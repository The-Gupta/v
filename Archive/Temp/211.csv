The United Kingdom Cancer Cytogenetics Group (UKCCG) [corrected].,139-45,"The detection of clones by conventional cytogenetic studies in diagnostic hematoncology is heavily subject to the effects of many biological and laboratory factors, one of which is the number of divisions analyzed. Data from 20 laboratories were combined to get an impression of the true frequency of clonal divisions for comparison with the theoretical models that have been previously used to set laboratory policies. This study showed that low-percentage clones were more common in the myelodysplastic syndromes and that high-percentage clones were more common in acute myeloid leukemia than in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), although the clone detection rate in ALLs is higher. The inference is that the putative diagnosis should be taken into account when deciding how many divisions to analyze before concluding that no detectable clone is present.","['Swansbury, G J']",['Swansbury GJ'],"['Academic Department of Haematology and Cytogenetics, Royal Marsden NHS Trust, Sutton, Surrey, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,IM,['Cancer Genet Cytogenet 1998 Nov;107(1):87'],"['Cell Division', '*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Clone Cells', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Humans', 'Models, Genetic']",1998/07/17 00:00,1998/07/17 00:01,['1998/07/17 00:00'],"['1998/07/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/17 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0165460897004779 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-4608(97)00477-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1998 Jul 15;104(2):139-45. doi: 10.1016/s0165-4608(97)00477-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three patients (one with rheumatoid arthritis and two with systemic lupus erythematosus) treated with azathioprine for 3 to 7 years developed acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The total cumulative doses of azathioprine varied from 89-260 g. An antecedent prolonged pancytopenic phase suggestive of myelodysplasia developed in all the cases. Morphological analysis showed AML with trilineage myelodysplastic features in residual marrow cells in all the cases. Karyotypic analysis showed deletion of the long arm of chromosome 7 (7q-) in one case and monosomy 7 (-7) in two cases. These were chromosomal aberrations typically associated with mutagen- or therapy-related AML. Fluorescence in situ hybridization with a chromosome-7-specific DNA probe was used to investigate the distribution of the monosomy 7 clone in two cases. Monosomy 7 was demonstrated in both the leukemic blasts and the residual myeloid cells of various stages of differentiation. This finding indicated that the leukemia had evolved from a mutated clone that was capable of terminal differentiation, which was consistent with the biological characteristics of the myelodysplastic syndromes. These cases represented therapy-related AML, as evidenced by clincopathological features, karyotypic aberrations of 7q-/-7, and demonstration of leukemic evolution from an underlying clonal myeloid disorder. The data support the hypothesis that azathioprine might be directly mutagenic.","['Kwong, Y L', 'Au, W Y', 'Liang, R H']","['Kwong YL', 'Au WY', 'Liang RH']","[""University Department of Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/complications/*drug therapy', 'Azathioprine/*adverse effects', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*adverse effects', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/chemically induced/complications/*genetics', 'Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic/complications/*drug therapy', 'Mutagens']",1998/07/17 00:00,1998/07/17 00:01,['1998/07/17 00:00'],"['1998/07/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/17 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0165-4608(97)00456-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-4608(97)00456-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1998 Jul 15;104(2):94-7. doi: 10.1016/s0165-4608(97)00456-1.,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Mutagens)', 'MRK240IY2L (Azathioprine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most patients in complete remission induced by RA experience relapse and resist further treatment with RA. This resistance primarily is due to a systemic self-induced catabolism of RA, which interferes with the maintenance of effective plasma levels of RA. In this report we explored the possibility that treatment with combinations of RA and other differentiation agents may induce differentiation at lower RA concentrations, which in turn may produce diminished levels of resistance. We found that although n-butyric acid (BA), tributyrin (TB) (a prodrug of BA), or hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA) were inactive as sole agents they potentiated RA-induced differentiation of human acute promyelocytic NB4 cells. A measure of the effectiveness of these combinations was that the concentrations of RA in combination with BA and HMBA inducing half-maximal differentiation were 20- to 40-fold lower than those needed with RA alone. Furthermore, the concentrations of BA and HMBA in these combinations were at achievable plasma levels. Therefore, these combinations may have clinical utility for treatment of a variety of malignancies that are sensitive to RA alone.","['Taimi, M', 'Chen, Z X', 'Breitman, T R']","['Taimi M', 'Chen ZX', 'Breitman TR']","['Laboratory of Biological Chemistry, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-4255, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Oncol Res,Oncology research,9208097,IM,,"['Acetamides/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Butyrates/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Butyric Acid', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Triglycerides/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1998/07/17 00:00,1998/07/17 00:01,['1998/07/17 00:00'],"['1998/07/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/17 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncol Res. 1998;10(2):75-84.,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Triglycerides)', '107-92-6 (Butyric Acid)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)', 'S05LZ624MF (tributyrin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The NKC is regulated by the negative signal of the NK receptor, which recognizes major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigens. However, it is not known whether or not the negative signal influences the ADCC. In this study, the relationship of the ADCC and negative signal was investigated. As target cells, adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) cell lines were used. When the target cells were treated with an anti-human T-lymphotropic virus type-1 (anti-HTLV-1) antibody, they were killed by the NK cells by means of the ADCC (ADCC/anti-HTLV-1). The killing levels were parallel with the cell surface HTLV-1 antigenicity. However, when these cells lines were treated with an anti-HLA, the ADCC (ADCC/anti-HLA) showed inverse correlation with the HLA antigenicity. Furthermore, when HLA polymorphic and monomorphic determinants of these target cells were blocked by F(ab')2 fragments of the anti-HLA and W6/32, the ADCC/anti-HLA was enhanced, but the ADCC/anti-HTLV-1 was not enhanced. These results suggest that the ADCC/anti-HLA may have an intimate relationship with the MHC class I antigens. The ADCC/anti-HLA may be suppressed by the negative signal. On the other hand, the ADCC/anti-HTLV-1 may have no relationship with the class I antigens and the negative signal may have no influence against the ADCC/anti-HTLV-1. The biological mechanism of this difference remains to be investigated.","['Komatsu, F', 'Tamiya, H']","['Komatsu F', 'Tamiya H']","['Blood Transfusion Service, School of Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Oncol Res,Oncology research,9208097,IM,,"['Adult', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity/*immunology', 'Epitopes/immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HLA Antigens/drug effects/immunology', 'HTLV-I Antibodies/*immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*immunology', 'Receptors, IgG/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/immunology']",1998/07/17 00:00,1998/07/17 00:01,['1998/07/17 00:00'],"['1998/07/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/17 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncol Res. 1998;10(2):59-67.,"['0 (Epitopes)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (HTLV-I Antibodies)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mu(3) receptor is present on several macrophage cell types including microglia, on cultured astrocytes, and in brain and retina. Murine macrophage cell lines and human HL-60 leukemia cells contain high concentrations of these receptors. Binding of 3H-morphine to the receptor is displaced by morphine, etorphine, naloxone, diprenorphine and morphine 6-glucuronide, but not by morphine 3-glucuronide, fentanyl, benzomorphans, enkephalins, dynorphin, beta-endorphin, endomorphin-1, other opioid peptides or nociceptin (orphanin FQ). The mu(3) receptor appears to be much more sensitive to inactivation by reduced glutathione than are classical mu, delta and kappa receptors. Evidence is also presented for G protein-coupling of these receptors. These and other data raise the possibility that the mu(3) receptor is a member of a chemokine or of another related receptor family, rather than the opioid receptor family. The affinity for morphine of mu(3) receptors of granulocytic-differentiated HL-60 cells is markedly enhanced in the presence of levorphanol and certain benzomorphans.

Its effects in the brain are less well characterized. In a previous study, we found LIF transcripts to be predominantly expressed in neurons of the adult rat brain. Highest levels were observed in the hippocampus, particularly in granular neurons of the dentate gyrus and in hilar interneurons. Here we report the effects of LIF on survival and differentiation of postnatal rat hippocampal cells in vitro. We find that LIF minimally influences the survival and differentiation of dentate gyrus neurons, causing a slight reduction of the number of dendrites per neuron. In contrast, LIF induces a pronounced increase in the number of astrocytes. This increase does not appear to be due to enhanced proliferation but rather to increased cell survival. On the other hand, epidermal growth factor (EGF) induces astrocyte proliferation, and addition of LIF inhibits the EGF effect. In summary, LIF does not appear to be crucial for the survival or differentiation of cultured dentate gyrus neurons. This cytokine increases astrocyte survival but does not enhance astrocyte proliferation, and LIF is able to counteract the growth stimulation elicited by EGF.","['Gadient, R A', 'Lein, P', 'Higgins, D', 'Patterson, P H']","['Gadient RA', 'Lein P', 'Higgins D', 'Patterson PH']","['Biology Division, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 91125, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Brain Res,Brain research,0045503,IM,,"['Animals', 'Astrocytes/cytology/*drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Hippocampus/cytology/*drug effects', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Neurons/cytology/*drug effects/physiology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley']",1998/07/17 00:00,1998/07/17 00:01,['1998/07/17 00:00'],"['1998/07/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/17 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-8993(98)00236-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-8993(98)00236-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Brain Res. 1998 Jul 6;798(1-2):140-6. doi: 10.1016/s0006-8993(98)00236-4.,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)']",,,,['Copyright 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

We demonstrate that in the murine leucemic cell line, P388, trimerization of HSF1, transcriptional activation of the hsp70 gene, and expression of Hsp70 are achieved as a result of heat shock. In contrast, the small heat shock proteins Hsp25 and alpha B-crystallin are not expressed in these cells and cannot be induced upon heat shock. Furthermore, no hsp25 transcript can be detected, indicating that there is a defect in the hsp25 gene or a block in its expression. Comparison of the hsp25 gene structure between P388 and Hsp25-expressing Ehrlich ascites tumor (EAT) cells by Southern blot analysis revealed no differences in the structural organization of the gene and no changes in its localization in the genome. However, sequence analysis of the hsp25 promoter region in P388 cells demonstrates minor differences. Despite these differences, the hsp25 promoter from P388 cells mediates heat shock-induced activation of a reporter gene when transfected into human HeLa cells which is comparable to that of the hsp25 promoter from EAT cells. Furthermore, the hsp25 gene isolated from EAT or P388 cells can both be expressed in HeLa cells and lead to a similar heat shock-stimulated accumulation of Hsp25. Silencing of the hsp25 and alpha B-crystallin genes in P388 cells by DNA-methylation could also be excluded since 5-azacytidine treatment does not influence expression of these genes. Interestingly, when expressed in P388 cells the hsp25 promoter from EAT cells is not activated upon heat shock, whereas the human hsp70 promoter is activated. Taken together, the data suggest cell line-specific differences in a mechanism of regulation of hsp25 transcription, which interferes with the activation of the promoter by HSF1 and which may also affect the alpha B-crystallin gene.","['Neininger, A', 'Gaestel, M']","['Neininger A', 'Gaestel M']","['Max-Delbruck-Center for Molecular Medicine, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,IM,,"['Animals', 'Azacitidine/pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Carcinoma, Ehrlich Tumor', 'Crystallins/genetics', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/*physiology', 'HSP27 Heat-Shock Proteins', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/genetics', 'HeLa Cells', 'Heat Shock Transcription Factors', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/*genetics', 'Heat-Shock Response/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Point Mutation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Conformation', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transcriptional Activation/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/07/17 00:00,1998/07/17 00:01,['1998/07/17 00:00'],"['1998/07/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/17 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(98)94099-X [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1998.4099 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1998 Jul 10;242(1):285-93. doi: 10.1006/excr.1998.4099.,"['0 (Crystallins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (HSF1 protein, human)', '0 (HSP27 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (HSPB1 protein, human)', '0 (Heat Shock Transcription Factors)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

WEHI-3B D- cells, derived from WEHI-3B D+ cells, are near tetraploid and not responsive to the differentiation-inducing properties of the retinoid. To gain information on mechanisms that regulate the maturation of these two cell lines, several multiploid cell lines have been established through fusion of WEHI-3B D+ and WEHI-3B D- cells. Studies with the multiploid cell lines have shown that (a) the cellular growth rate decreases with increased DNA ploidy; (b) near-tetraploid D+/+ cells, obtained by fusing WEHI-3B D+ with WEHI-3B D+ cells, remain differentiation-competent, demonstrating that no direct relationship exists between differentiation competency and DNA ploidy; and (c) near-hexaploid D +/- and D -/+ cells, formed by fusion of WEHI-3B D+ with WEHI-3B D- cells, do not respond to differentiation inducers, suggesting the inhibition of the differentiation machinery of WEHI-3B D+ cells by components from maturation-incompetent WEHI-3B D- cells.

For certain cancer sites, the secular analyses of mortality were extended back to 1911 by use of published data. Mortality from cancer at older ages in Scotland has increased over the last 40 years. In each sex, this trend has been dominated by the effects of smoking: all-cancer rates and rates of lung cancer, now the most common fatal cancer in men and in women in Scotland, reached a peak in the cohort of men born at the turn of the century and the cohort of women born in the 1920s. For much of the period, the Scottish all-age rates of lung cancer were the highest reported in the world; they are now decreasing on a secular basis in men, but are still increasing in women. There have also been large increases at older ages in the incidence and mortality rates for cancer of the prostate in recent years. bladder cancer, nervous system cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, myeloma and leukaemia; for each there is likely to be a considerable artefactual element to the increase, with differing degrees of possibility that there may in addition be an element of real increase. Substantial decreases in mortality at all ages have occurred for stomach and colorectal cancers and substantial increases at all ages for pleural cancer and melanoma. Rates of mortality from breast cancer, the most common cancer in women in Scotland, have generally increased over the past 80 years; a temporary cessation in this upward trend occurred in the years during and after the Second World War, and recently rates have turned downward, probably at least in part because of better treatment. Mortality from ovarian cancer, the second most common reproductive-related female tumour in Scotland, has also increased at older ages. At younger ages, mortality from cancer in Scotland has decreased, especially in men, whereas incidence has not. This divergence, which has been a consequence of better treatment, has occurred especially for cancers of the testis and ovary, Hodgkin's disease and leukaemia. There have been increases at young adult ages, however, in both mortality from and incidence of oral and pharyngeal, oesophageal and laryngeal cancers in men, and melanoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in each sex. Cervical cancer rates at young ages also increased, but this trend has reversed for incidence in the most recent birth cohorts. Incidence rates have also increased for testicular cancer in young adults and leukaemia in children. With the possible exceptions of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and childhood leukaemia, the increasing rates are likely largely to reflect real rises in incidence, and they highlight the need for investigation of the causes of these cancers, and, when causes are known, for preventive action.","['Swerdlow, A J', 'dos Santos Silva, I', 'Reid, A', 'Qiao, Z', 'Brewster, D H', 'Arrundale, J']","['Swerdlow AJ', 'dos Santos Silva I', 'Reid A', 'Qiao Z', 'Brewster DH', 'Arrundale J']","['Epidemiological Monitoring Unit, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mortality/trends', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Scotland/epidemiology']",1998/07/17 00:00,1998/07/17 00:01,['1998/07/17 00:00'],"['1998/07/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1998.424 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1998;77 Suppl 3:1-54. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1998.424.,,,,,,PMC2149878,,,,,,,,,

Recently, a few more clinical features associated with myeloma, such as salivary type hyperamylasemia and elevated serum C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration, have been reported. The elevation of CRP is thought to be related to interleukin-6 (IL-6) production by myeloma cells, because of identification of IL-6 as an autocrine and/or paracrine growth factor for myeloma cells. More recently, there have been several reports of cases with myeloma associated with hyperammonemia. This hyperammonemia is not considered to be due to liver dysfunction, because in most of these cases tests revealed normal hepatic function, and some cases showed different patterns of serum amino acid distribution than that associated with hepatic failure. However, there have been no apparent observations of ammonia production by myeloma cells. In this study, we used six human myeloma cell lines including KMS-18, which was recently established from a myeloma case associated with hyperammonemia. These lines were treated with MRA (mycoplasma removal agent) to observe ammonia production in vitro. They produced and released significantly higher levels of ammonia into culture medium than non-myeloma hematological cell lines or the HepG2 human hepatic carcinoma cell line. Although attempts to analyze the relative expression levels of the enzymes related to ammonia biosynthesis using the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay failed to detect any differences between these myeloma lines and other cell lines, in vitro excess ammonia production by the myeloma cells was confirmed and the relevance to clinical manifestations is discussed.","['Otsuki, T', 'Yamada, O', 'Sakaguchi, H', 'Ichiki, T', 'Kouguchi, K', 'Wada, H', 'Hata, H', 'Yawata, Y', 'Ueki, A']","['Otsuki T', 'Yamada O', 'Sakaguchi H', 'Ichiki T', 'Kouguchi K', 'Wada H', 'Hata H', 'Yawata Y', 'Ueki A']","['Department of Hygiene, Kawasaki Medical School, Kurashiki, Okayama, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Ammonia/*metabolism', 'Culture Media', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/enzymology/metabolism', 'Multiple Myeloma/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/07/17 00:00,1998/07/17 00:01,['1998/07/17 00:00'],"['1998/07/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401077 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Jul;12(7):1149-58. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401077.,"['0 (Culture Media)', '7664-41-7 (Ammonia)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From January 1991 to November 1994, 92 patients from the Spanish Cooperative Group PETHEMA with MM in objective response after 12 courses of VCMP/VBAP chemotherapy were randomized to receive IFN maintenance vs no treatment until relapse. Prognostic factors at diagnosis were similar in both groups. IFN was administered at a starting dose of 3 mU/m2 three times per week. The IFN toxicity was moderate with granulocytopenia and fatigue being the most common adverse effects. Median duration of response from randomization until relapse was 13 months in the IFN group vs 7.7 months in the no treatment arm (P = 0.042). Median survival from randomization was 38.8 months for patients given IFN vs 32.7 months for those allocated to the no treatment arm (P = 0.12). Features at relapse were similar in patients who received IFN maintenance and in those assigned to no treatment. Finally, survival from relapse was identical in both groups. In summary, our results show a significant prolongation of response in patients maintained with IFN with no significant influence on survival.

Dissemination of malignant cells in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) may be mediated by similar mechanisms. Here, we report, that the t(15/17)+ acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cell line NB4 constitutively expresses and releases the proenzyme form of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9, 92 kDa type IV collagenase/gelatinase, gelatinase B), as well as tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1). Both proteins were identified by N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis after purification using gelatin Sepharose affinity chromatography. Whereas 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13 acetate (TPA) increased both MMP-9 and TIMP-1 mRNA levels, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) stimulated only MMP-9 gene expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (MoABs) to TNF-alpha (anti-TNF-alpha) decreased the constitutive and TPA-dependent expression of MMP-9 but did not influence TIMP-1 expression, either in unstimulated or in TPA-treated NB4 cells. FACS analyses showed that NB4 cells express both TNF receptor 1 (TNF-R1) and TNF-R2 to a similar extent. Blocking MoABs against TNF-R 1 (anti-TNF-R1) decreased the constitutive expression of MMP-9, whereas anti-TNF-R2 had almost no effect. Our results show, that in NB4 cells the expression of MMP-9 but not of TIMP-1 is maintained by autocrine stimulation with TNF-alpha. Thus, leukemic cells may be enabled to leave the bone marrow and infiltrate peripheral tissues by a dysfunction in the regulation of the MMP-9:TIMP-1 equilibrium, possibly triggered through autostimulation by TNF-alpha.","['Ismair, M G', 'Ries, C', 'Lottspeich, F', 'Zang, C', 'Kolb, H J', 'Petrides, P E']","['Ismair MG', 'Ries C', 'Lottspeich F', 'Zang C', 'Kolb HJ', 'Petrides PE']","['Molecular Oncology Laboratory, Department of Medicine III, University of Munich Medical School Grosshadern, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis/immunology/*physiology', 'Collagenases/*biosynthesis/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*enzymology/genetics', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/biosynthesis/immunology/*physiology', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type II', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-1/biosynthesis/isolation & purification', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis/*pharmacology']",1998/07/17 00:00,1998/07/17 00:01,['1998/07/17 00:00'],"['1998/07/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401042 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Jul;12(7):1136-43. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401042.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type II)', '0 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-1)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Collagenases)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Abnormalities of 12p comprised deleted (del)(12p) alone (seven cases), add(12p) alone (seven cases), del(12p) and add(12p) (one case) and balanced translocations of 12p to 1p13, 1q31, 10q11, 14q11 and 15q15 (one case of each). A novel, exon-specific RT-PCR assay identified breakpoints in ETV6 in nine of 19 cases, and showed breakpoints in intron 5 (seven cases of children with c-ALL), in intron 4 (in one adult with Bip-L) and in intron 2 (in one adult with AML). RT-PCR for the ETV6/AMLI fusion (tested in 19 cases) was positive using standard primers in five cases (four of which had shown rearrangements in intron 5) and occurred as a variant fusion in a sixth case (also positive for a rearrangement in intron 5) using 3' RACE PCR. Southern blotting confirmed rearrangements in intron 5 in the five cases available for analysis and revealed a rearrangement in intron 5 in one of 10 cases with no evidence of intron 5 involvement by RT-PCR. Rearrangements in intron 5 of ETV6 were found in eight of nine cases of children with c-ALL of which six carried the ETV6/AMLI fusion. Heterozygosity within intron 5 (revealed by the genomic probe B1) was found in seven of 11 cases tested. Deletion of one allele was indicated in three cases with del(12p) and one case with add(12p). This study, using a combination of ETV6 exon-specific RT-PCR, RT-PCR for ETV6/AMLI and Southern blotting has shown that rearrangement and/or deletion of ETV6 may occur in up to 70% of patients with abn 12p.

To compare the cellular functions of two of the class III RTK, FLT3 and KIT, a murine chimeric FMS/FLT3 (FF3) receptor was expressed ectopically using retroviral infection, in normal IL3-derived cultured mast cells. Stimulation of the chimeric receptor produced a full mitogenic signal and led to mast cell maturation, as occurs upon activation of the endogenous KIT receptor. When introduced into mast cells derived from KIT-deficient White spotting (W) mutant mice, the FF3 receptor bypassed their mitogenic defect. KIT activation induced a synergistic mitogenic activity in mast cells upon IL3 stimulation, whereas FF3 appeared to down-modulate the IL3 response. Adhesion to fibronectin was specifically associated with KIT signaling.","['Casteran, N', 'Beslu, N', 'Lecocq, E', 'Gomez, S', 'Dubreuil, P']","['Casteran N', 'Beslu N', 'Lecocq E', 'Gomez S', 'Dubreuil P']","['Molecular and Functional Hematology Laboratory U119 INSERM, Marseille, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['*Amidohydrolases', 'Aminopeptidases/biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/ultrastructure', 'Cell Adhesion/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Fibronectins/metabolism', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Liver/cytology', 'Male', 'Mast Cells/physiology/*ultrastructure', 'Mice', 'Pregnancy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-3/physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",1998/07/17 00:00,1998/07/17 00:01,['1998/07/17 00:00'],"['1998/07/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401057 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Jul;12(7):1089-98. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401057.,"['0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-3)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Flt3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.4.11.- (Aminopeptidases)', 'EC 3.5.- (Amidohydrolases)', 'EC 3.5.1.88 (peptide deformylase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Southern blotting (SB) with multiple DNA probes for the IGH, IGK, TCRB, TCRG, TCRD and TAL1 loci revealed rearrangement patterns largely comparable to pediatric ALL, but several differences were found for precursor-B-ALL patients. Firstly, adult patients showed a lower level of oligoclonality in the IGH gene locus (five out of 26 patients; 19%) despite a comparable incidence of IGH gene rearrangements (24 out of 26 patients; 92%). Secondly, all detected IGK gene deletions (n = 12) concerned rearrangements of the kappa deleting element (Kde) to Vkappa gene segments, which represent two-thirds of the Kde rearrangements in pediatric precursor-B-ALL and only half of the Kde rearrangements in mature B cell leukemias. Thirdly, a striking predominance of immature Ddelta2-Ddelta3 cross-lineage recombinations was observed (seven out of 16 TCRD rearrangements; 44%), whereas more mature Vdelta2-Ddelta3 gene rearrangements occurred less frequently (six out of 16 TCRD rearrangements; 38% vs >70% in pediatric precursor-B-ALL). Together these data suggest that the Ig/TCR genotype of precursor-B-ALL is more immature and more stable in adults than in children. We also evaluated whether heteroduplex analysis of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products of rearranged Ig and TCR genes can be used for identification of molecular targets for minimal residual disease (MRD) detection. Using five of the major gene targets (IGH, IGK, TCRG, TCRD and TAL1 deletion), we compared the SB data and heteroduplex PCR results. High concordance between the two methods ranging from 96 to 100% was found for IGK, TCRG and TAL1 genes. The concordance was lower for IGH (70%) and TCRD genes (90%), which may be explained by incomplete or 'atypical' rearrangements or by translocations detectable only by SB. Finally, the heteroduplex PCR data indicate, that MRD monitoring is possible in almost 90% of adult precursor-B-ALL and >95% of adult T-ALL patients.","['Szczepanski, T', 'Langerak, A W', 'Wolvers-Tettero, I L', 'Ossenkoppele, G J', 'Verhoef, G', 'Stul, M', 'Petersen, E J', 'de Bruijn, M A', ""van't Veer, M B"", 'van Dongen, J J']","['Szczepanski T', 'Langerak AW', 'Wolvers-Tettero IL', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'Verhoef G', 'Stul M', 'Petersen EJ', 'de Bruijn MA', ""van't Veer MB"", 'van Dongen JJ']","['Department of Immunology, University Hospital Rotterdam/Erasmus University Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aging/*genetics', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'DNA Probes', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement', '*Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', '*Transcription Factors']",1998/07/17 00:00,1998/07/17 00:01,['1998/07/17 00:00'],"['1998/07/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401071 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Jul;12(7):1081-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401071.,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

FISH detected 9-16% nuclei with a BCR-ABL fusion gene, contrasting with RT-PCR, performed in two cases, which was negative in one case and weakly positive in the other.

KOR-SA3544 expression over 3% was detected in the majority of TEL/AML1-negative patients with newly diagnosed common or preB ALL (19 of 31) and not in TEL/AML1-positive patients (0 of 18, P < 0.0001). The level of expression of KOR-SA3544 was 0.02-90% (median 6.0%) and 0.03-2.4% (median 0.23%) in TEL/AML1-negative and TEL/AML1-positive patients, respectively. All five newly diagnosed patients with DNA index > or =1.16 and <1.6 exhibited high levels of KOR-SA3544 expression. Membrane expression of CD79a was found to correlate with TEL/AML1 negativity, although less significantly than KOR-SA3544 (P = 0.03). Furthermore, our data confirm that TEL/AML1 positivity correlates with non-hyperdiploidy and low presenting age. In conclusion, KOR-SA3544 correlated strongly with TEL/AML1 negativity, it was a better predictor of TEL/AML1 status than other factors tested and was found at high levels in hyperdiploidy. In combination with age, KOR-SA3544 predicted TEL/AML1 status in 86% newly diagnosed preB/cALL patients.","['Hrusak, O', 'Trka, J', 'Zuna, J', 'Houskova, J', 'Bartunkova, J', 'Stary, J']","['Hrusak O', 'Trka J', 'Zuna J', 'Houskova J', 'Bartunkova J', 'Stary J']","['Institute of Immunology, Prague, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Age Factors', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis', 'Artificial Gene Fusion', 'Child', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Ploidies', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', '*Repressor Proteins', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/*genetics']",1998/07/17 00:00,1998/07/17 00:01,['1998/07/17 00:00'],"['1998/07/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401072 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Jul;12(7):1064-70. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401072.,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tdt was expressed in 80 (25%) of 321 evaluable cases. Twenty-six of 77 (34%) Tdt+ patients assessable for response, entered complete remission (CR) vs 121 of 209 (58%) Tdt- cases (P < 0.001). CD7 was expressed in 102 of 332 (30%) evaluable cases; 37 of 93 assessable (40%) CD7+ patients attained a CR as compared to 114/204 (56%) CD7- (P = 0.013). Duration of survival was significantly shorter for patients with CD7+ or Tdt+ AML (P = 0.006 and 0.001, respectively). In a multivariate analysis, Tdt was found to significantly adverse achievement of CR (P = 0.018), while CD7 affected duration of CR (P = 0.037). Overall the expression of either Tdt or CD7 correlated with a relatively high expression of CD34 (P < 0.001), GP-170 (P = 0.003), lymphoid antigens (LyAg) (P < 0.001), t(9;22) or anomalies of chromosome 5/7 (P < 0.001). Finally, we pooled the patients into four phenotypic classes, according to the presence of Tdt, CD7 or both: [Tdt-CD7-], [Tdt+CD7-], [Tdt-CD7+] and [Tdt+CD7+]. The category [Tdt+CD7+] was characterized by a more unfavorable outcome as suggested by a lower rate of CR (P < 0.001) and a shorter duration of survival as compared to cases [Tdt-CD7-], [Tdt+CD7-] and [Tdt-CD7+] (P = 0.002). This figure is consistent with the frequent convergence in the subset [Tdt+CD7+] of GP-170 positivity (P = 0.003), translocation t(9;22), anomalies of chromosome 5 and/or 7 (P < 0.001) and signs of lineage infidelity (deviant expression of lymphoid antigens) (P < 0.001). We conclude that the expression of Tdt or CD7 is associated with an unfavorable outcome and that the combination of both defines a clinical subset with a poorer prognosis due to the significantly higher association with MDR phenotype, and 'poor prognostic' chromosomal abnormalities.","['Venditti, A', 'Del Poeta, G', 'Buccisano, F', 'Tamburini, A', 'Cox-Froncillo, M C', 'Aronica, G', 'Bruno, A', 'Del Moro, B', 'Epiceno, A M', 'Battaglia, A', 'Forte, L', 'Postorino, M', 'Cordero, V', 'Santinelli, S', 'Amadori, S']","['Venditti A', 'Del Poeta G', 'Buccisano F', 'Tamburini A', 'Cox-Froncillo MC', 'Aronica G', 'Bruno A', 'Del Moro B', 'Epiceno AM', 'Battaglia A', 'Forte L', 'Postorino M', 'Cordero V', 'Santinelli S', 'Amadori S']","['Cattedra di Ematologia, Universita Tor Vergata, Divisione di Ematologia, Ospedale S Eugenio, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD7/*biosynthesis', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/*biosynthesis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/enzymology/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis']",1998/07/17 00:00,1998/07/17 00:01,['1998/07/17 00:00'],"['1998/07/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401067 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Jul;12(7):1056-63. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401067.,"['0 (Antigens, CD7)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While pharmacokinetic investigations suggest that the AraC-activating enzyme deoxycytidine kinase is saturated at drug concentrations achieved by short-term infusion of 0.5 to 1.0 g/m2 AraC and that higher doses are therefore not more effective, recent evidence indicates that additional mechanisms of AraC cytotoxicity may exist which could be enhanced by further dose escalation. In order to test this thesis in the clinical setting, a prospective randomized comparison of high-dose (HD-AraC) vs intermediate-dose (ID-AraC) AraC was carried out in patients with refractory or relapsed AML on the basis of the sequential high-dose AraC and mitoxantrone regimen (S-HAM). AraC was given as a 3-h infusion q 12 h on days 1, 2, 8 and 9. Patients younger than 60 years were randomized to AraC doses of 3.0 g/m2 vs 1.0 g/m2 while older patients received either 1.0 g/m2 or 0.5 g/m2 per single dose. Mitoxantrone was given to all patients on days 3, 4, 10 and 11 at a daily dose of 10 mg/m2. Randomization was stratified for primary refractoriness against induction therapy and length of first remission in relapsed patients. From 186 evaluable patients, 88 (47%) and 10 cases (5%) achieved a complete (CR) or partial (PR) remission, 39 patients (21%) had persisting leukemia (non-response (NR)), and 49 cases (26%) died within 6 weeks after the start of therapy (early death (ED)). In patients younger than 60 years the higher dose level resulted in a significant reduction of NR (12% vs 31%; ordinal chi2 test: P = 0.01) but also a higher rate of ED (32% vs 17%) thus leading to a marginally higher CR rate only (52% vs 45%). Within the subgroup of patients with refractory AML the tendency towards a higher CR rate after HD-AraC was more pronounced (46% vs 26%; P = 0.045). In patients older than 60 years, corresponding though less evident differences were observed with a higher rate of NR in the lower dose group (26% vs 16%) and ED occurring more frequently after higher doses (36% vs 26%). These data indicate that HD-AraC reveals a significantly higher antileukemic efficacy than ID-AraC as expressed by a significant reduction of failure from NR. This advantage, however, does not fully translate into an increase in remission rate due to a higher incidence of ED after HD-AraC predominantly from uncontrolled infections. In order to take full advantage of the higher antileukemic activity of HD-AraC an improvement of supportive care and infection control is warranted.","['Kern, W', 'Aul, C', 'Maschmeyer, G', 'Schonrock-Nabulsi, R', 'Ludwig, W D', 'Bartholomaus, A', 'Bettelheim, P', 'Wormann, B', 'Buchner, T', 'Hiddemann, W']","['Kern W', 'Aul C', 'Maschmeyer G', 'Schonrock-Nabulsi R', 'Ludwig WD', 'Bartholomaus A', 'Bettelheim P', 'Wormann B', 'Buchner T', 'Hiddemann W']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Gottingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",1998/07/17 00:00,1998/07/17 00:01,['1998/07/17 00:00'],"['1998/07/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401066 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Jul;12(7):1049-55. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401066.,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'NOAC protocol']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patients in remission after two courses were randomized to receive either two (short arm) or six (long arm) additional intensive cycles of chemotherapy.

Seventy-three patients were randomized to the short arm and 66 to the long arm. There was no significant difference in the relapse-free survival (median 21 months vs 17 months) or overall survival (43 months vs 39 months) between the short and long arms, respectively.

Because we had recently identified multiple bcl-2/Ig gene rearrangements in blood mononuclear cells of patients with PPBL, we sought evidence of this oncogene in this particular patient: bcl-2/Ig gene rearrangements were found in blood mononuclear cells but not in lymphoma cells. Owing to the possible role of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in the pathogenesis of PPBL, we also hypothesized our patient might have an EBV-related lymphoproliferative disorder. Despite serologies consistent with past exposure to this virus, it was not found in lymphoma cells using a sensitive polymerase chain reaction technique.

A number of cellular alterations including the cellular membrane, such as mutations of the glucocorticoid receptor or expression of membrane transport proteins, detoxification mechanisms and altered expression of topoisomerases, have been described. In addition to anti-apoptotic survival mechanisms, involving abnormalities of several oncogenes and suppressor genes (ras, c-myc, p53, Rh and bcl-2), the broad resistance spectrum might be explained but clinical studies which include the evaluation of resistance factors are missing. On the other hand, risk factor evaluation is important as a number of therapeutical strategies with different intensities from corticosteroid monotherapy up to high-dose chemotherapy with tandem autologous bone marrow transplantation exist.","['Gieseler, F', 'Nussler, V']","['Gieseler F', 'Nussler V']",,['eng'],"['Editorial', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism']",1998/07/17 00:00,1998/07/17 00:01,['1998/07/17 00:00'],"['1998/07/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401060 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Jul;12(7):1009-12. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401060.,,,39,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three of the VCR-resistant cell lines are characterized by the overexpression of mdr-1, while two cell lines overexpress mrp. We found that all three antagonists additively to synergistically enhanced the cidal activity of VCR for the five wild-type and VCR-resistant cell lines in a dose dependent manner when used singly. Combinations consisting of a 20% inhibitory concentration (IC20) of VCR plus two antagonists also showed additive to synergistic effects on both wild and VCR-resistant cell lines. It is of interest that the combined effect of IC20 VCR plus MDR antagonists on the three VCR-resistant cell lines expressing mdr-1 was significantly superior to those of the two cell lines expressing the mrp gene. These results suggest that the combined effect of MDR antagonists work better than their single use and that the MDR antagonists work more efficiently in cells showing drug resistance through mdr-1 than in those utilizing mrp.","['Hosoi, E', 'Hirose, M', 'Hamano, S', 'Morimoto, M', 'Kuroda, Y']","['Hosoi E', 'Hirose M', 'Hamano S', 'Morimoto M', 'Kuroda Y']","['School of Medical Science, The University of Tokushima, Tokushima City, Tokushima 770, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Cyclosporine/*pharmacology', 'Dipyridamole/*pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Verapamil/*pharmacology', 'Vincristine/*pharmacology']",1998/07/17 00:00,1998/07/17 00:01,['1998/07/17 00:00'],"['1998/07/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3892/ijo.13.2.343 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 1998 Aug;13(2):343-8. doi: 10.3892/ijo.13.2.343.,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '64ALC7F90C (Dipyridamole)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we have examined whether the chimeric ETV6-AML1 protein could serve as a tumor specific antigen for CTL in HLA-A2.1 individuals. We have identified a nonapeptide (RIAECILGM), encoded by the fusion region of the ETV6-AML1 protein, that binds to HLA-A2.1 molecules and induces specific primary CTL in peripheral blood lymphocytes from healthy donors. These CTL specifically lysed HLA-A2.1 tumor cells endogeneously expressing the ETV6-AML fusion protein.

Using UT-7/GMT cells, we examined how TPO promotes hemoglobinization. TPO induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the TPO receptor but not the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor. There was no competition between TPO and EPO for binding to EPO receptor. These findings suggest that TPO has a direct effect on hemoglobinization via a specific receptor on UT-7/GMT cells.

Age is an important risk factor for overall survival of patients; staging strategies and treatment expose elderly patients to an even higher risk arising from surgical complications, death from secondary cancer and leukemia or lethal cardiac complications. In contrast to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, optimal staging and treatment procedures have not yet been defined for this disease in elderly patients. However, due to the very poor prognosis of inadequately treated patients, treatment recommendations at present must be based on those for younger patients while keeping the individual risk profile in mind. If staging laparotomy is omitted, most patients will require a combined modality treatment. While in low-risk patients a reduced number of cycles with full-dose chemotherapy like ABVD (Adriblastina, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine) or of six cycles with less toxic drugs like VBM (vinblastine, bleomycin, methotrexate) followed by limited field radiotherapy may suffice, patients with well-defined risk factors will require a more prolonged chemotherapy. Currently, there is no evidence that C(M)OPP [cyclophosphamide (mustargen), vincristine, procarbazine, prednisone]/ABVD or ABVD may successfully be replaced by less toxic regimens. Therefore, further studies are required on the specific definition of biological age, the cost/benefit ratio of staging procedures and treatment and the influence of these strategies on the quality of life in the elderly.","['Greil, R']",['Greil R'],"['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Oncology,Oncology,0135054,IM,,"['Adult', '*Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Hodgkin Disease/epidemiology/pathology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",1998/07/15 02:02,2000/10/06 11:01,['1998/07/15 02:02'],"['1998/07/15 02:02 [pubmed]', '2000/10/06 11:01 [medline]', '1998/07/15 02:02 [entrez]']","['ocl55265 [pii]', '10.1159/000011862 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncology. 1998 Jul-Aug;55(4):265-75. doi: 10.1159/000011862.,,,71,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several PLD genes have now been identified and it is probable that different isoforms regulate distinct functions. Defining the subcellular localisation of each isoform would facilitate understanding of their roles. Previous PLD localisation studies have been based largely on enzyme activity measurements, which cannot distinguish between isoforms [2,5]. We have cloned the cDNAs encoding human PLD1a and PLD1b from an HL60 cell cDNA library and expressed them as catalytically active fusion proteins with green fluorescent protein (GFP) in COS-1 cells and RBL-2H3 cells, a mast cell model which degranulates upon cross-linking of the high-affinity immunoglobulin E (IgE) receptor. In unstimulated cells, GFP-PLD1b colocalised with secretory granule and lysosomal markers; it was not found at the plasma membrane or nucleus and did not colocalise with markers for the Golgi. Stimulation or RBL-2H3 cells through IgE receptor cross-linking caused plasma membrane recruitment of GFP-PLD1b. Inhibition of IgE-receptor-stimulated, PLD-catalysed phosphatidate formation suppressed secretion of granule and lysosomal contents, but did not affect translocation of GFP-PLD1b. These experiments suggest that PLD1 plays a role in regulated exocytosis rather than endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to Golgi membrane transport.","['Brown, F D', 'Thompson, N', 'Saqib, K M', 'Clark, J M', 'Powner, D', 'Thompson, N T', 'Solari, R', 'Wakelam, M J']","['Brown FD', 'Thompson N', 'Saqib KM', 'Clark JM', 'Powner D', 'Thompson NT', 'Solari R', 'Wakelam MJ']","['Institute for Cancer Studies, Birmingham University Medical School, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Curr Biol,Current biology : CB,9107782,IM,,"['Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Membrane/enzymology', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/*enzymology', 'Golgi Apparatus/enzymology', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Luminescent Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Lysosomes/*enzymology', 'Mast Cells/immunology/physiology', 'Phospholipase D/genetics/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/07/15 00:00,1998/07/15 00:01,['1998/07/15 00:00'],"['1998/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0960-9822(98)70326-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s0960-9822(98)70326-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Biol. 1998 Jul 2;8(14):835-8. doi: 10.1016/s0960-9822(98)70326-4.,"['0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.4.4 (Phospholipase D)', 'EC 3.1.4.4 (phospholipase D1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For this reason we have reviewed our experience. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All children with DS diagnosed a having acute leukemia during a 21-year period were reviewed retrospectively. Treatment was administered according to current protocols in our unit at the time of diagnosis without any initial modification. RESULTS: There were 13 children with DS and acute leukemia [6 ALL, 4 AML and 3 transient leukemias (TL)]. No patient presented CNS leukemia at diagnosis. All children with AML and DS were under three years of age and standard treatments did not achieve satisfactory results. TL regressed in two newborns without developing AMKL later. Five out of six patients with DS and ALL achieved complete remission. Currently, 4 of these children are alive and off therapy. Toxicities related to treatment were observed in almost all of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: Children with DS suffer a higher risk of developing leukemia. They should receive standard protocols, but aggressive supportive care might be provided as they have a higher incidence of treatment related toxicities. Prognosis of these children is similar or even better in some cases than children without DS. TL is a true neoplastic process capable of spontaneous remission and it can progress to AMKL.","['Bermudez Cortes, M', 'Verdeguer Miralles, A', 'Jovani Casano, C', 'Canete Nieto, A', 'Fernandez, J M', 'Ferris Tortajada, J', 'Castel Sanchez, V']","['Bermudez Cortes M', 'Verdeguer Miralles A', 'Jovani Casano C', 'Canete Nieto A', 'Fernandez JM', 'Ferris Tortajada J', 'Castel Sanchez V']","['Servicio de Oncologia Pediatrica, Hospital Infantil Universitario La Fe, Valencia.']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Spain,An Esp Pediatr,Anales espanoles de pediatria,0420463,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Down Syndrome/*complications', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*complications/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies']",1998/07/15 00:00,1998/07/15 00:01,['1998/07/15 00:00'],"['1998/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,An Esp Pediatr. 1998 Jun;48(6):593-8.,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],Sindrome de Down y leucemia.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Autoimmune phenomena occur frequently with IFN therapy, but arthritis is uncommon. We describe the clinical features and treatment of IFN-induced arthritis. METHODS: A patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia who developed arthritis secondary to IFN therapy is presented. The clinical features and treatment of this condition in 37 additional cases are reviewed. RESULTS: The most common clinical presentation was symmetric polyarthritis. This was associated with antinuclear antibodies in 72% of patients and rheumatoid factor in 34%. Cessation of IFN, with or without the addition of antiinflammatory or remittive agents, resulted in remission of arthritis in 89% and 71% of the cases, respectively. Restarting IFN therapy resulted in recurrence of arthritis in 63%. In the patient described in this report, recurrence of arthritis was prevented by coadministration of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and prednisone. CONCLUSION: Arthritis is an uncommon complication of IFN therapy; but it may lead to cessation of this treatment modality. In such cases, coadministration of a remittive agent such as HCQ may enable reinstitution of IFN therapy without recurrence of arthritis.","['Nesher, G', 'Ruchlemer, R']","['Nesher G', 'Ruchlemer R']","['Rheumatology Service, Shaare-Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Arthritis Rheum,Seminars in arthritis and rheumatism,1306053,IM,,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents/therapeutic use', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Antinuclear/blood', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Antirheumatic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Arthritis/blood/*chemically induced/drug therapy', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Humans', 'Hydroxychloroquine/therapeutic use', 'Indomethacin/therapeutic use', 'Interferon-alpha/*adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prednisone/therapeutic use', 'Rheumatoid Factor/blood', 'Secondary Prevention']",1998/07/15 00:00,1998/07/15 00:01,['1998/07/15 00:00'],"['1998/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0049-0172(98)80015-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0049-0172(98)80015-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Arthritis Rheum. 1998 Jun;27(6):360-5. doi: 10.1016/s0049-0172(98)80015-2.,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Antibodies, Antinuclear)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antirheumatic Agents)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '4QWG6N8QKH (Hydroxychloroquine)', '9009-79-4 (Rheumatoid Factor)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'XXE1CET956 (Indomethacin)']",,43,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ability to genetically engineer insects would facilitate strategies to protect crops and block arthropod vector-borne disease transmission.

A promising alternative is the pantropic retroviral vector, which is packaged with the envelope glycoprotein from vesicular stomatitis virus and is replication-defective. We show here that pantropic murine retroviral vectors can mediate high-level expression of foreign genes in somatically transformed insect larvae and adults of three dipteran genera.

To dissect the contribution of these alterations in the deregulation of the differentiation and proliferation of erythroblasts, we generated spi-1 transgenic mice. Analysis of these animals revealed that Spi-1 overexpression was directly involved in the block of proerythroblast differentiation. However, the erythroleukemia that develops in these animals evolved in two steps. During the early step (HS1 step), non tumorigenic proerythroblasts remained strictly dependent upon erythropoietin (Epo) for their survival and proliferation. Later on, Epo-independent and tumorigenic proerythroblasts emerged (HS2 step) suggesting that other oncogenes cooperate with Spi-1 to lead to a fully malignant phenotype. By provirus tagging, we demonstrate that the HS1 step was clonal indicating that a cell selection must occur in vivo. Analysis of the nature of p53 in both the in vivo HS1 and HS2 proerythroblasts and in cultured erythroblastic cell lines showed that--p53 was normal in the HS1 primary tissues but was mutated in the HS1 cultured cell lines--p53 was frequently altered in HS2 primary tissues but was found normal in some mice. These data indicate that (i) the blockage of the erythroblast differentiation by Spi-1 occurs independently of p53 alteration (ii) p53 alteration is not necessary to confer Epo independence and tumorigenicity to spi-1 transgenic proerythroblasts.","['Barnache, S', 'Wendling, F', 'Lacombe, C', 'Denis, N', 'Titeux, M', 'Vainchenker, W', 'Moreau-Gachelin, F']","['Barnache S', 'Wendling F', 'Lacombe C', 'Denis N', 'Titeux M', 'Vainchenker W', 'Moreau-Gachelin F']","['INSERM U248, Institut Curie, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,,"['Animals', 'Clone Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', '*Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics']",1998/07/14 00:00,1998/07/14 00:01,['1998/07/14 00:00'],"['1998/07/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/14 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1202095 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1998 Jun 11;16(23):2989-95. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1202095.,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CK2 activity is elevated in human solid tumors and leukemia, and dysregulated expression of CK2 induces lymphoma in transgenic mice. Mice that are deficient in p53 also develop lymphomas, and p53 activity may be regulated by CK2 phosphorylation. Here we demonstrate that CK2alpha transgenic mice partially or completely deficient in p53 develop thymic lymphomas at a markedly accelerated rate when compared to p53-deficient mice lacking the transgene. Lymphomas originating from CK2alpha transgenic mice that are heterozygous for p53 generally lose the wild type p53 allele, indicating that loss of p53 is an important step in tumor progression. Moreover, though lymphomas occur as early as 3 weeks of age in the transgenic mice that are nullizygous for p53, they are still monoclonal, indicating that additional stochastic mutations are required for their development. These lymphomas express high levels of myc mRNA and frequently ectopically express Lmo-2, a transcription factor involved in human T cell acute lymphocytic leukemia. The p53-null CK2alpha transgenic lymphomas grow rapidly but are highly prone to apoptosis, suggesting that transformation occurs through synergistic dysregulation of cell cycle control induced by misexpression of CK2 and loss of function of p53.","['Landesman-Bollag, E', 'Channavajhala, P L', 'Cardiff, R D', 'Seldin, D C']","['Landesman-Bollag E', 'Channavajhala PL', 'Cardiff RD', 'Seldin DC']","['Department of Medicine, Boston University Medical Center, Massachusetts 02118, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,,"['Animals', 'Casein Kinase II', 'Gene Dosage', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/enzymology/*etiology/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mutagenesis', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/*physiology', 'Thymus Gland/pathology', 'Thymus Neoplasms/enzymology/*etiology/genetics/pathology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*physiology']",1998/07/14 00:00,1998/07/14 00:01,['1998/07/14 00:00'],"['1998/07/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/14 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1201854 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1998 Jun 11;16(23):2965-74. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1201854.,"['0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Casein Kinase II)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",,,['CA71796/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

If seasonal variation in the onset of disease could be shown in any of the diagnostic subgroups of leukaemia or lymphoma, this would provide supportive evidence of an aetiology linked to exposure to infection. All cases in the Manchester Children's Tumour Registry (aged 0-14 years at diagnosis) with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia (ANLL), Hodgkin's disease (HD) or non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) between 1 January 1954 and 31 December 1996 were included in an analysis of seasonal variation in the month of first symptom and the month of diagnosis. Cases of common acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (c-ALL) diagnosed from 1979 onwards were also analysed separately.

Using this method, no indication of seasonal variation was found in the other diagnostic groups for date of first symptom or in any of the diagnostic groups for date of diagnosis. For comparison with a previous study, a further analysis based on date of diagnosis for all ALL cases, using summer-winter ratios, showed a significant summer excess.

We studied a population-based cohort of 94 survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in childhood who were in first remission after treatment without spinal irradiation or bone marrow transplantation. Pulmonary function test results were compared with reference values for our laboratory, based on 348 healthy subjects who had never smoked from a local population study. A median of 8 years after cessation of therapy (range 1-18 years) the participants had a slight, subclinical, restrictive ventilatory insufficiency and reduced transfer factor and transfer coefficient. The changes in lung function were related to younger age at treatment and to more dose-intensive treatment protocols that specified more use of cranial irradiation and higher cumulative doses of anthracyclines, cytosine arabinoside and intravenous cyclophosphamide than previous protocols. We conclude that, 8 years after treatment without bone marrow transplantation or spinal irradiation, survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in first remission were without pulmonary symptoms but had signs of slight restrictive pulmonary disease including reduced transfer factor. The increased dose intensity of many recent protocols for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia may lead to increased late pulmonary toxicity.","['Nysom, K', 'Holm, K', 'Olsen, J H', 'Hertz, H', 'Hesse, B']","['Nysom K', 'Holm K', 'Olsen JH', 'Hertz H', 'Hesse B']","['Section of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, GGK 4074, The Juliane Marie Centre, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Forced Expiratory Volume', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Lung/drug effects/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*drug therapy/*physiopathology', 'Respiratory Function Tests', 'Risk Factors', 'Survivors', 'Total Lung Capacity', 'Vital Capacity']",1998/07/14 00:00,1998/07/14 00:01,['1998/07/14 00:00'],"['1998/07/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/14 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1998.436 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1998 Jul;78(1):21-7. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1998.436.,,,,,,PMC2062952,,,,,,,,,

Our results reveal that the non-receptor tyrosine kinases, Abl, Fyn, Lyn, Btk and Csk, are expressed in all three cell types. The expression level of Btk, a tyrosine kinase implicated in Bruton's syndrome, is exceptionally high in the erythroblastoid cell line 6C2, transformed by the v-erbB carrying avian erythroblastosis virus, AEV-ES4. We have also uncovered a new STE-20-related serine/threonine kinase, KFC, which is abundantly expressed in both the TGFalpha-stimulated erythroid progenitor cells and v-sea-transformed erythroblasts. Based on sequence homology of the kinase domain, KFC appears to be the first member of a new subfamily of STE-20-like kinases.","['Robinson, D', 'Chen, H C', 'Li, D', 'Yustein, J T', 'He, F', 'Lin, W C', 'Hayman, M J', 'Kung, H J']","['Robinson D', 'Chen HC', 'Li D', 'Yustein JT', 'He F', 'Lin WC', 'Hayman MJ', 'Kung HJ']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Microbiology, Case Western Reserve University, School of Medicine, Cleveland, Ohio 44106, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Biomed Sci,Journal of biomedical science,9421567,IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Chickens', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Erythroblasts/*enzymology', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/drug effects/*enzymology', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, erbB', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/enzymology/etiology/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncogene Proteins, Viral/genetics', 'Oncogenes', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transformation, Genetic', 'Transforming Growth Factor alpha/pharmacology']",1998/07/14 02:03,2000/10/06 11:01,['1998/07/14 02:03'],"['1998/07/14 02:03 [pubmed]', '2000/10/06 11:01 [medline]', '1998/07/14 02:03 [entrez]']","['jbs05093 [pii]', '10.1007/BF02258362 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biomed Sci. 1998;5(2):93-100. doi: 10.1007/BF02258362.,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Viral)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor alpha)', '0 (env-sea oncogene protein, Avian Erythroblastosis Retrovirus)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",,,"['CA39207/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA46613/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA57179/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

A smaller suppression of NK cytotoxicity after cortisol was also observed in SDAT (mean decrease -24%) than in the control group (-44%). The NK cell activity of SDAT patients was inversely correlated with the cognitive status as evaluated by the analysis of MMSE (Mini Mental State Examination) score. A comparison of young and elderly healthy subjects revealed no variations in NK cell activity. A physiological decrease in cytosolic PKC activity was demonstrated in healthy old subjects after IL-2 and IFN-beta incubation, but not in SDAT patients, while no variations in kinase activity were observed after cortisol incubation. The decreased activity with cytokines was associated with reduced levels of PKC alpha and betaII isoforms. An alteration in cytokine-mediated NK cell activity associated with PKC dysregulation is therefore suggested to occur in patients with SDAT. These changes may indicate the existence of an immunological component to the pathogenesis and progression of the disease.","['Solerte, S B', 'Fioravanti, M', 'Pascale, A', 'Ferrari, E', 'Govoni, S', 'Battaini, F']","['Solerte SB', 'Fioravanti M', 'Pascale A', 'Ferrari E', 'Govoni S', 'Battaini F']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Geriatrics and Gerontology Clinic, University of Pavia, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Neurobiol Aging,Neurobiology of aging,8100437,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Alzheimer Disease/*enzymology/*immunology', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity/*physiology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/pharmacology', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interferon-beta/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*enzymology/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Male', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/07/14 00:00,1998/07/14 00:01,['1998/07/14 00:00'],"['1998/07/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/14 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/14 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0197458098000505 [pii]', '10.1016/s0197-4580(98)00050-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Neurobiol Aging. 1998 May-Jun;19(3):191-9. doi: 10.1016/s0197-4580(98)00050-5.,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '77238-31-4 (Interferon-beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The kinetics of cell death in IFN-gamma-treated HT29 cells paralleled the increase in the levels of Fas and FasL expression. We further show that IFN-gamma up-regulated the expression of Fas and FasL in STAT1-transfected U3A cells but not in STAT1-deficient U3A cells. Correspondingly, IFN-gamma induced cell death in STAT1-transfected U3A cells but not in STAT1-deficient U3A cells. IFN-gamma-induced cell death was inhibited by caspase-1 inhibitors.

Here we study two human leukemia cell lines (HL-60 and K562) that have different sensitivities to edelfosine; HL-60 cells are more sensitive than K562 cells. To determine whether edelfosine alters the sensitivity of these lines to an oxidative stress, cells were subjected to the oxidative stress of iron(II) plus ascorbate and then monitored for free radical formation, membrane integrity, and cytotoxicity. The HL-60 cell was sensitive to the ether lipid drug in clonogenic and dye exclusion assays; a lipid-derived free radical was generated by this sensitive cell in the presence of small amounts of Fe2+ and ascorbate as detected by electron paramagnetic resonance and the spin trap alpha-(4-pyridyl-1-oxide)-N-tert-butylnitrone. There was also simultaneous generation of an ascorbate-free radical, which has been shown to estimate cellular oxidative flux. In contrast, the K562 cell was resistant to edelfosine cytotoxicity in all assays and did not generate either lipid-derived or ascorbate-free radicals. Subcellular homogenates of the HL-60 cell generated both radicals when exposed to the drug, but homogenates of K562 did not generate either, suggesting that differential drug uptake or intracellular drug localization is not the cause of the difference in oxidation. Trypan blue uptake by the HL-60, but not the K562 cells, measured under the same conditions as the oxidation experiments, demonstrated a loss of membrane impermeability with similar time and concentration dependence, suggesting a causal relationship of membrane damage and radical generation. Complementary studies of HL-60 cell membrane integrity with propidium iodide impermeability and light scatter using the flow cytometer showed a concentration dependence that was similar to radical generation. Biochemical studies of the fatty acids of the HL-60 cell revealed more highly polyunsaturated lipids in the cells. Cellular antioxidant enzymes and vitamin E contents of the two cell lines were similar. We conclude that there is a time- and concentration-dependent generation of important oxidations by the sensitive HL-60 cells exposed to the membrane-targeted ether lipid, but the resistant K562 cells are oxidatively silent. This may be due in part to the differences in fatty acid polyunsaturation of the cellular membranes. The difference in oxidative susceptibility could be the basis for drug resistance to this membrane-specific anticancer agent.","['Wagner, B A', 'Buettner, G R', 'Oberley, L W', 'Burns, C P']","['Wagner BA', 'Buettner GR', 'Oberley LW', 'Burns CP']","['Department of Medicine, The University of Iowa College of Medicine, The University of Iowa Cancer Center, Iowa City 52242, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Ascorbic Acid/pharmacology', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects', 'Fatty Acids/chemistry', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Free Radicals/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Indicators and Reagents/metabolism', 'Iron/pharmacology', 'Lipid Peroxidation', 'Nitrogen Oxides/pharmacology', 'Phospholipid Ethers/*pharmacology', 'Propidium/metabolism', 'Pyridines', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Trypan Blue/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Vitamin E/analysis']",1998/07/14 00:00,1998/07/14 00:01,['1998/07/14 00:00'],"['1998/07/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/14 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/14 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1998 Jul 1;58(13):2809-16.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Fatty Acids)', '0 (Free Radicals)', '0 (Indicators and Reagents)', '0 (Nitrogen Oxides)', '0 (Phospholipid Ethers)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (alpha-(4-pyridyl-1-oxide)-N-tert-butylnitrone)', '1406-18-4 (Vitamin E)', '1Y6SNA8L5S (edelfosine)', '36015-30-2 (Propidium)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'I2ZWO3LS3M (Trypan Blue)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)']",,,"['HL49264/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA66081/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously developed a P-glycoprotein-expressing multidrug resistant subline (HL60/E8) from the non-P-glycoprotein-expressing human HL60 promyelocytic leukemia cell line. A possible cause of MDR1 silencing in HL60 cells is methylation of the promoter proximal region, thus demethylation occurring as a result of drug treatment may be responsible for MDR1 activation in the multidrug resistant subline. Using the bisulphite genomic sequencing technique we demonstrated that HL60 DNA is methylated at multiple sites within two distinct areas, one upstream and one downstream of the transcription start point. Only a single site in each area was methylated in all strands examined, with the remaining adjacent sites showing partial methylation. In contrast, DNA from the multidrug resistant HL60/E8 subline was unmethylated at essentially all sites in both areas. Thus the development of the P-glycoprotein-expressing multidrug resistant subline was associated with demethylation of the MDR1 5' region.","['Desiderato, L', 'Davey, M W', 'Piper, A A']","['Desiderato L', 'Davey MW', 'Piper AA']","['Department of Cell and Molecular Biology University of Technology, Sydney, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Somat Cell Mol Genet,Somatic cell and molecular genetics,8403568,IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'CpG Islands/genetics', 'DNA Methylation', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'HL-60 Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics']",1998/07/14 00:00,1998/07/14 00:01,['1998/07/14 00:00'],"['1998/07/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/14 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02673749 [doi]'],ppublish,Somat Cell Mol Genet. 1997 Nov;23(6):391-400. doi: 10.1007/BF02673749.,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This toxin also hemolyzes sheep erythrocytes by a mechanism presumed to include pore formation and osmotic lysis. Intoxication and hemolysis appear at strikingly different toxin concentrations and evolve over different time scales, suggesting that different molecular processes may be involved. The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that intoxication and hemolysis occur by distinct mechanisms. Although the hemolytic activity of AC toxin has a lag of >1 h, intoxication starts immediately. Because of this difference, we sought a surrogate or precursor lesion that leads to hemolysis, and potassium efflux has been observed from erythrocytes treated with other pore-forming toxins. AC toxin elicits an increase in K+ efflux from sheep erythrocytes and Jurkat cells, a human T-cell leukemia line, that begins within minutes of toxin addition. The toxin concentration dependence along with the analysis of the time course suggest that toxin monomers are sufficient to elicit release of K+ and to deliver the catalytic domain to the cell interior. Hemolysis, on the other hand, is a highly cooperative event that likely requires a subsequent oligomerization of these individual units. Although induction of K+ efflux shares some structural and environmental requirements with both intoxication and hemolysis, it can occur under conditions in which intoxication is reduced or prevented. The data presented here suggest that the transmembrane pathway by which K+ is released is separate and distinct from the structure required for intoxication but may be related to, or a precursor of, that which is ultimately responsible for hemolysis.","['Gray, M', 'Szabo, G', 'Otero, A S', 'Gray, L', 'Hewlett, E']","['Gray M', 'Szabo G', 'Otero AS', 'Gray L', 'Hewlett E']","['Department of Medicine, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, Virginia 22908, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,,"['Adenylate Cyclase Toxin', 'Adenylyl Cyclases/*metabolism', 'Bacterial Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Bordetella pertussis', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Calmodulin/metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP/metabolism', 'Erythrocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Hemolysin Proteins/*pharmacology', '*Hemolysis', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Potassium/*metabolism', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Precursors/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Temperature', 'Virulence Factors, Bordetella/*pharmacology']",1998/07/11 00:00,1998/07/11 00:01,['1998/07/11 00:00'],"['1998/07/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/11 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/11 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.273.29.18260 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)80424-0 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1998 Jul 17;273(29):18260-7. doi: 10.1074/jbc.273.29.18260.,"['0 (Adenylate Cyclase Toxin)', '0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Calmodulin)', '0 (Hemolysin Proteins)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (Virulence Factors, Bordetella)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 4.6.1.1 (Adenylyl Cyclases)', 'RWP5GA015D (Potassium)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,"['AI18000/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'HL37127/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

To better understand the mechanism of cytotoxicity of 1,2-naphthoquinones, the roles of various resistance mechanisms including P-glycoprotein, multidrug resistant associated protein, glutathione (GSH) and related enzymes, altered topoisomerase activity, and overexpression of genes that control apoptosis (bcl-2 and bc-xL) were studied. MCF7 cells were most sensitive to the naphthoquinones with IC50 values ranging from 1.1 to 10.8 microM, as compared to 2.5 to >32 microM for HT29 human colon, A549 human lung, CEM leukemia and AT3.1 rat prostate cancer cells. MCF7 ADR cells, selected for resistance to adriamycin (ADR), displayed cross-resistance to the tricyclic 1,2-naphthoquinones. Drug efflux via a P-glycoprotein mechanism was ruled out as a mechanism of resistance to 1,2-naphthoquinones, since KB-V1 cells expressing high levels of P-glycoprotein and the KB-3.1 parent line were equally sensitive to these compounds. Any resistance of the tricyclic naphthoquinones noted in ADR-resistant cells appeared to relate to the GSH redox cycle and could be circumvented by exposure to buthionine sulfoximine or by changing the structure from a tricyclic derivative to a 4-alkoxy-1,2-naphthoquinone. The 1,2-naphthoquinones were found to be cytotoxic against CEM/VM-1 and CEM/M70-B1 cells that were selected for resistance to teniposide or merbarone, respectively. In addition, cells overexpressing bcl-2 or bcl-xL proteins were as sensitive to 1,2-naphthoquinones as were control cells.

METHODS: Retinal ischemia was induced in rats by increasing the intraocular pressure to 110 mm Hg for 60 minutes. Various doses of recombinant human ADF (rhADF) or vehicle were administered intravenously before ischemia induction and immediately after reperfusion. The degree of retinal damage was assessed by electroretinogram (ERG) recording, by measuring the inner retinal thickness, and by counting the number of TdT-dUTP terminal nick-end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells in the inner nuclear layer. RESULTS: The amplitudes of the ERG b-wave and oscillatory potentials were increased significantly by treatment before ischemia and after reperfusion with 0.5 mg or 5 mg rhADF and by treatment after reperfusion with 1 mg rhADF, compared with those of vehicle-treated control rats (P < 0.01). On day 28 after reperfusion, the thickness of the inner retina of control rats and of rats treated before ischemia and after reperfusion with 0.5 mg rhADF were 46.1+/-6.4 microm and 78.5+/-8.9 microm, respectively (P < 0.01). The number of TUNEL-positive cells on days 1 and 2 after reperfusion was decreased significantly by treatments with 0.5 mg rhADF compared with the number of TUNEL-positive cells in control rats (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Electrophysiologic and histologic studies showed that ischemia for 60 minutes produces severe damage in vehicle-treated control rat retina, particularly in the inner retinal layer.

However, scattered nucleotide differences exist between enFeLV env elements and corresponding sequences of exogenous FeLV-B isolates. To address this disparity, we examined recombinant FeLV (rFeLV) viruses obtained from three experimentally-induced feline thymic tumors, along with rFeLVs derived from one naturally-occurring thymic tumor. Two of the three experimental cats were challenged with a FeLV-A/Rickard preparation, while one cat received this FeLV-A along with a mixture of in vitro-generated rFeLVs. The FeLV-A/Rickard preparation employed in this study was shown to be free of detectable rFeLVs since no recombinant products were observed in this preparation following nested PCR analyses. For each of the four tumor DNAs, nucleotide sequence analysis was performed on multiple clones of rFeLV-specific PCR products derived from the surface glycoprotein (SU) portion of the recombinant proviral env gene. Relative to the parental enFeLV sequence used to generate the rFeLVs, a total of 19 nucleotide differences were found scattered within the SU region of the env gene in these in vivo-derived rFeLV clones. Most interestingly, this set of 19 differences led to complete sequence identity with natural FeLV-B isolates. Our results indicate these differences are present early in the in vivo evolution of recombinant viruses, suggesting that rFeLVs harboring these differences are strongly selected. We also present evidence indicating an in vivo selection pattern exists for specific recombinant species containing relatively greater amounts of enFeLV-derived SU sequence. This in vivo selection process appears to be gradual, occurring over the infection timecourse, yielding rFeLV species which have recombination structural motifs similar to those seen in natural FeLV-B isolates.","['Bechtel, M K', 'Mathes, L E', 'Hayes, K A', 'Phipps, A J', 'Roy-Burman, P']","['Bechtel MK', 'Mathes LE', 'Hayes KA', 'Phipps AJ', 'Roy-Burman P']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Southern California School of Medicine, Los Angeles 90033, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Virus Res,Virus research,8410979,IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Biological Evolution', 'Cats', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Recombination, Genetic', 'Retroviridae Infections/pathology/*virology', 'Selection, Genetic', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Tumor Virus Infections/pathology/*virology']",1998/07/11 00:00,1998/07/11 00:01,['1998/07/11 00:00'],"['1998/07/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/11 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/11 00:00 [entrez]']","['S016817029800015X [pii]', '10.1016/s0168-1702(98)00015-x [doi]']",ppublish,Virus Res. 1998 Mar;54(1):71-86. doi: 10.1016/s0168-1702(98)00015-x.,,,,['CA51485/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) were investigated to test the hypothesis that the development of subsets of enteric neurons and/or glia is also affected by a neuropoietic cytokine, by itself, or together with NT-3. Crest-derived cells, immunoselected from the fetal rat gut (E14) with antibodies to p75NTR, were found by RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry (after culture) to express both alpha (CNTER alpha) and beta components (gp130 and LIFR beta) of the tripartite CNTF receptor. In situ, myenteric ganglia below the esophagus were CNTFR alpha-immunoreactive by E16-E18. In vitro, CNTF and LIF induced in crest-derived cells nuclear translocation of STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3), a concentration-dependent increase in expression of neuronal or glial markers, and a decrease in expression of the precursor marker, nestin. LIFR beta was expressed by more cells than CNTFR alpha; therefore, although the factors were equipotent, the maximal effect of LIF > CNTF. The cytokines and NT-3 were additive in promoting neuronal but not glial development. Specifically, the development of neurons expressing NADPH-diaphorase activity (an early marker found in inhibitory motor neurons) was promoted by CNTF and NT-3. These observations support the idea that a ligand for the tripartite CNTF receptor complex plays a role in ENS development.","['Chalazonitis, A', 'Rothman, T P', 'Chen, J', 'Vinson, E N', 'MacLennan, A J', 'Gershon, M D']","['Chalazonitis A', 'Rothman TP', 'Chen J', 'Vinson EN', 'MacLennan AJ', 'Gershon MD']","['Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Columbia University, College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York 10032, USA. ac83@columbia.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Dev Biol,Developmental biology,0372762,IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Intestines/*embryology/*innervation', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'NADPH Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Nerve Growth Factors/*physiology', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/pharmacology', 'Neural Crest/cytology', 'Neuroglia/*physiology', 'Neurons/*physiology', 'Neurotrophin 3', 'Pregnancy', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism']",1998/07/11 00:00,1998/07/11 00:01,['1998/07/11 00:00'],"['1998/07/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/11 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0012160698989011 [pii]'],ppublish,Dev Biol. 1998 Jun 15;198(2):343-65.,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Neurotrophin 3)', '0 (Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, rat)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', 'EC 1.6.99.1 (NADPH Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",,,"['HD21032/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'NS15547/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS35224/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Its occurrence during pregnancy limits treatment with standard chemotherapeutic agents. A woman was found to have hairy cell leukemia and massive splenomegaly late in the second trimester. A review of the literature did not provide a carefully formulated treatment plan. It was believed that splenectomy (the historic therapy for hairy cell leukemia) would likely result in improved hematologic values and allow the pregnancy to progress. STUDY DESIGN: Case report with literature review. RESULTS: Preoperative laboratory studies revealed platelet count 65,000/mm3, hematocrit 28.6%, white blood cell count 4000/mm3, and hairy cell index 0.06 to 0.07. At 24 weeks' gestation, the patient underwent splenectomy with resolution of thrombocytopenia and normal progression of pregnancy without complication. Repeat cesarean section at 38 weeks produced a 2875 gm healthy male infant with Apgar scores of 9 and 9. CONCLUSION: If antepartum management of hairy cell leukemia is warranted, splenectomy is a safe and effective treatment option during the second trimester.","['Stiles, G M', 'Stanco, L M', 'Saven, A', 'Hoffmann, K D']","['Stiles GM', 'Stanco LM', 'Saven A', 'Hoffmann KD']","['Department of Surgery, Sharp Memorial Hospital, San Diego 92123, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Perinatol,Journal of perinatology : official journal of the California Perinatal Association,8501884,IM,,"['Adult', 'Cesarean Section', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/complications/*surgery', 'Male', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Hematologic', 'Pregnancy Complications, Neoplastic/*surgery', 'Pregnancy Trimester, Second', '*Splenectomy', 'Thrombocytopenia/etiology']",1998/07/11 00:00,1998/07/11 00:01,['1998/07/11 00:00'],"['1998/07/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/11 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/11 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Perinatol. 1998 May-Jun;18(3):200-1.,,,8,,,,,,,,,,,,

Though the CD 34+ therapy is a relatively new treatment and the mononuclear cell therapy is more standard, both have been successfully used to reconstitute lethally damaged hematopoietic stem cells. Allogeneic transplants have been more effective than autologous transplants against tumors, but they also pose a greater hazard of death from complications, graft-versus-host disease, and infections. More currently, this approach has been used in patients with certain solid tumors, either in a metastatic or recurrent disease setting or as an adjuvant to surgery and/or standard doses of chemotherapy in patients with a known high risk of recurrence. Unfortunately, the majority of the studies about the impact of this therapy have been small and nonrandomized against standard therapy, and they have encompassed diverse populations of patients. This makes comparisons with contemporary standard--dose approaches--already problematic from a statistical point of view--even more dangerous because of the dissimilarity of the groups being compared. Particularly in the high-risk adjuvant setting, data suggest that those patients that meet the eligibility criteria for high-dose therapy and transplantation exhibit the prognostic factors for a positive outcome. When one compares these results with those of a more heterogeneous group of patients treated with conventional therapy, the conclusion might be drawn that high-dose therapy is superior to standard therapy, when a longer follow-up of the patients in the study will show this to be untrue. Thus there is a plea from clinicians and physicians conducting trials for prospective, randomized trials that would allow a fair comparison between high-dose therapy in combination with transplant procedures and a more conventional, standard chemotherapy, which is often less toxic and definitely less expensive. This article reviews the data for transplantation in four tumors: breast cancer, ovarian cancer, small-cell lung cancer, and germ cell testis cancer. There is such a small number of randomized trials that an attempt must be made to compare these small high-dose therapy studies with similar, though not identical, large studies of conventional therapy. This article attempts to make those comparisons, and several conclusions are drawn, which are detailed below. First, few data support the use of high-dose chemotherapy in any patient with recurrent and drug-resistant breast cancer or ovarian cancer. Similarly, few data support the use of high-dose approaches for patients with extensive small-cell lung cancer. For patients with metastatic breast cancer that has responded completely to conventional chemotherapy, no data suggest a survival advantage for the immediate consolidation of that response with high-dose chemotherapy. The only trial addressing this issue found that immediate transplantation led to a better disease-free survival rate, but overall survival, as compared with that of patients who received transplants at relapse, was not affected, and the study did not address the issue of the relative merits of conventional chemotherapy in either case. The only study of high-dose versus conventional chemotherapy was statistically underpowered, and it showed poorer-than-anticipated outcomes in the patients who received conventional therapy. Ongoing or recently completed trials will, it is hoped, address the many unanswered questions in this area. For patients with high-risk, non-metastatic breast cancer, no completed and analyzed phase III randomized studies address the relative merits of conventional versus high-dose therapy.

Influences of N1-acSp dose (1-100 microM), time (0-12 h at 100 microM), aminoguanidine (AG, 1 mM) and cell numbers (at 1 microM N1-acSp) on percentage S-phase, polyamine contents and viability were determined. DFMO/CGP 48664A decreased percentage S-phase from 58 to 26%, decreased spermidine (Sd) and spermine (Sp) contents 3-fold, but did not affect viability. With increasing N1-acSp dose, S-phase percentage and Sd contents increased concomitantly, reaching plateau values that were comparable with those of untreated controls. S-phase and Sd content increased from 4-6 h after N1-acSp administration, reaching plateau values from 11 and 6 h, respectively. N1-acSp content was dose dependent and increased linearly to reach plateau values from 8 h. AG did not affect any of these parameters. Addition of 1 microM N1-acSp to decreasing numbers of DFMO/CGP 48664A-treated cells caused increasing S-phase percentage, Sd and N1-acSp contents.

N1-acSp accumulation rate and its subsequent conversion to Sd is relatively slow compared with intracellular Sd needs.

Maxima for spermidine and S-phase were reached at < or = 8 and 18 h, respectively. These were below levels of untreated controls. Decreases were noted from 12 and 18 h, respectively. N1-acSp was detectable in L1210 from 0-18 h. Liver spermidine was decreased by CGP 48664A/DFMO. After N1-acSp treatment, liver N1-acSp and N1-acSd increased from < or = 8 h, reached maxima at < or = 8 and 10 h, respectively, and were undetectable from 15 h. We conclude that the in vivo growth inhibitory effect of CGP 48664A/DFMO is reversible by N1-acSp treatment. The liver is probably involved in N1-acSp terminal catabolism. The effect of the polyamine depletion-repletion scheme on S-phase cell numbers may be much more profound than present estimates from 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation.","['Dorhout, B', 'Ferwerda, H', 'Kingma, A W', 'de Hoog, E', 'Muskiet, F A']","['Dorhout B', 'Ferwerda H', 'Kingma AW', 'de Hoog E', 'Muskiet FA']","['Central Laboratory for Clinical Chemistry, University Hospital Groningen, Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,IM,,"['Amidines/*administration & dosage', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Count', 'Eflornithine/*administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Indans/*administration & dosage', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'S Phase/drug effects', 'Spermine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",1998/07/11 00:00,1998/07/11 00:01,['1998/07/11 00:00'],"['1998/07/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/11 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/11 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0304-4165(98)00015-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s0304-4165(98)00015-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1998 Jun 5;1381(1):89-94. doi: 10.1016/s0304-4165(98)00015-4.,"['0 (Amidines)', '0 (Indans)', ""149400-88-4 (4-amidinoindan-1-one 2'-amidinohydrazone)"", ""25593-72-0 (N'-acetylspermine)"", '2FZ7Y3VOQX (Spermine)', 'ZQN1G5V6SR (Eflornithine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Two hundred and seventy seven consecutive lymph node FNA specimens reported to be consistent with reactive lymphoid hyperplasia (n = 213) or suggestive/diagnostic of malignant lymphoma (n = 64) were reviewed. Follow up data were obtained by case record review or by histological correlation. The value of immunocytochemistry, in situ hybridisation for immunoglobulin light chain mRNA, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) towards the final clinicopathological diagnosis was assessed in 92, 61, and 45 cases, respectively. RESULTS: Sixty one of 67 lymphomas and 207 of 209 reactive lymph nodes were accurately diagnosed by FNA cytology. There were six false negative aspirates including three cases of follicular lymphoma, two cases of Hodgkin's disease, and one chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Two FNA specimens considered suspicious of lymphoma proved reactive on histology or clinical follow up. One metastatic small cell carcinoma was wrongly diagnosed as lymphoma. Ancillary studies contributed to the correct diagnosis in most cases although occasional misleading results were obtained, particularly with PCR. CONCLUSIONS: FNA cytology accurately distinguished reactive lymphoid hyperplasia from malignant lymphoma in 97% of cases. However, occasional wrong diagnoses occurred owing to sampling error or misinterpretation. Ancillary studies can be applied to cytological samples and contribute to the diagnosis in most cases.","['Stewart, C J', 'Duncan, J A', 'Farquharson, M', 'Richmond, J']","['Stewart CJ', 'Duncan JA', 'Farquharson M', 'Richmond J']","['Department of Pathology, Royal Infirmary, Glasgow, UK.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biopsy, Needle', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'False Negative Reactions', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Pseudolymphoma/*pathology']",1998/07/11 00:00,1998/07/11 00:01,['1998/07/11 00:00'],"['1998/07/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/11 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/jcp.51.3.197 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 1998 Mar;51(3):197-203. doi: 10.1136/jcp.51.3.197.,,,,,,PMC500638,,,,,,,,,

Using the 51Cr-release assay to measure necrotic death of target cells, neonatal NK cells had low NK activity (K562 targets) and high lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) activity (Daudi targets) compared with adult cells, as has been previously reported. Using a 125I-deoxyuridine (125I-UdR) release assay, cord cells were shown to also have higher apoptotic LAK activity against YAC-1 target cells. Interleukin-4 (IL-4) inhibited interleukin-2 (IL-2)-induced necrotic killing of target cells by adult effectors but had no such inhibitory effect on cord cells. In contrast, IL-4 inhibited both adult and cord LAK cytotoxicity of YAC-1 target cells by apoptotic mechanisms with higher suppression observed in cord cell preparations. Using a colorimetric substrate conversion assay, IL-2 induced higher, and IL-4 had a more significant suppressive effect on, cord cell granzyme B enzyme activity compared with adult cells, paralleling apoptosis cytotoxicity data. Co-culture of either adult or cord LAK cells with IL-4 had a similar inhibitory effect on granzyme B protein expression, as detected by Western blotting. In contrast, IL-4 did not inhibit perforin expression, thereby defining IL-4 as a cytokine that can differentially regulate the NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity processes of apoptosis and necrosis. The differential sensitivity of cord cells to cytokine regulation of cytotoxicity may also have implications for cord blood transplantations, as NK cells are known to function as an effector cell in both graft-versus-host disease and in the graft-versus-leukaemia phenomena.","['Gardiner, C M', 'Reen, D J']","['Gardiner CM', 'Reen DJ']","[""Children's Research Centre, Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, Dublin, Ireland.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aging/immunology', 'Apoptosis/*immunology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*immunology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Fetal Blood/immunology', 'Granzymes', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Interleukin-2/*immunology', 'Interleukin-4/*immunology', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/enzymology/*immunology/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Perforin', 'Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins', 'Serine Endopeptidases/metabolism']",1998/07/11 00:00,1998/07/11 00:01,['1998/07/11 00:00'],"['1998/07/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/11 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2567.1998.00464.x [doi]'],ppublish,Immunology. 1998 Apr;93(4):511-7. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2567.1998.00464.x.,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins)', '126465-35-8 (Perforin)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (GZMB protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Granzymes)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)']",,,,,PMC1364129,,,,,,,,,

The fourth patient developed acute myeloid leukemia after 4 weeks of G-CSF treatment. During maintenance, one patient was treated with G-CSF for 18 months, until she received bone marrow transplantation, without presenting side effects. In the second responding patient G-CSF treatment was stopped because of appearance of immature cells in peripheral blood and myeloid blasts in bone marrow.

The present study was undertaken to assess the feasibility, toxicity, and antileukemic activity of carboplatin (CBDCA) added to a combination of the two former agents. DESIGN AND METHODS: Two regimens (R) of CBDCA plus HIDAC and either mitoxantrone or idarubicin (crossover) were sequentially evaluated. R-1 consisted of CBDCA 300 mg/m2/d (24-hour infusion) on days 1-4, HIDAC 1 g/m2/bd on days 1-5, and mitoxantrone/idarubicin 12/6 mg/m2/d on days 1-3, followed by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). R-2, an attenuated-toxicity regimen, consisted of CBDCA and G-CSF as above, HIDAC on alternate days (1, 3, 5), and mitoxantrone/idarubicin 8/5 mg/m2/dose. Intended post-remission therapy included a similar, lower intensity course and a myeloablative phase supported by an allogeneic or autologous blood cell transplant. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients (median age 53 years, one child) formed the study group: 10 (34%) had a primary refractory disease (8 to idarubicin-cytarabine-etoposide, ICE), 6 (21%) were at second or subsequent relapse, and 5 (17%) had a first remission lasting < 12 months. In addition, 4 patients (14%) had received prior HIDAC and 10 (34%) were relapsing after a bone marrow/blood cell transplant. Twelve patients were treated with R-1 and 17 with R-2. The complete response rate was 25% with R-1 and 53% with R-2, due to a significantly lower death rate by pancytopenic complications (p = 0.023). The probability of response by risk class was: primary refractory 30% (43% with R-2), > 2nd relapse 33% (50% with R-2), 1st relapse < 12 months 40% (50% with R-2), 1st relapse > 12 months 50% (75% with R-2), prior HIDAC 75%, and prior transplant 30% (33% with R-2). Seven patients could undergo an autologous (n = 5) or allogeneic (n = 2) bone marrow/peripheral blood cell transplant after one consolidation cycle. Overall survival was 4.2 months, significantly longer in responders (complete and partial: median 11 months) than non-responders (p < 0.001). Median duration of complete remission was 10 months and 2-year probability 0.31, but no patient remained disease-free at 3 years. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: R-2 was well tolerated, exerted a significant activity in high-risk AML, and is amenable to further improvements. However, the lack of long-term disease-free survivors indicates the need for innovative post-remission strategies.","['Bassan, R', 'Lerede, T', 'Buelli, M', 'Borleri, G', 'Bellavita, P', 'Rambaldi, A', 'Barbui, T']","['Bassan R', 'Lerede T', 'Buelli M', 'Borleri G', 'Bellavita P', 'Rambaldi A', 'Barbui T']","['Division of Hematology, Ospedali Riuniti, Bergamo, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Carboplatin/administration & dosage', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Recurrence']",1998/07/11 00:00,1998/07/11 00:01,['1998/07/11 00:00'],"['1998/07/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/11 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/11 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1998 May;83(5):422-7.,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No recent studies give data on the incidence and risk factors of renal complications and their prognostic impact. DESIGN AND METHODS: Two hundred and twenty consecutive adult patients with newly diagnosed acute leukemia treated at a major university medical center were evaluated for renal complications before, during, and after treatment; 166 patients were treated by chemotherapy only and 54 patients were treated with chemotherapy and later transplanted with allogeneic or autologous bone marrow. Renal complications were subdivided into 3 entities: acute renal failure, major and minor complications, based on clinical and laboratory parameters. Renal failure occurring as a consequence of terminal multi-organ failure was excluded from the present study. RESULTS: Approximately 30% of patients in the chemotherapy group had a renal complication either before or after chemotherapy. Patients undergoing transplantation had a 50% risk of renal complications. Risk factors for complications were male sex, age, previous kidney disease, white cell count, and refractory leukemia (chemotherapy group) and allogeneic versus autologous transplant (transplant group). In the chemotherapy group, early but not delayed renal complications had a poor prognostic impact. In the transplant group renal complications had no impact on prognosis. In all patient groups, acute renal failure was prognostically unfavorable.

One approach to delineate replication errors in cancer cells is to determine alterations of microsatellites that are short tandem repeat sequences dispersed throughout the human genome. We have investigated whether genomic instability may be a possible event in the leukemogenic process by evaluating the pattern of instability in 41 cases of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-two samples of genomic DNA (41 at diagnosis and 41 at remission) were analyzed by PCR with microsatellite markers chosen on five different chromosomes (2, 10, 11, 13, 18) known to be frequently involved in tumors of various origins. Since deletions of the short arm of chromosome 12 are relatively common in children with ALL, we also analyzed one region flanked by the microsatellite marker D12S308 on 12p. This area encompasses a genetic locus which contains the putative suppressor gene KIP1. RESULTS: A pattern of MI at one or two loci on different chromosomes could be documented in 4 of the 41 cases analyzed (9.7%). Three were common ALL and 1 was a T-ALL. One case showed two concomitant sites of instability, while 1 revealed two additional bands by using simultaneously microsatellite markers D2S123 and D18S58. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that genetic instability of microsatellite repeat sequences occurs in a proportion of childhood ALL. Mismatched repair errors documented in hereditary and sporadic solid tumors may thus be involved in hematological malignancies. While in such cases the pattern of genomic instability appears indicative of a mutator phenotype and of a potential predisposition towards a leukemic transformation, other genomic loci close to cytogenetic and molecular alterations known to occur in ALL need to be investigated in depth in cases with an apparently non mutated phenotype.","['Reato, G', 'Basso, G', 'Putti, M C', 'Cignetti, A', 'Guarini, A', 'Foa, R']","['Reato G', 'Basso G', 'Putti MC', 'Cignetti A', 'Guarini A', 'Foa R']","['Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche ed Oncologia Umana, University of Turin, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,,"['Child', '*Genome, Human', 'Humans', '*Microsatellite Repeats', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics']",1998/07/11 00:00,1998/07/11 00:01,['1998/07/11 00:00'],"['1998/07/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/11 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/11 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1998 May;83(5):403-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cellular expression, serum release and correlation with other soluble molecules belonging to nerve growth factor receptors (NGFr) superfamily.",398-402,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: CD27, a transmembrane homodimer belonging to the nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor superfamily, is typically expressed on leukemic CD5+ cells in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and found in soluble form in the serum of CLL patients. Therefore, we investigated clinico-biological implications of increased serum levels of sCD27 in an unselected series of B-CLL patients. DESIGN AND METHODS: Serum CD27 (sCD27) levels were determined at the time of diagnosis in 82 previously untreated B-CLL patients using a sandwich enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA). Results were correlated with either clinico-hematological or biological features. Finally, quantitative flow cytometric analyses of membrane CD27 (mCD27) expression were carried out on peripheral blood (PB) cells of 22 B-CLL patients and 5 healthy controls, respectively. RESULTS: CD27 was found to be expressed on the surface of both resting normal and leukemic B cells. sCD27 levels were significantly higher in B-CLL patients (median value 2150 U/mL) than in healthy controls (median value 220 U/mL) (p < 0.0001). There was a close relationship between sCD27 and soluble TNF-alpha, another molecule belonging to the NGF receptor superfamily. Changes in sCD27 level correlated with clinical stage, beta 2 microglobulin and LDH. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that sCD27 is a reliable marker of tumor mass in B-CLL. Its potential prognostic value should be tested in prospective studies.","['Molica, S', 'Vitelli, G', 'Levato, D', 'Crispino, G', ""Dell'Olio, M"", 'Dattilo, A', 'Matera, R', 'Gandolfo, G M', 'Musto, P']","['Molica S', 'Vitelli G', 'Levato D', 'Crispino G', ""Dell'Olio M"", 'Dattilo A', 'Matera R', 'Gandolfo GM', 'Musto P']","['Divisione Ematologia, Azienda Ospedaliera Pugliese-Ciaccio, Catanzaro, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,,"['Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Multigene Family', 'Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor/*genetics', 'Solubility', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7/*blood']",1998/07/11 00:00,1998/07/11 00:01,['1998/07/11 00:00'],"['1998/07/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/11 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/11 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1998 May;83(5):398-402.,"['0 (Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we investigated the surface expression of CD117 antigen in 135 patients with acute leukemia in relationship to de novo or secondary origin of AML, subtypes of FAB classification, expression of other antigens such as CD34, HLA-DR, CD15, CD14, CD45RA, CD45RO, CD11b, CD11c, CD4, CD7, mixed antigen co-expression (LyAg + AML and MyAg + ALL) and features of leukemic mass. DESIGN AND METHODS: The CD117 antigen expression (clone 95C3) was determined by flow cytometry in a series of 135 patients with acute leukemia at diagnosis consecutively observed during the years 1995-1997: 82 AML (including 51 cases of de novo AML, 22 cases of AML following myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), 9 cases of myeloid blastic crisis of chronic myeloid leukemia (BC-CML) and 53 ALL. All cases were stratified in CD117+ and CD117- groups and the differences were analyzed by using appropriate statistical analyses. RESULTS: CD117 antigen was found over 10% in 74% of AML without significant differences of positivity between AML after MDS or BC-CML and de novo AML. We did not note a significant correlation between FAB classification and CD117 which was expressed in 100% of M1 and M7 cases, in 80% of M0 cases, in 75% of M2 cases, in 70% of M3 cases and in 82% of M4 cases. Instead, in M5 subtype CD117 was strictly restricted to earlier stages: ten of the eleven M5b (91%) cases completely lacked CD117 antigen expression, whereas 100% of M5a cases were positive. The results of Pearson's coefficient showed: 1) a significant inverse relationship between CD117 and CD15, CD4 and CD14 (only in M5 subtypes) and CD11b, CD11c and CD45RO (in all cases); 2) a significant direct correlation between CD117 and CD34 and CD45RA (in all cases); and 3) an independent expression between CD117 and CD15 associated with a low correlation between CD117 and HLA-DR antigen (only in non-monocytic cases). In ALL, whether of B or T lineages, surface expression of CD117 was never observed. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the CD117 antigen shows a high specificity for AML, independently upon FAB classification, and represents a reliable marker in characterizing the differentiative degree of the monocytic blasts.","['Cascavilla, N', 'Musto, P', ""D'Arena, G"", 'Melillo, L', 'Carella, A M', 'Petrilli, M P', 'Sanpaolo, G', 'Carotenuto, M']","['Cascavilla N', 'Musto P', ""D'Arena G"", 'Melillo L', 'Carella AM', 'Petrilli MP', 'Sanpaolo G', 'Carotenuto M']","['Divisione di Ematologia, Ospedale Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza, I.R.C.C.S., San Giovanni Rotondo, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*blood', 'Cell Differentiation/immunology', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*blood']",1998/07/11 00:00,1998/07/11 00:01,['1998/07/11 00:00'],"['1998/07/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/11 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/11 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1998 May;83(5):392-7.,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we evaluated the effects of PEG-recombinant human megakaryocyte growth and development factor (PEG-rHuMGDF), a pegylated and truncated form of thrombopoietin, on the growth and differentiation of the HEL cell line. As a model system we chose the pluripotent HEL line that acquires multiple markers of the megakaryocyte/platelet phenotype following treatment with phorbol esters, and, more importantly, expresses the receptor for thrombopoietin (Mpl receptor) at its cellular surface. DESIGN AND METHODS: The effect of PEG-rHuMGDF on HEL proliferation/differentiation was evaluated in a liquid culture assay. RESULTS: Peg-rHuMGDF do not increase the proliferative capacity of HEL cell but, in parallel experiments, HEL cells showed a more mature and differentiated pattern after exposure to the cytokine. Our results show that PEG-rHuMGDF, at the optimal doses of 100-150 ng/mL, is able to induce: 1) morphological changes with the formation of cytoplasmic protrusions; 2) increased ploidy as demonstrated by cytofluorimetric analysis; 3) increased expression of megakaryocyte markers, including glycoprotein IIb-IIIa and the platelet-specific alloantigen (PIA1).

The more intensive treatment regimen in high-risk ALL patients might contribute to the development of AON. The clinical course of AON, however, is determined by necrosis-specific factors such as a large size.

SOCS-3, a cytokine-inducible protein of the suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) family, is expressed in the murine pituitary in vivo. After i.p. injection of LIF (5.0 micrograms/mouse) or interleukin-1 beta (0.1 microgram/mouse) pituitary SOCS-3 mRNA was stimulated 9-fold and 6-fold, respectively. Also, in corticotroph AtT-20 cells LIF and interleukin-1 beta both potently stimulated SOCS-3 mRNA expression. In AtT-20 cells, stable overexpression of SOCS-3 inhibits basal and LIF-stimulated ACTH secretion in comparison to mock-transfected AtT-20 cells (basal: 4426 +/- 118 vs. 4973 +/- 138 pg/ml, P < 0.05; LIF-induced: 5511 +/- 172 vs. 9308 +/- 465 pg/ml, P < 0.001). Stable overexpression of SOCS-3 cDNA in AtT-20 cells also resulted in a significant 50% decrease of LIF-induced POMC mRNA levels (P < 0.05) and POMC promoter activity (P < 0.001), respectively. Western blot analysis revealed an inhibition of LIF-stimulated gp130 and STAT-3 phosphorylation in SOCS-3 overexpressing AtT-20 cells. Thus, SOCS-3 inhibits the Janus kinase (JAK) and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) pathway, which is known to mediate LIF-stimulated ACTH secretion and POMC gene expression. In conclusion, SOCS-3 functions as an intracellular regulator of POMC gene expression and ACTH secretion, acting as a negative feedback mediator of the cytokine-mediated neuro-immuno-endocrine interface.","['Auernhammer, C J', 'Chesnokova, V', 'Bousquet, C', 'Melmed, S']","['Auernhammer CJ', 'Chesnokova V', 'Bousquet C', 'Melmed S']","['Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Cedars-Sinai Research Institute-UCLA School of Medicine 90048, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Endocrinol,"Molecular endocrinology (Baltimore, Md.)",8801431,IM,,"['Adrenocorticotropic Hormone/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Hypothalamus/metabolism', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Phosphorylation', 'Pituitary Gland/*metabolism', 'Pro-Opiomelanocortin/*genetics', 'Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', '*Repressor Proteins', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', '*Transcription Factors', 'Transfection']",1998/07/11 00:00,1998/07/11 00:01,['1998/07/11 00:00'],"['1998/07/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/11 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/mend.12.7.0140 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Endocrinol. 1998 Jul;12(7):954-61. doi: 10.1210/mend.12.7.0140.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Il6st protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Socs3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', '66796-54-1 (Pro-Opiomelanocortin)', '9002-60-2 (Adrenocorticotropic Hormone)']",,,['DK-50238/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

CCRF-CEM human leukemic cells were exposed to etoposide for 2 hr, then embedded in agarose on microscope slides before cell lysis. DNA from each cell remained trapped in the agarose and covalently bound topo II molecules from drug-stabilized cleavable complexes remained associated with the DNA. The covalently bound topo II was detected in situ by immunofluorescence. Isoform-specific covalent complexes were detected with antisera specific for either the alpha or beta isoform of topo II followed by a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated second antibody. DNA was detected using the fluorescent stain Hoechst 33258. A cooled slow scan charged coupled device camera was used to capture images. A dose-dependent increase in green immunofluorescence was observed when using antisera to either the alpha or beta isoforms of topo II, indicating that both isoforms are targets for etoposide. We have called this the TARDIS method, for trapped in agarose DNA immunostaining.

Recently, a dichotomy between IL-12 and IL-10 regarding progression of a variety diseases has emerged. IL-12 activates type 1 cytokine production and has an antagonistic effect on type 2 cytokines. Here, by using quantitative competitive PCR, we show that peripheral blood mononuclear cells from bovine leukemia virus-infected animals in the alymphocytotic stage of disease express an increased amount of IL-12 p40 mRNA. In contrast, IL-12 p40 mRNA expression by cells from animals with late-stage disease, termed persistent lymphocytosis, was significantly decreased compared to that by normal and alymphocytotic animals. Interestingly, IL-12 p40 mRNA was also detected in tumor-bearing animals. IL-12 p40 expression occurred only in monocytes/macrophages, not B or T lymphocytes. The present study combined with previous findings suggest that IL-12 in bovine leukemia virus-infected animals may regulate production of other cytokines such as gamma interferon and IL-10 and the progression of bovine leukosis in animals that develop more advanced disease such as a persistent lymphocytosis of B cells or B-cell lymphosarcoma.","['Pyeon, D', 'Splitter, G A']","['Pyeon D', 'Splitter GA']","['Department of Animal Health and Biomedical Sciences, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin 53706, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*metabolism/physiopathology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Interleukin-12/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*physiology', 'Lymphocytosis/*metabolism/physiopathology', 'Macrophages/metabolism', 'Monocytes/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Virus Latency']",1998/07/11 00:00,1998/07/11 00:01,['1998/07/11 00:00'],"['1998/07/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/11 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.72.8.6917-6921.1998 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1998 Aug;72(8):6917-21. doi: 10.1128/JVI.72.8.6917-6921.1998.,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)']",,,['R01 CA59127/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC109906,,,,,,,,,

Here, we utilized the human T-cell leukemia type 1 Tax protein as a molecular tool to investigate the mechanism of viral gene transcription that initiates the early phase of infection of HIV-1. Tax alone does not significantly increase the activity of HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) in T lymphocytes, but it markedly enhanced the replication of an infectious HIV-1 provirus with a truncated nef gene. This enhancement is preferentially mediated by the cooperation of Tax and Tat which is dependent on TAR and duplicated kappaB cis elements of the HIV-1 LTR as well as the NF-kappaB activation domain of Tax. Furthermore, phorbol myristate acetate and membrane-targeted HIV-1 Nef also enhanced the LTR activity in the presence of Tat in the TAR- and kappaB cis element-dependent manner.

The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNase H domain has been expressed independently of the polymerase domain and possesses Mn2+-dependent activity with a hexahistidine tag. The isolated domain maintains the ability to specifically remove a tRNA primer mimic. In this study, the substrate determinants for recognition of the cognate tRNA3Lys are defined. Model substrates were constructed which mimic the RNA-DNA hybrid obtained from plus-strand strong-stop synthesis. Deletion substrates containing only 12, 9, or 6 positions of the tRNA primer were capable of being cleaved by the isolated RNase H domain. Mismatch and bromodeoxyuridine mutagenesis analysis indicated that positions 2, 3, 4, and 6, when mutated, affected the specificity of RNase H activity. Substitution substrates indicated that positions 4 and 6 within the RNA primer were important for recognition and cleavage by the HIV-1 isolated RNase H domain. Moloney murine leukemia virus-HIV-1 hybrid substrates were constructed which demonstrated that changes to HIV-1 sequences at positions 4 and 6 were sufficient but not optimal for regaining cleavage by the isolated HIV-1 RNase H domain.

The mechanism by which a nuclear protein such as Tax stimulates I-kappaB phosphorylation and degradation remains unclear. Here, we describe two cytoplasmic mutants of Tax, designated TaxDeltaN81 and TaxDeltaN109, from which the domains important for cyclic AMP response element binding factor (CREB) and serum response factor (SRF) binding and nuclear transport have been removed. These mutants were unable to trans activate from the HTLV-1 21-bp repeats or the serum response element in the c-fos promoter. In contrast, they activated NF-kappaB reporters, suggesting that activation of NF-kappaB by Tax occurs in the cytoplasm. Incorporation of the nuclear localization signal (NLS) of the simian virus 40 large T antigen into TaxDeltaN81 and TaxDeltaN109 redirected both proteins predominantly to the nucleus yet did not restore trans activation via CREB or SRF. The NLS fusion had little effect on TaxDeltaN81 but reduced NF-kappaB trans activation by TaxDeltaN109, possibly because of its proximity to the NF-kappaB-activating domain of Tax. In contrast to wild-type Tax, the cytoplasmic TaxDeltaN mutants are not cytotoxic. Stable expression of TaxDeltaN109 in HeLa cells resulted in a significant reduction in the intracellular level of I-kappaB alpha, with the constitutive presence of NF-kappaB in the nucleus and concomitant activation of the NF-kappaB enhancer. These results are suggestive of a potential application of the TaxDeltaN109-like mutants in targeting I-kappaB degradation and NF-kappaB activation. Interestingly, a Tax species with a molecular mass similar to that of TaxDeltaN109 was identified in many HTLV-1-transformed T cells, suggesting that TaxDeltaN109-like species might play a role in HTLV-1-induced leukemogenesis.","['Nicot, C', 'Tie, F', 'Giam, C Z']","['Nicot C', 'Tie F', 'Giam CZ']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, Maryland 20814, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,,"['Binding Sites', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mutagenesis', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Transcriptional Activation']",1998/07/11 00:00,1998/07/11 00:01,['1998/07/11 00:00'],"['1998/07/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/11 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.72.8.6777-6784.1998 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1998 Aug;72(8):6777-84. doi: 10.1128/JVI.72.8.6777-6784.1998.,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (NF-kappa B)']",,,"['F32 CA075638/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA048709/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA48709/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA75638/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC109886,,,,,,,,,

Recently, a ubiquitin-specific protease enzyme (named HAUSP) and a ubiquitin-homology family protein (PIC1) have been found associated with ND10. HAUSP binds strongly to Vmw110, a herpesvirus regulatory protein which has the ability to disrupt ND10, while PIC1 was identified as a protein which interacts with PML, the prototype ND10 protein. We have investigated the role of ubiquitin-related pathways in the mechanism of ND10 disruption by Vmw110 and the effect of virus infection on PML stability. The results show that the disruption of ND10 during virus infection correlates with the loss of several PML isoforms and this process is dependent on active proteasomes. The PML isoforms that are most sensitive to virus infection correspond closely to those which have recently been identified as being covalently conjugated to PIC1. In addition, a large number of PIC1-protein conjugates can be detected following transfection of a PIC1 expression plasmid, and many of these are also eliminated in a Vmw110-dependent manner during virus infection. These observations provide a biochemical mechanism to explain the observed effects of Vmw110 on ND10 and suggest a simple yet powerful mechanism by which Vmw110 might function during virus infection.","['Everett, R D', 'Freemont, P', 'Saitoh, H', 'Dasso, M', 'Orr, A', 'Kathoria, M', 'Parkinson, J']","['Everett RD', 'Freemont P', 'Saitoh H', 'Dasso M', 'Orr A', 'Kathoria M', 'Parkinson J']","['MRC Virology Unit, Glasgow G11 5JR, Scotland. r.everett@vir.gla.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cricetinae', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/metabolism', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Endopeptidases/metabolism', 'Herpesvirus 1, Human/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Isomerism', 'Lactones/pharmacology', 'Leupeptins/pharmacology', 'Multienzyme Complexes/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'SUMO-1 Protein', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Ubiquitin Thiolesterase', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases', 'Ubiquitin-Specific Peptidase 7', 'Ubiquitins/metabolism']",1998/07/11 00:00,1998/07/11 00:01,['1998/07/11 00:00'],"['1998/07/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/11 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.72.8.6581-6591.1998 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1998 Aug;72(8):6581-91. doi: 10.1128/JVI.72.8.6581-6591.1998.,"['0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Leupeptins)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Ubiquitins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '155975-72-7 (clasto-lactacystin beta-lactone)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Vmw110 protein, Human herpesvirus 1)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (USP7 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Ubiquitin Thiolesterase)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Ubiquitin-Specific Peptidase 7)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'RF1P63GW3K (benzyloxycarbonylleucyl-leucyl-leucine aldehyde)']",,,,,PMC109835,,,,,,,,,

In the present studies, we used Friend virus as a model to analyze characteristics of a live-attenuated vaccine in protection against virus-induced disease. Highly susceptible mice were immunized with nonpathogenic Friend murine leukemia helper virus (F-MuLV), which replicates poorly in adult mice. Further attenuation of the vaccine virus was achieved by crossing the Fv-1 genetic resistance barrier. The minimum dose of vaccine virus required to protect 100% of the mice against challenge with pathogenic Friend virus complex was determined to be 10(3) focus-forming units of attenuated virus. Live vaccine virus was necessary for induction of immunity, since inactivated F-MuLV did not induce protection. To determine whether immune cells mediated protection, spleen cells from vaccinated donor mice were adoptively transferred into syngeneic recipients. The results indicated that immune mechanisms rather than viral interference mediated protection.","['Dittmer, U', 'Brooks, D M', 'Hasenkrug, K J']","['Dittmer U', 'Brooks DM', 'Hasenkrug KJ']","['Laboratory of Persistent Viral Diseases, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Hamilton, Montana 59840, USA. udittmer@atlas.niaid.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/immunology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/*prevention & control', 'Mice', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Retroviridae Infections/immunology/*prevention & control', 'Spleen/cytology/immunology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/immunology/*prevention & control', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines, Attenuated/immunology', 'Viral Vaccines/*immunology', 'Viremia/immunology/prevention & control']",1998/07/11 00:00,1998/07/11 00:01,['1998/07/11 00:00'],"['1998/07/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/11 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.72.8.6554-6558.1998 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1998 Aug;72(8):6554-8. doi: 10.1128/JVI.72.8.6554-6558.1998.,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Vaccines, Attenuated)', '0 (Viral Vaccines)']",,,,,PMC109828,,,,,,,,,

To resolve this controversy, we have performed quantitative biochemical analyses on gp70-Pr15E complexes formed after independent expression of the amphotropic and ecotropic Moloney MLV env genes in BHK-21 cells. We found that all cell-associated gp70 molecules are disulfide linked to Pr15E whereas only a small amount of free gp70 is released by the cells. The complexes were resistant to treatment with reducing agents in vivo, indicating that the presence and stability of the disulfide interaction between gp70 and Pr15E are not dependent on the cellular redox state. However, disulfide-bonded Env complexes were disrupted in lysates of nonalkylated cells in a time-, temperature-, and pH-dependent fashion. Disruption seemed not to be caused by a cellular factor but is probably due to a thiol-disulfide exchange reaction occurring within the Env complex after solubilization. The possibility that alkylating agents induce the formation of the intersubunit disulfide linkage was excluded by showing that disulfide-linked gp70-Pr15E complexes exist in freshly made lysates of nonalkylated cells and that disruption of the complexes can be prevented by lowering the pH. Together, these data establish that gp70 and Pr15E form a stable disulfide-linked complex in vivo.","['Opstelten, D J', 'Wallin, M', 'Garoff, H']","['Opstelten DJ', 'Wallin M', 'Garoff H']","['Department for Biosciences at Novum, Karolinska Institute, S-141 57 Huddinge, Sweden.

In this study, an HIV-2 molecular clone that is infectious but apathogenic in macaques was used to first define cis-acting regions that can be deleted to prevent HIV-2 genomic encapsidation and replication without inhibiting viral gene expression. Lentivirus encapsidation determinants are complex and incompletely defined; for HIV-2, some deletions between the major 5' splice donor and the gag open reading frame have been shown to minimally affect encapsidation and replication. We find that a larger deletion (61 to 75 nucleotides) abrogates encapsidation and replication but does not diminish mRNA expression. This deletion was incorporated into a replication-defective, envelope-pseudotyped, three-plasmid HIV-2 lentivirus vector system that supplies HIV-2 Gag/Pol and accessory proteins in trans from an HIV-2 packaging plasmid. The HIV-2 vectors efficiently transduced marker genes into human T and monocytoid cell lines and, in contrast to a murine leukemia virus-based vector, into growth-arrested HeLa cells and terminally differentiated human macrophages and NTN2 neurons. Vector DNA could be detected in HIV-2 vector-transduced nondividing CD34(+) CD38(-) human hematopoietic progenitor cells but not in those cells transduced with murine vectors.

By using amino acid alignment methods, the NH2 and COOH termini of the RT, RNase H (RH), and integrase (IN) domains of the Pol polyprotein were determined. The HTLV-1 RT seems to be unique since its NH2 terminus is probably encoded by the pro open reading frame (ORF) fused downstream, via a transframe peptide, to the polypeptide encoded by the pol ORF. The HTLV-1 Pol amino acid sequence was revealed to be highly similar to that of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV), particularly at the RT-RH hinge region. These two domains remain linked for RSV; this may also be the case for HTLV-1. In light of these results, RT, RT-RH, and RT-RH-IN genes were constructed and introduced into His-tagged protein expression vectors. The corresponding proteins were synthesized in vitro, and the DNA polymerase activities of different protein combinations were tested.

However, this activity was observed in cells transfected to express US28 and might not correspond to the actual role of the protein in the CMV life cycle. Expression of US28 allows human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) entry into certain CD4(+) cells and their fusion with cells expressing HIV-1 envelope (Env) proteins. Such properties were initially reported for the cellular chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR4, which behave as CD4-associated HIV-1 coreceptors. We found that coexpression of US28 and either CXCR4 or CCR5 in CD4(+) cells resulted in enhanced synctium formation with HIV-1 Env+ cells. This positive effect of US28 on cell fusion seems to be distinct from its HIV-1 coreceptor activity. Indeed, enhancement of cell fusion was also observed when US28 was expressed on the HIV-1 Env+ cells instead of an CD4(+) target cells. Furthermore, US28 could enhance cell fusion mediated by other viral proteins, in particular, the G protein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G). The HIV-1 coreceptor and fusion-enhancing activities could be affected by mutations in different domains of US28. The fusion-enhancing activity of US28 seems to be cell type dependent. Indeed, cells coexpressing VSV-G and US28 fused more efficiently with human, simian, or feline target cells, while US28 had no apparent effect on fusion with the three mouse or rat cell lines tested. The positive effect of US28 on cell fusion might therefore require its interaction with a cell-specific factor.

We demonstrate that these particles can be made infectious in an in vitro, cell-free system by the addition of a surrogate envelope protein, the G spike glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G). The appearance of infectivity is accompanied by physical association of the G protein with the immature, noninfectious virus particles. Similarly, exposure in vitro of wild-type VSV-G to a fusion-defective pseudotyped virus containing a mutant VSV-G markedly increases the infectivity of the virus to titers similar to those of conventional VSV-G pseudotyped viruses. Furthermore, similar treatment of an amphotropic murine leukemia virus significantly allows infection of BHK cells not otherwise susceptible to infection with native amphotropic virus. The partially cell-free virus maturation system reported here should be useful for studies aimed at the preparation of tissue-targeted retrovirus vectors and will also aid in studies of nucleocapsid-envelope interactions during budding and of virus assembly and virus-receptor interactions during virus uptake into infected cells.

Only a small percentage of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1)-transformed cells carry p53 mutations, and mutated p53 genes have been found in only one-fourth of adult T-cell leukemia cases. In previous studies, we demonstrated that wild-type p53 is stabilized and transcriptionally inactive in HTLV-1-transformed cells. Further, the viral transcriptional activator Tax plays a role in both the stabilization and inactivation of p53 through a mechanism involving the first 52 amino acids of p53. Here we show for the first time that phosphorylation of p53 inactivates p53 by blocking its interaction with basal transcription factors. Using two-dimensional peptide mapping, we demonstrate that peptides corresponding to amino acids 1 to 19 and 387 to 393 are hyperphosphorylated in HTLV-1-transformed cells. Moreover, using antibodies specific for phosphorylated Ser15 and Ser392, we demonstrate increased phosphorylation of these amino acids. Since HTLV-1 p53 binds DNA in a sequence-specific manner but fails to interact with TFIID, we tested whether phosphorylation of the N terminus of p53 affected p53-TFIID interaction. Using biotinylated peptides, we show that phosphorylation of Ser15 alone inhibits p53-TFIID interaction. In contrast, phosphorylation at Ser15 and -37 restores TFIID binding and blocks MDM2 binding. Our studies provide evidence that HTLV-1 utilizes the posttranslational modification of p53 in vivo to inactivate function of the tumor suppressor protein.","['Pise-Masison, C A', 'Radonovich, M', 'Sakaguchi, K', 'Appella, E', 'Brady, J N']","['Pise-Masison CA', 'Radonovich M', 'Sakaguchi K', 'Appella E', 'Brady JN']","['Virus Tumor Biology Section, Laboratory of Receptor Biology and Gene Expression, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-5055, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,,"['Binding Sites', 'Cell Line, Transformed', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2', 'Serine/metabolism', 'Transcription Factor TFIID', 'Transcription Factors, TFII/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/chemistry/*metabolism']",1998/07/11 00:00,1998/07/11 00:01,['1998/07/11 00:00'],"['1998/07/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/11 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.72.8.6348-6355.1998 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1998 Aug;72(8):6348-55. doi: 10.1128/JVI.72.8.6348-6355.1998.,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factor TFIID)', '0 (Transcription Factors, TFII)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",,,,,PMC109779,,,,,,,,,

The incorporation of exogenous sulfatide into the plasma membrane of HT-29 (a CD4-/GalCer+/CXCR4+ human intestinal cell line) or RD (CD4-/GalCer-/ CXCR4+ human rhabdomyosarcoma) resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of HIV-1 infection. Experiments with luciferase reporter viruses pseudotyped with HIV-1 or amphotropic murine leukemia virus envelopes demonstrated that sulfatide acts at the level of viral entry. Paradoxically, the transfer of sulfatide in the plasma membrane of various CD4- cells resulted in increased binding of HIV-1. Surface pressure measurements were conducted to study the interaction of gp120 with glycosphingolipid monolayers. The data showed that gp120 could penetrate into a monomolecular film of GalCer, confirming the role of this glycosphingolipid as a functional receptor for HIV-1. In contrast, the insertion of gp120 into a monolayer of sulfatide was very limited. Moreover, the incorporation of sulfatide in a monomolecular film of GalCer specifically inhibited the penetration of gp120. In conclusion, these data show that sulfatide mediates gp120 binding but, in marked contrast with GalCer, is not able to initiate the fusion event.","['Fantini, J', 'Hammache, D', 'Delezay, O', 'Pieroni, G', 'Tamalet, C', 'Yahi, N']","['Fantini J', 'Hammache D', 'Delezay O', 'Pieroni G', 'Tamalet C', 'Yahi N']","['Laboratoire de Biochimie et Biologie de la Nutrition, CNRS ESA 6033, Faculte des Sciences St. Jerome, Marseille, France.

The screening of single cell cDNA libraries derived from hematopoietic progenitors also showed the presence of RARalpha and, to a lesser extent, RARgamma transcripts in committed granulocyte (colony-forming unit-granulocyte [CFU-G]) or granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) colony-forming cells. The contribution of RARalpha1 and gamma to hematopoietic cell differentiation was therefore investigated in mice bearing targeted disruption of either one or both of these loci. Because RARgamma and RARalpha1gamma compound null mutants die shortly after birth, bone marrow cells were collected from fetuses at 18.5 days postcoitum (dpc) and evaluated for growth and differentiation in culture in the presence of Steel factor (SF), interleukin-3 (IL-3), and erythropoietin (Epo). The frequency of colony-forming cells from bone marrow populations derived from RARalpha1/gamma double null mice was not significantly different from that of RARgamma or RARalpha1 single nulls or from wild-type controls. In addition, the distribution of erythroid, granulocyte, and macrophage colonies was comparable between hematopoietic cells from all groups, suggesting that lineage commitment was not affected by the lack of RARalpha1 and/or RARgamma. Colony cells were then harvested individually and evaluated by morphologic criteria. While terminal granulocyte differentiation was evident in wild-type cells and colonies from either single null mutant, colonies derived from RARalpha1-/-gamma-/- bone marrow populations were blocked at the myelocyte and, to a lesser extent, at the metamyelocyte stages, whereas erythroid and macrophage differentiation was not affected. Together, these results indicate that both RARalpha1 and gamma are required for terminal maturation in the granulocytic lineage in vitro, but appear to be dispensable for the early stages of hematopoietic cell development. Our results raise the possibility that in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), the RARalpha fusion proteins cause differentiation arrest at a stage when further maturation requires not only RARalpha, but also RARgamma. Finally, bone marrow cells appear to differentiate normally in vivo, suggesting an effective compensation mechanism in the RARalpha1/gamma double null mice.","['Labrecque, J', 'Allan, D', 'Chambon, P', 'Iscove, N N', 'Lohnes, D', 'Hoang, T']","['Labrecque J', 'Allan D', 'Chambon P', 'Iscove NN', 'Lohnes D', 'Hoang T']","['Clinical Research Institute of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Lineage/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Granulocytes/*cytology', 'Hematopoiesis/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*physiology', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha']",1998/07/10 00:00,1998/07/10 00:01,['1998/07/10 00:00'],"['1998/07/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57102-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Jul 15;92(2):607-15.,"['0 (Rara protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (retinoic acid receptor gamma)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All cases were well characterized as to the morphologic, cytochemical, and immunologic features, according to the European Group for the Immunological Classification of Leukemias (EGIL). The cases included 1,103 acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 819 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 11 biphenotypic acute leukemia (BAL), and 4 undifferentiated (AUL). c-kit was expressed in 741 (67%) AML cases, regardless of the French-American-British (FAB) subtype, one third of BAL, all four AUL, but only in 34 (4%) of ALL cases. The minority of c-kit+ ALL cases were classified as: T-cell lineage (two thirds), mainly pro-T-ALL or T-I, and B lineage (one third); cells from 62% of these ALL cases coexpressed other myeloid markers (CD13, CD33, or both). There were no differences in the frequency of c-kit+ AML or ALL cases according to age being similar in the adult and pediatric groups. Our findings demonstrate that c-kit is a reliable and specific marker to detect leukemia cells committed to the myeloid lineage, and therefore should be included in a routine basis for the diagnosis of acute leukemias to demonstrate myeloid commitment of the blasts. c-kit expression should score higher, at least one point, in the system currently applied to the diagnosis of BAL, as its myeloid specificity is greater than CD13 and CD33. Findings in ALL and AUL suggest that c-kit identifies a subgroup of cases, which may correspond to leukemias either arising from early prothymocytes and/or early hematopoietic cells, both able to differentiate to the lymphoid and myeloid pathways.","['Bene, M C', 'Bernier, M', 'Casasnovas, R O', 'Castoldi, G', 'Knapp, W', 'Lanza, F', 'Ludwig, W D', 'Matutes, E', 'Orfao, A', 'Sperling, C', ""van't Veer, M B""]","['Bene MC', 'Bernier M', 'Casasnovas RO', 'Castoldi G', 'Knapp W', 'Lanza F', 'Ludwig WD', 'Matutes E', 'Orfao A', 'Sperling C', ""van't Veer MB""]","[""GEIL-Laboratoire d'Immunologie, Faculte de Medicine, Nancy, France.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', '*Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*diagnosis/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*analysis', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",1998/07/10 00:00,1998/07/10 00:01,['1998/07/10 00:00'],"['1998/07/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57100-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Jul 15;92(2):596-9.,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We now report that exposure of malignant cells from 50 different patients with AML for 48 hours in culture to DT388-GMCSF reduces by a median of 1.6 logs (range, 0 to 3.7 logs) the number of leukemic cells capable of forming colonies in semisolid media (leukemic colony-forming cells [CFU-L]) with a median IC50 of 3 x 10(-12) mol/L (range, 5 to >4,000 x 10(-12) mol/L). Furthermore, the cell kill is dependent on the presence of high-affinity GM-CSF receptors on leukemic blasts, because CFU-L from 27 of 28 AML samples expressing > or = 35 GM-CSF receptors per cell were inhibited by the toxin, whereas the colony growth from all 4 leukemic samples (2 AML, 1 acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL], and 1 prolymphocytic leukemia [PLL]) that had less than 35 receptors per cell was unaffected by the drug. Sensitivity of CFU-L to DT388-GMCSF was seen regardless of the clinical responsiveness of the patient's leukemia to standard chemotherapy agents. In contrast, clonogenic cells from normal bone marrow formed colonies at near control numbers after exposure to much higher toxin concentrations (4 x 10(-9) mol/L) than those required to kill CFU-L from most patients. Thus, leukemic progenitors isolated directly from the peripheral blood of most AML patients show the same sensitivity to DT388-GMCSF as previously demonstrated for AML cell lines. Under the same conditions of exposure, normal hematopoietic progenitors are relatively unaffected by DT388-GMCSF, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic agent in AML.","['Hogge, D E', 'Willman, C L', 'Kreitman, R J', 'Berger, M', 'Hall, P D', 'Kopecky, K J', 'McLain, C', 'Tagge, E P', 'Eaves, C J', 'Frankel, A E']","['Hogge DE', 'Willman CL', 'Kreitman RJ', 'Berger M', 'Hall PD', 'Kopecky KJ', 'McLain C', 'Tagge EP', 'Eaves CJ', 'Frankel AE']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Diphtheria Toxin/genetics/*toxicity', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics/*toxicity', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/biosynthesis', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/toxicity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/07/10 00:00,1998/07/10 00:01,['1998/07/10 00:00'],"['1998/07/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57099-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Jul 15;92(2):589-95.,"['0 (Diphtheria Toxin)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,"['CA 12213/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA76178/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Importantly, in 33% of AML and in 47% of the ALL cases with cytogenetic data, submicroscopic chromosomal aberrations or masked translocations were shown that were not detected in the cytogenetic analysis either for structural reasons or because of an insufficient number of metaphases obtained.

In addition, we have shown that Stat1alpha, but not Stat3, is involved in EPO-induced cellular proliferation. In this study, we examined the roles of Stat1alpha and Stat3 in EPO-induced erythroid differentiation. UT-7/GM was used as a model system, because this cell line can differentiate into erythroid-lineage cells with EPO treatment (Komatsu et al, Blood 89:4021, 1997). We found that EPO did not activate Stat1alpha or Stat3 in UT-7/GM cells. Transfection experiments showed that both Stat1alpha and Stat3 inhibited the induction by EPO of gamma-globin and erythroid-specific 5-aminolevulinate synthetase transcripts, resulting in a reduction of the percentage of hemoglobin-positive cells. Dominant negative forms of Stat1alpha or Stat3 promoted the EPO-induced erythroid differentiation of UT-7/GM cells, even in the presence of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, although this cytokine never induced erythroid differentiation of the parent UT-7/GM cells with or without EPO. A cell cycle analysis showed that the constitutive activation of Stat1alpha, but not Stat3, shortened the period of G0/G1 prolongation caused by EPO stimulation.

However, the role of individual PKC isoforms in apoptosis is poorly defined. Therefore, we investigated the translocation of individual PKC isoforms during radiation-induced apoptosis with and without rescue from apoptosis by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in the human erythroleukemia cell line TF-1. PKCalpha was translocated from the particulate to cytosolic fraction of TF-1 cells within 5 minutes of treatment with apoptosis-inducing levels of ionizing radiation. However, this postirradiation translocation did not occur when cells were rescued from apoptosis by GM-CSF. Furthermore, treatment of cells with Go 6976, an inhibitor of classical PKC isoforms, abrogated the rescue effect of GM-CSF. The calcium-independent novel PKC isoform, PKCalpha appeared to be degraded in both the particulate and cytosolic fractions of TF-1 cells after treatment with apoptosis-inducing levels of ionizing radiation in either the presence or absence of GM-CSF rescue. Levels of ceramide, a lipid mediator of apoptosis, were measured at 2, 4, 8, 10, and 60 minutes after treatment with ionizing radiation and were substantially reduced in TF-1 cells rescued from apoptosis by GM-CSF compared with apoptotic TF-1 cells. The largest decrease in ceramide production seen was at 4 minutes postirradiation, with a 46% reduction in ceramide levels in TF-1 cells rescued from apoptosis by GM-CSF compared with those in apoptotic TF-1 cells. Because ceramide has been shown to affect PKCalpha subcellular distribution, these data implicate a role for ceramide in mediating the rapid postirradiation translocation and inhibition of PKCalpha in TF-1 cells not rescued from apoptosis by GM-CSF. Expression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 doubled in TF-1 cells rescued from apoptosis by GM-CSF, but did not increase in unrescued cells. Our findings suggest that activated PKCalpha and increased expression of Bcl-2 after gamma irradiation determine survival in TF-1 cells rescued from apoptosis with GM-CSF and that PKCalpha plays a role in mediating signals involved in sensing cellular damage and/or regulation of cell damage repair.","['Kelly, M L', 'Tang, Y', 'Rosensweig, N', 'Clejan, S', 'Beckman, B S']","['Kelly ML', 'Tang Y', 'Rosensweig N', 'Clejan S', 'Beckman BS']","['Interdisciplinary Program in Molecular and Cellular Biology, Tulane University, New Orleans, LA 70112, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/*radiation effects', 'Carbazoles/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/07/10 00:00,1998/07/10 00:01,['1998/07/10 00:00'],"['1998/07/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57080-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Jul 15;92(2):416-24.,"['0 (Carbazoles)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Indoles)', '136194-77-9 (Go 6976)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We therefore intensified intrathecal chemotherapy (simultaneously administered methotrexate, hydrocortisone, and cytarabine) for 165 consecutive children with newly diagnosed ALL enrolled in Total Therapy Study XIIIA from December 1991 to August 1994. The 64 patients (39%) who had 1 or more blast cells in cytocentrifuged preparations of cerebrospinal fluid at diagnosis, with or without associated higher-risk features, received additional doses of intrathecal chemotherapy during remission induction and the first year of continuation treatment. Patients with higher-risk leukemia, regardless of cerebrospinal fluid findings, also received additional doses of intrathecal chemotherapy during the first year of continuation treatment. Cranial irradiation was reserved for patients with higher-risk leukemia (22% of the total). The 5-year cumulative risk of an isolated CNS relapse among all 165 patients was 1.2% (95% confidence interval, 0% to 2.9%), whereas that of any CNS relapse was 3.2% (0. 4% to 6.0%). The probability of surviving for 5 years without an adverse event of any type was 80.2% +/- 9.2% (SE).

Most studies support the view that treatment with IFN-alpha results in prolonged survival compared with hydroxyurea therapy. Some patients are offered URD transplantation as a second-line treatment; however, the impact of pretransplant IFN-alpha on the outcome of URD transplantation is uncertain. To address this question, we evaluated the effect of pretransplant IFN-alpha therapy in 184 patients undergoing URD transplantation for CML in CP at a single center. Of the 184 patients, 114 did not receive IFN-alpha, whereas 22, 23, and 25 patients received IFN-alpha for, respectively, 1 to 5, 6 to 12, and more than 12 months before transplant. Pretransplant IFN-alpha therapy administered for > or = 6 months was associated with an increased risk of severe (grades III-IV) acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD; relative risk [RR], 3.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4 to 6.2; P = .004) and mortality (RR, 2. 1; 95% CI, 1.3 to 3.5; P = .003) relative to less than 6 months or no IFN-alpha therapy. Increased mortality occurred between 100 and 365 days after transplant (P = .005), was limited to patients with severe acute GVHD, and was due to chronic GVHD refractory to immunosuppressive therapy. Other variables associated with mortality included HLA-DRB1 or DQB1 (but not HLA-A or B) mismatched donors, age greater than 50 years, weight > or = 110% of ideal body weight, and the absence of cytomegalovirus (CMV) or fungal prophylaxis. For patients treated with IFN-alpha for less than 6 months before transplant, who were < or = 50 years of age, received a HLA-A, B, DRB1, and DQB1 matched URD transplant, and received CMV and fungal prophylaxis after transplant (n = 48), survival was 87% +/- 5% at 5 years.

ATRA probably induces differentiation of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells by binding to the E-domain of the RARalpha portion (RARalpha /E-domain) of PML/RARalpha chimeric protein. Therefore, molecular alteration in the RARalpha /E-domain of the chimeric gene is one mechanism by which patients with APL may acquire resistance to ATRA therapy. In this study using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and single-strand conformation polymorphism, DNA segments amplified from the RARalpha /E-domain in fresh APL cells of 23 APL patients (8 males and 15 females from 4 to 76 years of age) were screened for mutations. Of those patients, 3 patients (1 with de novo and 2 with relapse) had clinical resistance to ATRA therapy. We found mutations in the RARalpha /E-domain of PML/RARalpha chimeric gene exclusively in the 2 patients who exhibited ATRA-resistance at relapse, whereas the mutations were not detected at their initial onset. Interestingly, these patients received a prolonged or intermittent administration of ATRA before relapse with ATRA-resistance. The mutations lead to the change of amino acid in the ligand-binding region of RARalpha /E-domain, Arg272Gln, or Met297Leu according to the amino acid sequence of RARalpha, respectively. Further study demonstrated that the in vitro ligand-dependent transcriptional activity of the mutant PML/RARalpha protein was significantly decreased as compared with that of wild-type PML/RARalpha. These findings suggest that mutations in the RARalpha /E-domain of the PML/RARalpha chimeric gene may confer clinical resistance to ATRA therapy in patients with APL.","['Imaizumi, M', 'Suzuki, H', 'Yoshinari, M', 'Sato, A', 'Saito, T', 'Sugawara, A', 'Tsuchiya, S', 'Hatae, Y', 'Fujimoto, T', 'Kakizuka, A', 'Konno, T', 'Iinuma, K']","['Imaizumi M', 'Suzuki H', 'Yoshinari M', 'Sato A', 'Saito T', 'Sugawara A', 'Tsuchiya S', 'Hatae Y', 'Fujimoto T', 'Kakizuka A', 'Konno T', 'Iinuma K']","['Department of Pediatrics, Tohoku University School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan. mimaizuma@ped.med.tohoku.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/genetics', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",1998/07/10 00:00,1998/07/10 00:01,['1998/07/10 00:00'],"['1998/07/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57074-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Jul 15;92(2):374-82.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These genes encode two homologous proteins, p13(MTCP1) and p14(TCL1), which share no similarity with other known protein. To determine the oncogenic role of MTCP1, mice transgenic for MTCP1 under the control of CD2 regulatory regions (CD2-p13 mice) were generated. No abnormality was detected during the first year after birth. A late effect of the transgene was searched for in a cohort of 48 CD2-p13 mice aged 15 to 20 months, issued from 3 independent founders. Lymphoid hemopathies, occurring in the three transgenic lines, were characterized by lymphoid cells with an irregular nucleus, a unique and prominent nucleolus, condensed chromatin, a basophilic cytoplasm devoid of granules, and an immunophenotype of mature T cells. The molecular characterization of Tcrb rearrangements demonstrated the monoclonal origin of these populations. Histopathological analysis of the cohort demonstrated early splenic and hepatic infiltrations, whereas lymphocytosis and medullar infiltrations were found infrequently. The engraftment of these proliferations in H2-matched animals demonstrated their malignant nature. Cumulative incidence of the disease at 20 months was 100%, 50%, and 21% in F3, F4, and F7 lines, respectively, and null in the control group.

To assess the possible role of DNA-dependent protein kinase in effecting this phosphorylation, both DNA end-joining and DNA-stimulated phosphorylation were examined in the presence of various inhibitors. Linear but not supercoiled DNA stimulated the phosphorylation of several endogenous proteins in the extracts, including species of approximately 48, 87, and 96 kDa. This phosphorylation was selectively suppressed by the kinase inhibitors wortmannin, dimethylaminopurine, and LY294002, with a dose response that in each case paralleled the inhibition of DNA end-joining. If wortmannin was added while the end-joining reaction was in progress, end-joining of DNA already present in the reaction continued for some time, but newly added DNA was not joined or processed at all. Ends with 3'-hydroxyl termini were joined much faster than those with 3'-phosphoglycolate termini, although both were equally effective in stimulating protein phosphorylation. The results support a role for DNA-dependent protein kinase in regulating end-joining in vitro, and suggest that at least one of the necessary phosphorylations involves a protein bound at or near the DNA end to be joined. In contrast, nuclear extracts from human cells joined double-strand breaks with normal but not modified termini, and the joining was unaffected by kinase inhibitors, suggesting that the dominant mechanism of end-joining in these extracts did not involve DNA-PK.","['Gu, X Y', 'Weinfeld, M A', 'Povirk, L F']","['Gu XY', 'Weinfeld MA', 'Povirk LF']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Medical College of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'DNA/*metabolism', '*DNA Damage', '*DNA Repair', 'DNA-Activated Protein Kinase', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Ovum/enzymology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenopus laevis']",1998/07/10 00:00,1998/07/10 00:01,['1998/07/10 00:00'],"['1998/07/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/10 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1021/bi980198o [doi]', 'bi980198o [pii]']",ppublish,Biochemistry. 1998 Jul 7;37(27):9827-35. doi: 10.1021/bi980198o.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (DNA-Activated Protein Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (PRKDC protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",,,['CA40615/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

The ALVE proviruses are known to modulate physiological processes of the host birds. Different ALVE elements retain variable portions of the complete, prototype viral genome, and each provirus resides in its own specific location within the host genome. Thus, each ALVE element has its own particular potential to modulate host physiology depending on the nature of its integration site, the completeness of the proviral genome, and the level of expression of the locus. It is important, therefore, to be able to establish the ALVE element profiles of chickens quickly and accurately, both in the laboratory and in a commercial setting.

To clarify the mechanisms of thrombocytosis, we studied serum levels of thrombopoietin (TPO) and other thrombopoietic cytokines in 40 patients with KD (149 samples) and 106 age-matched controls using ELISA. TPO values in the controls were 1.94 +/- 0.69 fmol/ml (mean +/- SD) with a 95% reference interval of 0.85 to 3.27 fmol/ml.

When platelet counts peaked in the second to third weeks, TPO levels were still high or comparable with the controls. TPO levels in KD patients with normal platelet counts were significantly higher than control levels. Interleukin (IL)-6 levels in the first week rose, but neither IL-11 nor leukemia inhibitory factor was detectable.

Comparison of seven mitochondrion-specific fluorochromes.,157-63,"It is commonly accepted that mitochondria undergo major changes early during the apoptotic process and that these alterations are critical for the death/life decision. Here we report that Jurkat T cell leukemia cells exhibit a perturbed incorporation of potential-sensitive fluorochromes. After 6 h of CD95/Fas/APO-1 crosslinking, a significant fraction of still normal-sized Jurkat cells exhibit a decreased incorporation of three different cationic lipophilic dyes commonly used for the quantitation of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (deltapsi(m)): DiOC6(3), chloromethyl-X-rosamine, and tetramethylrhodaminemethylester. In contrast, upon induction of apoptosis, cells tend to exhibit an increase in the fluorescence obtained with rhodamine 123. The increased rhodamine 123 fluorescence into cells undergoing apoptosis is not affected by labeling in the presence of the protonophore m-chlorophenylhydrazone and thus cannot be attributed to a change in the deltapsi(m). Six hours after CD95 ligation no changes are found among normal-sized cells in the incorporation of mitotracker green and nonylacridine orange, which both measure mitochondrial mass. However, a fraction of cells exhibit an increased staining with the Apo2.7 antibody which detects a mitochondrial antigen generated during apoptosis. These findings underline the importance of using adequate fluorochromes for the quantitation of mitochondrial changes occurring during early apoptosis. Moreover, they cast doubts on those studies that, using rhodamine 123, hypothesized that apoptosis would be associated with a stable or increased deltapsi(m).","['Metivier, D', 'Dallaporta, B', 'Zamzami, N', 'Larochette, N', 'Susin, S A', 'Marzo, I', 'Kroemer, G']","['Metivier D', 'Dallaporta B', 'Zamzami N', 'Larochette N', 'Susin SA', 'Marzo I', 'Kroemer G']","['Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Unite Propre de Recherche 420, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Immunol Lett,Immunology letters,7910006,IM,,"['Aldehydes', 'Aminoacridines', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/metabolism', '*Apoptosis', 'Carbocyanines', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Fluorescence', '*Fluorescent Dyes', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Mitochondria/*physiology', 'Organic Chemicals', 'Rhodamine 123', 'Rhodamines', 'fas Receptor/pharmacology/*physiology']",1998/07/10 00:00,1998/07/10 00:01,['1998/07/10 00:00'],"['1998/07/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/10 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0165-2478(98)00013-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-2478(98)00013-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Immunol Lett. 1998 Apr;61(2-3):157-63. doi: 10.1016/s0165-2478(98)00013-3.,"['0 (Aldehydes)', '0 (Aminoacridines)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Carbocyanines)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Organic Chemicals)', '0 (Rhodamines)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '0 (mitotracker green FM)', '0 (red dye CMXRos)', '1N3CZ14C5O (Rhodamine 123)', ""54501-79-0 (3,3'-dihexyl-2,2'-oxacarbocyanine)"", '62669-72-1 (tetramethylrhodamine)', '81650-07-9 (10-N-nonylacridinium orange)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously shown that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration induces hypothalamic and pituitary LIF expression in vivo, which is associated with the acute rise in circulating adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) levels. As AtT-20 cells respond to LIF, we established murine LIF (mLIF) stably transfected AtT-20 cell lines to study LIF regulation of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) expression and ACTH secretion. Our results show that mLIF transfectants accumulated mLIF (up to 15.6 +/- 3.2 ng/mL after 24 h) as well as increased ACTH secretion (up to 2.4-fold above control cells) in conditioned medium. The magnitude of ACTH induction correlated with mLIF concentrations in different transfectants (r = 0.75-0.88, p < 0.05). Moreover, mLIF transfectants showed a higher sensitivity to CRH stimulation with an increased ACTH production within 8 h (p < 0.05), whereas control cells were responsive to CRH at 24 h. Additionally, mLIF transfectants exhibited a maximum threefold ACTH induction, compared to 1.7-fold in control cells. Furthermore, mLIF transfectants have a blunted dexamethasone-mediated inhibition of ACTH (35% inhibition in control cells vs no inhibition in mLIF-transfected cells at 24 h). These findings support and extend the previous observations of LIF acting at the pituitary level, and indicate that mLIF stably-transfected AtT-20 cells are a useful model for studying mLIF-mediated gene regulation in pituicytes.","['Li, Q L', 'Yano, H', 'Ren, S G', 'Li, X', 'Friedman, T C', 'Melmed, S']","['Li QL', 'Yano H', 'Ren SG', 'Li X', 'Friedman TC', 'Melmed S']","['Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Research Institute-UCLA School of Medicine, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Endocrine,Endocrine,9434444,IM,,"['Adrenocorticotropic Hormone/metabolism', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Line', 'Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone/blood', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Growth Inhibitors/*biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Pro-Opiomelanocortin/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Radioimmunoassay', 'Transfection']",1998/07/10 00:00,1998/07/10 00:01,['1998/07/10 00:00'],"['1998/07/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02801326 [doi]'],ppublish,Endocrine. 1997 Dec;7(3):325-30. doi: 10.1007/BF02801326.,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '66796-54-1 (Pro-Opiomelanocortin)', '9002-60-2 (Adrenocorticotropic Hormone)', '9015-71-8 (Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone)']",,,"['DA-00276/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'DK-287235/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK-50238/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

The vincristine (2 mg in 10 mL diluent) was inadvertently injected into her Ommaya reservoir. Within 10 minutes, the error was realized. Despite optimal care, nausea and vomiting developed the first night, followed sequentially by coarse tremor, disorientation, horizontal nystagmus, and stupor. Her mental status waxed and waned until day 9, at which time she became responsive only to noxious stimuli. By day 11, she was deeply comatose and on day 40 she died without regaining any neurological function. CONCLUSION: Despite aggressive and immediate therapy, intraventricular vincristine infusion produced neurologic toxicity, with progressive loss of mental function, followed by coma and death.

The bcl-2 related genes have been shown to contribute to either the inhibition or induction of apoptosis in a variety of neoplasms; therefore, it was hypothesized that the expression of these genes might contribute to malignant transformation in ovarian surface epithelial tumors. The expression of bcl-2 family proteins was investigated in 28 ovarian surface epithelial tumors, including serous and mucinous benign, borderline, and malignant tumors by immunohistochemical staining with antibodies to bcl-2, bax, bcl-X, and mcl-1 proteins. Staining intensity was scored on a 1+ to 3+ scale and the benign, borderline, and malignant tumors were compared. Significantly less immunoreactive bcl-2 and bcl-X proteins were present in malignant serous tumors compared to their benign counterparts. No difference was seen in immunostaining for bax or mcl-1 when benign, borderline, or malignant serous tumors were compared. In the mucinous tumors, no differences were seen in immunostaining for any of the bcl-2 family proteins between tumor types. The loss of expression of the antiapoptotic proto-oncogenes bcl-2 or bcl-X in serous carcinomas compared to benign serous tumors, together with previous demonstrations that the presence of bcl-2 in ovarian surface epithelial cancers is a favorable prognostic indicator, suggests that bcl-2 and bcl-X have biological functions in the ovary other than inducing apoptosis, acting instead as tumor suppressor proteins.","['Wehrli, B M', 'Krajewski, S', 'Gascoyne, R D', 'Reed, J C', 'Gilks, C B']","['Wehrli BM', 'Krajewski S', 'Gascoyne RD', 'Reed JC', 'Gilks CB']","['Department of Pathology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Gynecol Pathol,International journal of gynecological pathology : official journal of the International Society of Gynecological Pathologists,8214845,IM,,"['*Apoptosis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'Neoplasms, Glandular and Epithelial/*chemistry/pathology', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*chemistry/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'bcl-X Protein']",1998/07/10 00:00,1998/07/10 00:01,['1998/07/10 00:00'],"['1998/07/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00004347-199807000-00010 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Gynecol Pathol. 1998 Jul;17(3):255-60. doi: 10.1097/00004347-199807000-00010.,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results of microscopic evaluation of an aspirate from a splenic nodule were suggestive of lymphosarcoma. The condition of the horse deteriorated, and it was subsequently euthanatized. Postmortem examination revealed diffuse lymphoma. In human beings, generalized pruritus may be an indication of serious internal disease, including malignancy.

In addition to 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecine (SN-38), its active metabolite, we were able to identify several metabolites in the plasma of patients treated with this drug, especially an oxidative metabolite, 7-ethyl-10[4-N-(5-aminopentanoic acid)-1-piperidino] carbonyloxy-camptothecine. During our study of the biosynthesis of 7-ethyl-10[4-N-(5-aminopentanoic acid)-1-piperidino] carbonyloxy-camptothecine from CPT-11 by human liver microsomes, we were able to detect another quantitatively important polar metabolite, which was also present in the plasma and urine of patients treated with CPT-11. On the basis of preliminary experiments, the structure of this compound was postulated to be 7-ethyl-10-(4-amino-1-piperidino)carbonyloxycamptothecine, and this structure was synthesized by Rhone-Poulenc Rorer. Urine samples and human liver microsomal extracts were studied by high-performance liquid chromatography/atmospheric pressure chemical ionization/tandem mass spectrometry to identify its structure formally. The identification of the metabolite was supported by identical retention time, mass-to-charge ratio and tandem mass spectrometry fragmentation as a synthetic standard. Like irinotecan, 7-ethyl-10-(4-amino-1-piperidino) carbonyloxycamptothecine was a weak inhibitor of cell growth of P388 cells in culture (IC50 = 3.4 micrograms/ml vs. 2.8 micrograms/ml for irinotecan and 0.001 microgram/ml for SN-38). It was also a poor inducer of topoisomerase I-DNA cleavable complexes (100-fold less potent than SN-38). However, unlike 7-ethyl-10[4-N-(5-aminopentanoic acid)-1-piperidino] carbonyloxy-camptothecine, this new metabolite could be hydrolyzed to SN-38 by human liver microsomes and purified human liver carboxylesterase, though to a lesser extent than irinotecan. This compound can therefore contribute to the activity and toxicity profile of irinotecan in vivo.","['Dodds, H M', 'Haaz, M C', 'Riou, J F', 'Robert, J', 'Rivory, L P']","['Dodds HM', 'Haaz MC', 'Riou JF', 'Robert J', 'Rivory LP']","['Institut Bergonie, Bordeaux, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/chemistry/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Biotransformation', 'Camptothecin/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Irinotecan', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy/pathology', 'Microsomes, Liver/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/07/10 00:00,1998/07/10 00:01,['1998/07/10 00:00'],"['1998/07/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/10 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 1998 Jul;286(1):578-83.,"['0 (7-ethyl-10-(4-amino-1-piperidino)carbonyloxycamptothecine)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '7673326042 (Irinotecan)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SN was iodinated with the Bolton-Hunter (BH) reagent and purified by isocratic reversed phase chromatography. Specific binding sites for 125I-BHSN were identified on human Mono Mac 6 cells, a monocytic cell line. Scatchard analysis revealed a single class of binding sites with a Kd value of 7.3 nM and a Bmax of 322 (fmol/mg protein). Competition studies demonstrated that the 15 C-terminal amino acids of SN could displace authentic SN, whereas shorter fragments were inactive. Other sensory neuropeptides like substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide or galanin as well as the chemokine receptor ligand Rantes or the typical chemoattractant FMLP could not displace SN. Our studies demonstrate specific high affinity binding sites for SN on a monocytic cell line. Since SN exerts a potent chemotactic activity towards monocytes and increases cytosolic calcium in these cells, these binding sites might well represent a putative functional plasma membrane receptor for SN.","['Schneitler, C', 'Kahler, C', 'Wiedermann, C J', 'Hogue-Angeletti, R', 'Fischer-Colbrie, R']","['Schneitler C', 'Kahler C', 'Wiedermann CJ', 'Hogue-Angeletti R', 'Fischer-Colbrie R']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Neuroimmunol,Journal of neuroimmunology,8109498,IM,,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites/immunology', 'Binding, Competitive/immunology', 'Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Chromogranins/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Galanin/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Iodine Radioisotopes', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Monocytes/*chemistry/cytology/*metabolism', 'Neuroblastoma', 'Neuropeptides/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Radioligand Assay', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/metabolism', 'Secretogranin II', 'Substance P/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/chemistry/drug effects/metabolism']",1998/07/09 02:03,2000/06/01 09:00,['1998/07/09 02:03'],"['1998/07/09 02:03 [pubmed]', '2000/06/01 09:00 [medline]', '1998/07/09 02:03 [entrez]']","['S0165-5728(98)00012-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-5728(98)00012-5 [doi]']",ppublish,J Neuroimmunol. 1998 Jun 1;86(1):87-91. doi: 10.1016/s0165-5728(98)00012-5.,"['0 (Chromogranins)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '0 (Neuropeptides)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Secretogranin II)', '149146-12-3 (secretoneurin)', '33507-63-0 (Substance P)', '88813-36-9 (Galanin)', 'JHB2QIZ69Z (Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have cloned a novel human gene that is highly homologous in the transmembrane and G protein-coupling domains to mouse T-cell death-associated gene 8 (TDAG8). The gene, human TDAG8 (hTDAG8), which belongs to the G protein-couple receptor superfamily, encodes a protein of 337 amino acids. An expressed sequence tag (EST) corresponding to hTDAG8 was identified from a human thyroid cDNA library and subsequently used to isolate a full-length genomic clone. Northern blot analysis revealed that the hTDAG8 gene is expressed predominantly in lymphoid tissues, including peripheral blood leukocytes, spleen, lymph nodes, and thymus. Stably transfected mammalian CHO cells were generated, and heterologous expression of hTDAG8 was confirmed by Northern blot analysis. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) revealed that hTDAG8 maps to human chromosome 14q31-32.1, a region in which abnormalities associated with human T-cell lymphoma or leukemia are found. Taken together, these data implicate the hTDAG8 gene in T-cell-associated diseases in humans, but its actual physiological and pathological role in the human immune system needs further investigation.","['Kyaw, H', 'Zeng, Z', 'Su, K', 'Fan, P', 'Shell, B K', 'Carter, K C', 'Li, Y']","['Kyaw H', 'Zeng Z', 'Su K', 'Fan P', 'Shell BK', 'Carter KC', 'Li Y']","['Human Genome Sciences, Inc., Rockville, MD 20850, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,DNA Cell Biol,DNA and cell biology,9004522,IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Death', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cricetinae', 'Female', 'Gene Library', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Lymphoid Tissue/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Organ Specificity', 'Pregnancy', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*biosynthesis/chemistry/*genetics', '*Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/chemistry', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Thyroid Gland/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection']",1998/07/09 00:00,1998/07/09 00:01,['1998/07/09 00:00'],"['1998/07/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/09 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/dna.1998.17.493 [doi]'],ppublish,DNA Cell Biol. 1998 Jun;17(6):493-500. doi: 10.1089/dna.1998.17.493.,"['0 (GPR65 protein, human)', '0 (GPR65 protein, mouse)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,['GENBANK/U95218'],,,

Classification). Lymphomas were classified according to their presumed normal counterparts, to the extent possible. Within both T- and B-cell categories differentiation between lymphomas and/or leukemias of ""precursor"" or ""peripheral"" neoplasms are defined arising from antigen independend or antigen reactive cell proliferation. Lymphomas undoubtedly characterized by currently available morphologic, immunologic, and genetic technics represent ""real"" disease entities. Provisional categories include lymphomas that have been described in some detail, but without consensus within the ILSG. Proposed names are based predominantly on established usage. With respect to similar treatment approaches and difficulties of the ILSG members in subclassifying large cell lymphomas, centroblastic, immunoblastic and large cell anaplastic lymphomas of B-cell type were ""lumped"" together as large B-cell lymphomas. Within a prospective treatment trial overall survival was significantly better in centroblastic as compared to B-cell immunoblastic lymphoma diagnosed by optimal histomorphology according the criteria of the Kiel Classification. Thus the R.E.A.L. Classification fails to identify patients who may require other than standard treatment. Future studies will demonstrate whether subclassifying the proposed ""peripheral"" T-cell lymphomas, unspecified into T-zone lymphoma, lymphoepitheloid (Lennert's) lymphoma and pleomorphic, small, medium, and large cell lymphomas according the Kiel Classification is of clinicopathologic relevance. On the contrary the subtypes of chronic lymphocytic leukemia of T-cell type form two distinct entities within the R.E.A.L. Classification separating T-CLL/prolymphocytic leukemia from large granular lymphocyte leukemia of T- and NK-cell type. Within the R.E.A.L. Classification the lymphoplasmacytoid immunocytoma of the Kiel Classification will be subsumed together with the prognostically significantly better B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Opposite to the original intention of the ILSG two proposals are developed on clinical grouping of entities. Clinical indolent lymphoid neoplasms usually have ""low grade"" histologic appearances, with a predominance of small cells subsuming with the exception of the mantle cell lymphoma all of the low grade lymphomas of the Kiel classification. Aggressive lymphomas (intermediate risk) are defined as tumors whose survival if untreated is measured in months, highly or very aggressive lymphomas and/or leukemias will kill untreated patients within weeks. Unlike the Kiel Classification proposed categories subsume lymphomas irrespective of cytomorphology, thus grouping together potentially curable and uncurable diseases. Undoubtedly the R.E.A.L. Classification forms at present the best compilation of existing knowledge upon neoplasms of the immune system, enabling cooperation between clinicians and scientists all over the world. According to the ILSG this proposal should be considered a starting point for future periodic reevaluations.","['Meusers, P', 'Brittinger, G']","['Meusers P', 'Brittinger G']","['Abteilung fur Hamatologie, Universitatsklinikum-Gesamthochschule, Essen.']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,Praxis (Bern 1994),Praxis,101468093,IM,,"['Europe', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/classification/diagnosis/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*classification/diagnosis/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/classification/diagnosis/pathology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'United States']",1998/07/09 00:00,1998/07/09 00:01,['1998/07/09 00:00'],"['1998/07/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/09 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/09 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Praxis (Bern 1994). 1998 Jun 3;87(23):793-800.,,R.E.A.L.-Klassifikation der Non-Hodgkin-Lymphome aus klinisch-onkologischer Sicht.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expression of HDC mRNA and the protein was proved by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and by immunoblot, respectively. The role of histamine was studied in proliferation assays in the presence of irreversible inhibitor of the HDC (alpha-fluoromethylhistidine--aFMH) and also by competing for the intracellular binding sites of histamine using N,N-diethyl-2, 4-phenylmethyl-phenoxy-ethanamine-HCl (DPPE). By inhibiting the HDC enzyme activity by FMH and blocking the intracellular action of histamine by DPPE, a significant decrease in cell proliferation was observed in mitogen stimulated lymphocytes of healthy donors. In CLL patients the proliferation of leukemic lymphocytes was significantly inhibited by blocking the binding of histamine to intracellular binding sites by DPPE but not by FMH inhibiting only the de novo histamine formation. The observations suggest that HDC has functional relevance in lymphocytes, since mitogen induced lymphocyte proliferation of healthy donors is mainly enhanced by de novo synthesis and subsequent action of intracellular histamine. Alternatively, in constitutively proliferating chronic lymphoid leukemia cells we suggest that the preformed pool but not the de novo synthesized intracellular histamine interferes with cellular proliferation.","['Bencsath, M', 'Paloczi, K', 'Szalai, C', 'Szenthe, A', 'Szeberenyi, J', 'Falus, A']","['Bencsath M', 'Paloczi K', 'Szalai C', 'Szenthe A', 'Szeberenyi J', 'Falus A']","['Semmelweis University of Medicine, Department of Genetics, Cell- and Immunobiology, Budapest, Hungary.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Pathol Oncol Res,Pathology oncology research : POR,9706087,IM,,"['Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Primers', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Histamine Antagonists/pharmacology', 'Histidine Decarboxylase/antagonists & inhibitors/*blood/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*enzymology/immunology', '*Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Lymphocytes/*enzymology/immunology', 'Methylhistidines/pharmacology', 'Phenyl Ethers/pharmacology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reference Values']",1998/07/09 00:00,1998/07/09 00:01,['1998/07/09 00:00'],"['1998/07/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/09 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02904705 [doi]'],ppublish,Pathol Oncol Res. 1998;4(2):121-4. doi: 10.1007/BF02904705.,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histamine Antagonists)', '0 (Methylhistidines)', '0 (Phenyl Ethers)', '70050-43-0 (alpha-fluoromethylhistidine)', 'EC 4.1.1.22 (Histidine Decarboxylase)', 'I43T3ID6G2 (tesmilifene)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To further characterise the role of NC protein of MoMuLV (NCp10) in the replication of the viral genome, the influence of NCp10 on self-primed versus primer-specific reverse transcription has been analysed in vitro. The results show that NCp10 can enhance the specificity of proviral DNA synthesis by inhibiting self-primed cDNA synthesis while promoting primer-specific DNA synthesis within active NCp10-RNA nucleoprotein complexes. Retroviruses are known to show a high degree of variability and this prompted us to examine the possible implication of NCp10 in the genetic variability of MoMuLV. The ability of reverse transcriptase (RT) to extend different mutated primers using an RNA or a DNA template has been investigated in the presence or in the absence of NCp10. NCp10 was found to have different effects on RT depending on the nature of the template: an enhancement at the elongation level of mutated primers using RNA as template versus a slight inhibition using DNA as template. These observations suggest that NCp10 could be implicated in the genetic variability of MoMuLV by allowing nucleotide misincorporation principally during minus strand DNA synthesis.","['Rascle, J B', 'Ficheux, D', 'Darlix, J L']","['Rascle JB', 'Ficheux D', 'Darlix JL']","[""Unite de Virologie Humaine U412, Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon, 46 Allee d'Italie, 69364 Lyon Cedex 07, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,IM,,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Viral/*biosynthesis', 'Gene Products, gag/*metabolism', '*Genetic Variation', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Proviruses/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Viral Core Proteins/*metabolism']",1998/07/09 00:00,1998/07/09 00:01,['1998/07/09 00:00'],"['1998/07/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/09 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/09 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-2836(98)91873-3 [pii]', '10.1006/jmbi.1998.1873 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Biol. 1998 Jul 10;280(2):215-25. doi: 10.1006/jmbi.1998.1873.,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Viral Core Proteins)', '129924-33-0 (retroviral nucleocapsid protein NCp10, Moloney murine leukemia', 'virus)']",,,,['Copyright 1998 Academic Press'],,,,,,,,,,

These results suggest that a non-peptide compound can mimic the effect of TPO via c-Mpl.","['Kimura, T', 'Kaburaki, H', 'Tsujino, T', 'Ikeda, Y', 'Kato, H', 'Watanabe, Y']","['Kimura T', 'Kaburaki H', 'Tsujino T', 'Ikeda Y', 'Kato H', 'Watanabe Y']","['Research and Development Division, Hokuriku Seiyaku Co., Ltd, Katsuyama, Fukui, Japan. tki@land.hokuriku.or.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,FEBS Lett,FEBS letters,0155157,IM,,"['Benzodiazepinones/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Megakaryocytes/drug effects/physiology', '*Milk Proteins', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytokine/metabolism', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism/pharmacology', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Thrombopoietin/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/07/08 00:00,1998/07/08 00:01,['1998/07/08 00:00'],"['1998/07/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/08 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/08 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-5793(98)00536-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s0014-5793(98)00536-5 [doi]']",ppublish,FEBS Lett. 1998 May 29;428(3):250-4. doi: 10.1016/s0014-5793(98)00536-5.,"['0 (Benzodiazepinones)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '143641-95-6 (MPL protein, human)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For this purpose we employed two human T-cell lines; the Jurkat cells in which long exposure to diBu-cAMP severely down-regulated the catalytic subunit of PKA (PKA-C), and H-9 cells in which such exposure markedly increased PKA-C level. Transient transfection assays revealed that addition of diBu-cAMP 1 h before or after transfection profoundly increased HTLV-I LTR directed CAT expression and synergistically enhanced its stimulation by the viral transactivator tax gene product in both cell lines. However longer exposure to diBu-cAMP before transfection reduced LTR-CAT expression to below its basal level and completely abolished its stimulation by tax in Jurkat cells, and this diBu-cAMP inhibitory effect could be abrogated by co-transfection of a PKA-C expressing vector. By contrast, in H-9 cells, this long exposure to diBu-cAMP continued enhancing LTR-CAT expression and its tax-mediated transactivation, and this stimulatory effect of diBu-cAMP could be diminished by the PKA-specific inhibitor N-12-(p-bromocinnamylamine)ethyll-5-isoquinolinsulfonamid e (H-89). Notably, in the absence of diBu-cAMP treatment H-89 reduced LTR-CAT expression to below its basal level and prevented its stimulation by tax in both cell lines. Together these findings indicate not only that cAMP-activated PKA stimulates HTLV-I LTR expression and its transactivation by tax, but even in the absence of PKA activating signals the basal HTLV-I LTR expression as well as its stimulation by tax are both dependent on a basal PKA activity.","['Turgeman, H', 'Aboud, M']","['Turgeman H', 'Aboud M']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,FEBS Lett,FEBS letters,0155157,IM,,"['Bucladesine/*pharmacology', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/biosynthesis', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/drug effects', 'Gene Products, tax/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Genes, pX', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Kinetics', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection']",1998/07/08 00:00,1998/07/08 00:01,['1998/07/08 00:00'],"['1998/07/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/08 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/08 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-5793(98)00513-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s0014-5793(98)00513-4 [doi]']",ppublish,FEBS Lett. 1998 May 29;428(3):183-7. doi: 10.1016/s0014-5793(98)00513-4.,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

E7010 exhibits a broad spectrum of antitumor activity against human tumor xenografts. The mechanism of action is by arresting the progression of cells in M phase of the cell cycle by inhibiting tubulin polymerization. The objective of this phase I study was to determine the maximum allowable dose (MAD), toxicity, and pharmacokinetics of single or 5-day repeated doses of E7010. In the single-dose study, E7010 was administered orally to 16 patients at doses ranging from 80 to 480 mg/m2. The dose-limiting toxicity was peripheral neuropathy at a dose of 480 mg/m2. Hematological and gastrointestinal toxicities were mild. In the 5-day repeated-dose study, 41 patients were given E7010 at doses ranging from 30 to 240 mg/m2 per day. The dose-limiting toxicities were peripheral neuropathy and intestinal paralysis. Gastrointestinal toxicity was dose-dependent but not severe. Hematological toxicity was not dose-dependent. Pharmacokinetic analysis in the single-dose study showed a rapid increase in the plasma levels of the drug after administration, followed by disappearance with a t1/2 of 4.4-16.6 h. The variation in area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) between the patients was small and increased in a dose-dependent manner. Total drug recovery in urine 72 h after administration was 77.8+/-11.4%, indicating that E7010 has favorable absorption and elimination profiles. The changes in the plasma levels of E7010 on day 5 in the 5-day repeated-dose study were almost the same as those on day 1, indicating that the drug did not accumulate. In the single-dose study, spinal cord metastasis exhibited a 74% reduction in a patient with uterine sarcoma and a minor response (MR) was observed in a pulmonary adenocarcinoma patient. In the 5-day repeated-dose study decreases in the tumor markers carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC) were observed in a patient with stomach cancer and in a patient with recurrent uterine cervical carcinoma, respectively. The recommended phase II doses are 320 mg/m2 for a single-dose study and 200 mg/m2 per day for a 5-day repeated-dose study. Since the activity of E7010 is time-dependent, i.e. a certain concentration of E7010 is required for more than 12 h to suppress the growth of P388 leukemia cells, it is recommended that subsequent phase I/II studies be conducted using a divided dose schedule in order to maintain the blood level of E7010.","['Yamamoto, K', 'Noda, K', 'Yoshimura, A', 'Fukuoka, M', 'Furuse, K', 'Niitani, H']","['Yamamoto K', 'Noda K', 'Yoshimura A', 'Fukuoka M', 'Furuse K', 'Niitani H']","['Kinki University School of Medicine, Osaka-Sayama, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aminophenols/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Area Under Curve', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Treatment Outcome']",1998/07/08 00:00,1998/07/08 00:01,['1998/07/08 00:00'],"['1998/07/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/08 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/08 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002800050795 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1998;42(2):127-34. doi: 10.1007/s002800050795.,"['0 (Aminophenols)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '141430-65-1 (E 7010)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In an effort to clarify the exact mechanism of resistance to this novel TS inhibitor, we examined the molecular alterations in its target enzyme TS, the transport protein (reduced folate carrier, RFC), and folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS) in a human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line, MOLT-3, made resistant to ZD9331. A 310-fold resistant subline was established after 6 months exposure to the drug at concentrations up to 7 microM, and was designated MOLT-3/ ZD9331. MOLT-3/ZD9331 showed crossresistance to CB3717 (4.8-fold), raltitrexed (63-fold) and methotrexate (MTX) (120-fold), but retained sensitivity to trimetrexate (0.88-fold). The resistant cells demonstrated impaired initial cellular uptake and low accumulation of [3H]MTX in accordance with a decreased expression of RFC1, suggesting the downregulation of RFC. However, Southern blot analysis demonstrated no change in gene copy number nor gross rearrangement of RFC1 in the resistant cells. In addition, MOLT-3/ZD9331 showed amplification of the TS gene with a concomitantly increased level in the gene expression. In contrast, the expression of FPGS did not alter. These results demonstrate that continuous exposure of the cells to ZD9331 leads not only to a decreased expression of RFC1 but also to TS gene amplification and overexpression. The resistant mechanisms are likely to be regulated both at a genetic and a transcriptional level for different resistance phenotypes in the ZD9331-resistant MOLT-3 cells.","['Kobayashi, H', 'Takemura, Y', 'Miyachi, H']","['Kobayashi H', 'Takemura Y', 'Miyachi H']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Defense Medical College, Tokorozawa, Saitama, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/blood', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', '*Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Methotrexate/blood/pharmacology', 'Peptide Synthases/metabolism', 'Quinazolines/*pharmacology', 'Thymidylate Synthase/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1998/07/08 00:00,1998/07/08 00:01,['1998/07/08 00:00'],"['1998/07/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/08 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/08 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002800050792 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1998;42(2):105-10. doi: 10.1007/s002800050792.,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0 (SLC19A2 protein, human)', '0 (ZD 9331)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (Peptide Synthases)', 'EC 6.3.2.17 (folylpolyglutamate synthetase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Following exposure to low oxygen partial pressure (hypoxia), HIF-1 binds to an hypoxia-response element located 3' to the erythropoietin gene and confers activation of erythropoietin expression. The conserved core HIF-1 binding site (HBS) of the erythropoietin 3' enhancer (CGTG) contains a CpG dinucleotide known to be a potential target of cytosine methylation. We found that methylation of the HBS abolishes HIF-1 DNA binding as well as hypoxic reporter gene activation, suggesting that a methylation-free HBS is mandatory for HIF-1 function. The in vivo methylation pattern of the erythropoietin 3' HBS in various human cell lines and mouse organs was assessed by genomic Southern blotting using a methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme. Whereas this site was essentially methylation-free in the erythropoietin-producing cell line Hep3B, a direct correlation between erythropoietin protein expression and the degree of erythropoietin 3' HBS methylation was found in different HepG2 sublines. However, the finding that this site is partially methylation-free in human cell lines and mouse tissues that do not express erythropoietin suggests that there might be a general selective pressure to keep this site methylation-free, independent of erythropoietin expression.","['Wenger, R H', 'Kvietikova, I', 'Rolfs, A', 'Camenisch, G', 'Gassmann, M']","['Wenger RH', 'Kvietikova I', 'Rolfs A', 'Camenisch G', 'Gassmann M']","['Institute of Physiology, University of Zurich-Irchel, Zurich, Switzerland. labbauer@physiol.unizh.ch']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,IM,,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular', '*Cell Hypoxia', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Dinucleoside Phosphates/*metabolism', 'Erythropoietin/*biosynthesis', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, Reporter', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit', 'Kidney/embryology/growth & development/metabolism', 'L Cells', 'Leukemia', 'Liver/embryology/growth & development/metabolism', 'Liver Neoplasms', 'Luciferases/biosynthesis', 'Mice', 'Neuroblastoma', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Organ Specificity', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/07/08 00:00,1998/07/08 00:01,['1998/07/08 00:00'],"['1998/07/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/08 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/08 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1432-1327.1998.2530771.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1998 May 1;253(3):771-7. doi: 10.1046/j.1432-1327.1998.2530771.x.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Dinucleoside Phosphates)', '0 (HIF1A protein, human)', '0 (Hif1a protein, mouse)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', ""2382-65-2 (cytidylyl-3'-5'-guanosine)"", 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have assessed the impact of the infection on the clinical features, quality of life and survival of HCV+ve Lp-Ic patients as compared to its impact in HCV-ve patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy patients with Lp-Ic consecutively observed over a six-year period were studied. Clinical, virological and histopathological features were recorded at diagnosis. Quality of life was assessed using a scoring system including disease-related symptoms, performance status, working ability, hospital admissions and therapies required. RESULTS: Eighteen patients (26%) with HCV infection were identified. Significant differences between those patients and the HCV-ve group included number of symptomatic patients, Hb levels, serum protein levels, entity of the IgM monoclonal component, number of patients with cryoglobulins and with organ (liver, kidney) involvement, and entity and pattern of bone marrow infiltration. Survival rates were similar (P = 0.8383), but the quality-of-life score was significantly worse for the HCV+ve patients (P = 0.002). All anti-HCV Ab+ve patients tested positive for HCV RNA; genotype 2ac was detected in a significant proportion of cases. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that HCV infection is present in about one-third of patients with Lp-Ic. HCV infection does not seem to affect the overall survival of patients with Lp-Ic, but it affects the clinical expression of the disease, so that the overall quality of life of HCV+ve patients is significantly worse.","['Silvestri, F', 'Barillari, G', 'Fanin, R', 'Salmaso, F', 'Pipan, C', 'Falasca, E', 'Puglisi, F', 'Mariuzzi, L', 'Zaja, F', 'Infanti, L', 'Patriarca, F', 'Candoni, A', 'Rogato, A', 'Di Loreto, C', 'Botta, G A', 'Baccarani, M']","['Silvestri F', 'Barillari G', 'Fanin R', 'Salmaso F', 'Pipan C', 'Falasca E', 'Puglisi F', 'Mariuzzi L', 'Zaja F', 'Infanti L', 'Patriarca F', 'Candoni A', 'Rogato A', 'Di Loreto C', 'Botta GA', 'Baccarani M']","['Division of Hematology, University Hospital, Udine, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Hepacivirus/pathogenicity', 'Hepatitis C/*complications', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/pathology/*virology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/pathology/*virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', '*Quality of Life', 'Survival Analysis']",1998/07/08 00:00,1998/07/08 00:01,['1998/07/08 00:00'],"['1998/07/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/08 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/08 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1023/a:1008265804550 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(19)61006-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 1998 May;9(5):499-504. doi: 10.1023/a:1008265804550.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These ardeemins (i) reversed drug resistance to vinblastine (VBL) or to taxol as much as 700-fold at relatively noncytotoxic concentrations in vitro; (ii) as a single agent at high concentrations killed MDR cells more efficaciously than the respective parent wild-type cells; and (iii) exhibited strong synergistic effects with doxorubicin (DX) and VBL against the growth of MDR neoplastic cells, and to a lesser extent, of the parent wild-type cells. Mechanistic studies showed that photoaffinity labeling of P-glycoprotein (Pgp) with [3H] azidopine was competitively inhibited by the ardeemins. Resistance to DX in MDR-[Pgp+ and MDR-associated protein (MRP)+], MDR-Pgp+, lung resistance protein (LRP)+-expressing, and wild-type lung cancer cells were reversed 110- to 200-fold, 50- to 66-fold, 7- to 15-fold, and 0.9- to 3-fold, respectively, by 20 microM of the ardeemins. Moreover, these compounds increased the intracellular accumulation of VBL and markedly decreased its efflux. Finally, in vivo combination studies demonstrated that nontoxic doses of the ardeemins with DX significantly improved the chemotherapeutic effects in B6D2F1 mice bearing DX-resistant P388 leukemia, and nude mice bearing human MX-1 mammary carcinoma xenografts. The above features indicate that the ardeemins may have utility in the therapy of cancer.","['Chou, T C', 'Depew, K M', 'Zheng, Y H', 'Safer, M L', 'Chan, D', 'Helfrich, B', 'Zatorska, D', 'Zatorski, A', 'Bornmann, W', 'Danishefsky, S J']","['Chou TC', 'Depew KM', 'Zheng YH', 'Safer ML', 'Chan D', 'Helfrich B', 'Zatorska D', 'Zatorski A', 'Bornmann W', 'Danishefsky SJ']","['Molecular Pharmacology and Therapeutics Program, Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research, 1275 York Avenue, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,,"['Alkaloids/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Indoles/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Mice', 'Pyrimidinones/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vinblastine/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",1998/07/08 00:00,1998/07/08 00:01,['1998/07/08 00:00'],"['1998/07/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/08 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/08 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.95.14.8369 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1998 Jul 7;95(14):8369-74. doi: 10.1073/pnas.95.14.8369.,"['0 (5-N-acetyl-8-demethylardeemin)', '0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Pyrimidinones)', '148441-26-3 (5-N-acetylardeemin)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",,,"['R01 HL025848/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL25848/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC20982,,,,,,,,,

However, the biological mechanism by which these oncogenes disrupt the developmental program of normal human hematopoietic cells during the initiation of the leukemogenic process is poorly understood due to the absence of an appropriate experimental system to study their function. Here, we report that retroviral transduction of TLS-ERG, a myeloid leukemia-associated fusion gene, to human cord blood cells results in altered myeloid and arrested erythroid differentiation and a dramatic increase in the proliferative and self-renewal capacity of transduced myeloid progenitors. Thus, TLS-ERG expression alone induced a leukemogenic program that exhibited similarities to the human disease associated with this translocation. These results provide an experimental examination of the early stages of the human leukemogenic process induced by a single oncogene and establish a paradigm to functionally assay putative leukemogenic genes in normal human hematopoietic cells.","['Pereira, D S', 'Dorrell, C', 'Ito, C Y', 'Gan, O I', 'Murdoch, B', 'Rao, V N', 'Zou, J P', 'Reddy, E S', 'Dick, J E']","['Pereira DS', 'Dorrell C', 'Ito CY', 'Gan OI', 'Murdoch B', 'Rao VN', 'Zou JP', 'Reddy ES', 'Dick JE']","['Department of Genetics, Research Institute, Hospital for Sick Children, and Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, 555 University Avenue, Toronto, Ontario M5G 1X8, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,,"['Cell Lineage/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/*pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', '*RNA-Binding Protein FUS', 'Retroviridae']",1998/07/08 00:00,1998/07/08 00:01,['1998/07/08 00:00'],"['1998/07/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/08 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/08 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.95.14.8239 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1998 Jul 7;95(14):8239-44. doi: 10.1073/pnas.95.14.8239.,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA-Binding Protein FUS)', '0 (TLS-ERG fusion protein, human)']",,,"['F32 CA072193/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1F32CA72193/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC20960,,,,,,,,,

Using HL60 leukemia and M14 melanoma cell lines we investigated the role of the apoptotic pathway in pMC540-mediated cell death. Tumor cells exposed to pMC540 showed cell size shrinkage and an increase in the sub-diploid DNA content. A loss of membrane phospholipid asymmetry associated with apoptosis was induced by pMC540 in both tumor cell lines as evidenced by the externalization of phosphatidylserine. A dose-dependent increase in caspase-3 protease activity suppressed by the tetrapeptide inhibitor DEVD-CHO was observed in both cell lines. Western blot analysis of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, a caspase substrate, showed the classical cleavage pattern (116 to 89 kDa) associated with apoptosis in pMC540-treated cell lysates. Furthermore, caspase inhibition blocked the externalization of membrane PS, indicating that the loss of membrane phospholipid asymmetry is a downstream event of caspase activation. These findings demonstrate that tumor cell death induced by pMC540 is mediated by caspase proteases.","['Pervaiz, S', 'Hirpara, J L', 'Clement, M V']","['Pervaiz S', 'Hirpara JL', 'Clement MV']","['Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore. shazib@pacific.net.sg']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,IM,,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Size', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*pharmacology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Melanoma', 'Phosphatidylserines/metabolism', 'Pyrimidinones/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/07/04 00:00,1998/07/04 00:01,['1998/07/04 00:00'],"['1998/07/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/04 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/04 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0304-3835(98)00021-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s0304-3835(98)00021-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 1998 Jun 5;128(1):11-22. doi: 10.1016/s0304-3835(98)00021-4.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Phosphatidylserines)', '0 (Pyrimidinones)', '58823-12-4 (merocyanine dye)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expression of exogenous wt-p53 suppresses a variety of leukaemia phenotypes by acting on cell survival, proliferation and/or differentiation. As for tumour gene therapy, the final fate of the neoplastic cells is one of the most relevant points. We examined the effects of exogenous wt-p53 gene expression in several leukaemia cell lines to identify p53-responsive leukaemia. The temperature-sensitive p53Val135 mutant or the human wt-p53 cDNA was transduced in leukaemia cell lines representative of different acute leukaemia FAB subtypes, including M1 (KG1), M2 (HL-60), M3 (NB4), M5 (U937) and M6 (HEL 92.1.7), as well as blast crisis of chronic myelogenous leukaemia (BC-CML: K562, BV173) showing diverse differentiation features. By morphological, molecular and biochemical analyses, we have shown that exogenous wt-p53 gene expression induces apoptosis only in cells corresponding to M1, M2 and M3 of the FAB classification and in BC-CML showing morphological and cytochemical features of undifferentiated blast cells. In contrast, it promotes differentiation in the others. Interestingly, cell responsiveness was independent of the vector used and the status of the endogenous p53 gene.","['Rizzo, M G', 'Zepparoni, A', 'Cristofanelli, B', 'Scardigli, R', 'Crescenzi, M', 'Blandino, G', 'Giuliacci, S', 'Ferrari, S', 'Soddu, S', 'Sacchi, A']","['Rizzo MG', 'Zepparoni A', 'Cristofanelli B', 'Scardigli R', 'Crescenzi M', 'Blandino G', 'Giuliacci S', 'Ferrari S', 'Soddu S', 'Sacchi A']","['Molecular Oncogenesis Laboratory, Regina Elena Cancer Institute, CRS, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,IM,,"['Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Cell Survival', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Genes, p53/genetics/*physiology', 'Genetic Therapy', 'HL-60 Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/*pathology/therapy']",1998/07/04 00:00,1998/07/04 00:01,['1998/07/04 00:00'],"['1998/07/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/04 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/04 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1998.236 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1998 May;77(9):1429-38. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1998.236.,,,,,,PMC2150178,,,,,,,,,

To study the cellular mechanisms of acquired drug resistance we developed 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D3)-resistant sublines of promyelocytic leukemia HL60 cells which have increased proliferation rates (Exp. Cell Res., 224, 312, 1996; Cancer Res., 50, 5513, 1996). We report here that the resistant sublines display varying degrees of shortening of the G1 phase as compared to the parental HL60-G cells. Protein levels of cyclins E, D1, D2 and D3 are elevated in these resistant cell lines, and cyclin D1 is especially high in 40AF cells, which has the shortest G1 length. The protein levels of cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk)2, Cdk4 and Cdk6 are not altered in the resistant sublines. Both Cdk2 and Cdk6-associated kinase activites are increased in the resistant sublines, but not Cdk4 kinase activity. Protein levels of p27Kip1 are not consistently altered in the resistant sublines as compared to the parental HL60-G cells, but are reduced relative to HL60-G cells arrested by 96 h treatment with 1,25D3. Interestingly, the resistant cell lines constitutively express high levels of retinoblastoma protein (pRb), and pRb is highly phosphorylated, indicating that the G1 cyclin/Cdk complexes in the resistant cells are physiologically active. The results suggest that the increased activity of cyclin D/Cdk6, and perhaps cyclin E/Cdk2, lead to rapid hyperphosphorylation of pRb and consequently a shorter early G1 phase, and that in the resistant cells the increased ratio of cyclin E to p27Kip1 results in activation of Cdk2 and contributes to the abrogation of the 1,25D3-induced block to the S phase entry. Additionally, it is apparent that constitutively increased levels of pRb are compatible with increased rates of cell proliferation.","['Wang, Q M', 'Luo, X', 'Kheir, A', 'Coffman, F D', 'Studzinski, G P']","['Wang QM', 'Luo X', 'Kheir A', 'Coffman FD', 'Studzinski GP']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, UMD-New Jersey Medical School, Newark 07103, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,,"['*CDC2-CDC28 Kinases', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Cyclin A/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*metabolism', 'Cyclins/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', '*G1 Phase', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",1998/07/04 00:00,1998/07/04 00:01,['1998/07/04 00:00'],"['1998/07/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/04 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/04 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1201803 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1998 May 28;16(21):2729-37. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1201803.,"['0 (Cyclin A)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2-CDC28 Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK4 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK6 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",,,['R01-44722/PHS HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Eleven of them (9.9%) had Down's syndrome (DS), 6 boys and 5 girls. The median age was 22.5 (range 10-40) months. FAB subtypes were the following: M7: 6, M4: 3, and M0: 2. Five of them had previously had myelodysplasia and in 3, all FAB M7, myelofibrosis was detected. This population was treated with two consecutive protocols. Nine patients were included in the AML-HPG-90 protocol and 2 patients in the AML-HPG-95 study, respectively. However, all DS patients in this series received the same treatment. Eight patients achieved complete remission: two patients received two cycles of intensification with high dose (HD) ara-C, and 1 patient, only one cycle; the other 5 were prevented from receiving such therapy because of unacceptable toxicity or death. At 45 months, event-free survival and overall survival estimates were 0.30, S.E. 0.16. Mortality was remarkably high. All deaths (7) were associated with sepsis (5) or pulmonary infection (2). Three deaths occurred before achieving complete remission, 3 patients died during the consolidation phase and 1 died whilst off treatment. No one presented leukemic relapse. We conclude that this AML-BFM treatment strategy is highly toxic to children with DS and AML in our setting. Efforts will be made to improve clinical support and to administer less intensive therapy to this particular pediatric AML subgroup, which, in fact, has a better prognosis than the same non-trisomic population.","['Zubizarreta, P', 'Felice, M S', 'Alfaro, E', 'Fraquelli, L', 'Casak, S', 'Quinteros, R', 'Cygler, A', 'Gallego, M', 'Perez, L E', 'Sackmann-Muriel, F']","['Zubizarreta P', 'Felice MS', 'Alfaro E', 'Fraquelli L', 'Casak S', 'Quinteros R', 'Cygler A', 'Gallego M', 'Perez LE', 'Sackmann-Muriel F']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, Hospital de Pediatria SAMIC Professor Dr.J.P.

The TEL/AML1 rearrangement is cryptic at the cytogenetic level but confers a favorable prognosis. The AML1 gene was first identified by virtue of its involvement in adult and pediatric acute myeloid malignancies associated with t(8;21) and t(3;21)(q26;q22.1). We have therefore determined the frequency of the TEL/AML1 fusion in pediatric myeloid leukemias by RT-PCR analysis. METHODS: Total RNA was isolated from cryopreserved bone marrow samples of 38 pediatric patients with AML. RNA quality was controlled for by amplification of the TEL gene.

Zero out of 29 pediatric AML patients had evidence for the TEL/AML1 fusion by RT-PCR.

The central reviewers independently examined the bone marrow and peripheral blood smears of all the patients and classify the disease according to the French-British-American (FAB) classification. There were a total of 117 eligible patients. The median age of the patients was 56 years (range 16-86). The male:female ratio was 1:1. Thirty-two percent of the patients were younger than 40 years. The frequency of the FAB subtypes was RA/RARS, 54.7; RAEB, 23.1; CMML, 9.4; and RAEB-T, 12.8%. Anemia was the most common symptom presenting in 84.6% of the patients. In the 34 patients in whom the cytogenetics in the bone marrow were analysed, 44.1% revealed abnormalities. Of these, monosomy 7 and trisomy 8 were the most common aberration, each being detected in 26.7% of the patients. Transfusions were the main therapeutic modality in 80% of the patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a 5 year survival rate of 29% for the whole group with a median survival of 24 months. Twenty-five percent of the patients had progressed to acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) with a median time to disease-progression of 23 months. The median survival for RA/RARS, RAEB, CMML and RAEB-T were 58.4, 19.9, 10.7 and 8.7 months, respectively (P < 0.001). The stepwise Cox regression analysis revealed the percentage of blasts in the bone marrow as the only parameter significantly associated with survival and disease progression. On comparison with data from other countries, the age of Thai patients with MDS is considerably lower than the western population but is comparable to other asian countries. The distribution of the FAB subtypes and the survival of the patients are similar. The major prognostic features, however, lie in the percentage of blasts in the bone marrow rather than the degree of the observed cytopenia.","['Intragumtornchai, T', 'Prayoonwiwat, W', 'Swasdikul, D', 'Suwanwela, N', 'Chaimongkol, B', 'Jootar, S', 'Chansung, K', 'Chancharunee, S', 'Leelasiri, A', 'Yoshida, Y']","['Intragumtornchai T', 'Prayoonwiwat W', 'Swasdikul D', 'Suwanwela N', 'Chaimongkol B', 'Jootar S', 'Chansung K', 'Chancharunee S', 'Leelasiri A', 'Yoshida Y']","['Department of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand. itanin@netserv.chula.ac.th']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Demography', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/classification/*diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Thailand/epidemiology']",1998/07/04 00:00,1998/07/04 00:01,['1998/07/04 00:00'],"['1998/07/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/04 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/04 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(98)00022-8 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(98)00022-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1998 May;22(5):453-60. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(98)00022-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Spontaneous apoptosis was consistently observed in the control cultures in the absence of drug but this accounted for less than 12% of all cells in every case. The methods under investigation were the Annexin V labelling assay, the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) end-labelling assay and the labelling of a 38 kDa mitochondrial membrane protein (7A6 antigen) which is exposed on cells undergoing apoptotic cell death (Apo2.7 assay). The Annexin V assay consistently stained a higher percentage of cells and with a greater separation between the positive and negative cell populations. We conclude that the phosphatidyl serine translocation to the outer leaflet of the cell membrane following an apoptotic signal, as labelled by Annexin V, probably occurs before the development of the DNA strand breaks or the exposure of 7A6 antigen in those cells triggered to die by apoptosis.","['Pepper, C', 'Thomas, A', 'Tucker, H', 'Hoy, T', 'Bentley, P']","['Pepper C', 'Thomas A', 'Tucker H', 'Hoy T', 'Bentley P']","['Department of Haematology, Llandough Hospital, Penarth, South Glamorgan, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,,"['Annexin A5/analysis', 'Apoptosis/*genetics/*physiology', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Coloring Agents', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Genetic Techniques', 'Humans', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/pathology', 'Propidium/analysis']",1998/07/04 00:00,1998/07/04 00:01,['1998/07/04 00:00'],"['1998/07/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/04 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/04 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(98)00013-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(98)00013-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1998 May;22(5):439-44. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(98)00013-7.,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Coloring Agents)', '36015-30-2 (Propidium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This demonstrated that leukemia cell populations usually contain transcripts for IL1beta, TNF alpha, flt 3 and flt 3 ligand in vivo and that transcripts for the other cytokines only appear after the leukemia cells are processed in vitro. The presence of TNF alpha transcripts appears to be associated with resistance to remission induction therapy.

Therefore, we tested other ways to quantify protection based on biochemical measures of viability or drug metabolism.

Dithizone caused a time- and concentration-dependent induction of differentiation in both the promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 cells and the myeloblastic leukemia cell line ML-1 cells, as measured by nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reducing activity. Morphological changes and esterase activities confirmed that this differentiation took place. The induction of differentiation required the addition of dithizone to the culture medium for at least 12 h. The differentiation inducing activity was inhibited by the preincubation of dithizone with various metal ions such as Pb2+, Zn2+, Cu2+ and Mn2+ ions, but not with Fe3+ and Mg2+ ions. In addition, the DNA extracted from dithizone-treated HL-60 cells showed a typical ladder pattern characteristic of apoptosis in agarose gel electrophoresis. A quantitative analysis of DNA fragmentation revealed that this apoptosis was concentration- and time-dependent in both the HL-60 and ML-1 cells. Dithizone-induced apoptosis was also inhibited by preincubation with Mn2+ ions, but not with Mg2+ ions.

The mean nuclear area (+/- standard error of the mean, SE) was significantly greater (P < 10(-6)) in cells from the different types of diffuse large-cell lymphoma than in cells from the different types of small-cell lymphoma (42.91 +/- 1.21 micron 2 vs 19.33 +/- 1.08 micron 2, respectively); there was no overlap between the two groups.

Additionally, the cell-to-cell variability in nuclear area within a given tumour was significantly greater (P < 0.001) for the diffuse large-cell type than for the small non-cleaved cell type. The mean nuclear form factor (+/- SE) and mean nuclear contour indices (+/- SE) of the diffuse large cleaved cell type (0.53 +/- 0.02 and 5.08 +/- 0.11, respectively) were significantly different (P < 0.01 to 10(-6)) from the same parameters in the diffuse large-cell type (0.82 +/- 0.01 and 3.94 +/- 0.04, respectively). Some of the major criteria of the NCI-WF used subjectively to discriminate between bovine lymphoma cell types were supported by morphometric measurements.

The purpose of this study was to generate hypotheses on associations between exposure to benzene, toluene, xylene, and styrene and various common types of cancer. METHODS: In the context of a population-based case-control study carried out in Montreal, 3,730 cancer patients (15 types of cancers, not including leukemia) and 533 population controls were interviewed, and their job histories were translated by a team of experts into occupational exposures, including benzene, toluene, xylene, and styrene. In the present analysis, exposure to these substances was compared between each case series and a control group pooling selected cancer patients and population controls, using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Exposure levels were low for most exposed subjects, and there was a high correlation between exposure to benzene, toluene and xylene. For most sites of cancer there was no evidence of excess risk due to these substances. However, limited evidence of increased risk was found for the following associations: esophagus-toluene, colon-xylene, rectum-toluene, rectum-xylene and rectum-styrene. CONCLUSIONS: These latter observations warrant further investigation.","['Gerin, M', 'Siemiatycki, J', 'Desy, M', 'Krewski, D']","['Gerin M', 'Siemiatycki J', 'Desy M', 'Krewski D']","[""Department de medecine du travail et d'hygiene du milieu, Universite de Montreal, Quebec, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Ind Med,American journal of industrial medicine,8101110,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Benzene/adverse effects', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Humans', 'Hydrocarbons, Aromatic/*adverse effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Occupational Diseases/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Occupational Exposure/adverse effects', 'Odds Ratio', 'Quebec/epidemiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Styrene', 'Styrenes/adverse effects', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Toluene/adverse effects', 'Xylenes/adverse effects']",1998/07/04 02:12,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/07/04 02:12'],"['1998/07/04 02:12 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/07/04 02:12 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0274(199808)34:2<144::AID-AJIM7>3.0.CO;2-X [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0274(199808)34:2<144::aid-ajim7>3.0.co;2-x [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Ind Med. 1998 Aug;34(2):144-56. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0274(199808)34:2<144::aid-ajim7>3.0.co;2-x.,"['0 (Hydrocarbons, Aromatic)', '0 (Styrenes)', '0 (Xylenes)', '3FPU23BG52 (Toluene)', '44LJ2U959V (Styrene)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three of these carcinogenic 'disinfection by-products', dichloroacetic acid (DCA), trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and chloral hydrate (CH) have been widely evaluated for their potential toxicity. The mechanism(s) by which they exert their activity and the steps in the etiology of the cancers that they induce are important pieces of information that are required to develop valid biologically-based quantitative models for risk assessment. Determining whether these chemicals induce tumors by genotoxic or nongenotoxic mechanisms (or a combination of both) is key to this evaluation. We evaluated these three chemicals for their potential to induce micronuclei and aberrations as well as mutations in L5178Y/TK +/- (-)3.7.2C mouse lymphoma cells. TCA was mutagenic (only with S9 activation) and is one of the least potent mutagens that we have evaluated. Likewise, CH was a very weak mutagen. DCA was weakly mutagenic, with a potency (no. of induced mutants/microgram of chemical) similar to (but less than) ethylmethanesulfonate (EMS), a classic mutagen. When our information is combined with that from other studies, it seems reasonable to postulate that mutational events are involved in the etiology of the observed mouse liver tumors induced by DCA at drinking water doses of 0.5 to 3.5 g/l, and perhaps chloral hydrate at a drinking water dose of 1 g/l. The weight-of-evidence for TCA suggest that it is less likely to be a mutagenic carcinogen. However, given the fact that DCA is a weak mutagen in the present and all of the published studies, it seems unlikely that it would be mutagenic (or possibly carcinogenic) at the levels seen in finished drinking water.","['Harrington-Brock, K', 'Doerr, C L', 'Moore, M M']","['Harrington-Brock K', 'Doerr CL', 'Moore MM']","['Environmental Carcinogenesis Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,IM,,"['Animals', 'Chloral Hydrate/*toxicity', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Dichloroacetic Acid/*toxicity', 'Disinfectants/*toxicity', 'Leukemia L5178/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mutagenicity Tests', 'Mutagens/*toxicity', 'Thymidine Kinase/genetics', 'Trichloroacetic Acid/*toxicity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', '*Water Purification']",1998/07/04 00:00,1998/07/04 00:01,['1998/07/04 00:00'],"['1998/07/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/04 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/04 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1383-5718(98)00026-6 [pii]', '10.1016/s1383-5718(98)00026-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 1998 Mar 30;413(3):265-76. doi: 10.1016/s1383-5718(98)00026-6.,"['0 (Disinfectants)', '0 (Mutagens)', '418M5916WG (Chloral Hydrate)', '5V2JDO056X (Trichloroacetic Acid)', '9LSH52S3LQ (Dichloroacetic Acid)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Predictors of child distress included age, group (CI, PO), and procedural variables (medications and doses, technical difficulty, number of needles required). METHODOLOGY: This was a randomized, controlled prospective study that compared the PO (n = 45) and CI arms (n = 47), at 1, 6, and >12 months after diagnosis. A cross-sectional control group consisted of parents of 70 patients in first remission before the prospective study. Parent questionnaires, staff and parent ratings, and data on medications administered, technical difficulty of the procedure, and needle insertions were obtained for each procedure. This article reports on the final data point for the project (>12 months). RESULTS: Mothers and nurses reported lower levels of child distress in the CI than the PO group. The CI and PO groups showed lower levels of child and parent distress than the cross-sectional control group. Distress decreased throughout the time, and child age was inversely related to distress (younger children had more distress) regardless of group. Child distress was associated with staff perceptions of the technical difficulty of the procedure and with child age, but not with medications administered. CONCLUSIONS: The data showed that pharmacologic and psychologic interventions for procedural distress were effective in reducing child and parent distress and support integration of the two approaches. Younger children experienced more distress and warranted additional consideration. Staff perceptions of the technical difficulty of procedures were complex and potentially helpful in designing intervention protocols.","['Kazak, A E', 'Penati, B', 'Brophy, P', 'Himelstein, B']","['Kazak AE', 'Penati B', 'Brophy P', 'Himelstein B']","[""Department of Pediatrics, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine and Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104-4399, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Pediatrics,Pediatrics,0376422,IM,,"['Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adolescent', '*Bone Marrow Examination/psychology', 'Child', 'Combined Modality Therapy', '*Conscious Sedation', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', '*Imagery, Psychotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*physiopathology/psychology', 'Male', 'Pain/psychology', '*Pain Management', 'Pain Measurement', 'Parents/psychology', '*Patient Care Team', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*physiopathology/psychology', 'Premedication', 'Prospective Studies', '*Spinal Puncture/psychology']",1998/07/04 00:00,1998/07/04 00:01,['1998/07/04 00:00'],"['1998/07/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/04 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/04 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1542/peds.102.1.59 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatrics. 1998 Jul;102(1 Pt 1):59-66. doi: 10.1542/peds.102.1.59.,,,,['57917/PHS HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

A. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 15195-15203) reported that potassium depletion of lipopolysaccharide-stimulated mouse macrophages induced by the potassium ionophore, nigericin, leads to the rapid release of mature interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta). We have now shown a similar phenomenon in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated human monocytic leukemia THP-1 cells. Rapid secretion of mature, 17-kDa IL-1beta occurred, in the presence of nigericin (4-16 microM). No effects on the release of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-6, or proIL-1beta were seen. Addition of the irreversible interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme (ICE) inhibitor, Z-Val-Ala-Asp-dichlorobenzoate, or a radicicol analog, inhibited nigericin-induced mature IL-1beta release and activation of p45 ICE precursor. The radicicol analog itself did not inhibit ICE, but markedly, and very rapidly depleted intracellular levels of 31-kDa proIL-1beta. By contrast, dexamethasone, cycloheximide, and the Na+/H+ antiporter inhibitor, 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride, had no effect on nigericin-induced release of IL-1beta. We have therefore shown conclusively, for the first time, that nigericin-induced release of IL-1beta is dependent upon activation of p45 ICE processing. So far, the mechanism by which reduced intracellular potassium ion concentration triggers p45 ICE processing is not known, but further investigation in this area could lead to the discovery of novel molecular targets whereby control of IL-1beta production might be effected.","['Cheneval, D', 'Ramage, P', 'Kastelic, T', 'Szelestenyi, T', 'Niggli, H', 'Hemmig, R', 'Bachmann, M', 'MacKenzie, A']","['Cheneval D', 'Ramage P', 'Kastelic T', 'Szelestenyi T', 'Niggli H', 'Hemmig R', 'Bachmann M', 'MacKenzie A']","['Novartis Pharma, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland.

Furthermore, the expression domains of a number of these genes correlates with functionally integrated neuronal populations. We have isolated two members of the divergent T-cell leukemia translocation (HOX11/Tlx) homeobox gene family from chick, Tlx-1 and Tlx-3, and show that they are expressed in differentiating neurons of both the peripheral and central nervous systems. In the peripheral nervous system, Tlx-1 and Tlx-3 are expressed in overlapping domains within the placodally derived components of a number of cranial sensory ganglia. Tlx-3, unlike Tlx-1, is also expressed in neural crest-derived dorsal root and sympathetic ganglia. In the CNS, both genes are expressed in longitudinal columns of neurons at specific dorsoventral levels of the hindbrain. Each column has distinct anterior and/or posterior limits that respect inter-rhombomeric boundaries. Tlx-3 is also expressed in D2 and D3 neurons of the spinal cord. Tlx-1 and Tlx-3 expression patterns within the peripheral and central nervous systems suggest that Tlx proteins may be involved not only in the differentiation and/or survival of specific neuronal populations but also in the establishment of neuronal circuitry. Furthermore, by analogy with the LIM genes, Tlx family members potentially define sensory columns early within the developing hindbrain in a combinatorial manner.","['Logan, C', 'Wingate, R J', 'McKay, I J', 'Lumsden, A']","['Logan C', 'Wingate RJ', 'McKay IJ', 'Lumsden A']","[""Department of Developmental Neurobiology, United Medical and Dental Schools, Guy's Hospital, London SE1 9RT, United Kingdom.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Neurosci,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,8102140,IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'Body Patterning', 'Brain/embryology/*metabolism', 'Chick Embryo', 'Ganglia, Sensory/embryology/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/*physiology', '*Genes, Homeobox', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Mitosis/physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Multigene Family', 'Rhombencephalon/embryology/*metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Spinal Cord/cytology/metabolism']",1998/07/03 00:00,1998/07/03 00:01,['1998/07/03 00:00'],"['1998/07/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/03 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Neurosci. 1998 Jul 15;18(14):5389-402.,['0 (Biomarkers)'],,,['WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,PMC6793508,,,,,,,,,

A retrospective study was conducted on the skin tissues from 28 Chinese patients with TCLS. We used in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, and polymerase chain reaction to determine the presence of viruses. Among the 28 cases, HTLV-I was only detected in two cases with adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, not in other cases of TCLS. This suggests that HTLV-I may not play a significant role in the oncogenesis of TCLS in Chinese patients. Conversely, EBV was detected in 12 cases (42.9%), including the secondary TCLS, large cell lymphoma, mycosis fungoides, adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, and angiocentric lymphoma. Nevertheless, latent membrane protein 1 was not detected in any of the EBV-positive cases. Neither was any correlation found between the presence of EBV in TCLS and the prognosis or the severity of the skin lesion.

Although the mechanism of MP formation has been clarified, their biological importance remains ill defined. We have recently shown that platelet-derived MP influence platelet and endothelial cell function. In this study, we have further examined the mechanism of cellular activation by platelet MP. To address the possibility that they may influence monocyte-endothelial interactions, we used an in vitro assay to examine their effects on the adhesion of monocytes to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Platelet MP increased the adhesion of monocytes to HUVEC in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Maximal adhesion of monocytes to resting HUVEC was observed after 24 h of stimulation with MP. Similar kinetics were observed with U-937 (human promonocytic leukemia) cells, used as a model for the blood-borne monocyte. Maximal adhesion of resting monocytes to MP-stimulated HUVEC was observed after 5 h of stimulation with MP. The EC50s for MP-induced increases in HUVEC, monocyte, and U-937 cell adhesion is 8.74, 43.41, and 10.83 microg/ml of MP protein, respectively. The induction of monocyte-endothelial adhesion was mimicked by arachidonic acid isolated from MP. The observed increased cellular adhesiveness correlated with MP-induced upregulation of cell adhesion molecules. MP-stimulated HUVEC increased intracellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) but not vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), P-, or E-selectin expression. Monocyte and U-937 lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (CD11a/CD18) and macrophage antigen-1 (CD11b/ CD18, alpham/beta2) were both upregulated upon MP stimulation, but an increase in p150,95 (CD11c/CD18), very late antigen-1, or ICAM-1 expression was not observed. The functional importance of these changes was demonstrated with blocking antibodies. MP also induced the chemotaxis of U-937 cells in a dose-dependent manner with an EC50 of 4.40 microg/ml of MP protein. Similarly, arachidonic acid isolated from MP mimicked the chemotactic response. A role for PKC was implicated in both adhesion and chemotaxis. GF 109203X, a specific inhibitor of PKC, significantly reduced monocyte-endothelial adhesion, as well as U-937 chemotaxis. The demonstration that platelet MP may modulate important aspects of endothelial and monocyte function provides a novel mechanism by which platelets may interact with such cells in human atherosclerosis and inflammation.","['Barry, O P', 'Pratico, D', 'Savani, R C', 'FitzGerald, G A']","['Barry OP', 'Pratico D', 'Savani RC', 'FitzGerald GA']","['Center for Experimental Therapeutics, Department of Pediatrics, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104-6100, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,IM,,"['Blood Platelets/*physiology', 'CD11 Antigens/analysis', 'Cell Adhesion', '*Cell Communication', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemotaxis', 'Endothelium, Vascular/*cytology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/analysis', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/physiology', 'Monocytes/*physiology', 'Protein Kinase C/physiology']",1998/07/03 00:00,1998/07/03 00:01,['1998/07/03 00:00'],"['1998/07/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI2592 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1998 Jul 1;102(1):136-44. doi: 10.1172/JCI2592.,"['0 (CD11 Antigens)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",,,['HL4500/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC509075,,,,,,,,,

These factors act through receptor complexes containing the signal transducer gp130. The downstream mechanisms that lead to ES cell self-renewal have not been delineated, however. In this study, chimeric receptors were introduced into ES cells. Biochemical and functional studies of transfected cells demonstrated a requirement for engagement and activation of the latent trancription factor STAT3. Detailed mutational analyses unexpectedly revealed that the four STAT3 docking sites in gp130 are not functionally equivalent. The role of STAT3 was then investigated using the dominant interfering mutant, STAT3F. ES cells that expressed this molecule constitutively could not be isolated. An episomal supertransfection strategy was therefore used to enable the consequences of STAT3F expression to be examined. In addition, an inducible STAT3F transgene was generated. In both cases, expression of STAT3F in ES cells growing in the presence of LIF specifically abrogated self-renewal and promoted differentiation. These complementary approaches establish that STAT3 plays a central role in the maintenance of the pluripotential stem cell phenotype. This contrasts with the involvement of STAT3 in the induction of differentiation in somatic cell types. Cell type-specific interpretation of STAT3 activation thus appears to be pivotal to the diverse developmental effects of the LIF family of cytokines. Identification of STAT3 as a key transcriptional determinant of ES cell self-renewal represents a first step in the molecular characterization of pluripotency.","['Niwa, H', 'Burdon, T', 'Chambers, I', 'Smith, A']","['Niwa H', 'Burdon T', 'Chambers I', 'Smith A']","['Centre for Genome Research, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH9 3JQ, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Division/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*physiology', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/physiology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*physiology', 'Transgenes']",1998/07/03 00:00,1998/07/03 00:01,['1998/07/03 00:00'],"['1998/07/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1101/gad.12.13.2048 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Dev. 1998 Jul 1;12(13):2048-60. doi: 10.1101/gad.12.13.2048.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)']",,,,,PMC316954,,,,,,,,,

Hoxa9, Meis1 and Pbx1 proteins have been shown to physically interact with each other, as Hoxa9 cooperatively binds consensus DNA sequences with Meis1 and with Pbx1, while Meis1 and Pbx1 form heterodimers in both the presence and absence of DNA. In this study, we sought to determine if Hoxa9 could transform hemopoietic cells in collaboration with either Pbx1 or Meis1. Primary bone marrow cells, retrovirally engineered to overexpress Hoxa9 and Meis1a simultaneously, induced growth factor-dependent oligoclonal acute myeloid leukemia in <3 months when transplanted into syngenic mice. In contrast, overexpression of Hoxa9, Meis1a or Pbx1b alone, or the combination of Hoxa9 and Pbx1b failed to transform these cells acutely within 6 months post-transplantation. Similar results were obtained when FDC-P1 cells, engineered to overexpress these genes, were transplanted to syngenic recipients.

We previously reported that nm23 genes (H1 and H2) were overexpressed in acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) and nm23-H1 expression predicted the prognosis of AML, especially AML-M5. To clarify the correlation between French-American-British (FAB) classification and nm23 expression level and to clarify the involvement of nm23-H2 and nm23-H1 in patient survival, we investigated the relative levels of nm23-H1 and -H2 mRNA in 76 AML samples using the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. We confirmed that the expression of both nm23-H1 and -H2 genes in AML samples from three different hospitals was significantly higher than that in normal blood cells (P < 0.0005). Overexpression of nm23-H1 was observed in each FAB AML-M1, -M2, -M3, -M4 or -M5 subtype, and the predictive effect of nm23-H1 expression on AML prognosis was shown in FAB AML-M2 and -M5 cases. Although overexpression of nm23-H2 was also found in each FAB subtype, the expression of nm23-H2 in AML-M1 and -M3 cells was not significantly higher than that in normal cells. Among AML subtypes, AML-M3 showed the lowest expression levels of both nm23 genes. To understand the relationship between nm23-H1 and -H2 expression levels, nm23 expression levels for all the AML cases were plotted and divided into four groups (group A, nm23-H1 and -H2 both high; B, both low; C, only nm23-H1 high; D, only nm23-H2 high). A statistically significant correlation between the levels of expression of nm23-H1 and -H2 was observed (r= 0.726). Most AML-M3 cases belonged to group B, but not other types of AML. Analysis of survival probability between the groups showed that group B survived for significantly longer compared with group A. Furthermore, AML-M3 cases survived for significantly longer compared with non-M3 cases in the same group B. These data suggest that low expression levels of both nm23-H1 and -H2 are associated with good prognosis in AML patients.","['Wakimoto, N', 'Yokoyama, A', 'Okabe-Kado, J', 'Nagata, N', 'Motoyoshi, K', 'Honma, Y']","['Wakimoto N', 'Yokoyama A', 'Okabe-Kado J', 'Nagata N', 'Motoyoshi K', 'Honma Y']","['Department of Chemotherapy, Saitama Cancer Center Research Institute, Ina, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/classification/*metabolism', 'Lymphokines/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins', 'NM23 Nucleoside Diphosphate Kinases', '*Nucleoside-Diphosphate Kinase', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prognosis', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism']",1998/07/02 00:00,1998/07/02 00:01,['1998/07/02 00:00'],"['1998/07/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/02 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/02 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1998.382 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1998 Jun;77(12):2298-303. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1998.382.,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (NM23 Nucleoside Diphosphate Kinases)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.4.6 (NME1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.4.6 (Nucleoside-Diphosphate Kinase)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins)']",,,,,PMC2150427,,,,,,,,,

To improve the prognosis of patients with CLL, we have designed a sequential treatment strategy that comprises intensive chemotherapy for mobilization of peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs) and induction of minimal disease, followed by high-dose radiochemotherapy with stem cell reinfusion and post-transplant molecular monitoring by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the complementary determining region III (CDRIII) gene. In a prospective study, we have evaluated this protocol in 18 patients with CLL, also including early stages of the disease. The median age was 49 (29-61) years; Binet stages were A, six; B, nine; and C, three. Adverse prognostic factors [high lymphocyte count and/or diffuse bone marrow (BM) infiltration] were present in 16 out of 18 patients. All patients showed a clone-specific molecular marker as demonstrated by PCR amplification of CDRIII rearrangements. For stem cell mobilization and reduction of tumour load, one to two cycles of Dexa-BEAM chemotherapy were administered, resulting in minimal disease (circulating lymphoma cells <1 x 10(9) l(-1); BM infiltration <20%; lymphomas <2 cm) in 16 out of 18 patients, including four patients who already had minimal disease before Dexa-BEAM. Stem cell harvesting was successful in 14 patients. All grafts [three BM, 11 peripheral blood (PB)] were purged from leukaemic cells using immunomagnetic methods. Thirteen patients having achieved minimal disease were reinfused with purged autologous stem cells (ASC) after preparation with total body irradiation and cyclophosphamide. Engraftment was delayed in patients receiving BM (n = 3) but prompt [neutrophils >0.5 x 10(9) l(-1) after 10 (9-13) days, platelets >20 x 10(9) l(-1) after 11 (9-214) days] in patients restored with PBPCs (n = 10). Procedure-related deaths did not occur. Although the results of CDRIII PCR suggest persistence or recurrence of the leukaemic clone in at least three cases, to date only one patient has relapsed, whereas all others survive without clinical evidence of disease with a maximum follow-up of 48 months. We conclude that sequential high-dose therapy using Dexa-BEAM and autologous stem cell transplantation is a safe and highly effective treatment for patients with CLL. However, a longer follow-up is needed to assess whether definite cures can be achieved using this strategy.","['Dreger, P', 'von Neuhoff, N', 'Kuse, R', 'Sonnen, R', 'Glass, B', 'Uharek, L', 'Schoch, R', 'Loffler, H', 'Schmitz, N']","['Dreger P', 'von Neuhoff N', 'Kuse R', 'Sonnen R', 'Glass B', 'Uharek L', 'Schoch R', 'Loffler H', 'Schmitz N']","['Second Department of Medicine, University of Kiel, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Carmustine/administration & dosage', 'Chlorambucil/administration & dosage', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide', 'Female', 'Fluorouracil/administration & dosage', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Male', 'Melphalan/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Methylprednisolone/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitomycins/administration & dosage', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Prospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1998/07/02 00:00,1998/07/02 00:01,['1998/07/02 00:00'],"['1998/07/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/02 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/02 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1998.381 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1998 Jun;77(12):2291-7. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1998.381.,"['0 (Mitomycins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)', 'U68WG3173Y (Carmustine)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)', 'X4W7ZR7023 (Methylprednisolone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'CHOP protocol', 'COP protocol 1', 'Dexa-BEAM protocol', 'FAMP protocol']",,,,,PMC2150407,,,,,,,,,

The expression and amplification of both genes has now been characterized for each member of the E-series of drug-resistant sublines and is reported here. Both ARA [detected by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)] and MRP (detected by Northern blot analysis) were expressed at low levels in the sensitive parental CEM cell line. An equivalent level of MRP mRNA expression was detected throughout the CEM, E16, E25 and E50 sublines, and there was increasing expression in the E100, E200 and E1000 sublines. ARA expression was not detected in the E16, E25, E50 and E100 sublines but was detected by both RT-PCR and Northern blot analysis in the E200 and E1000 sublines. Southern blot analysis indicated the increased levels of MRP and ARA expression resulted from gene amplification and that MRP was first amplified in the E100 subline and ARA in the E200 subline, suggesting that the two genes were not initially co-amplified. Cytogenetic analysis of E1000 cells demonstrated a large addition to chromosome 16p, around the region where the ARA and MRP genes are located. Increased expression of ARA is associated with increased colchicine resistance in the E-series of sublines and combined with MRP may account for their resistance phenotype.","[""O'Neill, G M"", 'Peters, G B', 'Harvie, R M', 'MacKenzie, H B', 'Henness, S', 'Davey, R A']","[""O'Neill GM"", 'Peters GB', 'Harvie RM', 'MacKenzie HB', 'Henness S', 'Davey RA']","['Clinical Oncology Department, Royal North Shore Hospital, St Leonards, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,IM,,"['ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*genetics', 'Gene Amplification', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/drug therapy/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/07/02 00:00,1998/07/02 00:01,['1998/07/02 00:00'],"['1998/07/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/02 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/02 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1998.350 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1998 Jun;77(12):2076-80. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1998.350.,"['0 (ABCC6 protein, human)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",,,,,PMC2150375,,,,,,,,,

DHEA is a powerful antioxidant and immunomodulator whose production declines with age. For this study, twenty-four female, 15-month-old C57BL/6 mice were left uninfected while twenty-four were infected with LP-BM5 murine leukemia virus, causing murine AIDS. The retroviral infection caused immune dysfunction and loss of hepatic and cardiac vitamins E and A, resulting in increased lipid peroxides. Treatment with DHEAS at 0.01 or 0.005% in drinking water for 10 weeks post-infection significantly (P < 0.05) lowered lipid peroxidation in both heart and liver tissues. Treatment with DHEAS also largely prevented loss of the antioxidants, such as vitamin E and A, and prevented loss of phospholipid in the hearts and livers of the old uninfected as well as infected mice. This study suggests that DHEAS supplementation reduces damage associated with elevated oxidation due to aging and retrovirus infection.","['Araghi-Niknam, M', 'Ardestani, S K', 'Molitor, M', 'Inserra, P', 'Eskelson, C D', 'Watson, R R']","['Araghi-Niknam M', 'Ardestani SK', 'Molitor M', 'Inserra P', 'Eskelson CD', 'Watson RR']","['Arizona Prevention Center, University of Arizona, Tucson 85724, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Soc Exp Biol Med,"Proceedings of the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.

Design.Clinical, radiological, laboratory, and pathological data from a young patient at advanced stage of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome were studied. RESULTS: A 38-year-old white man with stage CIII human immunodeficiency virus infection presented with headaches. Cerebrospinal fluid culture was positive for mycobacterium. He had facial herpes simplex virus and disseminated cytomegalovirus infections. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed multiple areas of patchy or ring-shaped contrast enhancement in the periventricular zone of the right frontoparietal region. Stereotactic brain biopsy showed perivascular CD3 (pan T-cell marker)-positive lymphocytic infiltrates with partial necrosis extending into the neuropil. Not a single cell was labeled with L26, a B-cell marker. Negative and positive controls were appropriate. Special stains for cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, Epstein-Barr virus, acid-fast bacilli, and fungi were negative. Gene rearrangement studies showed rearranged Tgamma and Tbeta bands. Polymerase chain reaction with a primer specific for Epstein-Barr virus genome-encoding nuclear antigen 1 region was positive. Human T-cell leukemia/lymphoma virus I work-up was negative. The patient was treated for mycobacteria. Four months later, he presented with a paravertebral neck mass. Needle biopsy showed a T-cell lymphoma with morphology similar to that in the brain. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this case represents the first example of T-cell lymphoma of the brain in a patient with advanced stage of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Epstein-Barr virus may play a role in T-cell lymphomagenesis. The other unique finding is the complete absence of B cells in a central nervous system lesion. The underlying mechanism eradicating the B cells is unknown.","['Aydin, F', 'Bartholomew, P M', 'Vinson, D G']","['Aydin F', 'Bartholomew PM', 'Vinson DG']","['Department of Pathology, Tulane University School of Medicine, New Orleans, LA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Arch Pathol Lab Med,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,7607091,IM,,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*complications', 'Adult', 'Biopsy', 'Brain Neoplasms/complications/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid/microbiology', 'Gene Rearrangement, beta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Gene Rearrangement, gamma-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, AIDS-Related/*diagnosis', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/complications/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Mycobacterium/isolation & purification', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",1998/07/02 00:00,1998/07/02 00:01,['1998/07/02 00:00'],"['1998/07/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/02 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/02 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Arch Pathol Lab Med. 1998 Apr;122(4):361-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A bone marrow biopsy revealed a 70% hematopoietic cellularity with 65% blasts. Immunophenotyping showed aberrant expression of lymphoid-associated marker CD19. Cytogenetic analysis on a 72-hour culture of bone marrow cells supplemented with conditioned media was evaluated by G-banding at about the 400-band level. The patient's age, cytogenetics, WBC, and immunophenotype at diagnosis would seem to suggest a favorable prognosis, according to previous studies of prognostic indicators. She was treated with induction and consolidation chemotherapy, followed by myeloablative conditioning and autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSCT). Despite multiple favorable prognostic factors, the patient relapsed 7 months after PBSCT. Translocation of chromosomes 8 and 21 is common in AML and is generally considered a good prognostic factor.

Our findings showed an important correlation between the genetic material loss events and an independent distribution of point mutations, which favors the hypothesis of a specific type of genetic instability characterized by the recurrent loss of chromatin fragments implicated in a subset of colorectal cancers.","['el Sebai, H', 'Ged, C', 'Bonichon, F', 'de Verneuil, H', 'Longy, M']","['el Sebai H', 'Ged C', 'Bonichon F', 'de Verneuil H', 'Longy M']","[""Laboratoire d'Oncologie Moleculaire Institut Bergonie, Bordeaux, France.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,IM,,"['Adenocarcinoma/chemistry/*genetics', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 18/genetics', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/chemistry/*genetics', 'Female', 'Genes, p53', 'Genes, ras', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Male', 'Microsatellite Repeats', 'Middle Aged', 'Point Mutation/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas']",1998/07/02 00:00,1998/07/02 00:01,['1998/07/02 00:00'],"['1998/07/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/02 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/02 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0165460897004159 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-4608(97)00415-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1998 Jul 1;104(1):32-8. doi: 10.1016/s0165-4608(97)00415-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The total intracellular concentration of photosensitizer did not decrease significantly during this 18 h interval. For the murine cell lines, the maximum cytotoxic and mutagenic effects were observed when the time between addition of the photosensitizer and irradiation was between 1 and 4 h. The time course of the variations in efficacy did not vary greatly from one murine cell line to another, even though the cell lines differ markedly in the extent of their cytotoxic and mutagenic response. The time course of the variation was similar for cytotoxicity and mutagenicity, as well as for the induction of DNA fragmentation. The human lymphoblastic cell line, WTK1, showed less variation in survival and mutability with time than did the murine cell lines. With Pc 4 (HOSiPcOSi[CH3]2[CH2]3N[CH3]2) as the photosensitizer, the photocytotoxicity for murine L5178Y (LY)-S1 cells did not change significantly as the time between addition of Pc 4 and irradiation was increased from 2 to 18 h. However, the mutagenicity decreased by a factor of three during this interval. The mutagenicity of PDT with Pc 4 was much less in LY-S1 cells than that with AlPc. The results suggest that the variation in the efficacy observed for AlPc-induced photocytotoxicity is caused by changes in the intracellular distribution and/or the aggregation of the photosensitizer with time after its addition.","['He, J', 'Horng, M F', 'Deahl, J T', 'Oleinick, N L', 'Evans, H H']","['He J', 'Horng MF', 'Deahl JT', 'Oleinick NL', 'Evans HH']","['Division of Radiation Biology, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, OH 44106-4942, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Photochem Photobiol,Photochemistry and photobiology,0376425,IM,,"['Aluminum/pharmacokinetics/toxicity', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Indoles/*pharmacokinetics/*toxicity', 'Leukemia L5178', 'Light', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Organometallic Compounds/*pharmacokinetics/*toxicity', 'Organosilicon Compounds/*pharmacokinetics/*toxicity', 'Photosensitizing Agents/*pharmacokinetics/*toxicity', '*Silanes', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'X-Rays']",1998/07/02 00:00,1998/07/02 00:01,['1998/07/02 00:00'],"['1998/07/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/02 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/02 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Photochem Photobiol. 1998 Jun;67(6):720-8.,"['0 (Indoles)', '0 (Organometallic Compounds)', '0 (Organosilicon Compounds)', '0 (Photosensitizing Agents)', '0 (Silanes)', '135719-28-7 (silicon phthalocyanine)', '47822-79-7 (aluminum phthalocyanine)', '92396-88-8 (bis(tri-n-hexylsiloxy)(2,3-naphthalocyaninato)silicon)', 'CPD4NFA903 (Aluminum)']",,,"['P01 CA-48735/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA-43703/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,['NASA'],['Non-programmatic'],,,,,

A 56-year-old man presented with signs and symptoms of advanced cardiac insufficiency, respiratory disturbance and renal failure. Serologically, the anti-human T lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) antibody titer and the levels of both calcium and parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) were distinctly elevated. These data suggested a diagnosis of adult T cell lymphoma/leukemia (ATLL). However, examination of a peripheral blood sample revealed only a few atypical lymphoid cells (3%) associated with mild leukocytosis (white blood cell count, 13.7 x 10(3)/mm3). Lymph node swelling was systemic but mild, with some nodes up to 10 mm in diameter. The patient died of MOF. Adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma was unable to be diagnosed definitively because of the short duration of laboratory abnormalities and because of the discrepancy between the laboratory data and the magnitude of lymphoproliferation in both the lymph nodes and peripheral blood. At autopsy, the most conspicuous finding was extensive metastatic calcification in the multiple organs, including the heart, lungs, kidneys, tongue, liver, pancreas, spleen and systemic arterial walls. Very small numbers of medium-sized atypical lymphoid cells admixed with small reactive lymphocytes were identified in multiple organs, with no evidence of massive infiltration. Molecular analyses could not detect monoclonal integration of HTLV-I provirus DNA or monoclonality of T cell lineage cells. Parathyroid hormone-related peptide was demonstrated in the cytoplasm of the atypical lymphoid cells on immunohistochemical examination. The bone trabeculae generally showed distinct evidence of resorption associated with marked proliferation of osteoclasts. These findings suggested that the hypercalcemia in the present case was categorized as humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy rather than local osteolytic hypercalcemia.","['Kumamoto, H', 'Ichinohasama, R', 'Sawai, T', 'Naganuma, H', 'Furukawa, Y', 'Akiu, N', 'Kano, M', 'Ooya, K']","['Kumamoto H', 'Ichinohasama R', 'Sawai T', 'Naganuma H', 'Furukawa Y', 'Akiu N', 'Kano M', 'Ooya K']","['Department of Oral Pathology, Tohoku University School of Dentistry, Sendai, Japan. kumamoto@mail.cc.tohoku.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Australia,Pathol Int,Pathology international,9431380,IM,,"['Autopsy', 'Bone Resorption/pathology', 'Calcinosis/*complications/pathology', 'Calcium/analysis', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Fatal Outcome', 'HTLV-I Infections/*complications/pathology', 'Humans', 'Kidney/pathology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/diagnosis', 'Lung/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Organ Failure/*complications/pathology', 'Myocardium/chemistry/pathology', 'Phosphorus/analysis']",1998/07/02 00:00,1998/07/02 00:01,['1998/07/02 00:00'],"['1998/07/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/02 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/02 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1440-1827.1998.tb03912.x [doi]'],ppublish,Pathol Int. 1998 Apr;48(4):313-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1440-1827.1998.tb03912.x.,"['27YLU75U4W (Phosphorus)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Progress in understanding the function of differentiated cells in vivo can be facilitated by creating cell lines via immortalizing gene transduction, if they retain the essential differentiated features of the same cells in vivo. Rodent cells immortalize spontaneously with a frequency of 10(-5) to 10(-6). Thus, it is easy to isolate immortal cells from rodent cell populations even without the transfer of immortalizing genes. Immortalizing genes can be used to increase this frequency to approximately 100%. In contrast, the spontaneous immortalization of human cells is a very rare event; the frequency is thought to be < 10(-12). Immortalizing genes can also be used to increase this frequency. Several genes that promise efficient immortalization of cultured cells have been identified. Immortalizing genes include simian virus 40 large T antigen, papillomaviruses E6 and E7, adenovirus E1A, Epstein-Barr virus, human T-cell leukemia virus, herpesvirus saimiri, oncogenes, and mutant p53 gene. Equally important, innovative means of gene delivery have been developed as well. These immortalizing genes, together with gene transfer methodologies, have provided the means to generate cell lines from cell types that are not abundant or are difficult to obtain in pure form in primary culture, are in short supply as human cells, and/or have brief lifetimes in culture. This chapter focuses primarily on the immortalization method by gene transfection. The chapter is not meant to be comprehensive, but rather to provide an account of the power and usefulness of immortalization methodology.","['Katakura, Y', 'Alam, S', 'Shirahata, S']","['Katakura Y', 'Alam S', 'Shirahata S']","['Laboratory of Cellular Regulation Technology, Graduate School of Genetic Resources Technology, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Methods Cell Biol,Methods in cell biology,0373334,IM,,"['Animals', '*Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Humans', 'Oncogenes', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', '*Transfection']",1998/07/02 00:00,1998/07/02 00:01,['1998/07/02 00:00'],"['1998/07/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/02 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/02 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/s0091-679x(08)61573-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Cell Biol. 1998;57:69-91. doi: 10.1016/s0091-679x(08)61573-3.,,,130,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using the 3T3-L1 cell line, we have examined the activation of all adipocyte expressed STATs by 23 different factors which are either potent regulators of adipocyte gene expression or known STAT activators in other cell types. STAT activation was assessed by examining nuclear translocation and tyrosine phosphorylation in serum deprived, fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Unlike other adipocyte-expressed STATs, STAT 5A was present in the nucleus under basal conditions. Of all the activators examined, only growth hormone was capable of causing STATs 5A and 5B to translocate to the nucleus. None of the activators were capable of affecting the cellular distribution of STAT 6. Furthermore, our results indicate that there is a quantitative activation of STATs 1 and 3 by LIF, OSM, and IFN-gamma as measured by both nuclear translocation and tyrosine phosphorylation in whole cell extracts. IFN-gamma is a potent activator of STAT 1 and a weaker activator of STAT 3, whereas LIF and OSM are potent activators of STAT 3 and weaker activators of STAT 1.

We report here the clinicopathologic findings from five patients with a history of bone marrow transplantation in which colonoscopic biopsies showed chronic mucosal changes reminiscent of chronic idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The patients ranged in age from 2.5 to 31 years. Bone marrow transplantations were performed for leukemia (3 patients), Hodgkin's disease (1 patient), and metachromatic leukodystrophy (1 patient). Endoscopy was performed because of complaints of abdominal pain and diarrhea in all of the five patients. The mean time after transplantation in which histologic features of chronicity were identified was 5.8 months (range, 3-16 mo). All of the five patients had prior colonic biopsies showing acute GVHD. One patient had a previous episode of cytomegalovirus infection. Chronicity was characterized by mild-to-moderate architectural distortion, ie., villiform surface with crypt branching and atrophy, similar to that seen in chronic idiopathic IBD. The lamina propria was hypocellular, with prominent small blood vessels. Focal fibrosis of the lamina propria was noted. One patient had active cryptitis. Superimposed changes of acute GVHD were mild to absent. None of the patients had a history of IBD before receiving the bone marrow transplant. Changes associated with chronicity can be observed in mucosal biopsy specimens from patients with GVHD. It is uncertain whether these changes are directly caused by GVHD or are the result of superimposed infections. The association of chronic mucosal change in the setting of GVHD with the clinical diagnosis of chronic GVHD needs additional investigation.","['Asplund, S', 'Gramlich, T L']","['Asplund S', 'Gramlich TL']","['Department of Anatomic Pathology, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Ohio 44195, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Colon/*pathology', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases/pathology', 'Intestinal Mucosa/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1998/07/01 00:00,1998/07/01 00:01,['1998/07/01 00:00'],"['1998/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mod Pathol. 1998 Jun;11(6):513-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To study the contribution of soluble factors in the interaction between T cells and synoviocytes in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), we looked at the effect of IL-17 on these cells in the presence of cytokines classified as pro (IL-1)- and anti-inflammatory (IL-4, IL-13, IL-10). Both human rIL-1beta and rIL-17 induced IL-6 and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) production by synovial fibroblasts in a dose-dependent manner. After 7 days of culture, optimal concentrations of IL-1beta increased IL-6 (33-fold) and LIF (10-fold) production by synoviocytes, while IL-17 showed a lesser effect on IL-6 (17-fold) and LIF (4-fold) production. Using low concentrations of IL-17 and IL-1beta in combination, a synergistic effect was observed on the production of IL-6, whereas an additive effect was observed for LIF production. Production of biologically active IL-17 was demonstrated in RA synovium supernatants with the use of a blocking anti-IL-17 Ab. Both IL-4 and IL-13 had a modest stimulatory effect on IL-1- and IL-17-induced production of IL-6, but inhibited that of LIF. In contrast, IL-10 had a limited inhibitory effect on IL-6 production and no effect on that of LIF. These findings indicate that low levels of cytokines produced by monocytes (IL-1) and T cells (IL-17) can act together on synoviocytes. Thus, some RA synovium T cells producing IL-17 can activate mesenchymal cells leading to an increased proinflammatory pattern sensitive to Th2 cytokine regulation.","['Chabaud, M', 'Fossiez, F', 'Taupin, J L', 'Miossec, P']","['Chabaud M', 'Fossiez F', 'Taupin JL', 'Miossec P']","['Department of Immunology, Hopital Edouard Herriot, Lyon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,,"['Arthritis, Rheumatoid/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell-Free System/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Drug Combinations', 'Growth Inhibitors/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/*physiology', 'Interleukin-10/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-13/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-17', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/*biosynthesis', 'Interleukins/*pharmacology/physiology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Synovial Membrane/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Th2 Cells/*physiology']",1998/07/01 00:00,1998/07/01 00:01,['1998/07/01 00:00'],"['1998/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1998 Jul 1;161(1):409-14.,"['0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-13)', '0 (Interleukin-17)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PHAP II, a substrate of granzyme A, is degraded within minutes of CTL attack. Two additional cytoplasmic proteins of 27 and 53 kDa bind strongly to the mutant granzyme A column, requiring 6 M urea to elute.

Hsp27 coprecipitates with granzyme A from cytoplasmic lysates and is not a substrate of the enzyme. Hsp27 translocates to the detergent-insoluble fraction of target cells and relocalizes from diffuse cytoplasmic staining to long filamentous fibers, especially concentrated in a perinuclear region, within minutes of CTL attack.

In the present studies the immune response in BALB and C57BL mice during the acute phase of E-55+ murine leukemia virus infection was examined. The results demonstrate that BALB mice produce both IL-4 and IFN-gamma, in contrast to C57BL mice, which produce only IFN-gamma. In BALB mice, IL-4 production results in the absolute requirement for CD8+ T cells to reduce the virus burden during the acute phase of infection. The anti-virus immune response in these mice is IFN-gamma dependent. On the other hand, C57BL mice do not produce IL-4 and, in the absence of both CD8+ T cells and IFN-gamma, still generate an effective anti-virus immune response. Genetic studies suggest that these distinct immune responses are regulated by more than one non-MHC-linked gene.

Since the ecto-5'-nucleotidase is identified as CD73 antigen, we performed immunofluorescence analysis using a specific monoclonal antibody. We analyzed ecto-5'-nucleotidase mRNA by RT-PCR to ascertain the possibility of an alteration in the transcription of its gene. RESULTS: A decrease in ecto-5'-nucleotidase activity was correlated to reduction in ecto-5'-nucleotidase positive cells (CD73+) in leukemia patients. RT-PCR produced a fragment of the expected size and the specific mRNA was found expressed in both healthy subjects and leukemia patients. CONCLUSIONS: The decrease in ecto-5'-nucleotidase activity in patients with B-CLL is not due to loss of transcription of the specific mRNA. The presence of point mutations, splicing alteration, or posttranslational modifications must be investigated. If a defect at DNA or RNA level will be detected, the molecular analysis will be considered for diagnosis of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia.","['Rosi, F', 'Tabucchi, A', 'Carlucci, F', 'Galieni, P', 'Lauria, F', 'Zanoni, L', 'Guerranti, R', 'Marinello, E', 'Pagani, R']","['Rosi F', 'Tabucchi A', 'Carlucci F', 'Galieni P', 'Lauria F', 'Zanoni L', 'Guerranti R', 'Marinello E', 'Pagani R']","['Institute of Biochemistry and Enzymology, University of Siena, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Clin Biochem,Clinical biochemistry,0133660,IM,,"[""5'-Nucleotidase/*blood/deficiency/genetics"", 'Aged', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/blood/deficiency', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/*enzymology', 'Lymphocytes/*enzymology', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis']",1998/07/01 00:00,1998/07/01 00:01,['1998/07/01 00:00'],"['1998/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0009-9120(98)00017-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s0009-9120(98)00017-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Biochem. 1998 Jun;31(4):269-72. doi: 10.1016/s0009-9120(98)00017-4.,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', ""EC 3.1.3.5 (5'-Nucleotidase)""]",,,,,,['Clin Biochem. 1999 Feb;32(1):91.

For the first four days of T-2 presence B16 cell survival was decreased in dose dependent fashion. However, cell survival after eleven days T-2 action may be dual: some stimulation of cell growth that was direct function of the number of seeded cells per well was observed and cell survival (for the highest number of seeded cells) six times greater than control, was noticed at 20 nM T-2 toxin concentration. A smaller cell growth stimulation (cell survival more than 3 times higher than control) was observed with a lower cell number seeded per well. Nevertheless, by eleventh day concentrations of T-2 higher than 35 nM completely inhibited B16 cell proliferation. The same trend was noticed for T-2 action towards K562 cells. Treatment of HeLa cells with various T-2 concentrations led to a marked inhibition of cell survival that was more pronounced at the end of 44th or 72nd hour, than after the 20th hour of agent's action. ICs50 values obtained in the present work, suggest that B16 cells were the most sensitive to T-2 antiproliferative action, while HeLa cells were the most resistant. When PBMC were cultured with HeLa cells the antagonism against various T-2 concentrations was observed; cell survival determined after 44, or 72 hours of cells incubation, was less decreased compared to cultures treated with T-2, or with PBMC only. In addition, it was shown that T-2 and cis-DDP had an antagonist effect on HeLa cells survival.","['Juranic, Z', 'Stojiljkovic, M P', 'Bocarov-Stancic, A', 'Kilibarda, V', 'Milovanovic, S R', 'Juranic, I', 'Bijelogrlic, S', 'Vuletic, N', 'Radulovic, S']","['Juranic Z', 'Stojiljkovic MP', 'Bocarov-Stancic A', 'Kilibarda V', 'Milovanovic SR', 'Juranic I', 'Bijelogrlic S', 'Vuletic N', 'Radulovic S']","['Institute of Oncology and Radiology of Serbia, Belgrade, Yugoslavia.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,IM,,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'HeLa Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Melanoma, Experimental/*pathology', 'T-2 Toxin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1998/07/01 00:00,1998/07/01 00:01,['1998/07/01 00:00'],"['1998/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 1998 Mar;17(1):33-40.,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', 'I3FL5NM3MO (T-2 Toxin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Forty-eight published studies on this topic have reported relative risks for over 1000 specific occupation/cancer combinations. Virtually all of the studies employed the case-control design. Occupations and exposures of fathers were investigated much more frequently than those of the mother. Information about parental occupations was derived through interviews or from birth certificates and other administrative records. Specific exposures were typically estimated by industrial hygienists or were self-reported. The studies have several limitations related to the quality of the exposure assessment, small numbers of exposed cases, multiple comparisons, and possible bias toward the reporting of positive results. Despite these limitations, they provide evidence that certain parental exposures may be harmful to children and deserve further study. The strongest evidence is for childhood leukemia and paternal exposure to solvents, paints, and employment in motor vehicle-related occupations; and childhood nervous system cancers and paternal exposure to paints. To more clearly evaluate the importance of these and other exposures in future investigations, we need improvements in four areas: a) more careful attention must be paid to maternal exposures; b) studies should employ more sophisticated exposure assessment techniques; c) careful attention must be paid to the postulated mechanism, timing, and route of exposure; and d) if postnatal exposures are evaluated, studies should provide evidence that the exposure is actually transferred from the workplace to the child's environment.","['Colt, J S', 'Blair, A']","['Colt JS', 'Blair A']","['Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, Maryland 20892, USA. coltj@epndce.nci.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,IM,,"['Brain Neoplasms/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Carcinogens', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Maternal Exposure/*adverse effects/statistics & numerical data', 'Neoplasms/chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology', 'Neuroblastoma/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects/statistics & numerical data', 'Occupations/statistics & numerical data', 'Paternal Exposure/*adverse effects/statistics & numerical data', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors', 'Wilms Tumor/chemically induced/epidemiology']",1998/07/01 00:00,1998/07/01 00:01,['1998/07/01 00:00'],"['1998/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1289/ehp.98106909 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 1998 Jun;106 Suppl 3:909-25. doi: 10.1289/ehp.98106909.,['0 (Carcinogens)'],,61,,,PMC1533069,,,,,,,,,

Although these studies have been limited by nonspecific pesticide exposure information, small numbers of exposed subjects, and the potential for case-response bias, it is noteworthy that many of the reported increased risks are of greater magnitude than those observed in studies of pesticide-exposed adults, suggesting that children may be particularly sensitive to the carcinogenic effects of pesticides.

The ancient infectious diseases have largely been controlled. The major diseases confronting children now are chronic and disabling conditions termed the ""new pediatric morbidity""--asthma mortality has doubled; leukemia and brain cancer have increased in incidence; neurodevelopmental dysfunction is widespread; hypospadias incidence has doubled. Chemical toxicants in the environment as well as poverty, racism, and inequitable access to medical care are factors known and suspected to contribute to causation of these pediatric diseases. Children are at risk of exposure to over 15,000 high-production-volume synthetic chemicals, nearly all of them developed in the past 50 years. These chemicals are used widely in consumer products and are dispersed in the environment. More than half are untested for toxicity. Children appear uniquely vulnerable to chemical toxicants because of their disproportionately heavy exposures and their inherent biological susceptibility. To prevent disease of environmental origin in America's children, the Children's Environmental Health Network (CEHN) calls for a comprehensive, national, child-centered agenda. This agenda must recognize children's vulnerabilities to environmental toxicants. It must encompass a) a new prevention-oriented research focus; b) a new child-centered paradigm for health risk assessment and policy formulation; and c) a campaign to educate the public, health professionals, and policy makers that environmental disease is caused by preventable exposures and is therefore avoidable. To anchor the agenda, CEHN calls for long-term, stable investment and for creation of a national network of pediatric environmental health research and prevention centers.","['Landrigan, P J', 'Carlson, J E', 'Bearer, C F', 'Cranmer, J S', 'Bullard, R D', 'Etzel, R A', 'Groopman, J', 'McLachlan, J A', 'Perera, F P', 'Reigart, J R', 'Robison, L', 'Schell, L', 'Suk, W A']","['Landrigan PJ', 'Carlson JE', 'Bearer CF', 'Cranmer JS', 'Bullard RD', 'Etzel RA', 'Groopman J', 'McLachlan JA', 'Perera FP', 'Reigart JR', 'Robison L', 'Schell L', 'Suk WA']","['Department of Community Medicine, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY 10029-6574, USA. plandrigan@smtplink.mssm.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,IM,,"['Child', '*Child Welfare/statistics & numerical data', 'Environmental Exposure/adverse effects/*prevention & control/statistics & numerical data', 'Environmental Health/*standards', 'Health Policy', 'Health Promotion/*methods', 'Health Transition', 'Humans', 'Primary Prevention/methods', 'Research/trends', 'United States']",1998/07/01 00:00,1998/07/01 00:01,['1998/07/01 00:00'],"['1998/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1289/ehp.98106787 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 1998 Jun;106 Suppl 3:787-94. doi: 10.1289/ehp.98106787.,,,,,,PMC1533065,,,,,,,,,

By using RT-PCR and Southern hybridization, we confirmed these observations and, in addition, we observed that KOR mRNA was expressed in oligodendrocytes and in the precursors of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. KOR mRNA level was the highest in the immature astrocytes and decreased with their maturation. Very few data are available on the regulation of KOR level by extracellular signals. Therefore, we examined the effect of three growth factors known to be present in the adult brain, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-BB) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and of two cyclic AMP (cAMP) generating systems, the cAMP analog, 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP and forskolin, on this level. It was found that in astrocytes, KOR mRNA level decreased dramatically under the effect of cAMP and less under the effect of bFGF while it did not change significantly after LIF treatment. In oligodendrocytes, it also decreased with cAMP, but increased under the effect of bFGF and PDGF-BB. In microglia, a decrease was observed with cAMP and lipopolysaccharides (LPS), the most used activators of macrophages. These results shed new evidence on the expression of opioid receptor mRNA in the glial cells of the rat CNS.

Previously we reported that primary acute myelogenous leukemia blasts and human leukemic cultured KG-1 cells but not HEL cells penetrate a reconstituted basement membrane (Matrigel) in an invasion assay. In this study, we investigated the role of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in in vitro invasion by leukemic cells. We found that both recombinant human tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (rhTIMP-2) and anti-MMP-2 antibody inhibit the invasiveness of KG-1 cells in the Matrigel assay (by 76% and 51% respectively), while anti-MMP-9 antibody does not, indicating that MMP-2 but not MMP-9 in involved in the invasive process. KG-1 cells were found to secrete constitutively the latent (but not the activated) forms of both MMP-2 and MMP-9 and, after stimulation with the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA), higher levels of these pro-MMP. TPA stimulation, however, did not increase the in vitro invasiveness of these cells. Analysis by Western blot and flow cytometry revealed the presence of the activated form of MMP-2 (64 kDa) on the surface of KG-1 cells and primary AML blasts, as well as MT-MMP in the homogenates of these cells. This active form of MMP-2 was not detected on the surface of HEL cells, which were non-invasive in vitro, although these cells secreted pro-MMP-2. In conclusion, leukemic KG-1 and primary acute myelogenous leukemia cells, which secrete pro-MMP-2 and pro-MMP-9, were also shown to express the activated form of MMP-2 on their cell surface.

During their differentiation, the cells acquired the capacity to produce not only superoxide anion (O2.-) but also nitric oxide (.NO) in response to IgG (or IgE)-opsonized zymosan. The inhibitors of the iNOS pathway, aminoguanidine and NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA), suppressed the production of .NO and enhanced the steady-state concentration of O2.- determined. Conversely, superoxide dismutase (SOD) scavenged the O2.- released and increased the .NO-derived nitrite concentration detected. These data suggested a possible interaction between O2.- and .NO. In differentiated U937 (or THP-1) cells, IgG or IgE-opsonized zymosan induced a strong time-dependent luminol-dependent chemiluminescence (LDCL), which was abrogated by SOD and partially inhibited by aminoguanidine or L-NMMA. Since the iNOS inhibitors did not directly scavenge O2.-, LDCL determination in the presence or absence of SOD and/or iNOS inhibitors demonstrated a concomitant production of O2.- and .NO. These radicals induced the formation of a .NO-derived product(s), probably peroxynitrite (ONOO-), which was required to elicit maximal LDCL. Finally, LDCL measurement provided a convenient tool to characterize iNOS triggering and demonstrated an interaction between NADPH oxidase and iNOS products in human macrophagic cells phagocytizing opsonized-zymosan. These findings show that in activated macrophages, iNOS activity can be involved in LDCL and support the debated hypothesis of iNOS participation to the microbicidal activity of human macrophages.","['Gross, A', 'Dugas, N', 'Spiesser, S', 'Vouldoukis, I', 'Damais, C', 'Kolb, J P', 'Dugas, B', 'Dornand, J']","['Gross A', 'Dugas N', 'Spiesser S', 'Vouldoukis I', 'Damais C', 'Kolb JP', 'Dugas B', 'Dornand J']","['INSERM U431, Universite de Montpellier II, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Free Radic Res,Free radical research,9423872,IM,,"['Calcitriol/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell-Free System', 'Free Radical Scavengers', 'Guanidines/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin E/metabolism', 'Immunoglobulin G/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Luminescent Measurements', 'Luminol', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/pathology', 'Macrophage Activation', 'Macrophages/*metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Nitrates/pharmacology', 'Nitric Oxide/*biosynthesis', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II', 'Opsonin Proteins/metabolism', '*Phagocytosis', 'Superoxide Dismutase/metabolism', 'Superoxides/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Xanthine/metabolism', 'Xanthine Oxidase/metabolism', 'Zymosan/metabolism', 'omega-N-Methylarginine/pharmacology']",1998/06/30 00:00,1998/06/30 00:01,['1998/06/30 00:00'],"['1998/06/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/30 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/30 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10715769809065803 [doi]'],ppublish,Free Radic Res. 1998 Feb;28(2):179-91. doi: 10.3109/10715769809065803.,"['0 (Free Radical Scavengers)', '0 (Guanidines)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Nitrates)', '0 (Opsonin Proteins)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '1AVZ07U9S7 (Xanthine)', '26404-66-0 (peroxynitric acid)', '27JT06E6GR (omega-N-Methylarginine)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '5EXP385Q4F (Luminol)', '9010-72-4 (Zymosan)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (NOS2 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'EC 1.17.3.2 (Xanthine Oxidase)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'SCQ4EZQ113 (pimagedine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, this role for human XO is disputed due to its distinctive lack of activity towards xanthine, and the failure of allopurinol to suppress reperfusion injury. In this paper, we have employed native gel electrophoresis together with activity staining to investigate the role human xanthine dehydrogenase (XD) and XO in hypoxic reperfusion injury. This approach has provided information which cannot be obtained by conventional spectrophotometric assays. We found that both XD and XO of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and lymphoblastic leukaemic cells (CEMs) catalysed ROS generation by oxidising NADH, but not hypoxanthine. The conversion of XD to XO was observed in both HUVECs and CEMs in response to hypoxia, although the level of conversion varied. Purified human milk XD generated ROS more efficiently in the presence of NADH than in the presence of hypoxanthine. This NADH oxidising activity was blocked by the FAD site inhibitor, diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), but was not suppressible by the molybdenum site inhibitor, allopurinol. However, in the presence of both DPI and allopurinol the activities of XD/XO were completely blocked with either NADH or hypoxanthine as substrates. We conclude that both human XD and XO can oxidise NADH to generate ROS. Therefore, the conversion of XD to XO is not necessary for post-ischaemic ROS generation. The hypoxic-reperfusion injury hypothesis should be reappraised to take into account the important role played by XD and XO in oxidising NADH to yield ROS.","['Zhang, Z', 'Blake, D R', 'Stevens, C R', 'Kanczler, J M', 'Winyard, P G', 'Symons, M C', 'Benboubetra, M', 'Harrison, R']","['Zhang Z', 'Blake DR', 'Stevens CR', 'Kanczler JM', 'Winyard PG', 'Symons MC', 'Benboubetra M', 'Harrison R']","[""Bone and Joint Research Unit, St Bartholomew's and the Royal London School of Medicine and Dentistry, University of London, UK.

Thy-1, like some other glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins, forms detergent-insoluble complexes containing protein tyrosine kinases (PTK) and some other molecules which are implicated in the signaling pathway. On the surface of a rat mast cell there are more than 10(6) Thy-1 molecules; however, it is not known which fraction of them is involved in transmembrane signaling, and what exactly is the heterogeneity of Thy-1 complexes. Using sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation of detergent-lysed RBL cells we found that the density of Thy-1 complexes depended on the detergent used and the lysis conditions employed. Sepharose 4B gel chromatography fractionation followed by density gradient ultracentrifugation revealed both size and density heterogeneity of Thy-1 and Lyn PTK complexes. Cross-linking of surface Thy-1 caused significant changes in the density of these complexes, and an increase in Lyn kinase activity in low/medium-density fractions. Thy-1 in low-density fractions was relatively resistant to cleavage with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC). Interestingly, removal of only a small fraction of surface Thy-1 by PI-PLC abolished the cell activation as determined by tyrosine phosphorylation of certain proteins. When Triton X-100 lysates were fractionated at 12000 x g, about 50 % of Thy-1 remained associated with the nuclear/cytoskeleton pellet; this fraction of Thy-1 exhibited an increased sensitivity to PI-PLC. Confocal laser scanning microscopy on fixed cells revealed that the total Thy-1 was relatively homogeneously distributed over the plasma membrane, whereas the PI-PLC-resistant Thy-1 was found mostly in small clusters. The combined data suggest that specialized membrane microdomains enriched in Thy-1 with increased sensitivity to PI-PLC are directly involved in coupling Thy-1 aggregation to transmembrane signaling.","['Surviladze, Z', 'Draberova, L', 'Kubinova, L', 'Draber, P']","['Surviladze Z', 'Draberova L', 'Kubinova L', 'Draber P']","['Institute of Molecular Genetics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Prague.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,IM,,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Phosphatidylinositol Diacylglycerol-Lyase', 'Phosphoinositide Phospholipase C', 'Rats', 'Thy-1 Antigens/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Type C Phospholipases/pharmacology', 'src-Family Kinases/metabolism']",1998/06/30 02:03,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/06/30 02:03'],"['1998/06/30 02:03 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/06/30 02:03 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1521-4141(199806)28:06<1847::AID-IMMU1847>3.0.CO;2-O [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1521-4141(199806)28:06<1847::AID-IMMU1847>3.0.CO;2-O [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1998 Jun;28(6):1847-58. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1521-4141(199806)28:06<1847::AID-IMMU1847>3.0.CO;2-O.,"['0 (Thy-1 Antigens)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.1.4.11 (Phosphoinositide Phospholipase C)', 'EC 4.6.1.13 (Phosphatidylinositol Diacylglycerol-Lyase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bcl-2 overexpression, or gain of function mutations in the open reading frame (ORF) or in the translational repressor, the upstream ORF(uORF) of bcl-2, might also be important in deregulating its function or expression.

DATA SOURCE: Pilot clinical trial involving 21 patients undergoing allogeneic transplant with positive histologic or radiographic evidence of GVHD of the gastrointestinal tract who failed antidiarrheal therapy with loperamide. DATA SYNTHESIS: A complete response, defined as resolution of diarrhea, was seen in 71% of trial participants (15 of 21 patients). At the dose and scheduling used (500 mcg i.v. three times daily for a median of seven consecutive days), octreotide was extremely well tolerated in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot study, octreotide treatment was effective in reducing the amount of diarrhea in patients with acute GVHD. The data suggest that patients receiving octreotide early in the course of the diarrhea experienced more benefit than patients with persistent diarrhea prior to receiving octreotide. The demonstrated safety and efficacy of octreotide in this patient population support further investigation of this therapeutic strategy for GVHD-induced diarrhea. A randomized, controlled, clinical trial of octreotide versus loperamide for the initial treatment of GVHD-induced diarrhea is warranted. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: Octreotide should be administered early in the course of GVHD as soon as onset of diarrhea is noted and should be discontinued as soon as diarrhea resolves to avoid constipation and the potential development of an ileus. Because response to the drug usually occurs quickly, maintaining treatment for additional days or weeks is unnecessary. If a benefit is not seen in four to seven days, continuing octreotide therapy is neither cost-effective nor prudent.","['Ippoliti, C', 'Neumann, J']","['Ippoliti C', 'Neumann J']","['M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Oncol Nurs Forum,Oncology nursing forum,7809033,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Diarrhea/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*complications', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia/complications/therapy', 'Lymphoma/complications/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Octreotide/*therapeutic use', 'Pilot Projects']",1998/06/30 00:00,1998/06/30 00:01,['1998/06/30 00:00'],"['1998/06/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/30 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/30 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncol Nurs Forum. 1998 Jun;25(5):873-8.,"['0 (Gastrointestinal Agents)', 'RWM8CCW8GP (Octreotide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Radical surgery, the current standard therapy, frequently necessitates the formation of a permanent colostomy and is associated with significant morbidity. For these reasons, alternatives to radical surgery have been sought. This review focuses on sphincter-sparing surgical modalities for distal rectal cancer. An extensive review of the literature on local excision alone, local excision plus postoperative radiation therapy (with or without chemotherapy), and local excision following preoperative chemoradiotherapy is presented. The design and interim results of the sole prospective multi-institution trial of local excision, Cancer and Leukemia Group B trial 8984, are also summarized. The literature on this subject, which is dominated by single-institution, retrospective reports, fails to support local excision as a superior or equal therapy to radical surgical excision for invasive distal rectal adenocarcinoma. The crucial question regarding the efficacy of radical surgical salvage for local recurrence following local excision also remains unanswered. We conclude that the role of local excision for invasive distal rectal adenocarcinoma remains undefined. If there is a future for this therapeutic modality, it will depend significantly on rigorous patient selection, provided that the efficacy of radical surgical salvage for local recurrence can be established.","['Weber, T K', 'Petrelli, N J']","['Weber TK', 'Petrelli NJ']","['Roswell Park Cancer Institute, State University of New York at Buffalo, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Oncology (Williston Park),"Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.)",8712059,IM,,"['Adenocarcinoma/drug therapy/radiotherapy/*surgery', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Forecasting', 'Humans', 'Postoperative Care', 'Preoperative Care', 'Prospective Studies', 'Rectal Neoplasms/drug therapy/radiotherapy/*surgery']",1998/06/30 00:00,1998/06/30 00:01,['1998/06/30 00:00'],"['1998/06/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/30 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/30 00:00 [entrez]']",['175684 [pii]'],ppublish,"Oncology (Williston Park). 1998 Jun;12(6):933-43; discussion 944, 947.",,,61,,,,,,,,,,,,

A case report and review of the literature.,224-30,"A patient with hypoplastic acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) who achieved remission with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) alone is reported. The 59-year-old male patient received antibiotics and G-CSF but not any antileukemic drugs because of ongoing pneumonia. After 2-week administration of G-CSF, he achieved complete remission and his pneumonia improved. Since leukemia relapsed after 3 months, he received G-CSF again for 5 weeks, but failed to be in remission this time. He underwent antileukemic chemotherapy and achieved second remission. When he suffered from a second relapse after 7 months, intensive chemotherapy was commenced but was stopped on the 2nd day since his general condition became very poor due to septicemia. He began to receive G-CSF again and achieved third complete remission after 3 weeks. In vitro studies showed that G-CSF did not stimulate proliferation of the patient's blast cells although they expressed G-CSF receptor on their surface. Moreover, G-CSF induced differentiation of the blast cells into segmented neutrophils in vitro. According to the literature, in all of the 12 patients with AML who were reported to achieve remission by G-CSF the course was complicated by infection, and 7 of the patients were diagnosed as hypoplastic acute leukemia. It is suggested that not G-CSF alone but G-CSF with infection could induce remission, which might be related to a differentiation effect of G-CSF in this case. G-CSF is not only safe but also useful for remission induction therapy in hypoplastic acute leukemia.","['Takamatsu, Y', 'Miyamoto, T', 'Iwasaki, H', 'Makino, S', 'Tamura, K']","['Takamatsu Y', 'Miyamoto T', 'Iwasaki H', 'Makino S', 'Tamura K']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Miyazaki Prefectural Hospital, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,IM,,"['Cell Count', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pneumonia/*complications', 'Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/analysis', '*Remission Induction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/06/30 02:01,2000/10/06 11:01,['1998/06/30 02:01'],"['1998/06/30 02:01 [pubmed]', '2000/10/06 11:01 [medline]', '1998/06/30 02:01 [entrez]']","['40844 [pii]', '10.1159/000040844 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 1998;99(4):224-30. doi: 10.1159/000040844.,"['0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Employing pentoxifylline (PTX), a phosphodiesterase inhibitor which could raise intracellular cAMP and modulate leukocyte activation, we sought to investigate if PTX could enhance tRA-induced promyelocytic leukemic cell differentiation but suppress tRA-augmented growth and activation of human granulocytes. tRA could significantly suppress clonal growth of U937 and HL-60 leukemic cells but enhanced the CFU-GM formation of normal bone marrow cells (22 +/- 6 vs. 90 +/- 16 CFU/well). PTX significantly augmented tRA suppression of clonal growth of U937 and HL-60 leukemic cells but suppressed tRA-augmented CFU-GM formation of normal bone marrow cells (90 +/- 16 vs. 25 +/- 9 CFU/well). In addition, PTX enhanced tRA-induced growth inhibition and differentiation of promyelocytic HL-60 leukemic cells, but suppressed respiratory burst activation by the immature granulocytic HL-60 cells and suppressed CD11b adhesion molecule expression by mature granulocytes. PTX similar to dibutyric cAMP promoted HL-60 myelocytic leukemic cell differentiation and growth inhibition, whereas PTX, in contrast to dibutyric cAMP which could augment phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-elicited respiratory burst activity by immature granulocytes, suppressed the PMA-elicited respiratory burst activity by immature and mature granulocytes. PTX did not raise the intracellular cAMP level of HL-60 cells, but partly suppressed the dibutyric cAMP-elicited elevation of intracellular cAMP level. Results from these studies suggest that PTX might act through different signaling pathways to enhance tRA-induced myelocytic leukemic cell differentiation but prevent from hyperreactive normal granulopoiesis and granulocyte activation.","['Yang, K D', 'Chao, C Y', 'Shaio, M F']","['Yang KD', 'Chao CY', 'Shaio MF']","[""Chang Gung Children's Hospital at Kaohsiung, Taiwan.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,IM,,"['Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'CD11 Antigens/analysis', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Clone Cells/cytology', 'Cyclic AMP/metabolism', 'Drug Synergism', 'Granulocytes/*cytology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Macrophages/*cytology', 'Pentoxifylline/*pharmacology', 'Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Respiratory Burst/drug effects', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",1998/06/30 02:01,2000/10/06 11:01,['1998/06/30 02:01'],"['1998/06/30 02:01 [pubmed]', '2000/10/06 11:01 [medline]', '1998/06/30 02:01 [entrez]']","['40838 [pii]', '10.1159/000040838 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 1998;99(4):191-9. doi: 10.1159/000040838.,"['0 (CD11 Antigens)', '0 (Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SD6QCT3TSU (Pentoxifylline)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A previously healthy 63 year old woman presented with a two month history of fatigue and a one week history of easy bruising. On admission she had oliguric acute renal failure, with marked elevation in serum uric acid and phosphate. A bone marrow biopsy showed AML M7 with fibrosis. The renal failure resolved with supportive care and institution of allopurinol therapy. Following this, AML induction chemotherapy resulted in complete remission. Her biochemical and clinical course were very similar to the classical ATLS seen in patients after chemotherapy. Therefore, this case represents a rare instance of acute renal failure from spontaneous ATLS, and in our opinion the first reported occurrence of spontaneous ATLS associated with AML.","['Lotfi, M', 'Brandwein, J M']","['Lotfi M', 'Brandwein JM']","[""Department of Medicine, St. Michael's Hospital, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,,"['Acute Kidney Injury/*etiology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cerebral Hemorrhage/etiology', 'Consciousness Disorders/etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypothyroidism/etiology', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/complications/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/etiology', 'Tumor Lysis Syndrome/*etiology']",1998/06/27 00:00,1998/06/27 00:01,['1998/06/27 00:00'],"['1998/06/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/27 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199809050923 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1998 May;29(5-6):625-8. doi: 10.3109/10428199809050923.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Further studies are needed to determine whether high-dose corticosteroids are also effective on the resolution of pleural effusions associated with other malignant disease.","['Hicsonmez, G', 'Cetin, M', 'Tunc, B', 'Tuncer, A M', 'Gumruk, F', 'Yenicesu, I']","['Hicsonmez G', 'Cetin M', 'Tunc B', 'Tuncer AM', 'Gumruk F', 'Yenicesu I']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology, Ihsan, Dogramaci Children's Hospital, Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Child', 'Dyspnea/etiology', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Glucocorticoids/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*complications', 'Male', 'Methylprednisolone/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Pleural Effusion, Malignant/*drug therapy/etiology/pathology']",1998/06/27 00:00,1998/06/27 00:01,['1998/06/27 00:00'],"['1998/06/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/27 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199809050922 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1998 May;29(5-6):617-23. doi: 10.3109/10428199809050922.,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', 'X4W7ZR7023 (Methylprednisolone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In cases of rearrangement of the light chains (variant translocations), a third breakpoint has been described at the 5' part of the bcl-2 locus (vcr). In the present case, we report the molecular analysis of an FL transformed into a blastic phase unresponsive to chemotherapy. Molecular studies revealed a typical bcl-2 rearrangement at the major locus (mbr). Vcr rearrangements was also observed with only a single restriction enzyme. At the same time, SSCP analysis of exon 5 of the p53 locus disclosed an abnormal conformer. Direct sequencing revealed a point mutation at codon 163 (A --> G).

Specific chromosome regions were translocated onto structurally abnormal chromosomes, resulting in partial tri-, tetra-, or pentasomy of these regions. We designated this type of chromosomal translocation as a ""segmental jumping translocation (SJT)"". These SJTs were found in several chromosomal regions such as 8q24, 9q34, 11q13, 11q23, 13q14, 14q24-q32, 21q22 and 22q11. The SJT at 9q34, which involved the ABL oncogene, was found in three of nine secondary leukemia patients who were treated with anticancer drugs and radiation. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients had 3-7 copies of SJT at 11q13 or 11q23. SJT at 14q32 and 21q22 were predominantly detected in the acute type of adult T-cell leukemia (8 of 27 patients) and in AML (5 of 17 patients). The size of the SJT regions varied among the patients. The overlapping region within the SJT could involve oncogene(s) associated with transformation to the advanced stage in leukemia and lymphoma patients. The SJT provides evidence of a new mechanism for gene amplification and formation of unidentified marker chromosomes in the advanced disease stage.","['Tanaka, K', 'Kamada, N']","['Tanaka K', 'Kamada N']","['Department of Cancer Cytogenetics, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,,"['Adult', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Crossing Over, Genetic', 'DNA Probes', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gene Amplification', 'Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/etiology/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/chemically induced/etiology/genetics/pathology', 'Oncogenes', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/biosynthesis', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1998/06/27 00:00,1998/06/27 00:01,['1998/06/27 00:00'],"['1998/06/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/27 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199809050916 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1998 May;29(5-6):563-75. doi: 10.3109/10428199809050916.,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eight patients in long-term (LT; 3 to 15 years) and 15 patients in short-term (ST; up to 3 years) remission were studied. Using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT) assay, the limit of detection was 10(-5) to 10(-6) for PML/RAR alpha transcript and 10(-4) to 10(-5) for the AML1/ETO transcript. Simultaneously, T lymphocyte subsets and NK cells from the peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) were investigated by flow cytometric analysis. Four of the eight patients in LT and 7 of the 15 patients in ST remission were MRD-positive. Although all MRD-positive patients in LT remission are still until now event-free, 3 of the 7 MRD-positive (MRD+) patients in ST remission soon relapsed. The total populations of CD4+, CD8+ and CD56+ [possible T-cell and natural killer (T/NK) populations] in the BM of ST patients and MRD+/LT patients were significantly (p < .01) low. The CD8+ CD28+ population showed the same tendency (p < .01-.02). The T/NK subsets in the BM of MRD-negative (MRD-) LT (MRD-/LT) patients showed similar numbers of cells as normal volunteers. Basically, the total percentage of the CD4+, CD8+ and CD56+ cell populations in the BM was increased and in the following order: MRD-/LT patients, normal volunteers, MRD+/LT patients and MRD+ or -/ST patients. The percentages of the T/NK-cell subsets in the PB were not significantly different among these groups. Thus, the difference of the possible T/NK-cell phenotype in the BM may strongly influence clinical and molecular remission. These results still remain to be confirmed by further studies of the functional anti-tumor immunity of T/NK cells of AML in remission.","['Inokuchi, K', 'Iwakiri, R', 'Futaki, M', 'Hanawa, H', 'Tanosaki, S', 'Nomura, T', 'Dan, K']","['Inokuchi K', 'Iwakiri R', 'Futaki M', 'Hanawa H', 'Tanosaki S', 'Nomura T', 'Dan K']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,,"['Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/mortality/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/mortality/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis/genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*analysis/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/analysis/genetics', 'Remission Induction', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*pathology', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factors/*analysis/genetics']",1998/06/27 00:00,1998/06/27 00:01,['1998/06/27 00:00'],"['1998/06/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/27 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199809050915 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1998 May;29(5-6):553-61. doi: 10.3109/10428199809050915.,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We looked for LRP overexpression, using immunocytochemistry with LRP 56 monoclonal antibody, on marrow slides from 41 cases of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). LRP overexpression (LRP+) was defined by expression of LRP 56 in at least 20% of marrow blasts. LRP overexpression was seen in 19 (46%) cases. Concordant results between LRP overexpression and P-glycoprotein (PGP) expression were seen in 66% of the cases (p = 0.03), and discordant results (LRP+ and PGP-, or LRP- and PGP+) in 33% of the cases. No correlation was seen between LRP overexpression and FAB type, karyotype, CD34, p53 expression and bcl2 overexpression in blasts. Furthermore, in the 18 cases treated with anthracycline-AraC intensive chemotherapy and the 7 cases treated with low dose AraC, the response rate was not significantly different in LRP+ and LRP- patients. Survival was also similar in LRP+ and LRP- patients. In conclusion, LRP overexpression is probably more frequent in MDS than in de novo AML and, as in AML, is only partially correlated with PGP expression. In our experience, however, LRP was not a prognostic factor for response to chemotherapy and survival in MDS.","['Lepelley, P', 'Poulain, S', 'Grardel, N', 'Preudhomme, C', 'Cosson, A', 'Fenaux, P']","['Lepelley P', 'Poulain S', 'Grardel N', 'Preudhomme C', 'Cosson A', 'Fenaux P']","[""Laboratorie d'Hematologie, CHU Lille, France.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Acute Disease', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Danazol/administration & dosage', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Life Tables', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis', 'Quinine/pharmacology', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/analysis', '*Vault Ribonucleoprotein Particles']",1998/06/27 00:00,1998/06/27 00:01,['1998/06/27 00:00'],"['1998/06/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/27 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199809050914 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1998 May;29(5-6):547-51. doi: 10.3109/10428199809050914.,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Vault Ribonucleoprotein Particles)', '0 (major vault protein)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'A7V27PHC7A (Quinine)', 'N29QWW3BUO (Danazol)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Median age of patients was 55 years in both groups. In dys-AML, the median leukocyte count (p = 0.04), peripheral blast (p = 0.02) and medullary blast cell count (p < 0.001) were significantly decreased, whereas the median platelet count (p - 0.04) was increased. Immunophenotyping demonstrated that leukemic blast cells in dys-AML more frequently expressed the adhesion molcules CD54 (p = 0.05) and CD58 (p = 0.08) than leukemic cells in non-dys-AML. Cytogenetically, we distinguished two karyotypic patterns, one group with a normal karyotype or prognostically favorable single chromosome aberrations (""P(0)-karyotype""), and another one with unfavorable single aberrations or complex aberrations (""P(1)-karyotype""). The incidence of these groups was not significantly different between dys-AML and non-dys-AML. Complete remission rate (CRR) after induction chemotherapy (p = 0.03) and overall survival time (OS; p = 0.03) were significantly lower in dys-AML. In addition, median disease free survival (DFS; p = n.s.) was inferior compared to non-dys-AML. In the dys-AML as well as in the non-dys-AML patient group, CRR, DFS, and OS were decreased in the P(1)-compared to the P(0)-subgroup.

The underlying mechanism has been unclear because the neoplastic cells are usually present in the bone marrow, where they are in a position to produce short range effects on bone resorption which are difficult to identify. This contrasts with the situation in hypercalcemia associated with non-metastatic carcinoma, where it has been clearly demonstrated that the most common cause is release from the tumor of a humoral mediator, Parathyroid Hormone-related Protein (PTHrP). Roles have been advocated in multiple myeloma for release of a number of other cytokines with osteolytic capacity on the basis of their enhancement of osteolytic activity in cultured fetal rat bone, although a causal relationship in patients has not been established. PTHrP has more recently been implicated in the genesis of hypercalcemia in patients with hematological malignancies by the demonstration in a proportion of cases of increased circulating levels of PTHrP, comparable to those in hypercalcemia due to cancer. Immunohistochemical studies indicate neoplastic hemopoietic cells can contain PTHrP, and thus have the capacity to act in a paracrine manner to enhance local bone resorption and contribute to the development of hypercalcemia.","['Firkin, F', 'Schneider, H', 'Grill, V']","['Firkin F', 'Schneider H', 'Grill V']","[""University of Melbourne Department of Medicine, St. Vincent's Hospital, Fitzroy, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,,"['Animals', 'Bone Resorption', 'Bone and Bones/cytology/embryology', 'Calcitriol/blood', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/physiology', 'Fetal Proteins/physiology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications/physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Hypercalcemia/*etiology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*physiology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Organ Specificity', 'Osteoblasts/pathology', 'Osteoclasts/pathology', 'Osteolysis/etiology/physiopathology', 'Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein', 'Proteins/*physiology', 'Rats']",1998/06/27 00:00,1998/06/27 00:01,['1998/06/27 00:00'],"['1998/06/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/27 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199809050909 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1998 May;29(5-6):499-506. doi: 10.3109/10428199809050909.,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Fetal Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PTHLH protein, human)', '0 (Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein)', '0 (Proteins)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",,44,,,,,,,,,,,,

Occasionally, however, EBV infects T-cells and natural killer (NK) cells, and infection of these cells has been associated with the development of leukemias and lymphomas. EBV-positive lymphoproliferative disorders of NK cells have been reported with increasing frequency, but the interactions between EBV and NK cells are not fully understood, in part because NK cells are not usually infected with EBV in vitro. The lymphoma-derived EBV-positive NK cell line, YT, has been useful in the study of EBV infection of NK cells. YT cells express the EBV-associated nuclear antigen (EBNA)-1, the latent membrane protein (LMP)-1, and LMP-2A, but not EBNA-2 and LMP-2B genes. This pattern of latent gene expression is compatible with a type II latency program, normally associated with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, Hodgkin's disease, and T-cell lymphoma.

Accordingly, oncologists have tried to improve anticancer agent/target interactions by increasing the intracellular dose of active effectors. However, a growing body of evidence stemming from both clinical and experimental observations, strongly suggests that similar anticancer-induced lesions may result in different cellular responses, greatly influencing cytotoxicity. For example, it has been shown that in some but not all cellular models, antitumor agents trigger apoptosis, an irreversible process which leads to a rapid and complete elimination of tumor cells. Several of these studies also demonstrated that apoptosis induced by antitumor agents is highly regulated by multiple signaling pathways which are themselves influenced by oncogenes, protein kinase activities, external stimuli and the oxidative balance. Therefore, it appears that cell death commitment is controlled by both external and internal factors which interfere downstream of drug- or ionizing radiation-target interaction. The characterization of these mediators may provide novel strategies for modulating intracellular signaling pathways in order to promote apoptosis in drug-resistant tumor cells.","['Jaffrezou, J P', 'Bettaieb, A', 'Levade, T', 'Laurent, G']","['Jaffrezou JP', 'Bettaieb A', 'Levade T', 'Laurent G']","['CJF INSERM 9503, Centre Claudius Regaud, Toulouse, France. jaffrezou@regaud-tlse.fnclcc.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*pathology', 'Models, Biological', 'Necrosis', 'Neoplasm Proteins/physiology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Oncogenes', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Signal Transduction', 'Topoisomerase I Inhibitors', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/06/27 00:00,1998/06/27 00:01,['1998/06/27 00:00'],"['1998/06/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/27 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199809050905 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1998 May;29(5-6):453-63. doi: 10.3109/10428199809050905.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)']",,101,,,,,,,,,,,,

The major cellular sources producing IL-12 are antigen-stimulated monocytes, macrophages, and B-cells isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Our laboratory has investigated the regulation of IL-12 gene expression in both cord blood and adult PBMC, and the effects of IL-12 on induction of IFN-gamma production, NK, and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cytotoxicity. IL-12 mRNA expression and protein production in LPS-stimulated cord blood MNC were 3-4 fold decreased when compared with adult PBMC. There were no differences between cord blood and adult PBMC in both basal levels of transcription or the degree of transcriptional activation of the IL-12 gene. Additionally, the half-life of IL-12 p40 mRNA was 3-fold lower in activated cord blood compared to adult PBMC. Exogenous IL-12 induced a significant increase of IFN-gamma from both cord and adult PBMC. Cord MNC has significantly reduced levels of NK activity, and IL-12 significantly enhanced cord blood NK cytotoxicity up to similar levels in adult PBMC. IL-12 also significantly enhanced cord blood NK and LAK activities against a broad range of neuroblastoma, leukemia, and lymphoma cell lines. Lower doses of IL-12 and IL-15 concomitantly generated either synergistic or additive effects on cord blood NK and LAK cytotoxicities. In light of the important biological functions of IL-12, reduced expression and production of IL-12 from activated cord blood may contribute to the immaturity of cord blood cellular immunity and contribute, in part, to decreased severe graft vs. host disease following unrelated cord blood stem cell transplantation. IL-12 enhancement of IFN-gamma, NK, and LAK activity in activated cord blood MNC up to comparable levels in adult PBMC suggests that exogenous IL-12 stimulation can compensate for the immaturity in cord blood cellular immunity. These characteristics of IL-12 biological activity strongly suggest its potential usefulness in future cancer immunotherapy.","['Lee, S M', 'Suen, Y', 'Qian, J', 'Knoppel, E', 'Cairo, M S']","['Lee SM', 'Suen Y', 'Qian J', 'Knoppel E', 'Cairo MS']","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology and Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Children's Hospital of Orange County, Orange, CA, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Fetal Blood/immunology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Interleukin-12/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Interleukin-15/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/drug effects/immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/06/27 00:00,1998/06/27 00:01,['1998/06/27 00:00'],"['1998/06/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/27 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199809050903 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1998 May;29(5-6):427-38. doi: 10.3109/10428199809050903.,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",,79,,,,,,,,,,,,

SIVmnd pol sequence analysis indicates that the six strains present in the colony belong to the SIVmnd lentivirus subgroup previously defined according to the only available prototype sequence (SIVmndGB1), which originated from the same colony. The intraanimal nucleotide diversity (1.1-3.1%) was similar in range to that reported in individuals infected by other HIV/SIVs. The interanimal diversity (0.5-4.3%) was not significantly different from that observed in each individual mandrill, indicating an epidemiological link among the SIVmnd isolates of distinct animals within the colony. Phylogenetic analysis of these isolates, together with seroepidemiological and behavior surveillance within the colony, indicates a predominant male-to-male transmission of SIVmnd that probably occurred during bouts of interanimal aggression. Moreover, our results suggest one case of vertical transmission of SIVmnd from a naturally infected founder female to one of her six offspring. The first genetic analysis of STLV isolates from mandrills is also reported here. Partial tax/rex sequences were used to evaluate the diversity between seven STLVmnd isolates and their phylogenetic relationships with other known strains of human and nonhuman primate T cell leukemia virus, types I and II (PTLV-I/II). They all belong to the PTLV-I subtype, but two genetically distinct STLVmnd groups were evidenced within the mandrill colony. The phylogenetic analyses of the STLVmnd isolates, together with seroepidemiological and behavior surveillance of the mandrills, indicate that intracolony transmissions of STLVmnd are also predominantly the result of male-to-male aggressive contacts.","['Nerrienet, E', 'Amouretti, X', 'Muller-Trutwin, M C', 'Poaty-Mavoungou, V', 'Bedjebaga, I', 'Nguyen, H T', 'Dubreuil, G', 'Corbet, S', 'Wickings, E J', 'Barre-Sinoussi, F', 'Georges, A J', 'Georges-Courbot, M C']","['Nerrienet E', 'Amouretti X', 'Muller-Trutwin MC', 'Poaty-Mavoungou V', 'Bedjebaga I', 'Nguyen HT', 'Dubreuil G', 'Corbet S', 'Wickings EJ', 'Barre-Sinoussi F', 'Georges AJ', 'Georges-Courbot MC']","['Centre International de Recherches Medicales de Franceville, Gabon.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses,AIDS research and human retroviruses,8709376,IM,,"['*Aggression', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Behavior, Animal', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/transmission/*veterinary/virology', 'Female', 'Genes, pX', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monkey Diseases/*transmission/virology', 'Papio/*virology', 'Phylogeny', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Seroepidemiologic Studies', 'Simian Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*transmission/virology', 'Simian Immunodeficiency Virus/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Simian T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/isolation & purification']",1998/06/27 00:00,1998/06/27 00:01,['1998/06/27 00:00'],"['1998/06/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/27 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/aid.1998.14.785 [doi]'],ppublish,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses. 1998 Jun 10;14(9):785-96. doi: 10.1089/aid.1998.14.785.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cell growth was measured and myeloid differentiation was tested on consecutive days over the whole course of culture. RESULTS: PGE2 and ATRA synergistically induced the myeloid differentiation of NB4 cells. In comparison with ATRA alone, the combination of PGE2 with ATRA caused an almost 20-fold decrease of effective concentration of ATRA. CONCLUSION: The combination of ATRA and PGE2 at an appropriate ratio may provide a convenient oral regimen of combined differentiation therapy for a better clinical outcome in APL patients.","['Chen, Z', 'Breitman, T R']","['Chen Z', 'Breitman TR']","['Institute of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Suzhou Medical College, Jiangsu Province, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Dinoprostone/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/06/27 00:00,1998/06/27 00:01,['1998/06/27 00:00'],"['1998/06/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/27 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/27 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 1997 Oct;110(10):783-8.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor or stem cell factor (SCF) alone could stimulate proliferation of HML/SE cells, however interleukin-3, interleukin-6, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and thrombopoietin could not. Although erythropoietin (EPO) alone stimulated neither proliferation nor differentiation of HML/SE cells, it did stimulate proliferation of HML/SE cells and production of hemoglobin in the presence of SCF. SCF activated the human EPO receptor promoter and induced EPO receptor gene expression. Given these results, we speculate that HML/SE cells acquired responsiveness to EPO via the EPO receptor induced by SCF. Mutation analysis of putative transcription factor binding sites in the human EPO receptor promoter suggested that Sp1, rather than the GATA-1 binding site, contributed to the induction of the hEPOR gene. Although it is well documented that hematopoietic stem cells and primitive progenitors require both an early-acting cytokine and a lineage-specific cytokine to differentiate to a certain lineage, related mechanisms are not well understood. HML/SE may serve as an excellent model system to analyze functions of early-acting cytokine SCF and lineage-specific cytokine EPO related to proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells.","['Sato, T', 'Watanabe, S', 'Ishii, E', 'Tsuji, K', 'Nakahata, T']","['Sato T', 'Watanabe S', 'Ishii E', 'Tsuji K', 'Nakahata T']","['Department of Clinical Oncology, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,,"['Antigens, Surface/immunology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Erythropoietin/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/*genetics', 'Stem Cell Factor/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/06/27 00:00,1998/06/27 00:01,['1998/06/27 00:00'],"['1998/06/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/27 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/27 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.273.27.16921 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)80628-7 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1998 Jul 3;273(27):16921-6. doi: 10.1074/jbc.273.27.16921.,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a model system to study the response of cells to oxidative insults, glutamate toxicity on a mouse nerve cell line, HT-22, was examined. Glutamate exposure kills HT-22 via a nonreceptor-mediated oxidative pathway by blocking cystine uptake and causing depletion of intracellular glutathione (GSH), leading to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and, ultimately, apoptotic cell death. Several HT-22 subclones that are 10-fold resistant to exogenous glutamate were isolated and the mechanisms involved in resistance characterized. The expression levels of neither heat shock proteins nor apoptosis-related proteins are changed in the resistant cells. In contrast, the antioxidant enzyme catalase, but not glutathione peroxidase nor superoxide dismutase, is more highly expressed in the resistant than in the parental cells. In addition, the resistant cells have enhanced rates of GSH regeneration due to higher activities of the GSH metabolic enzymes gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase and GSH reductase, and GSH S-transferases activities are also elevated. As a consequence of these alterations, the glutamate resistant cells are also more resistant to organic hydroperoxides and anticancer drugs that affect these GSH enzymes. These results indicate that resistance to apoptotic oxidative stress may be acquired by coordinated changes in multiple antioxidant pathways.","['Sagara, Y', 'Dargusch, R', 'Chambers, D', 'Davis, J', 'Schubert, D', 'Maher, P']","['Sagara Y', 'Dargusch R', 'Chambers D', 'Davis J', 'Schubert D', 'Maher P']","['The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, San Diego, CA 92186-5800, USA. sagara@salk.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Free Radic Biol Med,Free radical biology & medicine,8709159,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antioxidants/metabolism', 'Biological Transport', 'Catalase/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cystathionine/metabolism', 'Cystine/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance', 'Glutamate-Cysteine Ligase/metabolism', 'Glutamic Acid/pharmacology', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/analysis', 'Homocysteine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Oxidative Stress/*physiology', 'Oxidoreductases/analysis', '*Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-CH Group Donors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'Time Factors', 'Up-Regulation/genetics', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",1998/06/26 00:00,1998/06/26 00:01,['1998/06/26 00:00'],"['1998/06/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/26 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/26 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0891-5849(97)00457-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0891-5849(97)00457-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Free Radic Biol Med. 1998 Jun;24(9):1375-89. doi: 10.1016/s0891-5849(97)00457-7.,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0LVT1QZ0BA (Homocysteine)', '1001-13-4 (homocysteic acid)', '375YFJ481O (Cystathionine)', '3KX376GY7L (Glutamic Acid)', '48TCX9A1VT (Cystine)', 'EC 1.- (Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'EC 1.3.- (Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-CH Group Donors)', 'EC 1.3.1.24 (biliverdin reductase)', 'EC 6.3.2.2 (Glutamate-Cysteine Ligase)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",,,"['1 F32 NS10032/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS28121/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01NS09658/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

This makes it difficult to eliminate BLV infection from herds using serological assays only. Whether or not polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a useful tool to complement serological Ab-assays in BLV-eradication in herds was clarified in three ways: (i) different DNA-quick-preparations of blood were examined in nested PCR, (ii) cows of a BLV infected herd that was involved in a national eradication program were investigated for 6 months und (iii) BLV-provirus-variants occurring in this herd were differentiated. The results show, that even by using PCR it was not possible to detect all infected animals all the time and that eradication of BLV from this herd was not completed in this short time. The PCR is useful for the investigation of herds and more sensitive than ELISA. PCR using LTR-primers (34 positive cattle) was more sensitive than PCR with env-primers (30 positive cattle). Using PCR 34 BLV infected cattle were detected of which only 21 reacted in ELISA. Restriction enzyme analysis or sequence analysis of PCR-amplificates allowed the detection of virus variants and conclusions about the way of infection. PCR should be used for BLV-eradication in cattle herds with low BLV-incidence, for the investigation of new outbreaks or tumor cases in long term BLV free herds and for investigation of breeding cattle.","['Blankenstein, P', 'Fechner, H', 'Looman, A C', 'Beier, D', 'Marquardt, O', 'Ebner, D']","['Blankenstein P', 'Fechner H', 'Looman AC', 'Beier D', 'Marquardt O', 'Ebner D']","['Institut fur Virologie, FB Veterinarmedizin, Freie Universitat, Berlin.']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Berl Munch Tierarztl Wochenschr,Berliner und Munchener tierarztliche Wochenschrift,0003163,IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Base Sequence', 'Cattle', 'DNA, Viral/*chemistry/isolation & purification', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*diagnosis', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*isolation & purification', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",1998/06/26 00:00,1998/06/26 00:01,['1998/06/26 00:00'],"['1998/06/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/26 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/26 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Berl Munch Tierarztl Wochenschr. 1998 May;111(5):180-6.,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",Polymerase Kettenreaktion (PCR) zum Nachweis von BLV-Provirus--praktikable Erganzung der BLV-Diagnostik?,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GPIV in inactive platelet from CML was 36080 +/- 17010 molecules/platelet as compared with 13190 +/- 4810 from the controls (P < 0.01). No abnormality was found in the distribution of platelet membrane GPIb and GPIIb/IIIa (P > 0.05).

The difference in the release of intracellular alpha-granule TSP between CML and the control group was not found (P > 0.05). There was no direct correlation between GPIV expression and TSP binding after platelet activation. The high levels of beta-TG and PF4 in sera inhibited release of intracellular alpha-granule TSP in vitro. These results indicate that the abnormality of platelet membrane GPIV is a common marker in CML, therefore the specific increase of platelet GPIV in patients with CML may be a useful tool for the diagnosis and monitoring of the platelet dysfunction.

Complement receptor type 1 (CR1) is a marker for a readily mobilizable secretory vesicle compartment, which can undergo exocytic fusion with the plasma membrane independently of secretion of traditional granule contents. The basis for the formation of these distinct compartments is incompletely understood. Primary and secondary granules are generated directly from the Golgi complex during different stages of development of the cell, obviating the need for sorting signals for proper packaging of their constituents. To determine whether the secretory vesicles are formed in a similar manner, we studied a stable rat basophilic leukemia cell line (RBL-CR1) transfected with a plasmid containing the cDNA of human CR1 driven by a viral promoter. The CR1 was present primarily intracellularly in small vesicles resembling the CR1 storage pools in resting PMN. Activation of RBL-CR1 resulted in translocation of intracellular CR1 to the plasma membrane, with mobilization requirements different from those of the classical RBL granules. Thus, in RBL-CR1, continuously synthesized CR1 is stored and upregulated in much the same way as in PMN. This suggests that differential timing of gene expression is not essential for proper storage of CR1 and that other sorting mechanisms are involved, which can be studied in RBL-transfectants.","['Jost, C', 'Klickstein, L', 'Wetzler, E', 'Kumar, A', 'Berger, M']","['Jost C', 'Klickstein L', 'Wetzler E', 'Kumar A', 'Berger M']","['Department of Pediatrics, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, OH, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Membrane/*metabolism', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Complement/*biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/06/25 00:00,1998/06/25 00:01,['1998/06/25 00:00'],"['1998/06/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/25 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)30065-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Jul 1;92(1):300-9.,"['0 (Receptors, Complement)']",,,['AI 22687/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

We have characterized B-cell development in these mice before the onset of clinical disease to determine the steps involved in leukemogenesis. Flow cytometry reveals that the CD45R+CD43(+)CD24(+)BP-1(+) late pro-B-cell population is markedly expanded in the bone marrow of 3- to 5-week-old Emu-ret mice. Compared with late pro-B cells from transgene-negative mice, Emu-ret late pro-B cells have a limited capacity to differentiate in interleukin (IL)-7 and a higher incidence of VDJ rearrangements, but a similar cell cycle profile. In contrast, CD45R+CD43(+)CD24(+)BP-1(-) early pro-B cells from 3- to 5-week-old Emu-ret mice, which also express the RFP/RET transgene, differentiate in IL-7 similarly to their normal counterparts. Furthermore, early pro-B cells from Emu-ret and transgene-negative mice have an identical pattern of growth inhibition when exposed to interferons (IFNs)-alpha/beta and -gamma, whereas, pro-B-cell leukemia lines derived from Emu-ret mice are markedly less sensitive to growth inhibition by these IFNs. In 13-week-old well-appearing Emu-ret mice, late pro-B cells upregulate CYCLIN D1 expression and downregulate CASPASE-1 expression in a pattern that correlates with the emergence of B precursor cells in the peripheral blood and the loss of other B lineage subsets in the bone marrow. Taken together, these results suggest that the expression of the RFP/RET transgene initially prevents the normal elimination of late pro-B cells with nonproductive rearrangements. Secondary events that simultaneously disturb the normal transcriptional regulation of genes involved in the control of the cell cycle and apoptosis may allow for subsequent malignant transformation within the expanded late pro-B-cell population.","['Wasserman, R', 'Zeng, X X', 'Hardy, R R']","['Wasserman R', 'Zeng XX', 'Hardy RR']","[""Division of Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', 'Caspase 1', 'Cyclin D1/genetics', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/genetics', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', '*Drosophila Proteins', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/immunology/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases']",1998/06/25 00:00,1998/06/25 00:01,['1998/06/25 00:00'],"['1998/06/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/25 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)30062-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Jul 1;92(1):273-82.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Trim27 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Ret protein, Drosophila)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Ret protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.36 (Caspase 1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to determine if the NF1 gene was involved in the pathogenesis of JMML in children without a clinical diagnosis of NF1. An in vitro transcription and translation system was used to screen JMML marrows from 20 children for NF1 mutations that resulted in a truncated protein. Single-stranded conformational polymorphism analysis was used to detect RAS point mutations in these samples. We confirmed mutations of NF1 in three leukemias, one of which also showed loss of the normal NF1 allele. An NF1 mutation was detected in normal tissue from the only patient tested and this suggests that JMML may be the presenting feature of NF1 in some children. Activating RAS mutations were found in four patients; as expected, none of these samples harbored NF1 mutations. Because 10% to 14% of children with JMML have a clinical diagnosis of NF1, these data are consistent with the existence of NF1 mutations in approximately 30% of JMML cases.","['Side, L E', 'Emanuel, P D', 'Taylor, B', 'Franklin, J', 'Thompson, P', 'Castleberry, R P', 'Shannon, K M']","['Side LE', 'Emanuel PD', 'Taylor B', 'Franklin J', 'Thompson P', 'Castleberry RP', 'Shannon KM']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*genetics/physiopathology', 'Male', '*Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/physiopathology', 'Neurofibromatosis 1/*genetics/physiopathology', 'Neurofibromin 1', 'Proteins/*genetics']",1998/06/25 00:00,1998/06/25 00:01,['1998/06/25 00:00'],"['1998/06/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/25 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)30061-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Jul 1;92(1):267-72.,"['0 (Neurofibromin 1)', '0 (Proteins)']",,,"['CA 60407/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA72614/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Our objectives in this study were to determine the relationship between in vitro resistance to prednisolone (PRD) measured with the colorimetric methyl-thiazol-tetrazolium (MTT) assay, and (1) short-term clinical response to systemic PRD monotherapy, (2) long-term clinical outcome after combination chemotherapy within all patients and within the subgroups of clinical good and poor responders to PRD, and (3) in vitro resistance to 12 other drugs in 166 children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The 12 clinical poor PRD responders had ALL cells that were median 88-fold more in vitro resistant to PRD than 131 good responders (P = .013). Within all patients, increased in vitro resistance to PRD predicted a significantly worse long-term clinical outcome, at analyses with and without stratification for clinical PRD response, and at multivariate analysis (P </= .001). Within both the clinical good and poor responder subgroups, increased in vitro resistance to PRD was associated with a worse outcome, which was significant within the group of clinical good responders (P < .001). LC50 values, ie, lethal concentrations to 50% of ALL cells, for PRD and each other drug correlated significantly with those of all other 12 drugs, with an average correlation coefficient of 0.44 (standard deviation 0.05). The highest correlations were found between structurally related drugs. In conclusion, in vitro resistance to PRD was significantly related to the short-term and long-term clinical response to chemotherapy, the latter also within the subgroup of clinical good responders to PRD.

This instability is reflected in a high mutation rate of microsatellites, and recent studies in colon cancer indicate that defects in MMR result in frequent frameshift mutations in mononucleotide repeats located in the coding regions of BAX and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) receptor genes. Circumstantial evidence suggests that the MMR defect may be involved in some lymphoid malignancies, although several allelotype analyses have concluded on the low level of microsatellite instability in acute lymphoblastic leukemias. To further evaluate the implication of MMR defects in leukemogenesis, we have studied a series of 98 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 14 leukemic cell lines using several indicators of MMR defects. Microsatellite markers were compared between blast and normal DNA from the same patients and mutations were sought in mononucleotide repeat sequences of BAX and TGF-beta receptor II (TGF-beta RII). The absence of microsatellite instability (MI) and the absence of mutations in the genes examined from patient's leukemic cells contrasted with the observation that half of the cell lines displayed a high degree of MI and that three of seven of these mutator cell lines harbored mutations in BAX and/or TGF-beta RII.

It also affects hormone secretion, cell differentiation, and proliferation by a mode of action that involves stereospecific interaction with an intracellular vitamin D receptor (VDR). We recently found that retinoids, which are vitamin A derivatives, exert anticoagulant effects by upregulating thrombomodulin (TM) and downregulating tissue factor (TF) expression in acute promyelocytic leukemia cells and monoblastic leukemia cells. Both the VDR and retinoid receptors belong to the same family of receptors. A heterodimer consisting of the retinoid X receptor and the VDR binds to vitamin D responsive elements on genes regulated by vitamin D. To determine whether 1,25(OH)2D3 would exhibit anticoagulant effects similar to retinoids, we measured the antigen level, activity, and mRNA level of TM and TF in human leukemic cells, vascular endothelial cells, and monocytes treated with 1,25(OH)2D3. We found that 1,25(OH)2D3 upregulates antigen expression, activity, and mRNA levels of TM and downregulates antigen expression, activity, and mRNA levels of TF in human monocytic leukemia cells, some acute myelogenous leukemia cells, and monocytes, but not in umbilical vein endothelial cells. Transient transfection studies with reporter plasmids in monocytic leukemia cells and mobility gel-shift assay showed interaction with 1,25(OH)2D3 and functional retinoic acid responsive elements present in the 5'-flanking region of the TM gene. However, auxiliary factors or other elements in the TM gene may contribute to VDR specificity and transactivation of the gene in specific target cells. These findings indicate that 1,25(OH)2D3 resembles the retinoids in its control of the transcription of the TM and TF genes in human monocytic cells. Analogs of 1,25(OH)2D3 with anticoagulant activity may serve as adjunctive antithrombotic agents in monocytic leukemia and atherosclerotic disease.","['Koyama, T', 'Shibakura, M', 'Ohsawa, M', 'Kamiyama, R', 'Hirosawa, S']","['Koyama T', 'Shibakura M', 'Ohsawa M', 'Kamiyama R', 'Hirosawa S']","['School of Allied Health Sciences and the First Department of Internal Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan. intlkoya.mtec@med.tmd.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Anticoagulants/*pharmacology', 'Blood Coagulation/*drug effects', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*physiopathology', 'Monocytes/*drug effects/*physiology', 'Thrombomodulin/*biosynthesis/genetics']",1998/06/25 00:00,1998/06/25 00:01,['1998/06/25 00:00'],"['1998/06/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/25 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)30047-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Jul 1;92(1):160-7.,"['0 (Anticoagulants)', '0 (Thrombomodulin)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Next, we evaluated the effect on the PCAs of the NB4 parental cells of three synthetic retinoid analogues, ie: AM580 (selective for the retinoic acid receptor [RAR] alpha), capable to induce the granulocytic differentiation of NB4 cells; and CD2019 (selective for RARbeta) and CD437 (selective for RARgamma), both lacking this capability. Cells were treated with either ATRA or the analogues (10(-6) to 10(-8) mol/L) for 96 hours. The effect on cell differentiation was evaluated by morphologic changes, cell proliferation, nitro blue tetrazolium reduction assay, and flow cytometry analysis of the CD33 and CD11b surface-antigen expression. PCA was first measured in 20 mmol/L Veronal Buffer cell extracts by the one-stage clotting assay of normal and FVII-deficient plasmas. Further TF and CP have been characterized and quantified in cell-sample preparations by chromogenic and immunological assays. In the first series of experiments, ATRA downregulates both TF and CP in NB4 parental cells, as expected. However, in the differentiation-resistant cell lines, it induced a significant loss of TF but had little or no effect on CP. In a second series of experiments, in the NB4 parental cells, the RARalpha agonist (AM580) induced cell maturation and reduced 91% CP expression, whereas CD437 and CD2019 had no cyto-differentiating effects and did not affect CP levels. On the other hand, in the same cells the TF expression was reduced by ATRA and AM580, but also by the RARbeta agonist CD2019, which did not induce cell maturation. These data indicate that in NB4 cells, ATRA modulation of CP occurs in parallel with signs of cell differentiation, while the regulation of TF appears to be at least in part independent from these processes, and involves both alpha and beta nuclear retinoid receptors.","['Falanga, A', 'Consonni, R', 'Marchetti, M', 'Locatelli, G', 'Garattini, E', 'Passerini, C G', 'Gordon, S G', 'Barbui, T']","['Falanga A', 'Consonni R', 'Marchetti M', 'Locatelli G', 'Garattini E', 'Passerini CG', 'Gordon SG', 'Barbui T']","['Hematology Division, Ospedali Riuniti, Bergamo, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Thromboplastin/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/06/25 00:00,1998/06/25 00:01,['1998/06/25 00:00'],"['1998/06/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/25 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)30045-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Jul 1;92(1):143-51.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9035-58-9 (Thromboplastin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.26 (cancer procoagulant)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We searched for immediate-early cytokine responsive genes by the mRNA differential display technique using interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent OTT-1 cells, and have isolated a novel cDNA which encodes 210 amino acids and shows 87% amino acid identity to human SNAP-23 (synaptosomal-associated protein of 23 kD). The message for this protein (mouse SNAP-23) was induced in OTT-1 cells by IL-3, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and IL-5. The experiment using C-terminal deletion mutants of the common beta subunit (betac) of IL-3/GM-CSF/IL-5 receptors showed that expression of SNAP-23 was associated with the Ras-Raf-MAPK pathway, but not with the JAK-STAT pathway. Moreover, SNAP-23 was induced in response to a wide variety of cytokines, including IL-2, IL-3, IL-5, IL-10, stem cell factor, G-CSF, GM-CSF, leukemia inhibitory factor, and erythropoietin.

Histological examination revealed that hematopoietic cells were decreased in the liver of homozygous embryos, although they were composed of erythroid, myeloid, monocytic, and megakaryocytic cells with normal differentiation. Colony-forming assays using cells from fetal livers and yolk sacs showed that the number of colonies was markedly reduced and many of the colonies delayed to be recognized in Mllmu/mu embryos, although some of the colonies from Mllmu/mu embryos developed similarly with that from Mll+/+ and Mll+/mu embryos, suggesting the delayed onset of the proliferation of hematopoitic precursors.

We examined the effect of GVH reaction on the host hematopoiesis in the murine parent-into-F1 (P1 --> F1) model of GVHD. The systemic transfer of 5 x 10(7) of C57BL/6 (B6) splenocytes into (B6xDBA/2)F1 mice (BDF1), which results in acute GVHD, reduced the peripheral blood cell counts, the number of BM cells, and colony-forming unit-granulocyte macrophage (CFU-GM), whereas the injection of 10(8) of DBA/2 cells into BDF1, which results in chronic GVHD, did not affect hematopoiesis 2 weeks after the transfer. To clarify the mechanism of such myelosuppression, we examined the Fas expression in both hematopoietic progenitor cells as well as whole BM cells. The Fas expressions in each fraction significantly increased in BDF1 mice 2 weeks after the induction of acute GVHD, whereas no such effects were observed in the BDF1 mice with chronic GVHD. Furthermore, when such BM cells were incubated with anti-Fas antibody (Jo2), which induces apoptosis through Fas, the fraction of apoptotic cells increased and the number of CFU-GM decreased significantly. The in vivo administration of neutralizing anti-FasL antibody into BDF1 mice receiving with B6 spleen cells thus protected the host mice from BM failure. These results indicate that the functional expression of Fas on hematopoietic cells plays an essential role in the myelosuppressive effect of GVHD.","['Mori, T', 'Nishimura, T', 'Ikeda, Y', 'Hotta, T', 'Yagita, H', 'Ando, K']","['Mori T', 'Nishimura T', 'Ikeda Y', 'Hotta T', 'Yagita H', 'Ando K']","['Division of Hematology, the Departments of Internal Medicine and Immunology, Research Center for Genetic Engineering and Cell Transplantation, Tokai University School of Medicine, Kanagawa, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*immunology', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*blood/immunology/*pathology', 'Hematopoiesis/immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology/*pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Leukocytes/immunology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'fas Receptor/*immunology']",1998/06/25 00:00,1998/06/25 00:01,['1998/06/25 00:00'],"['1998/06/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/25 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)30040-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Jul 1;92(1):101-7.,['0 (fas Receptor)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report an APL patient who received high-dose chemotherapy and peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) autograft in second hematologic remission. Two leukaphereses that tested PML/RAR alpha positive by RT-PCR were obtained during the post-reinduction hematopoietic recovery, while the patient also tested PCR positive in the BM, and was reinfused after myeloablative chemotherapy (BUCY4), when the patient had spontaneously converted to PCR negative in the marrow. At present, he remains in continuous molecular and hematologic remission 22 months after PBSC transplantation. This is the second report of an APL patient who was transplanted in molecular remission with a PML/RAR alpha-positive PBSC autograft. As in the previous report, the prolonged clinical and molecular remission experienced post-transplant suggests that autologous PBSC infusion is still worthy of consideration for patients with APL in spite of the detection of PML/RAR alpha-positive cells in the PBSC collections.

Of 19 patients, a single individual achieved a durable complete remission. The mechanism of this action by murine anti-Tac has not been defined. We examined the hypothesis that the maintenance of the long-term response after treatment might be related to induction of a network of anti-idiotypic antibodies, as proposed in other tumor settings. In contrast to anti-Tac non-responders, the patient was found to have produced a human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) response, and specifically an anti-idiotypic (Ab2) response, that was readily detectable by standard assays 4 years after treatment. Using phage display antibody libraries, this response was shown to be monoclonal, consisting of a single IgG1,kappa antibody of moderate affinity. No evidence was found for anti-anti-idiotypic (Ab3) antibodies with reactivity for sTac, which might alternatively have maintained an autogenic human anti-Tac antibody response. An area of limited homology was noted between the Ab2 antibody and the IL2R in the domain of IL2 binding, but no binding of Ab2 to IL2 could be shown that might have reduced endogenous ligand (IL2) concentrations. Similarly, no anti-anti-idiotypic (T3) T cell response was detected. Thus, we are unable to confirm features of idiotypy that could suggest a role in maintaining an anti-tumor response by anti-Tac antibody therapy.","['Kingsbury, G A', 'Waldmann, T A', 'Junghans, R P']","['Kingsbury GA', 'Waldmann TA', 'Junghans RP']","['Biotherapeutics Development Lab, Harvard Medical School, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Aged', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/*physiology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Gene Library', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/immunology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1998/06/25 00:00,1998/06/25 00:01,['1998/06/25 00:00'],"['1998/06/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/25 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401048 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Jun;12(6):982-91. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401048.,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Molecular cloning of MLL genomic breakpoints by PCR has previously been difficult because MLL has many translocation partners and several breakpoints involve unknown partner genes. We review a new approach to MLL genomic breakpoint cloning called panhandle PCR. By adding an oligonucleotide sequence to the unknown 3' partner gene that is complementary to a known 5' MLL sequence, we have been able to generate a genomic template with an intrastrand loop for PCR schematically shaped like a pan with a handle. The intrastrand loop contains the translocation breakpoint and unknown partner DNA, while the handle contains the known 5' sequence from MLL and a complement to that sequence. Primers both derived from MLL are used to amplify the breakpoint by panhandle PCR. Panhandle PCR offers the advantage of having specificity for the strand of interest at both primer annealing sites without requiring specific primers for the many partner genes of MLL. Panhandle PCR is a straightforward method that represents a technical advance in MLL genomic breakpoint cloning.","['Felix, C A', 'Jones, D H']","['Felix CA', 'Jones DH']","[""Department of Pediatrics, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, 19104-4318, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Chromosome Deletion', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', '*Proto-Oncogenes', '*Transcription Factors', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1998/06/25 00:00,1998/06/25 00:01,['1998/06/25 00:00'],"['1998/06/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/25 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401026 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Jun;12(6):976-81. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401026.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",,,['1R29CA66140-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Structural abnormalities were present in all but five hyperdiploid karyotypes, and frequently involved lymphoid breakpoints: immunoglobulin gene regions (36 cases) or chromosome 11q13 region (21 cases). Numerous other structural aberrations were detected; the most frequent involved chromosome 1 and chromosome 13. Structural abnormalities were significantly more frequent in the second hypodiploid group. When analyzing the results obtained in the 60 patients studied at the time of diagnosis, a prognostic correlation was found between the cytogenetic pattern and overall survival: hyperdiploid patients had a longer survival than patients belonging to the pseudo/hypo/near-tetraploid group (median survival 36.8 vs 18.2 months, P < 0.04).

However these stem cells may have a reduced proliferative capacity due to previous cytotoxic chemotherapy treatment of the patient. In addition, primitive hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) from mobilized peripheral blood are almost exclusively quiescent, which makes it hard to induce proliferation in vitro and thus to improve stable transduction of introduced genes into a sufficiently large number of primitive stem cells. In this study CD34-selected mobilized PBSC from lymphoma and myeloma patients were used as target cells for retroviral-mediated gene transfer using a clinically relevant cell- and serum-free supernatant transduction protocol. We have investigated various parameters that may contribute to an improvement of the poor transduction efficiency of the primitive HSC, including prestimulation time, the use of the carboxy-terminal fibronectin fragment CH-296, as well as stromal cell line conditioned media. Retroviral supernatant transduction in combination with CH-296 increased significantly the gene transfer efficiency as compared to supernatant alone and made the use of polycations redundant. Gene transfer of primitive HSC (cobblestone area forming cell (CAFC) week 6) was specifically improved when this procedure was preceded by a 5-day pre-culture period as compared to a 2-day transduction procedure. However, irrespective of the numerical recovery, the CAFC week 6 after retroviral transduction produced less long-term culture colony-forming cells, suggesting a loss of individual stem cell quality. The addition of stroma-conditioned media during the pre-culture period did not affect the individual CAFC quality or transduction efficiency, but increased greatly the recovery of the total number of transduced and untransduced HSC leading to larger grafts containing higher numbers of transduced stem cells.","['Breems, D A', 'Van Driel, E M', 'Hawley, R G', 'Siebel, K E', 'Ploemacher, R E']","['Breems DA', 'Van Driel EM', 'Hawley RG', 'Siebel KE', 'Ploemacher RE']","['Institute of Hematology, Erasmus University Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Fibronectins/*physiology', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Peptide Fragments/*physiology', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Stromal Cells/physiology']",1998/06/25 00:00,1998/06/25 00:01,['1998/06/25 00:00'],"['1998/06/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/25 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401028 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Jun;12(6):951-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401028.,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To test this hypothesis, we employed fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) to isolate cells with this phenotype from normal light density marrow mononuclear cells (MNC). CD34+, kit+, rhodamine123(low) cells comprised from 0.05-0.01% of the total MNC population. They were small, had scant cytoplasm, and contained nuclei with dense, hyperchromatic chromatin and inconspicuous nucleoli. Additional immunophenotyping revealed that these cells were CD33-, CD38-, CD20-, and glycophorin A-. When plated in semisolid cultures containing optimal concentrations of IL-3, GM-CSF, KL, EPO, IL-6, and IL-1 these cells did not form colonies. However, when cultured over irradiated stromal cells, cobblestone areas were observed to form after 3 weeks, and harvested cells were able to initiate long-term cultures. To further demonstrate that these cells were indeed stem like, we also tested their ability to engraft and mature in immunocompromised (SCID) mice. Irradiated (400 cGy) SCID mice were transplanted with 2 x 10(3) candidate stem cells which were then injected with recombinant human growth factors every other day. Two months post-transplant the animals were sacrificed. PCR and FACS analysis of marrow and spleen cell samples revealed the presence of cells expressing human CD45 consistent with engraftment of human stem cells and the establishment of murine-human chimerism. Moreover, MNC isolated from transplanted mice formed unambiguously human BFU-E, CFU-GM and B cell colonies when stimulated with the appropriate growth factors. Accordingly, we have identified a relatively rapid and simple mechanism for isolating primitive human hematopoietic cells with stem cell-like properties. We anticipate that this strategy will be useful for experimental and therapeutic applications that require human stem cells in quantity.","['Ratajczak, M Z', 'Pletcher, C H', 'Marlicz, W', 'Machalinski, B', 'Moore, J', 'Wasik, M', 'Ratajczak, J', 'Gewirtz, A M']","['Ratajczak MZ', 'Pletcher CH', 'Marlicz W', 'Machalinski B', 'Moore J', 'Wasik M', 'Ratajczak J', 'Gewirtz AM']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia 19104, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/*analysis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*chemistry', 'Cell Separation/*methods', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Phenotype', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*analysis', 'Rhodamine 123', 'Rhodamines/*metabolism']",1998/06/25 00:00,1998/06/25 00:01,['1998/06/25 00:00'],"['1998/06/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/25 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401027 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Jun;12(6):942-50. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401027.,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Rhodamines)', '1N3CZ14C5O (Rhodamine 123)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed 72 non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) for methylation at p15 exon 1 by PCR and Southern blot techniques using methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes. Abnormal methylation was found in eight cases (11%), most of them (three MALT, one anaplastic T cell lymphoma, one Burkitt and one follicular lymphoma) showing hypermethylation in the p16 gene also. In contrast, two pleomorphic T cell NHL showed a selective methylation at p15 gene, while the p16 gene remained unmethylated.

In these experiments, the inhibition of p210 bcr-abl expression alone was not sufficient to induce apoptosis. We demonstrated that exposure to low doses (0.5 mM) of a butyric acid analog, arginine butyrate, was capable of inducing apoptosis in selected leukemia cell lines, including K562 cells, and in fresh leukemia cells from patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia. To further explore the mechanisms of this effect, we examined expression of p210 bcr-abl after butyrate exposure and found a dose-related inhibition of p210 bcr-abl protein without concordant change in other phosphoproteins, including the JAK-1 kinase. Further analysis revealed that the inhibition of bcr-abl expression occurs due to transcriptional regulation of the bcr-abl gene by arginine butyrate.

The sensitive cell lines Raji and Ramos died by necrosis and apoptosis, respectively, during incubation with eicosapentaenoic acid, whereas the viability of the resistant U-698 cell line was unaffected. The effects of EPA on Raji cells, was counteracted by vitamin E, indicating that lipid peroxidation was involved. However, apoptosis induced by eicosapentaenoic acid in Ramos cells, was unaffected by vitamin E, as well as eicosanoid synthesis inhibitors.

Resistance to this class of drugs may (partly) be reversed by modulating agents, as has been demonstrated in a variety of cell lines. However, it is unknown which modulators may be of clinical benefit in childhood ALL. Therefore, we studied the modulating effect of PSC 833, cyclosporin A (CsA), verapamil (Vp) and genistein on daunorubicin (DNR) cytotoxicity, accumulation and retention in childhood ALL cells. DNR cytotoxicity was determined using the MTT assay; DNR accumulation, DNR retention and the expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) and major vault protein/lung resistance protein (LRP) were determined by flow cytometry. In the majority of samples PSC 833 (19/26), CsA (22/26) and Vp (15/18) sensitized the cells to DNR whereas genistein made 25 out of 26 samples more resistant to DNR. The sensitizing effect on the cytotoxicity of DNR was median 1.2-fold using 2 microM PSC 833 (P = 0.025), 1.5-fold using 4 microM CsA (P = 0.003) and 1.6-fold using 6 microM Vp (P = 0.012) whereas the adverse effect of 25 microM genistein was median 1.8-fold (P < 0.0001). No relationship was found between the sensitizing effect of PSC 833, CsA or Vp and the degree of DNR resistance. In contrast, the adverse effect of genistein was largest in DNR sensitive samples (P = 0.003). The effect of each modulator on the cytotoxicity of DNR did not differ between initial and relapse ALL samples although the latter were median 1.4-fold more resistant to DNR (P = 0.005). Modulation of DNR cytotoxicity was not correlated with changes in the accumulated and retained intracellular DNR content or with the expression of P-gp, MRP and LRP. Besides genistein, PSC 833, CsA and Vp incidentally made ALL cells more resistant to DNR. CsA stimulated the leukemic cell survival in seven out of 26 samples, a phenomenon that was not related to the degree of DNR resistance. In conclusion, PSC 833, CsA and Vp but not genistein may be used to sensitize cells to DNR in childhood ALL. The data also indicate that not all patients may have a therapeutic benefit from these modulators. Therefore, an in vitro culture assay may be necessary to screen for patients who may benefit by a modulator in their therapy.","['den Boer, M L', 'Pieters, R', 'Kazemier, K M', 'Janka-Schaub, G E', 'Henze, G', 'Veerman, A J']","['den Boer ML', 'Pieters R', 'Kazemier KM', 'Janka-Schaub GE', 'Henze G', 'Veerman AJ']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University Hospital Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/analysis', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/analysis', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacokinetics', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclosporine/*pharmacology', 'Cyclosporins/*pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/*pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Genistein/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Verapamil/*pharmacology']",1998/06/25 00:00,1998/06/25 00:01,['1998/06/25 00:00'],"['1998/06/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/25 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401035 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Jun;12(6):912-20. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401035.,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Cyclosporins)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)', 'Q7ZP55KF3X (valspodar)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, in contrast to other G1 phase regulatory proteins, such as cyclin D, retinoblastoma protein and p16INK4A, cyclin A seems not to be commonly involved in tumorigenesis. Recently, a second human cyclin A--cyclin A1--has been identified. In contrast to cyclin A which is expressed throughout embryonic development and in adult tissue, the expression of cyclin A1 has been reported to be restricted to embryonic and germ line cells. We have confirmed the absence of cyclin A1 mRNA from normal peripheral blood leukocytes of seven healthy donors by single step reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Furthermore, we have examined the expression of cyclin A1 mRNA in 173 peripheral blood samples of 162 patients with various hematological malignancies. Cyclin A1 mRNA was detectable in 11 of 11 patients with acute myeloid leukemia, three of three patients with acute biphenotypic leukemia, eight of eight patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, 59 of 69 patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) at diagnosis, 13 of 15 patients with CML in blastic transformation, 10 of 18 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, two of nine patients with essential thrombocythemia, and only two of 10 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with both cyclin A1 RT-PCR positive ALL leukemias being undifferentiated relapses. In addition, cyclin A1 mRNA was found in one of six leukapheresis products, harvested from individuals without hematological disorders. Taken together, cyclin A1 is expressed in the majority of myeloid and undifferentiated hematological malignancies as well as in normal hematopoietic progenitor cells. We conclude that cyclin A1, a protein potentially involved in G1/S phase progression of immature cells, might be necessary for proliferation of early hematopoietic progenitor cells and their leukemic counterparts being blocked at that stage of differentiation.","['Kramer, A', 'Hochhaus, A', 'Saussele, S', 'Reichert, A', 'Willer, A', 'Hehlmann, R']","['Kramer A', 'Hochhaus A', 'Saussele S', 'Reichert A', 'Willer A', 'Hehlmann R']","['III.

The increasing number of blast cells in the bone marrow correlate with poor prognosis and risk of developing acute leukemia. Such progression is frequently associated with increasing chromosomal abnormalities and genetic mutations. A cohort of 75 MDS patients were investigated for RAS, FMS and p53 mutations, and these molecular findings were related to cytogenetics, clinical status, transformation to acute leukemia, prognostic scores and survival. A mutation incidence of 57% (43/75) was found, with 48% (36/75) RAS mutations, 12% (9/75) FMS mutations and 8% (4/50) p53 mutations. The mutation status for RAS and FMS was related to MDS subgroup, increasing with poor-risk disease. The highest incidence was in the chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) subgroup. The most frequent RAS mutations were of codon 12 and a predominance of FMS codon 969 mutations was observed. A statistically significant increased frequency of transformation to AML was observed in MDS patients harboring RAS or FMS mutations (P < 0.02). Patients with oncogene mutations had a significantly poorer survival compared with those without mutations at 2 years and at the end of the period of follow-up (P < 0.02). Multivariate analysis including mutation, age, gender, diagnosis (FAB), cytogenetics and International score shows that the International score and mutation and age is the best predictive model of a poor outcome, (P < 0.0001). When the analysis was undertaken without the International score, mutation and gender was the best predictor of poor survival (P = 0.005). This study shows that oncogene mutation, indicative of genetic instability, is associated with disease progression and poor survival in MDS.","['Padua, R A', 'Guinn, B A', 'Al-Sabah, A I', 'Smith, M', 'Taylor, C', 'Pettersson, T', 'Ridge, S', 'Carter, G', 'White, D', 'Oscier, D', 'Chevret, S', 'West, R']","['Padua RA', 'Guinn BA', 'Al-Sabah AI', 'Smith M', 'Taylor C', 'Pettersson T', 'Ridge S', 'Carter G', 'White D', 'Oscier D', 'Chevret S', 'West R']","['Department of Hematology, University of Wales College of Medicine, Cardiff, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', '*Genes, fms', '*Genes, p53', '*Genes, ras', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/mortality', 'Survival Rate']",1998/06/25 00:00,1998/06/25 00:01,['1998/06/25 00:00'],"['1998/06/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/25 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401044 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Jun;12(6):887-92. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401044.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study we analyzed whether this might be due to a disconnection between proliferation and differentiation. CD34+/CD36- sorted bone marrow cells of 18 MDS patients were cultured in a clonogenic and suspension culture assay in the presence of erythropoietin (Epo) and mast cell growth factor (MGF). Burst-forming units erythroid (BFU-E, 75 +/- 88/10(4) CD34+ cells, X +/- s.d.) and colony-forming units E (CFU-E) were observed in eight of the 13 cases (62%) with refractory anemia with or without ring sideroblasts (RA and RARS) and one of the five cases with RA with excess of blasts or in transformation (RAEB and RAEB-T). Suspension cultures with CD34+/CD36- sorted cells with Epo plus MGF demonstrated an 8.9 +/- 6.5-fold expansion after 7 days in cases with >10 BFU-E/10(4) CD34+/CD36- cells while cases with <10 BFU-E/10(4) CD34+/CD36- cells demonstrated 1.0 +/- 0.8-fold expansion especially in cases with RAEB/RAEB-T. FACS and morphology analysis after 7 days of suspension culture demonstrated partial differentiation along the erythroid lineage in cases with RA/RARS (75%) and RAEB/RAEB-T (66%) reflected by the presence of erythroblasts and normoblasts with variable expression of CD34, CD36 and Glycophorin A. In cases with erythroid colony formation 69 +/- 24% of the cells were CD34-/CD36+ and in cases with <10 BFU-E/10(4) CD34+ cells 18 +/- 16% of cells were CD34-/CD36+. Iron staining showed the presence of ring sideroblasts in two cases with RARS indicating that the cells originate from the abnormal erythroid clone. Finally, it was shown that cases with an impaired proliferative response demonstrate an enhanced binding of Annexin-V on CD34+ cells during the first days of the cell suspension culture phase. These results suggest that a defect in the proliferative response is most pronouncedly expressed in MDS whereas a subpopulation of cells retain the capacity to differentiate between transition to a terminated stage.","['Brada, S J', 'de Wolf, J T', 'Hendriks, D W', 'Smit, J W', 'Vellenga, E']","['Brada SJ', 'de Wolf JT', 'Hendriks DW', 'Smit JW', 'Vellenga E']","['Department of Hematology, University Hospital Groningen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Anemia, Refractory/*blood', 'Antigens, CD34/*analysis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*drug effects/physiology', 'CD36 Antigens/*analysis', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*drug effects/physiology', 'Erythropoietin/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Stem Cell Factor/*pharmacology']",1998/06/25 00:00,1998/06/25 00:01,['1998/06/25 00:00'],"['1998/06/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/25 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401046 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Jun;12(6):882-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401046.,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (CD36 Antigens)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",,,,,,['Leukemia. 1999 Mar;13(3):494-5.

One hundred and one patients with untreated ALL were entered into this study. The diagnosis of ALLm was made when more than 20% of all nucleated elements in the bone marrow showed maturation beyond prolymphocytes by light microscopic examination. The mature-appearing leukemic cells showed the same immunophenotype to remaining lymphoblasts. The number of ALLm cases was 19 (18.8%). The mean age at presentation of ALLm was 29 +/- 18, older than that of 18 +/- 16 of the remaining typical ALL (ALLt) (P = 0.015). Remission was induced with daunorubicin, vincristine, prednisone and L-asparaginase. Only two of 19 ALLm patients achieved CR after 4 weeks induction chemotherapy. In contrast, 57 of 82 (69.5%) ALLt patients achieved CR after the same induction chemotherapy. There was no significant difference in immunophenotype of ALLm compared with ALLt. Labeling index of DNA topoisomerase IIalpha (TopoLI) was studied by immunohistochemistry. Initial TopoLI of ALLm (221 +/- 147) was much lower than that of ALLt (609 +/- 262, P = 0.005). Furthermore, the remaining leukemic cells after chemotherapy were not labeled with anti-DNA topoisomerase IIalpha. The P53 protein was expressed in nine of 18 ALLm cases (50.0%) and P-glycoprotein was not expressed in ALLm cases. Twelve of 19 ALLm cases were studied for carrying bcr/abl fusion by karyotyping and/or fluorescent in situ hybridization. Only two cases revealed bcr/abl fusion. In conclusion, ALLm is a separate entity of ALL which has a very poor clinical course and is independent of other prognostic factors.

We performed a retrospective analysis to evaluate the outcome of a cohort of PV patients treated with pipobroman (PB) at a single institution during a period of 20 years (November 1971-October 1991). During this period, a total of 366 adult PV patients were diagnosed according to Polycythemia Vera Study Group (PVSG) criteria. Of these, only 199 (54%) were treated with PB: 92 were males and 107 females, median age was 63.0 years (range 25.2-87.3 years). Major clinical characteristics at onset were as follows: 34 (17%) patients had splenomegaly >3 cm below costal margin, 70 (35%) had platelets >600,000/mm3, 79 (40%) had white blood cells >12,000 mm3; 97 (49%) had hypertension, 83 (42%) had minor neurological symptoms (as vertigo, headache, paresthesias), 33 (17%) had pruritus and 27 (13%) had thrombotic features. All patients received PB at the dosage of 1 mg/kg/day until response was achieved (hematocrit value <50% in males and <45% in females). Thereafter treatment was given according to toxicity and maintenance of response. All patients were phlebotomized before starting treatment (mean number of phlebotomies performed: three, range 2-4) and 47 of them received PB when hematocrit value was already reduced at response levels: therefore, while all patients are evaluable for acute and long-term toxicity, only 152/199 (76.4%) patients are evaluable for response to PB. During a median time of 2 months, all these 152 patients achieved the response; as maintenance, 128/199 (64.3%) patients were managed with PB alone and 71/199 (35.7%) patients received phlebotomies occasionally. Sixty-one out of 199 (30.6%) patients developed disease-related complications (25 neurological symptoms, 21 thrombotic complications, 12 cardiovascular problems, three hepatic failures). Eleven (5.5%) patients developed acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) after a median time of treatment of 89 months (range 33-188 months), 11 (5.5%) patients developed myelofibrosis (median time from treatment 71 months, range 31-182 months) and in six (3%) patients cancer occurred (median time from treatment 85 months, range 13-118 months). The cumulative risk of leukemia in PV was 2% (95% CI: 0-4%) and 6% (95% CI: 1-11%) at 5 and 10 years respectively; the cumulative risk of myelofibrosis was 2% (95% CI: 1-5%) and 9% (95% CI: 3-15%) at 5 and 10 years, respectively. As of May 1996, 33 (16.6%) patients are lost to follow-up, 40 (20.1%) are dead and 126 (63.3%) are alive with a median overall survival of 191 months. In conclusion, this retrospective analysis confirms the efficacy and safety of PB in PV patients and its low leukemogenic role; prospective studies are needed to evaluate the real impact of PB in the treatment of PV.","['Petti, M C', 'Spadea, A', 'Avvisati, G', 'Spadea, T', 'Latagliata, R', 'Montefusco, E', 'Cosenza, M', 'Malagnino, F']","['Petti MC', 'Spadea A', 'Avvisati G', 'Spadea T', 'Latagliata R', 'Montefusco E', 'Cosenza M', 'Malagnino F']","['Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, University La Sapienza, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*adverse effects', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology', 'Pipobroman/*adverse effects', 'Polycythemia Vera/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Retrospective Studies']",1998/06/25 00:00,1998/06/25 00:01,['1998/06/25 00:00'],"['1998/06/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/25 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401045 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Jun;12(6):869-74. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401045.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '6Q99RDT97R (Pipobroman)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most promising strategy for curing these patients is through re-induction chemotherapy followed by successful allogeneic transplant. We studied a new high-dose induction regimen in order to improve the outcome for these patients. Eighteen adult patients with relapsed/refractory ALL were treated on a phase I study of high-dose cytarabine combined with a single escalating dose of idarubicin. Five patients had primary refractory disease and 13 were treated in refractory relapse. Nine patients (50%) had Ph+ ALL. The induction regimen was cytarabine 3 g/m2/day intravenously days 1-5 and idarubicin as a single intravenous dose on day 3. G-CSF 5 microg/kg subcutaneously every 12 h was started on day 7. The initial idarubicin dose was 20 mg/m2 with dose escalations of 10 mg m2. Cohorts of three patients were treated at each idarubicin dose level. Unacceptable toxicity was encountered at 50 mg/m2 with one death from infection and one death from cardiotoxicity in a patient with significant prior anthracycline exposure. There were no instances of grade 4 non-hematologic toxicity encountered at idarubicin doses of 20 mg/m2, 30 mg/m2, or 40 mg/m2. The data suggest a dose-response relationship for increasing doses of idarubicin with 0/3 complete responses (CR) at 20 mg/m2, 1/3 CR at 30 mg/m2, and 7/12 (58%) CR at idarubicin doses > or = 40 mg/m2.

We investigated the effect of combining granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) with IFN-A in the cytogenetic response of patients with minor responses to IFN-A alone. CML patients were eligible if they had shown sensitivity to IFN-A as determined by achievement of a hematologic or cytogenetic response, but failed to achieve or lost a major cytogenetic response after a minimum of 12 months of therapy with IFN-A alone. Patients received GM-CSF 30 microg/m2 daily, subcutaneously and the dose was escalated to 60 microg/m2 if tolerated. IFN-A was continued at the same dose being received by the patient and escalated when possible. Fourteen evaluable patients were included, 13 in chronic phase and one in accelerated phase. The best response prior to GM-CSF was a transient major cytogenetic response in two patients (14%), minor cytogenetic response in nine (64%), and complete hematologic response in three (22%). The median time on IFN-A prior to the start of GM-CSF was 39 months (range 12-72 months). Four patients achieved a significant cytogenetic response, including two complete (14%) and two partial (14%) cytogenetic remissions during therapy. One partial cytogenetic remission converted to complete shortly after therapy was discontinued. Two other patients had a significant reduction in the percentage of Philadelphia chromosome-positive metaphases. The dose of IFN-A could be escalated in half of the patients treated. No toxicity could be attributed to the addition of GM-CSF. We conclude that the addition of GM-CSF to the treatment with IFN-A in CML patients who are sensitive to IFN-A alone but fail to achieve a major cytogenetic response may be beneficial in some patients and should be further investigated.","['Cortes, J', 'Kantarjian, H', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Kurzrock, R', 'Keating, M', 'Talpaz, M']","['Cortes J', 'Kantarjian H', ""O'Brien S"", 'Kurzrock R', 'Keating M', 'Talpaz M']","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Philadelphia Chromosome']",1998/06/25 00:00,1998/06/25 00:01,['1998/06/25 00:00'],"['1998/06/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/25 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401033 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Jun;12(6):860-4. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401033.,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The main genetic alterations are deletions (bi- or monoallelic) or 5' CpG island methylation of p15 and p16; very few cases or cell lines had p18 or p19 deletions or hypermethylation. Hypermethylation and homozygous deletions of tumor suppressor genes establish a new paradigm of inactivation by lack of expression, in contrast to the previously identified tumor suppressors which are predominantly inactivated by point mutations followed by loss of the wild-type allele. Here, the literature data on alterations of this gene family in more than 4700 primary cases of leukemia or lymphoma and some 320 continuous leukemia-lymphoma cell lines are summarized. Among hematopoietic malignancies, the highest frequencies of p15del and p16del were seen in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (>30%) with striking rates in T-ALL (>50%), but also high rates in B cell precursor (BCP)-ALL (>20%); the rates of deletions in chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL), multiple myeloma, acute and chronic myeloid leukemia (AML and CML), and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) were rather low, only some B cell and T cell lymphomas showed increased frequencies. Results are quite different with regard to the second mode of inactivation, hypermethylation of the promoter region. Here, p15 is most often inactivated, at particularly high frequencies in the disorders lacking any p15/p16 deletions: 40-80% p15met in AML, MDS and multiple myeloma. Also p15met rates in BCP- and T-ALL cases were high (c. 40%). There is controversy concerning the prognostic impact of p15 and p16 aberrations with some studies describing a significant correlation between inactivation of these genes and poor prognosis, while most others did not detect any prognostic relevance, at least in pediatric ALL; there may be a worse prognosis for adults with B or T cell lymphomas. Despite the small number of cases studied, paired sequential analyses suggested that disease progression is associated with loss of p15/p16 activity in a certain percentage of adult patients. p15del/p16del and p15met/p16met were also detected in the large panel of leukemia-lymphoma cell lines studied. In general, the results in cell lines reproduce the data seen in primary cells with the important difference that the rates of p15/p16 inactivation are clearly higher in the cultured cells compared with the freshly explanted cells. Retrovirus- or electroporation-mediated ectopic gene transfer of p16 wild-type into p16-deficient cell lines led to growth inhibition, arrest in G1 (without apoptosis) and occasionally to differentiation, suggesting that the malignant phenotype of p16-/- cell lines can, at least partially, be reversed by restoring p16 gene expression. A striking inverse correlation between the absence of p16 (due to deletion) and presence of wild-type retinoblastoma gene was observed in cell lines confirming a common growth suppressor pathway; no comparable relationship of p16 inactivation with p53 was detected. Paired analysis of cell lines and corresponding primary cell material showed that in all instances tested both populations carried the same gene configuration of p15 and p16. Thus, p15del or p16del did not occur during establishment of the cell lines or during prolonged culture. It is likely that p15 or p16 deletions already acquired in vivo provide a dramatic growth advantage for the immortalization process in vitro, thus increasing the success rate for cell line establishment which is commonly extremely difficult.

Future studies will determine their exact role in the development and progression of hematopoietic neoplasms.

Here, we performed experiments to determine the proliferative effect of PIXY-321 on 13 constitutively growth factor-dependent human leukemia cell lines in comparison with GM-CSF, IL-3 and their combination using as read-out parameters the 48-hour 3H-thymidine incorporation assay and viable cell counts after in vitro culture for 7-8 days. Whereas one cell line was not responsive to any of these three cytokines, the other 12 cell lines showed variable degrees of growth in response to these effector molecules. PIXY-321 increased proliferation as measured by thymidine uptake relative to IL-3, GM-CSF or GM-CSF + IL-3 by 34% (range 5-448%), 12% (range 0-122%), and 6% (range 1-13%), respectively. PIXY-321 induced a mean increase of 32%, 30% and 11% in cell counts relative to the values obtained with IL-3, GM-CSF or GM-CSF + IL-3, respectively. Altogether, these data indicate that PIXY-321 stimulates proliferation of immature hematopoietic cells substantially better than equivalent concentrations of the single growth factors GM-CSF and IL-3. This hybrid growth factor showed a marginal to modest, but definite and reproducible increase in proliferation compared to the combination of GM-CSF plus IL-3. In summary, the fusion cytokine protein PIXY-321 appears to have biological effects superior to those elicited by its components, singly or in combination. This unique molecule should represent a useful tool in studies on the mechanisms underlying cytokine ligand-receptor interaction and the subsequent signal transduction. The use of PIXY-321 provides an opportunity for taking greater advantage in vitro and in vivo of the hematopoietic stimulatory activities of GM-CSF and IL-3.","['Drexler, H G', 'Meyer, C']","['Drexler HG', 'Meyer C']","['DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms & Cell Cultures, Department of Human and Animal Cell Cultures Braunschweig, Germany. hdr@gbf-braunschweig.de']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/06/25 00:00,1998/06/25 00:01,['1998/06/25 00:00'],"['1998/06/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/25 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199809058387 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1998 Mar;29(1-2):119-28. doi: 10.3109/10428199809058387.,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For this purpose, in vitro colony assays are an excellent approach for investigation of the biologic characteristics of MDS progenitor cells.

As the loss of p16INK4A function by genetic alterations leads to inappropriate progression of the cell cycle, the CDKN2 gene has been investigated intensively as a new candidate tumor suppressor gene in many malignant tumors. Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is a peripheral T-cell malignancy associated with human T-cell lymphotrophic virus type 1 (HTLV-1). As the development to ATL is believed to require not only HTLV-1 infection but also accumulation of genetic alterations, we investigated the relationship between alterations in the CDKN2 gene and ATL. Alterations in the CDKN2 gene were detected in approximately 15 to 20% of ATL patients. Interestingly, most of the patients with CDKN2 gene alterations had the aggressive form of ATL.

A better characterization of this entity could increase our understanding about the mechanisms of carcinogenesis, specially the induction of specific genetic abnormalities, e.g., BCR-ABL fusion, following chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy exposure, could facilitate the investigation of the kinetics of the development of CML, and also provide a model to study molecular events that might precede its development. Review of 32 tr-CML cases suggests that there are no clinically appreciable differences between tr-CML and de novo CML cases. Analysis of large epidemiological studies that investigated the risk of second primary leukemias has not shown any clear evidence of a higher risk of CML among individuals who underwent treatment for a primary cancer over the general population. The cancer-predisposing syndromes, the detection of BCR-ABL transcripts in healthy individuals, and the induction in vitro of BCR-ABL fusions by ionizing radiation, are all discussed in the context of tr-CML. Finally, the need for a large epidemiological study to specifically assess the risk of developing second primary CML after chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy is stressed.","['Aguiar, R C']",['Aguiar RC'],"['LRF Centre for Adult Leukaemia, Department of Haematology, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, Hammersmith Hospital, London, UK.

Differences in genetic susceptibility are known to exist for many of the major viral pathogens of poultry. Consequently, an increase in the level of genetic resistance provides a possible means of enhancing protection of flocks. This is particularly feasible where specific resistance genes have been identified, as in the case of avian leukosis and Marek's disease, and the development of genetic maps of the chicken has offered new possibilities for the identification of further resistance genes. It has also become clear that there are genetic differences in the response to live attenuated vaccine viruses, and new possibilities exist to manipulate the genetics of host flocks so that the effect of vaccination can be optimised.","['Bumstead, N']",['Bumstead N'],"['Institute for Animal Health, Agricultural and Food Research Council, Compton Laboratory, Berkshire, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Rev Sci Tech,Revue scientifique et technique (International Office of Epizootics),8712301,IM,,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/genetics/immunology', 'Birnaviridae Infections/genetics/immunology/veterinary', 'Coronavirus Infections/genetics/immunology/veterinary', 'Immunity, Innate/genetics', 'Infectious bronchitis virus/immunology', 'Infectious bursal disease virus/immunology', 'Marek Disease/genetics/immunology', 'Poultry', 'Poultry Diseases/genetics/*immunology', 'Virus Diseases/genetics/immunology/*veterinary']",1998/06/25 00:00,1998/06/25 00:01,['1998/06/25 00:00'],"['1998/06/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/25 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.20506/rst.17.1.1082 [doi]'],ppublish,Rev Sci Tech. 1998 Apr;17(1):249-55. doi: 10.20506/rst.17.1.1082.,,,50,,,,,,,,,,,,

Early treatment strategies, combining surgery and radiotherapy alone, resulted in survival rates of about 40% only. In the last 15 years, chemotherapy was used more frequently in combination with surgery and radiotherapy. The rationale was to increase the survival rate and to decrease radiation toxicity in young children. Forty-six patients younger than 16 years were treated between July 1977 and September 1995 in our institution (32 boys and 14 girls). Thirty-nine patients could be evaluated according to their postoperative treatment with regard to different protocols such as SIOP 1, SIOP 2, HDMTX/VCR, HIT protocol 89/91 and Carbo-PEI (one patient). In total, 21/39 patients are alive without evidence of disease (EFS 55 +/- 7%) with a follow-up of 26 to 210 months. Four children are lost to follow-up. Twelve patients died after relapse, 1 child died of MTX-induced brain atrophy, 1 patient developed a secondary malignancy (acute lymphoblastic leukemia) and died. The best results were seen in patients treated according to the HIT 89/91 protocol as first-line treatment (CR 9/10).

The secondary and tertiary structures of HA give it very important and unique viscoelastic properties. HA-composed materials are currently used intraocularly during ophthalmological surgery to facilitate surgical procedures and prevent tissue damage. To examine the effects of three viscous biomaterials composed of hyaluronan (Healon, IAL, and Biolon) used in ophthalmological surgery, the membrane electrical properties of the erythroleukemic K562 cell line exposed to these materials were investigated. Membrane conductivity, membrane permittivity, and the conductivity of the cytosol were evaluated using dielectric relaxation measurements in the radiofrequency range and fitting the experimental results to the general equations of the Maxwell-Wagner effect. The results demonstrate that while membrane permittivity and the conductivity of the cytosol are not significantly altered, the membrane conductivity of K562 cells exposed to all three biomaterials increases substantially and in a time-dependent manner with respect to untreated cells. These observations seem to indicate that hyaluronan perturbs ionic transport while it does not vary the type, quantity, or distribution of membrane components. In addition, the variations induced by these substances on the cell membrane are not dependent upon the molecular weight or on the biological origin of hyaluronan. These results may aid in elucidating the mechanisms involved in hyaluronan/cell membrane interaction and thus may provide a deeper understanding of the complications related to their use in ophthalmological surgery.","['Santini, M T', 'Cametti, C', 'Formisano, G', 'Flamma, F', 'Perilli, R']","['Santini MT', 'Cametti C', 'Formisano G', 'Flamma F', 'Perilli R']","['Laboratorio di Ultrastrutture, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Biomed Mater Res,Journal of biomedical materials research,0112726,IM,,"['Cell Membrane/*drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Size', 'Cytosol/drug effects/physiology', 'Elasticity', 'Electric Conductivity', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Ion Transport/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology', 'Lubrication', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Molecular Weight', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Viscosity']",1998/06/25 02:03,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/06/25 02:03'],"['1998/06/25 02:03 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/06/25 02:03 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-4636(199808)41:2<211::AID-JBM5>3.0.CO;2-L [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-4636(199808)41:2<211::aid-jbm5>3.0.co;2-l [doi]']",ppublish,J Biomed Mater Res. 1998 Aug;41(2):211-20. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-4636(199808)41:2<211::aid-jbm5>3.0.co;2-l.,['9004-61-9 (Hyaluronic Acid)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As for benzene, sufficient epidemiological evidence has accumulated indicating that benzene is a human carcinogen. To establish the OEL for benzene, the OEL committee of the Japan Society for Occupational Health (JSOH) selected 9 cases of acute myeloic or monocytic leukemia out of the 14 cases of leukemia in the Pliofilm cohort, adopted the exposure estimate of Paustenbach et al. (52), and calculated the risk of benzene-induced leukemia by means of an average relative risk model. The lifetime risk of leukemia by exposure to benzene at 1 ppm for 40 years was calculated as 0.762 x 10(-3) with a 95% confidence interval between 0.621 x 10(-3) and 0.98.10(-3). The benzene level that causes one lifetime excess death from leukemia among 1,000 workers exposed to benzene for 40 years was 1.31 ppm, with a 95% confidence interval between 1.01 and 1.61 ppm. The OEL committee decided that benzene exposure should be controlled by a reference value corresponding to a lifetime risk (10(-3) or 10(-4)) of leukemia rather than by a time-weighted average (TWA) concentration. The committee has proposed that the benzene exposure level corresponding to the lifetime risk of 10(-3) is 1 ppm and that corresponding to the risk of 10(-4) is 0.1 ppm. In 1995, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) changed the carcinogenicity classification of trichloroethylene from Group 3 (not classifiable as to carcinogenicity to humans) to Group 2A (probably carcinogenic to humans). The OEL committee of the JSOH, however, reached the conclusion that since it has not been confirmed that trichloroethylene is a human carcinogen, and since carcinogenicity, if any, may be based on an epigenetic rather than genotoxic mechanism, it is not appropriate to establish the OEL of trichloroethylene presupposing that trichloroethylene is a carcinogen. The judgment of the OEL committee is that the OEL for trichloroethylene should be established on other than carcinogenicity findings, particularly on the basis of its neurological effects. In the light of accumulated evidence that a long-term exposure to trichloroethylene at 50 ppm will cause neurotoxic effects to industrial workers, the OEL committee has proposed 25 ppm (135 mg/m3) as a reference value for work environments. Finally, we propose that the general environmental air standards of benzene and trichloroethylene should be about 1/1,000 of the respective reference values for work environment.","['Kaneko, T', 'Wang, P Y', 'Sato, A']","['Kaneko T', 'Wang PY', 'Sato A']","['Department of Environmental Health, Medical University of Yamanashi, Tamaho, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Poland,Int J Occup Med Environ Health,International journal of occupational medicine and environmental health,9437093,IM,,"['Animals', '*Benzene', 'Carcinogenicity Tests', 'Humans', 'Japan', '*Maximum Allowable Concentration', '*Occupational Exposure', '*Trichloroethylene']",1998/06/25 00:00,1998/06/25 00:01,['1998/06/25 00:00'],"['1998/06/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/25 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/25 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Occup Med Environ Health. 1998;11(1):81-98.,"['290YE8AR51 (Trichloroethylene)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",,86,,,,,,,,,,,,

While all of the RB protein in G1/0 cells is hypophosphorylated, residual cells in S and G2 have significant detectable amounts of hypophosphorylated RB as well as still hyperphosphorylated RB protein. Thus RB hypophosphorylation can be induced in S and G2 as well as the G1 phase.

The role of cPLA2 in the cytotoxic action of TNF was investigated in a panel of human leukemic cell lines. TNF could activate cPLA2 only in U937 and HL60 TNF-sensitive leukemic cells, but not in KG1a, CEM, and CEM/VLB100 cells that are relatively resistant to TNF. Pretreatment with 4-bromophenacyl bromide, a cPLA2 inhibitor, rendered U937 and HL60 cell lines resistant to the cytotoxic effect of TNF. Immunoblot and reverse-transcriptase PCR demonstrated that cPLA2 expression was detectable at both transcriptional and translational levels in all leukemic cell lines studied, although CEM and CEM/VLB100 cells expressed cPLA2 mRNA and protein at lower levels. The protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, increased TNF-induced cPLA2 activity and cytotoxicity in both CEM and CEM/VLB100 cell lines. Low levels of cPLA2 activity in the KG1a cell line could be activated by the cPLA2 activator mellitin, or the calcium ionophore A23187. The data suggest that cPLA2 activity is involved in TNF-induced cytotoxicity in leukemic cells. Resistance to TNF-induced cytotoxicity may involve either protein inhibitors that act upstream of cPLA2 in the TNF-signaling pathway or constitutive defects of cPLA2 itself, possibly involving calcium utilization.","['Wu, Y L', 'Jiang, X R', 'Newland, A C', 'Kelsey, S M']","['Wu YL', 'Jiang XR', 'Newland AC', 'Kelsey SM']","[""Department of Hematology, St. Bartholomew's and Royal London School of Medicine and Dentistry, University of London, United Kingdom.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,,"['Acetophenones/pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', '*Apoptosis', 'Arachidonic Acid/metabolism', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Cytosol/drug effects/enzymology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*enzymology/*immunology', 'Melitten/pharmacology', 'Phospholipases A/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Phospholipases A2', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/metabolism', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*immunology']",1998/06/24 00:00,1998/06/24 00:01,['1998/06/24 00:00'],"['1998/06/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/24 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/24 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1998 Jun 15;160(12):5929-35.,"['0 (Acetophenones)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '20449-79-0 (Melitten)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', 'EC 3.1.1.32 (Phospholipases A)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Phospholipases A2)', 'PN0FRW1G4Z (4-bromophenacyl bromide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been shown that elevated H-2Dd expression on infected thymocytes is a result of elevated mRNA transcription and that the transcriptional increase is correlated with elevated levels of a DNA binding activity, H-2 binding factor 1 (H-2 BF1), which recognizes the 5'-flanking sequence (5'-TGACGCG-3') of the H-2Dd gene. Recently, it has been shown that the activation transcription factor 1 (ATF-1) homodimer is one form of the H-2 BF1 complex. Here we demonstrate that the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) homodimer and the heterodimer of CREB/ATF-1 also recognize the cis regulatory motif and are two additional forms of the H-2 BF1 complex. The levels of mRNA encoding ATF-1 and CREB were both increased in RadLV-infected thymocytes that showed increased levels of H-2 mRNA. Also, all three H-2 BF1 binding activities, ATF-1 homodimer, CREB homodimer, and ATF-1/CREB heterodimer, were increased in RadLV-infected thymocytes that expressed high levels of H-2Dd Ag on the cell surface. Transfection experiments demonstrated that ATF-1 and CREB activated a reporter plasmid containing the H-2 BF1 motif. These observations strongly suggest that both ATF-1 and CREB are involved in the regulation of H-2 gene expression following RadLV infection of mouse thymocytes.","['Ishiguro, N', 'Brown, G D', 'Ishizu, A', 'Meruelo, D']","['Ishiguro N', 'Brown GD', 'Ishizu A', 'Meruelo D']","['Department of Pathology and Kaplan Cancer Center, New York University Medical Center, NY 10016, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,,"['Activating Transcription Factor 1', 'Animals', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Dimerization', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'H-2 Antigens/*biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigen H-2D', 'Isoantigens/*biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics/immunology', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex/genetics/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Radiation Leukemia Virus', 'Retroviridae Infections/genetics/immunology', 'Thymoma/genetics/immunology', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Virus Infections/genetics/immunology']",1998/06/24 00:00,1998/06/24 00:01,['1998/06/24 00:00'],"['1998/06/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/24 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/24 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1998 Jun 15;160(12):5907-14.,"['0 (Activating Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Atf1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigen H-2D)', '0 (Isoantigens)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,['CA22247/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Mastoparan-induced histamine release remained after removing the extracellular Ca2+, whereas the antigen-induced one disappeared. Pertussis toxin did not inhibit mastoparan-induced histamine release from the cells, and mastoparan did not stimulate phosphoinositide hydrolysis. In agreement with the results, RBL-2H3 cells had a small amount of ADP-ribosylation substrates for pertussis toxin. Neomycin (1-5 mM) suppressed mastoparan-induced histamine release and phospholipase D activation. However, butanol slightly inhibited mastoparan-induced histamine release. Moreover, 2,3-diphosphoglycerate inhibited mastoparan-induced phospholipase D activation, but not it's histamine release. On the other hand, mastoparan caused the leakage of lactate dehydrogenase from the cells in a similar concentration range to the histamine release. This leakage was also suppressed by neomycin. These results suggest that mastoparan enhances the membrane permeability, resulting in histamine release in a pertussis toxin-insensitive manner, and that mastoparan-induced phospholipase D activation may not relate to histamine release.","['Mizuno, K', 'Nakahata, N', 'Ohizumi, Y']","['Mizuno K', 'Nakahata N', 'Ohizumi Y']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Molecular Biology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Toxicon,Toxicon : official journal of the International Society on Toxinology,1307333,IM,,"['1-Butanol/pharmacology', '2,3-Diphosphoglycerate/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Calcium/pharmacology', 'Histamine Release/*drug effects', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Neomycin/pharmacology', 'Peptides', 'Pertussis Toxin', 'Phosphatidylinositols/metabolism', 'Phospholipase D/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Virulence Factors, Bordetella/pharmacology', 'Wasp Venoms/antagonists & inhibitors/*toxicity']",1998/06/24 00:00,1998/06/24 00:01,['1998/06/24 00:00'],"['1998/06/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/24 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/24 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0041-0101(97)00151-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0041-0101(97)00151-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicon. 1998 Mar;36(3):447-56. doi: 10.1016/s0041-0101(97)00151-7.,"['0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Virulence Factors, Bordetella)', '0 (Wasp Venoms)', '138-81-8 (2,3-Diphosphoglycerate)', '72093-21-1 (mastoparan)', '8PJ61P6TS3 (1-Butanol)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)', 'EC 3.1.4.4 (Phospholipase D)', 'I16QD7X297 (Neomycin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Larger cancellous osteons also suggested a positive balance in bone remodelling. The amount of bone tissue showed furthermore a statistically significant increase through the groups of polycythaemia vera, essential thrombocythaemia, chronic myelogenous leukaemia and idiopathic myelofibrosis. Parallel to the increase in the amount of bone, an increase in the degree of marrow fibrosis was detected.

Influenza A viruses were isolated from 29 patients with acute respiratory illness (14 BMT recipients and 15 patients with leukemia). Fifteen patients (52%) received amantadine (n = 4) or rimantadine (n = 11) therapy. All influenza isolates recovered from six patients shedding virus for > or = 3 days were screened for antiviral susceptibility; resistant isolates were further genetically characterized. Initial influenza isolates were susceptible to amantadine or rimantadine, but subsequent isolates from five of six patients were resistant. Influenza-associated mortality was similar among patients with and without documented antiviral resistance (2 of 5 vs. 5 of 24). We conclude that development of antiviral resistance in immunocompromised individuals should be considered when they have been treated with antivirals and have shed influenza virus for a prolonged period. Isolation procedures should be instituted for all immunocompromised patients with influenza, both during and after therapy with amantadine or rimantadine.","['Englund, J A', 'Champlin, R E', 'Wyde, P R', 'Kantarjian, H', 'Atmar, R L', 'Tarrand, J', 'Yousuf, H', 'Regnery, H', 'Klimov, A I', 'Cox, N J', 'Whimbey, E']","['Englund JA', 'Champlin RE', 'Wyde PR', 'Kantarjian H', 'Atmar RL', 'Tarrand J', 'Yousuf H', 'Regnery H', 'Klimov AI', 'Cox NJ', 'Whimbey E']","['Acute Viral Respiratory Diseases Unit, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Infect Dis,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,9203213,IM,,"['Adult', 'Amantadine/*therapeutic use', 'Antiviral Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Drug Resistance, Microbial', 'Humans', 'Influenza A virus/*drug effects', 'Influenza, Human/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Middle Aged', 'Opportunistic Infections/drug therapy/etiology/*virology', 'Rimantadine/*therapeutic use']",1998/06/24 00:00,1998/06/24 00:01,['1998/06/24 00:00'],"['1998/06/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/24 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1086/516358 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Infect Dis. 1998 Jun;26(6):1418-24. doi: 10.1086/516358.,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0T2EF4JQTU (Rimantadine)', 'BF4C9Z1J53 (Amantadine)']",,,['AI NO1-15103/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Most trials of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) have demonstrated a significant shortening of neutrophil recovery time and a trend toward higher rates of complete remission. Several studies have demonstrated a significant reduction in the rates of morbidity or early mortality with G-CSF or GM-CSF. In vitro data support the concept of enhancing antimicrobial activity with macrophage colony-stimulating factor or GM-CSF.

In a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter study conducted by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group in the United States, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was given only to those patients who had hypocellular or remission marrow on day 10 of one or two cycles of standard induction therapy. Although the administration of GM-CSF significantly reduced a wide range of adverse events, the main benefit of this cytokine seems to be mediated by a reduction in sepsis. A similarly designed study, conducted by the Southwest Oncology Group in a directly comparable AML patient population with use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) as the supportive cytokine, showed no survival benefit and no reduction in the rates of serious or lethal sepsis. In most current clinical situations, GM-CSF and G-CSF are indistinguishable both in terms of efficacy and toxicity. GM-CSF and G-CSF have very different impacts on the survival of patients with AML. The stimulation of monocyte-macrophage function and proliferation by GM-CSF may mediate the selective benefit of GM-CSF in patients with AML and stem cell transplants.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We are conducting a randomized adjuvant study for breast cancer patients younger than 60 years of age with > or = 70% risk of recurrence within five years. The first 89 consecutive patients who have received nine courses q three weeks of individually dose-escalated and G-CSF (filgrastim)-supported FEC (5-fluorouracil (5-FU), epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide) therapy given with ciprofloxacin prophylaxis were included in this analysis. Six different FEC dose levels were used for treatment at equivalent haematological toxicity. Dose modifications were based on white blood cell and platelet counts on days 8, 11/12, 15, and 22. RESULTS: Eighty-three of 89 patients completed all nine courses. The median epirubicin and cyclophosphamide doses were 782 mg/m2 (range 0-994 mg/m2) and 10.330 mg/m2 (range 0-14.460 mg/m2), respectively.

In patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia in chronic phase, long-term treatment with alpha-interferon has been reported to improve survival in comparison with standard treatments with cytotoxic drugs. To assess the pharmacoeconomic profile of interferon treatment in terms of cost per life-year gained, we conducted an incremental cost-effectiveness analysis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The clinical material utilised in our analysis derived from four published randomised trials comparing interferon vs. busulphan or hydroxyurea. The Gompertz model was used to estimate the total lifetime values of patient-years of subjects receiving interferon in comparison with subjects given a standard cytotoxic treatment. RESULTS: Our primary analysis showed that maintenance treatment with interferon improved survival expectancy by 37 to 93 discounted years for every 100 patients. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of interferon vs. cytotoxic therapy ranged from $93,000 to $226,000 per life-year gained (discounted costs per discounted years). A secondary analysis showed that the dose of interferon had significant influence on the cost-effectiveness ratio. Because our literature search identified a fifth study that showed an extremely favourable outcome using interferon but that was not included in our primary analysis due to its design, we conducted another secondary analysis based on these five studies that, however, confirmed the results of the primary analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that an unselected long-term treatment with interferon implies an unfavourable cost effectiveness ranking in comparison with data of cost per life-year gained which had previously been obtained from other types of medical intervention.","['Messori, A']",['Messori A'],"['Italian Cooperative Group for the Study of Meta-analysis, Azienda Ospedaliera Careggi, Florence, Italy. md3439@mclink.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,IM,,"['Area Under Curve', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Economics, Pharmaceutical', 'England', 'Female', 'Germany', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*economics/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Italy', 'Japan', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/economics/mortality', 'Male', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic/statistics & numerical data', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic/*statistics & numerical data', 'Statistics as Topic', 'Survival Rate']",1998/06/24 00:00,1998/06/24 00:01,['1998/06/24 00:00'],"['1998/06/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/24 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/24 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1023/a:1008212411489 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(19)55815-X [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 1998 Apr;9(4):389-96. doi: 10.1023/a:1008212411489.,['0 (Interferon-alpha)'],,,,,,['Ann Oncol. 1998 Apr;9(4):351-2.

This enhancement of NK and ADCC activities and the number of NK cells by IL-15 suggests it may be clinically useful in treating immunodeficient patients.","['Nguyen, Q H', 'Roberts, R L', 'Ank, B J', 'Lin, S J', 'Thomas, E K', 'Stiehm, E R']","['Nguyen QH', 'Roberts RL', 'Ank BJ', 'Lin SJ', 'Thomas EK', 'Stiehm ER']","[""Department of Pediatrics, UCLA Children's Hospital, Los Angeles, California 90095, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,IM,,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/*pharmacology', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity/*drug effects', 'CD56 Antigen/biosynthesis', 'Chickens', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Erythrocytes/immunology', 'Fetal Blood/cytology/*immunology/metabolism', 'HIV Envelope Protein gp120/immunology', 'HIV-1/immunology', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Interleukin-12/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-15/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/*immunology/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/immunology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/immunology', 'Mice', 'Receptors, IgG/biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/06/24 00:00,1998/06/24 00:01,['1998/06/24 00:00'],"['1998/06/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/24 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/24 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0008-8749(98)91286-2 [pii]', '10.1006/cimm.1998.1286 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1998 May 1;185(2):83-92. doi: 10.1006/cimm.1998.1286.,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (HIV Envelope Protein gp120)', '0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)']",,,"['AI-27550/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-28697/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-30629/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

Under these conditions, we analyzed the expression of the transcription factors and observed that the expression of NF-E2 p45, but not those of GATA-1, GATA-2, Tal-1/SCL, Evi-1, and MafK, was increased after TPO and K252a stimulation.

To understand the difference in the action of IGF-I observed in vitro and in vivo experiments, we examined the effect of IGF-I on the proliferation and Fas-mediated apoptosis of human osteoblasts in vitro. Human osteoblastic cell line MG63 and human primary osteoblast-like cells obtained from biopsy specimens were used as human osteoblasts. Cells were cultured with or without various concentrations of IGF-I followed by determination of the proliferative response and Fas-mediated apoptosis. IGF-I dose dependently stimulated the proliferation of cultured human osteoblasts. Both Fas expression and the degree of anti-Fas IgM-induced apoptosis of human osteoblasts was also augmented by IGF-I. Furthermore, the cytotoxicity of Fas ligand (FasL) cDNA transformants against human osteoblasts was increased when IGF-I-stimulated osteoblasts were used as target cells, indicating that stimulation of IGF-I increased functional Fas expression on human osteoblasts as well as their proliferation. The addition of DEVD-CHO, a specific inhibitor of CPP32, to the culture resulted in a significant inhibition of Fas-mediated apoptosis of both unstimulated and IGF-I-stimulated osteoblasts, although it did not affect the proliferative response or Fas expression. Our data suggest that activation of CPP32 is necessary for Fas-mediated apoptosis of human osteoblasts, and treatment of IGF-I increased this signaling pathway. In contrast, regulation of proliferation and Fas expression of the cells were probably not affected by CPP32 activation. Our results suggest that IGF-I acts on cultured human osteoblasts by increasing their proliferation and induction of Fas-mediated apoptosis by neighbouring FasL+ cells such as osteoclasts, thus probably functioning as a local coupling factor in the bone in vivo, stimulating both bone formation and resorption.","['Kawakami, A', 'Nakashima, T', 'Tsuboi, M', 'Urayama, S', 'Matsuoka, N', 'Ida, H', 'Kawabe, Y', 'Sakai, H', 'Migita, K', 'Aoyagi, T', 'Nakashima, M', 'Maeda, K', 'Eguchi, K']","['Kawakami A', 'Nakashima T', 'Tsuboi M', 'Urayama S', 'Matsuoka N', 'Ida H', 'Kawabe Y', 'Sakai H', 'Migita K', 'Aoyagi T', 'Nakashima M', 'Maeda K', 'Eguchi K']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Nagasaki University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Ligands', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/toxicity', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Osteoblasts/*cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fas Receptor/drug effects/genetics/*physiology']",1998/06/24 00:00,1998/06/24 00:01,['1998/06/24 00:00'],"['1998/06/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/24 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/24 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(98)98728-9 [pii]', '10.1006/bbrc.1998.8728 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1998 Jun 9;247(1):46-51. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.1998.8728.,"['0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (aspartyl-glutamyl-valyl-aspartal)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For example, axotomized sympathetic, sensory, and motor neurons begin to express galanin mRNA and protein, and recent evidence suggests that galanin plays a role in peripheral nerve regeneration. Previous studies in sympathetic and sensory neurons have established that galanin expression is triggered by two consequences of nerve transection: the induction of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and the reduction in the availability of the target-derived factor, nerve growth factor. It is shown in the present study that no stimulation of galanin expression occurs following direct application of LIF to intact neurons in the superior cervical sympathetic ganglion. Injection of animals with an antiserum to nerve growth factor concomitant with the application of LIF, on the other hand, does stimulate galanin expression. The data suggest that the response of neurons to an injury factor, LIF, is affected by whether the neurons still receive trophic signals from their targets.","['Shadiack, A M', 'Vaccariello, S A', 'Sun, Y', 'Zigmond, R E']","['Shadiack AM', 'Vaccariello SA', 'Sun Y', 'Zigmond RE']","['Department of Neurosciences, Case Western Reserve University, 10900 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH 44106-4975, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,,"['Animals', 'Galanin/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Growth Inhibitors/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*physiology', 'Immune Sera', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*physiology', 'Male', 'Nerve Growth Factors/immunology/*physiology', 'Nerve Regeneration', 'Neurons/*physiology', 'Peripheral Nervous System/injuries/physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Superior Cervical Ganglion/drug effects/*physiology']",1998/06/24 00:00,1998/06/24 00:01,['1998/06/24 00:00'],"['1998/06/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/24 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.95.13.7727 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1998 Jun 23;95(13):7727-30. doi: 10.1073/pnas.95.13.7727.,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '88813-36-9 (Galanin)']",,,"['R01 NS017512/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 NS007118/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS 07118/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS 17512/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC22738,,,,,,,,,

PPARgamma is also expressed in a subset of macrophages and negatively regulates the expression of several proinflammatory genes in response to natural and synthetic ligands. We here demonstrate that PPARgamma is expressed in macrophage foam cells of human atherosclerotic lesions, in a pattern that is highly correlated with that of oxidation-specific epitopes. Oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL) and macrophage colony-stimulating factor, which are known to be present in atherosclerotic lesions, stimulated PPARgamma expression in primary macrophages and monocytic cell lines. PPARgamma mRNA expression was also induced in primary macrophages and THP-1 monocytic leukemia cells by the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA). Inhibition of protein kinase C blocked the induction of PPARgamma expression by TPA, but not by oxLDL, suggesting that more than one signaling pathway regulates PPARgamma expression in macrophages. TPA induced the expression of PPARgamma in RAW 264.7 macrophages by increasing transcription from the PPARgamma1 and PPARgamma3 promoters. In concert, these observations provide insights into the regulation of PPARgamma expression in activated macrophages and raise the possibility that PPARgamma ligands may influence the progression of atherosclerosis.","['Ricote, M', 'Huang, J', 'Fajas, L', 'Li, A', 'Welch, J', 'Najib, J', 'Witztum, J L', 'Auwerx, J', 'Palinski, W', 'Glass, C K']","['Ricote M', 'Huang J', 'Fajas L', 'Li A', 'Welch J', 'Najib J', 'Witztum JL', 'Auwerx J', 'Palinski W', 'Glass CK']","['Division of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California at San Diego, 9500 Gilman Drive, La Jolla, CA 92093-0651, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,,"['Animals', 'Arteriosclerosis/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*metabolism', 'Foam Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lipoproteins, LDL/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/*biosynthesis', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis']",1998/06/24 00:00,1998/06/24 00:01,['1998/06/24 00:00'],"['1998/06/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/24 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.95.13.7614 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1998 Jun 23;95(13):7614-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.95.13.7614.,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Lipoproteins, LDL)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (oxidized low density lipoprotein)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,"['R01 HL059694/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL14197-25/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL59694/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC22700,,,,,,,,,

Subsequently, they were shown to contain the PML protein which is part of the oncogenic PML-RARalpha hybrid produced by the t(15;17) chromosomal translocation characteristic of acute promyelocytic leukemia. Yet, the physiological role of these nuclear bodies remains unknown. Here, we show that SP100 binds to members of the heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) families of non-histone chromosomal proteins. Further, we demonstrate that a naturally occurring splice variant of SP100, here called SP100-HMG, is a member of the high mobility group-1 (HMG-1) protein family and may thus possess DNA-binding potential. Both HP1 and SP100-HMG concentrate in the PML/SP100 NBs, and overexpression of SP100 leads to enhanced accumulation of endogenous HP1 in these structures. When bound to a promoter, SP100, SP100-HMG and HP1 behave as transcriptional repressors in transfected mammalian cells. These observations present molecular evidence for an association between the PML/SP100 NBs and the chromatin nuclear compartment.

Maturational cleavage of the Gag polyprotein by the viral protease is associated with striking morphological changes. The PR- MuLV particles exhibit a rounded central core, which has a characteristic track-like shell on its surface, whereas the WT MuLV cores display a polygonal surface with loss of the track-like feature. The pleomorphic shape and inability to refine unique orientation angles suggest that neither the PR- nor the WT MuLV adheres to strict icosahedral symmetry. Nevertheless, the PR- MuLV particles do exhibit paracrystalline order with a spacing between Gag molecules of approximately 45 A and a length of approximately 200 A. Because of the pleomorphic shape and paracrystalline packing of the Gag-RNA complexes, we raise the possibility that assembly of MuLV is driven by protein-RNA, as well as protein-protein, interactions.

Disruption of the basic helix-loop-helix gene SCL (stem cell leukemia) causes a block early in the hematopoietic program with defects in all hematopoietic lineages. To understand how SCL participates in the organogenesis of blood, we have isolated cDNAs encoding Xenopus SCL and characterized the function of SCL during embryogenesis. We demonstrate that SCL is expressed in ventral mesoderm early in embryogenesis. SCL expression is induced by BMP-4, and a dominant negative BMP-4 receptor inhibits SCL expression in the ventral region of the embryo. Expression of SCL in either bFGF-treated animal pole explants or dorsal marginal zone explants leads to the expression of globin protein. Furthermore, over-expression of SCL does not alter normal dorsal-ventral patterning in the embryo, indicating that SCL acts to specify mesoderm to a hematopoietic fate after inductive and patterning events have occurred. We propose that SCL is both necessary and sufficient to specify hematopoietic mesoderm, and that it has a similar role in specifying hematopoietic cell fate as MyoD has in specifying muscle cell fate.","['Mead, P E', 'Kelley, C M', 'Hahn, P S', 'Piedad, O', 'Zon, L I']","['Mead PE', 'Kelley CM', 'Hahn PS', 'Piedad O', 'Zon LI']","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Children's Hospital and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Development,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein Receptors', 'Bone Morphogenetic Proteins/physiology', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*chemistry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/*genetics', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Mesoderm/*physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/physiology', 'Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor/physiology', '*Receptors, Growth Factor', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcription Factors/physiology', 'Xenopus/*embryology', '*Xenopus Proteins']",1998/06/24 00:00,1998/06/24 00:01,['1998/06/24 00:00'],"['1998/06/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/24 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/24 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Development. 1998 Jul;125(14):2611-20.,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Bmp4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Growth Factor)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (TAL1 protein, Xenopus)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Xenopus Proteins)', '0 (bmp4 protein, Xenopus)', 'EC 2.7.11.30 (Bone Morphogenetic Protein Receptors)']",,,,,,,,,,,['GENBANK/AF060151'],,,

X-rays and 99mtechnicium-MDP bone scans were performed on patients with symptoms of bone pain, whereby five patients out of 850 patients were detected to have avascular necrosis of the femoral head. All had received aggressive chemotherapy with steroids. Two patients were still on therapy for the primary disease. In these patients further chemotherapy was continued without steroids. The median period from diagnosis of ALL to development of AVNB was 29 months. Three patients underwent corrective surgical procedures. To conclude, the data suggest that patients receiving combination chemotherapy, especially those with high cumulative doses, run a risk of developing AVNB.

Therefore, evaluation of late complications such as cataracts is of paramount importance. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We analyzed data of 2149 patients from the EBMT registry. A cohort of 1063 patients were evaluable for survival and ophthalmologic status after transplant for acute leukemia (AL) in first or second complete remission. Conditioning therapy included either single-dose total body irradiation (STBI) or fractionated TBI (FTBI) grouped in different dose rates (low: LDR < or = 0.04 Gy/min; high: HDR > 0.04 Gy/min). RESULTS: The overall 10-year estimated cataract incidence (ECI) was 50%. It was 60% in the STBI group, 43% in the FTBI group < or = 6 fractions, and 7% in the FTBI group > 6 fractions (p < 10(-4)). It was significantly lower (30%) in the LDR than in the HDR groups (59%;p < 10(-4)). Patients receiving heparin for veno-occlusive disease prophylaxis had fewer cataracts than those who did not (10-year ECI: 33% vs. 53%, respectively;p = 0.04). The 10-year ECI was 65% in the allogeneic vs. 46% in the autologous BMT patients (p = 0.0018). Factors independently associated with an increased risk of cataract were an older age (> 23 years), higher dose rate (> 0.04 Gy/min), allogeneic BMT, and steroid administration (> 100 days). The use of FTBI was associated with a decreased risk of cataract. Heparin administration was a protective factor in patients receiving STBI. In terms of cataract surgery, the unfavorable factors for requiring surgery were: age > 23 yr, STBI, dose rate > 0.04 Gy/min, chronic graft-vs.-host disease (cGvHD), and absence of heparin administration. Among the patients who required cataract surgery (111 out of 257), secondary posterior capsular opacification was observed in 15.7%. CONCLUSION: High dose rate and STBI are the main risk factors for cataract development and the need for surgery, and the administration of heparin has a protective role in cataractogenesis.","['Belkacemi, Y', 'Labopin, M', 'Vernant, J P', 'Prentice, H G', 'Tichelli, A', 'Schattenberg, A', 'Boogaerts, M A', 'Ernst, P', 'Della Volpe, A', 'Goldstone, A H', 'Jouet, J P', 'Verdonck, L F', 'Locasciulli, A', 'Rio, B', 'Ozsahin, M', 'Gorin, N C']","['Belkacemi Y', 'Labopin M', 'Vernant JP', 'Prentice HG', 'Tichelli A', 'Schattenberg A', 'Boogaerts MA', 'Ernst P', 'Della Volpe A', 'Goldstone AH', 'Jouet JP', 'Verdonck LF', 'Locasciulli A', 'Rio B', 'Ozsahin M', 'Gorin NC']","['Acute Leukemia Working Party of the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Paris, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Cataract/*etiology', 'Cataract Extraction', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*adverse effects', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/*adverse effects']",1998/07/04 00:00,1998/07/04 00:01,['1998/07/04 00:00'],"['1998/07/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/04 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/04 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0360-3016(98)00077-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0360-3016(98)00077-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1998 Jun 1;41(3):659-68. doi: 10.1016/s0360-3016(98)00077-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS AND PATIENTS: Ninety acute leukemia patients received an allogeneic T-depleted matched (n = 54) or mismatched (n = 36) BMT. They were preconditioned with total body irradiation (TBI), thiotepa, rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin, and cyclophosphamide. The TBI scheme was hyperfractionated in matched, and a single dose in mismatched patients. The dose to the lungs was reduced in both groups. RESULTS: Five of the 54 matched patients developed IP. All cases were fatal. There were 16 cases of IP, 13 fatal, in the mismatched group. The probability of developing IP was 11.3 +/- 4.9% and 48.6 +/- 9.0%, respectively. The between-group difference was statistically significant (p < 0.0001). The type of transplant and the TBI scheme were the most important parameters for IP development in univariate analysis, whereas acute graft-versus-host disease, disease stage and sex were nonsignificant. Median follow-up was 342 days (range 17-2900). CONCLUSIONS: The low incidence of IP in matched patients and the lack of idiopathic cases are evidence for the validity of the TBI schedule. In contrast, the incidence in mismatched patients remains too high; therefore, new strategies should be studied in an attempt to lower it.","['Aristei, C', 'Aversa, F', 'Chionne, F', 'Martelli, M F', 'Latini, P']","['Aristei C', 'Aversa F', 'Chionne F', 'Martelli MF', 'Latini P']","['Institute of Radiotherapy Oncology, General Hospital and Perugia University, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/complications', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/complications', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*therapy', 'Lung Diseases, Interstitial/*etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pneumonia, Viral/etiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Transplantation Conditioning']",1998/07/04 00:00,1998/07/04 00:01,['1998/07/04 00:00'],"['1998/07/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/04 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/04 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0360-3016(98)00068-6 [pii]', '10.1016/s0360-3016(98)00068-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1998 Jun 1;41(3):651-7. doi: 10.1016/s0360-3016(98)00068-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS AND MATERIALS: In the study were 27 patients with Stage I or II gastric lymphoma who had undergone irradiation of at least 24 Gy to > or = 1/3 of the left kidney. They include 16 women and 11 men, aged 31 to 77, with a mean age of 57.6 years (median 56). Fifteen patients had Stage I and 12 had Stage II disease. In 13 patients the whole kidney had been irradiated, and 14 had had partial kidney irradiation, at doses ranging between 24 and 40.5 Gy. All patients received combined chemotherapy with various drugs: all patients received corticosteroids, and five received cis-platinum. Their follow-up ranged between 0.7 and 7.8 years (mean 3.4 years). Data on possible effects of the treatment on blood pressure, renal function as assessed by blood urea and creatinine, and kidney shrinkage as seen by serial computed tomography scanning were collected on all patients. RESULTS: Three patients had persistent, mild elevations of urea and creatinine levels, which did not require special treatment. All three also received cis-platinum. Ipsilateral kidney shrinkage was evident in most patients. In 19 patients the craniocaudal measurement of the kidney shrank by > or = 1.6 cm. Shrinkage in other dimensions was also evident. The degree of atrophy was related to the volume of kidney irradiated. Only two patients developed hypertension, both at a low level of 150/90; one patient had had 40 Gy to the whole kidney, the other 40 Gy to half the kidney. Neither patient had elevated urea or creatinine. CONCLUSIONS: Notwithstanding the shrinkage to the irradiated part of the kidney, the treatment did not lead to clinically significant hypertension or renal dysfunction. The administration of cis-platinum to patients with gastric lymphoma that requires kidney irradiation should be further evaluated.","['Maor, M H', 'North, L B', 'Cabanillas, F F', 'Ames, A L', 'Hess, M A', 'Cox, J D']","['Maor MH', 'North LB', 'Cabanillas FF', 'Ames AL', 'Hess MA', 'Cox JD']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kidney/physiopathology/*radiation effects', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*radiotherapy', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/*radiotherapy', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Stomach Neoplasms/*radiotherapy']",1998/07/04 00:00,1998/07/04 00:01,['1998/07/04 00:00'],"['1998/07/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/04 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/04 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0360-3016(98)00083-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0360-3016(98)00083-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1998 Jun 1;41(3):647-50. doi: 10.1016/s0360-3016(98)00083-2.,,,,,,,['Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1999 Mar 1;43(4):939-40.

RESULTS: Complete remissions were achieved in 65% of all patients. A 58% overall 5-year survival rate was obtained. Relapses in irradiated areas of known disease occurred in only 6% of responding patients. There was, however, no statistical difference in response frequency, disease-free survival, or overall survival among the four regimens. Elderly patients responded less frequently. CONCLUSION: While radiotherapy provided control of local (known) disease, no impact on overall survival was apparent.

The effect of TAL1 expression in the T-cell lymphoid precursor, however, remains unclear. In the current study, we have developed TAL1 stable transfectants in a human immature T-cell lymphoid cell line. Whereas no effect on proliferation, cell culture density, or cell cycle was detected, the transfectants were more resistant than the parental cell line to apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic agents including etoposide, daunorubicin, doxorubicin, cytosine arabinoside, methotrexate and vincristine and also to apoptosis induced by Fas/CD95 cross-linking. This effect was independent of the cytostatic effects of the drugs. The basic domain-deleted transfectants did not demonstrate altered sensitivity, suggesting that DNA binding was necessary for resistance to apoptosis. The ability to alter the response to a wide range of cell death-inducing stimuli suggests that TAL1 acts at a late stage of the apoptotic cascade. These data therefore provide direct evidence of an antiapoptotic effect of ectopic TAL1 expression in response to cytotoxic agents, thus providing insight into its oncogenic function in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and a novel experimental model to further investigate the underlying mechanisms.

Such roles, however, have not been generally established because of insufficient quantitative and systemic analyses. To address this, we examined the expression of VEGF in 13 mouse ascites tumors (5 sarcomas, 3 carcinomas, 2 lymphomas, 1 leukemia, 1 mastocytoma, and 1 plasmacytoma). Using a newly developed sensitive and specific radioreceptor binding assay and functional assays, we found that active VEGF was significantly accumulated (6-850 ng/ml) in the ascites fluids of all 13 tumors. VEGF concentrations are higher in the tumors of sarcoma and carcinoma origin (430.4 +/- 234.2 ng/ml) than in those of lymphoma and hematological tumor origin (19.2 +/- 10.45 ng/ml). VEGF that accumulated in the peritoneal fluids or expressed in the ascites tumor cells was easily visualized with immunoprecipitation Western blot analysis with a rough correlation to the expression levels of VEGF gene in these tumor cells, suggesting that the tumor cells, at least in part, contributed to the production of the VEGF that accumulated in the ascites fluid. Most ascites tumors expressed VEGF; the 164-amino acid isoform was predominant, the 120-amino acid isoform was less abundant, and the 188-amino acid isoform was least abundant. Several representative ascites tumors expressed similar, if not higher, levels of VEGF when they were cultured at normoxic states, suggesting that they expressed VEGF at high levels in a constitutive manner. The microvessel densities in the peritoneal walls of tumor-bearing mice, which are significantly higher than those in normal mice, basically correlated to but did not parallel the VEGF concentrations in their respective ascites fluids. Thus, a complicated relationship may exist between the VEGF production and angiogenesis associated with ascites tumor in vivo. Taken together, our observations suggest that VEGF plays a fundamental role in ascites tumor formation; however, its importance may vary according to tumor origin.","['Luo, J C', 'Yamaguchi, S', 'Shinkai, A', 'Shitara, K', 'Shibuya, M']","['Luo JC', 'Yamaguchi S', 'Shinkai A', 'Shitara K', 'Shibuya M']","['Department of Genetics, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,,"['Animals', 'Ascites/*metabolism', 'Ascitic Fluid/metabolism/pathology', 'Endothelial Growth Factors/*analysis/genetics/metabolism', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymphokines/*analysis/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis/metabolism', 'Peritoneal Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors']",1998/07/04 00:00,1998/07/04 00:01,['1998/07/04 00:00'],"['1998/07/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/04 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/04 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1998 Jun 15;58(12):2652-60.,"['0 (Endothelial Growth Factors)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most of the alterations are deletions that are thought to be indicative of the presence of a tumor suppressor gene that is mutated on the remaining allele. These observations led us to consider whether 6q loss may contribute to the pathogenesis of childhood ALL. To define further a region containing this gene, we analyzed the loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of chromosome 6 in 113 primary ALL samples with matched normal DNA using 34 highly informative microsatellite markers. LOH was found in 17 (15%) samples at one or more of the loci, and partial or interstitial deletions of 6q were detected in 11 of these tumors. On the basis of these results, we performed a detailed deletional map and identified two distinct regions of deletion. The first region is flanked by D6S283 and D6S302 loci at 6q21-22. The second region is flanked by D6S275 and D6S283 loci at 6q21. Clinical analysis determined that LOH of 6q was demonstrated both in precursor-B cell ALLs (15 of 93; 16%) and in T cell ALLs (2 of 19; 11%). In addition, 19 patients have been studied at diagnosis and relapse; 18 showed the same 6q21-22 structural abnormality at relapse (normal, 16 patients; LOH, 2 patients) as their initial presentation, suggesting, albeit with a small patient sample size, that 6q21-22 deletions may be an initial event in leukemogenesis and may occur less frequently during the progression of childhood ALL. These data suggest the presence of putative tumor suppressor genes on chromosome arm 6q that are important in the development of both T and precursor-B childhood ALLs. Our map provides important information toward cloning putative ALL tumor suppressor genes.","['Takeuchi, S', 'Koike, M', 'Seriu, T', 'Bartram, C R', 'Schrappe, M', 'Reiter, A', 'Park, S', 'Taub, H E', 'Kubonishi, I', 'Miyoshi, I', 'Koeffler, H P']","['Takeuchi S', 'Koike M', 'Seriu T', 'Bartram CR', 'Schrappe M', 'Reiter A', 'Park S', 'Taub HE', 'Kubonishi I', 'Miyoshi I', 'Koeffler HP']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Cedars-Sinai Research Institute, University of California at Los Angeles School of Medicine, 90048, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Loss of Heterozygosity/*genetics', 'Male', 'Microsatellite Repeats/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/mortality', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Analysis']",1998/07/04 00:00,1998/07/04 00:01,['1998/07/04 00:00'],"['1998/07/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/07/04 00:01 [medline]', '1998/07/04 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1998 Jun 15;58(12):2618-23.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we purified a Mg2+-dependent endonuclease from etoposide-treated HL-60 cells undergoing apoptosis. High levels of Mg2+-dependent endonuclease activity were detected in etoposide-treated HL-60 cells, and this activity increased in a time-dependent manner following etoposide treatment. Such an activity could not be detected in untreated cells or in cells treated with etoposide in the presence of the caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-(OMe)-fluoromethyl ketone (zVAD-fmk) or the serine protease inhibitor tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK). This Mg2+-dependent endonuclease was purified by a series of chromatographic procedures. The enzyme preparation showed a single major protein band with Mr 34,000, determined by SDS-PAGE. The presence of the Mr 34,000 Mg2+-dependent endonuclease was also confirmed by activity gel analysis. The enzyme required only Mg2+ for full activity. pH optimum was in the range of 6.5-7.5. This enzyme introduced single- and double-strand breaks into SV40 DNA and produced internucleosomal DNA cleavage in isolated nuclei from untreated cells. The DNA breaks were terminated with 3'-OH, consistent with characteristic products of apoptotic chromatin fragmentation.

Here we review recent developments in our understanding of the antiviral and immunoregulatory properties of IFN-alpha, the nature of the multisubunit IFN-alpha receptor, and the molecular mechanisms of signal transduction. Where available, we have included comparative data on recombinant alpha-IFNs derived from both naturally occurring and nonnaturally occurring synthetic genes. We also review clinical data and data on the side effects and antigenicity of different sources of recombinant alpha-IFNs in humans. These latter topics are of clinical interest, because they may potentially affect the efficacy of these various products.

This enhancement was inhibited by treatment with a protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide and with an RNA synthesis inhibitor, actinomycin D, after irradiation. These findings suggested that low-dose irradiation induced the synthesis of some proteins which were attributed to the enhancement of CFA. Since we expected that one species of these proteins were heat shock proteins (hsps), we attempted to detect the hsp70 family by the Western blotting method and inducible hsp70 mRNA by the RT-PCR method. Low-dose irradiation induced the expression of hsp70 mRNA, whereas the enhancement of hsp70 (an inducible isoform) and hsc70 (a constitutively expressed isoform) expression could not be found. Furthermore, the M1 cells showed thermoresistance 1 h after low-dose pre-irradiation, and also showed radioresistance 4 h after irradiation. This time difference after pre-irradiation might be attributed to the different species of proteins in showing resistance to lethal stress. Therefore, some proteins other than hsp70 were believed to be concerned with the augmentation of CFA and the induction of thermo- and radio-resistance.","['Ibuki, Y', 'Hayashi, A', 'Suzuki, A', 'Goto, R']","['Ibuki Y', 'Hayashi A', 'Suzuki A', 'Goto R']","['Laboratory of Radiation Biology, Graduate School of Nutritional and Environmental Sciences, University of Shizuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Biol Pharm Bull,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,9311984,IM,,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'DNA Fragmentation/radiation effects', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Hot Temperature', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/*biosynthesis/*radiation effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/06/23 00:00,1998/06/23 00:01,['1998/06/23 00:00'],"['1998/06/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/23 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1248/bpb.21.434 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Pharm Bull. 1998 May;21(5):434-9. doi: 10.1248/bpb.21.434.,"['0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eight-fold overexpression of hRFC1, as determined by northern analysis, resulted in a 4-fold increase in MTX influx accompanied by a 2.4-fold increase in the steady-state level of free drug as compared with wild-type ZR-75-1 cells when the extracellular MTX level was 0.5 microM. When extracellular MTX was increased to 10 microM, the increase in influx equaled the increase in the transmembrane chemical gradient for MTX in the transfectant relative to wild-type cells. By 50 min, approximately 16-20 and 25% of the intracellular 3H represented MTX polyglutamates by HPLC analysis at [MTX]e = 0.5 and 10 microM in wild-type and transfected cells, respectively. Overexpression of hRFC1 enhanced sensitivity to MTX in MTX(R)ZR-75-1 cells by more than 250-fold. The data indicate that overexpression of hRFC1 in human cells results in comparable increases in influx and transmembrane gradients. This is different from what was reported when mouse RFC1 was transfected into murine leukemia cells, resulting in large, more symmetrical increases in the MTX bidirectional transport kinetics with a much smaller change in steady-state levels. The changes in the human cells transfected with hRFC1 however, were similar to what has been observed by other investigators when RFC1 expression is increased by low folate selective pressure.","['Sharif, K A', 'Moscow, J A', 'Goldman, I D']","['Sharif KA', 'Moscow JA', 'Goldman ID']","['Department of Medicine, Albert Einstein Comprehensive Cancer Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY 10461, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacokinetics', 'Biological Transport', 'Breast Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Folic Acid/*metabolism', 'Humans', '*Membrane Proteins', '*Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Methotrexate/*pharmacokinetics', 'Mice', 'Reduced Folate Carrier Protein', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/06/20 00:00,1998/06/20 00:01,['1998/06/20 00:00'],"['1998/06/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/20 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(98)00039-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(98)00039-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1998 May 15;55(10):1683-9. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(98)00039-2.,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Reduced Folate Carrier Protein)', '0 (SLC19A1 protein, human)', '0 (SLC19A2 protein, human)', '0 (Slc19a1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Slc19a2 protein, mouse)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,['CA-39807/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

We have used interphase FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) and competitive RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction) techniques for detection of BCR-ABL-positive cells to measure suppression of leukaemic clone in a series of 51 follow-up samples from 24 CML patients undergoing IFN-alpha treatment. Interphase FISH analysis of the malignant clone in bone marrow using BCR and ABL probes was found to be highly correlated to conventional G-banding metaphase examination (r = 0.98). RT-PCR quantification of BCR-ABL mRNA transcripts in blood also showed a high degree of concordance with the proportion of Ph-positive metaphases (r = 0.93). In addition, the degree of cytogenetic response did not influence the equivalence between karyotype analysis and molecular methods. We concluded that interphase FISH and competitive RT-PCR provide reliable information on residual tumour burden and response to IFN-alpha in CML patients.

Expression of topo IIalpha mRNA was reduced to <30%, whereas no significant alteration of topo IIbeta mRNA expression was observed. Under these conditions, drug sensitivity to the topo-II-directed agents, etoposide and daunorubicin, was reduced to approximately 50%, whereas sensitivity to 4-hydroperoxy-cyclophosphamide (4-HC) was not altered.

Flow cytometric profiles of doxorubicin-treated HL-60, K562, U937 and Jurkat cells failed to show any significant increase in Fas or Fas ligand expression over 24 h, despite the induction of significant levels of apoptosis in these cells. Although preincubation of human leukaemic cells with a neutralizing anti-Fas IgG antibody blocked anti-Fas IgM-induced apoptosis, this strategy failed to inhibit chemotherapeutic drug-induced apoptosis. To determine whether recruitment of the Fas/Fas ligand complex during drug-induced apoptosis was a cell-specific event we utilized the CEM cell line. Doxorubicin treatment of CEM cells over 24 h failed to show any up-regulation in Fas or Fas ligand protein levels as detected by flow cytometry. Furthermore, neutralizing anti-Fas IgG Ab failed to inhibit chemotherapeutic drug-induced apoptosis in CEM cells. The present studies do, however, demonstrate a role for anti-Fas IgM Ab in producing a cytotoxic synergistic effect when used in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs. Low-dose anti-Fas IgM treatment in combination with doxorubicin, methotrexate, camptothecin and etoposide produced an augmented cytoxicity in CEM cells. Taken together these observations demonstrate that although recruitment of the Fas/APO-1/CD95 receptor/ligand system is not a necessary requirement for chemotherapeutic drug-induced apoptosis, combination of anti-Fas IgM and drug treatment produces a synergistic cytotoxic effect which may prove useful in the treatment of human leukaemias.","['McGahon, A J', 'Costa Pereira, A P', 'Daly, L', 'Cotter, T G']","['McGahon AJ', 'Costa Pereira AP', 'Daly L', 'Cotter TG']","['Department of Biochemistry, University College, Cork, Ireland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Synergism', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/metabolism', 'Immunoglobulin M/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fas Receptor/*metabolism']",1998/06/20 00:00,1998/06/20 00:01,['1998/06/20 00:00'],"['1998/06/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.00745.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1998 Jun;101(3):539-47. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.00745.x.,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antibodies)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously shown constitutive activation of MAP kinase in approximately 50% of acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) samples. Recently, STAT proteins have been reported to be constitutively activated in 10-20% of AML cases. STAT3 and STAT5 are the main STAT proteins activated in haemopoietic progenitors in response to cytokines such as IL-3, GM-CSF, erythropoietin and thrombopoietin. Although the possibility of STAT1 protein as a substrate for MAP kinase at a serine residue has been suggested, the cross-talk between STATs and MAP kinase pathways in vivo, especially in leukaemia cells, remains unknown. We examined the phosphorylation of STAT 3 and STAT 5 at the tyrosine residues in AML samples in which MAP kinase activity had already been found. 40/50 primary AML cases (80%) exhibited constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed DNA binding activity of STAT5 correlated with tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5. Similarly, with respect to STAT3, 17/23 cases examined (74%) showed constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3. In addition, we examined the tyrosyl-phosphorylation of STAT5 isoforms, STAT5A and STAT5B, in 20 AML cases, and found selective STAT5B phosphorylation in the absence of STAT5A phosphorylation in three cases. Furthermore, in certain AML cases, constitutive activation of MAP kinase and STAT proteins occurred independently. No significant correlation of MAP kinase activation was observed with either tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3/STAT5 or positive DNA binding of STAT proteins. These results suggest that constitutive activation of STAT proteins occurs commonly and that the causes of constitutive activation of these two major cascades are heterogeneous in AML.","['Hayakawa, F', 'Towatari, M', 'Iida, H', 'Wakao, H', 'Kiyoi, H', 'Naoe, T', 'Saito, H']","['Hayakawa F', 'Towatari M', 'Iida H', 'Wakao H', 'Kiyoi H', 'Naoe T', 'Saito H']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Blotting, Western', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*enzymology', '*Milk Proteins', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Binding', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",1998/06/20 00:00,1998/06/20 00:01,['1998/06/20 00:00'],"['1998/06/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.00720.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1998 Jun;101(3):521-8. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.00720.x.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT5A protein, human)', '0 (STAT5B protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One dominant flanking sequence was obtained in the four samples harbouring a unique band after Southern-blotting. In one sample, which harboured two signals after Southern-blotting, IPCR amplification of diluted tumourous DNA revealed that these two sequences corresponded to one clone harbouring two integrated proviruses rather than to two distinct cellular clones, a result consistent with superinfection of the tumourous sample. In addition to integration sites corresponding to malignant clones, two to six oligoclonal forms were sequenced in four samples. No flanking sequence homology was found between clones derived from each patient, indicating that integration sites deletion in the vicinity of the provirus is a rare event in ATLL. The oligoclonal pattern of HTLV-1 replication in ATLL may result from clonal expansion of non-malignant HTLV-1-bearing clones within the sample and partly from HTLV-1 superinfection of monoclonal tumour cells.","['Leclercq, I', 'Cavrois, M', 'Mortreux, F', 'Hermine, O', 'Gessain, A', 'Morschhauser, F', 'Wattel, E']","['Leclercq I', 'Cavrois M', 'Mortreux F', 'Hermine O', 'Gessain A', 'Morschhauser F', 'Wattel E']","['Unite 124 INSERM, Institute de Recherche sur le Cancer, Lille, France.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,,"['Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Clonal Deletion', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/*virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'T-Lymphocytes/*virology', 'Virus Integration/genetics', 'Virus Replication/*genetics']",1998/06/20 00:00,1998/06/20 00:01,['1998/06/20 00:00'],"['1998/06/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.00743.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1998 Jun;101(3):500-6. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.00743.x.,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A strain of M. fermentans was recently isolated from a mouse T-lymphoma cell line, which differs from other M. fermentans strains by its growth characteristics and was designated (in the authors' records) as strain 609. Using the differential display technique (DD), a differentially expressed gene that was identified as the M. fermentans 609 ftsZ gene was isolated. Comparison of the nucleotide sequence of the M. fermentans 609 ftsZ gene to other ftsZ genes showed a 98% homology with Mycoplasma fermentans strain K7 and approximately 50% homology with Mycoplasma pulmonis and Mycoplasma genitalium. Comparison of the putative amino acid sequences of the FtsZ proteins showed similar homology. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to detect the presence of this ftsZ gene was established; it is a fast and convenient assay to detect infection of cells by the M. fermentans species. This work demonstrates that: (i) DD can be used as a useful technique to identify and isolate mycoplasmal genes from infected cells; and (ii) the ftsZ gene can be a useful marker to distinguish between different species of mycoplasma.","['Ofir, R', 'Horowitz, S', 'Wu, Q', 'Weinstein, Y']","['Ofir R', 'Horowitz S', 'Wu Q', 'Weinstein Y']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben Gurion University, Negev, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mol Cell Probes,Molecular and cellular probes,8709751,IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Bacterial Proteins/chemistry/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', '*Cytoskeletal Proteins', 'DNA, Bacterial/isolation & purification', '*Genes, Bacterial', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Mycoplasma fermentans/*genetics/growth & development/*isolation & purification', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Retroviridae Infections', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/06/20 00:00,1998/06/20 00:01,['1998/06/20 00:00'],"['1998/06/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/20 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0890-8508(98)90157-8 [pii]', '10.1006/mcpr.1998.0157 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Probes. 1998 Apr;12(2):85-92. doi: 10.1006/mcpr.1998.0157.,"['0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Bacterial)', '0 (FtsZ protein, Bacteria)']",,,,,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/X98609', 'GENBANK/X98610']",,,

The gene encoding the beta subunit is disrupted by inv(16), resulting in the formation of a chimeric protein, beta-SMMHC, which is associated with acute myelogenous leukemia. To understand the effect of beta-SMMHC on PEBP2-mediated transactivation, we used a luciferase assay system in which contribution of both the alpha and beta subunits was absolutely required to activate transcription. Using this system, we found that the minimal region of the beta subunit required for transactivation resides between amino acid 1 and 135, which is known to dimerize with the alpha subunit. In contrast, beta-SMMHC, despite having this minimal region for dimerization and transactivation, failed to support transcription with the alpha subunit. Furthermore beta-SMMHC blocked the synergistic transcription achieved by PEBP2 and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha. By using a construct in which the PEBP2 alpha subunit was fused to the glucocorticoid receptor ligand binding domain, we demonstrated that coexpressed beta-SMMHC tightly sequestered the alpha subunit in the cytoplasm and blocked dexamethasone-dependent nuclear translocation of the alpha subunit. Thus, the result suggess that beta-SMMHC inhibits PEBP2-mediated transcription via cytoplasmic sequestration of the alpha subunit. Lastly proliferation of ME-1 cells that harbor inv(16) was blocked by an antisense oligonucleotide complementary to the junction of the chimeric mRNA, suggesting that beta-SMMHC contributes to leukemogenesis by blocking the differentiation of myeloid cells.","['Kanno, Y', 'Kanno, T', 'Sakakura, C', 'Bae, S C', 'Ito, Y']","['Kanno Y', 'Kanno T', 'Sakakura C', 'Bae SC', 'Ito Y']","['Department of Viral Oncology, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Chromosome Inversion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Core Binding Factor alpha Subunits', 'Cytoplasm', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Rats', 'Transcription Factor AP-2', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/06/25 00:00,1998/06/25 00:01,['1998/06/25 00:00'],"['1998/06/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/25 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.18.7.4252 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1998 Jul;18(7):4252-61. doi: 10.1128/MCB.18.7.4252.,"['0 (CBFbeta-MYH11 fusion protein)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Core Binding Factor alpha Subunits)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Runx1 protein, rat)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-2)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,,PMC109009,,,,,,,,,

Gel shift and immunosupershift analyses demonstrated that both the positive-acting GC box and the negative-acting GC/GT box were recognized by Sp1 and Sp3. Co-transfection studies using Sp1 and/or Sp3 expression plasmids revealed that while Sp1 stimulated, Sp3 repressed Sp1-mediated transactivation of TC II transcription. The proximal GC/GT box also acted as a negative element in human chronic myelogenous leukemia K-562 and HeLa cells. These results suggest that tissue/cell specific expression of the TC II gene may be controlled by the relative ratios of Sp1 and Sp3 that bind to the GC/GT box and the weak promoter activity of TC II is due to the transcriptional repression caused by the binding of Sp3 to the proximal GC/GT box.","['Li, N', 'Seetharam, S', 'Seetharam, B']","['Li N', 'Seetharam S', 'Seetharam B']","['Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Medical College of Wisconsin and Veterans Medical Center, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53226, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,,"['Base Sequence', 'Caco-2 Cells', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Sp3 Transcription Factor', 'Transcobalamins/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism']",1998/06/20 00:00,1998/06/20 00:01,['1998/06/20 00:00'],"['1998/06/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/20 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.273.26.16104 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)80714-1 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1998 Jun 26;273(26):16104-11. doi: 10.1074/jbc.273.26.16104.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (SP3 protein, human)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Transcobalamins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '148710-94-5 (Sp3 Transcription Factor)']",,,"['DK-26638/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK-50052/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

This family includes the MDS1-EVI1 gene inactivated in myeloid leukemia, the PRDI-BF1/BLIMP1 transcription repressor of c-myc involved in driving B-cell differentiation, and the RIZ gene, which encodes proteins capable of binding to the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (Rb). The PR domain of MDS1-EVI1 is disrupted by translocations linked to myeloid leukemia, resulting in the activation of the PR-minus oncogenic product EVI1. Remarkably similar to MDS1-EVI1, RIZ gene also normally produces two protein products of different length, and the smaller protein RIZ2 lacks the PR domain of RIZ1 but is otherwise identical to RIZ1. These observations raise considerable interest to determine the function of PR. We show here that RIZ1 PR domain mediates protein-protein interaction. Recombinant fusion proteins of PR can bind to in vitro translated RIZ1 and RIZ2 proteins. The binding can be disrupted by amino acid substitutions at conserved residues of PR, suggesting that binding is specific. Of the three conserved exons of PR, the first two appear dispensable for binding, whereas the third exon is required. A region in the carboxyl terminus of RIZ proteins was mapped to be necessary and sufficient for PR binding. We also found that the PR domain shares significant sequence identity to the SET domain present in chromosomal proteins that function in modulating gene expression from yeast to mammals. Our data suggest that the PR domain is a derivative of SET domain and may function as protein binding interface in the regulation of chromatin-mediated gene expression.","['Huang, S', 'Shao, G', 'Liu, L']","['Huang S', 'Shao G', 'Liu L']","['Program in Oncogenes and Tumor Suppressor Genes, The Burnham Institute, La Jolla, California 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Chromatin/*metabolism', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Protein Binding', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/*metabolism', '*Transcription Factors', '*Zinc Fingers/genetics']",1998/06/20 00:00,1998/06/20 00:01,['1998/06/20 00:00'],"['1998/06/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/20 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.273.26.15933 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)80691-3 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1998 Jun 26;273(26):15933-9. doi: 10.1074/jbc.273.26.15933.,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (PRDM2 protein, human)']",,,"['CA76146/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA57496/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Tax-induced breakdown of IkappaBalpha requires phosphorylation of the inhibitor at Ser-32 and Ser-36, which is also a prerequisite for the transient activation of NF-kappaB in cytokine-treated T lymphocytes. However, it remained unclear how Tax interfaces with the cellular NF-kappaB/IkappaB signaling machinery to generate a chronic rather than a transient NF-kappaB response. We now demonstrate that Tax associates with cytokine-inducible IkappaB kinase (IKK) complexes containing catalytic subunits IKKalpha and IKKbeta, which mediate phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha at Ser-32 and Ser-36. Unlike their transiently activated counterparts in cytokine-treated cells, Tax-associated forms of IKK are constitutively active in either Tax transfectants or HTLV1-infected T lymphocytes. Moreover, point mutations in Tax that ablate its IKK-binding function also prevent Tax-mediated activation of IKK and NF-kappaB. Together, these findings suggest that the persistent activation of NF-kappaB in HTLV1-infected T-cells is mediated by a direct Tax/IKK coupling mechanism.","['Chu, Z L', 'DiDonato, J A', 'Hawiger, J', 'Ballard, D W']","['Chu ZL', 'DiDonato JA', 'Hawiger J', 'Ballard DW']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee 37232, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,,"['Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'HTLV-I Infections/*enzymology', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase', 'Jurkat Cells', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism']",1998/06/20 00:00,1998/06/20 00:01,['1998/06/20 00:00'],"['1998/06/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/20 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.273.26.15891 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)80684-6 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1998 Jun 26;273(26):15891-4. doi: 10.1074/jbc.273.26.15891.,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (CHUK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (IKBKB protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (IKBKE protein, human)']",,,"['R01 AI33839/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL45994/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA09385/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

We previously isolated and cultivated the HGE agent in the promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 and have also demonstrated the susceptibility of both granulocytic and monocytic human marrow progenitors. Circulating monocytes have not been observed to be infected, suggesting that cell susceptibility may be differentiation specific. To evaluate this hypothesis, HL-60 cells were differentiated towards granulocytes (with dimethyl sulfoxide or all-trans retinoic acid) or toward monocytes-macrophages (with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate [TPA], gamma interferon, or 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3) and then challenged with HGE. HGE binding, internalization, and proliferation were compared in differentiated and untreated control HL-60 cells by immunofluorescence, electron microscopy, and Giemsa staining. Granulocytic differentiation resulted in a doubling of HGE binding and enhanced infection consistent with the agent's clinical tropism for neutrophils. Granulocytic cells were unable to kill internalized ehrlichiae even after activation induced by N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe alone or together with tumor necrosis factor alpha. In contrast, monocyte-macrophage differentiation with TPA resulted in complete resistance to infection through at least two distinct mechanisms: (i) reduction in binding and uptake and (ii) killing of any internalized organisms. Diminished binding in TPA-treated cells correlated with their reduced expression of sialyl Lewis x (CD15s), a putative cellular receptor component for HGE. The degree of monocytic differentiation and activation induced (i.e., TPA > gamma interferon > vitamin D3) correlated with resistance to HGE. Thus, HL-60 cells exhibit a striking differentiation-specific susceptibility to HGE.

Interleukin 6 (IL-6) and members of its superfamily, including ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) and leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) have been implicated as primary mediators of the hepatic acute phase response. In the present report, mice suffering a turpentine-induced myositis were passively immunized with antibodies against either IL-6, CNTF or LIF. Passive immunization against IL-6 attenuated the anorexia and completely prevented the hypoalbuminaemia, and increases in the serum concentration of the acute phase reactants, amyloid P, amyloid A and seromucoid. In contrast, passive immunization against either CNTF or LIF failed to modulate the anorexia, weight loss or hepatic acute phase protein responses. The findings suggest that IL-6, but not other members of its superfamily, is primarily responsible for the hepatic acute phase response, and contributes to the anorexia, associated with turpentine-induced myositis.","['Kaibara, A', 'Espat, N J', 'Auffenberg, T', 'Abouhamze, A S', 'Martin, D', 'Kalra, S', 'Moldawer, L L']","['Kaibara A', 'Espat NJ', 'Auffenberg T', 'Abouhamze AS', 'Martin D', 'Kalra S', 'Moldawer LL']","['Department of Surgery, University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville, FL 32610, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Cytokine,Cytokine,9005353,IM,,"['Acute-Phase Reaction/*physiopathology', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Body Weight/drug effects', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Eating/drug effects', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/immunology/*physiology', 'Immunization, Passive', 'Interleukin-6/immunology/*physiology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/immunology/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Myositis/chemically induced/*immunology', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/immunology/*physiology', 'Orosomucoid/analysis', 'Serum Albumin/analysis', 'Serum Amyloid A Protein/analysis', 'Serum Amyloid P-Component/analysis', 'Turpentine']",1998/06/25 00:00,1998/06/25 00:01,['1998/06/25 00:00'],"['1998/06/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/25 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/25 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1043-4666(97)90313-6 [pii]', '10.1006/cyto.1997.0313 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytokine. 1998 Jun;10(6):452-6. doi: 10.1006/cyto.1997.0313.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Orosomucoid)', '0 (Serum Albumin)', '0 (Serum Amyloid A Protein)', '0 (Serum Amyloid P-Component)', 'XJ6RUH0O4G (Turpentine)']",,,['GM-40586/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],['Copyright 1998 Academic Press Limited.'],,,,,,,,,,

Reports thus far have been mostly limited to patients who received DLT from a matched sibling donor. We compared the efficacy and toxicity of DLT in 30 patients who were treated with cells from their HLA-identical sibling (n = 18) or from their phenotypically HLA-matched unrelated marrow donor (n = 12). The overall probability of obtaining a cytogenetic remission was 69% (95%CI: 51-83%) and was not significantly different between the two groups. The disease stage at the time of DLT was the only factor associated with cytogenetic remission by multivariate analysis; patients treated in cytogenetic or molecular relapse (n = 11) were seven times more likely (RR = 7.4, 95%CI: 2.4-22.4, P = 0.0005) to respond compared to patients treated for hematologic relapse (n = 19). There was a trend towards more acute GVHD II-IV in the unrelated donor group (58 vs 39%, P = 0.09), but the probability of developing extensive chronic GVHD was not significantly different (56 vs 39%, P = 0.4). We conclude that transfusion of donor cells from HLA-matched volunteer donors does not appreciably increase the risk of GVHD compared with transfusion of cells from HLA-identical siblings in patients with CML who relapse following allogeneic BMT.

We investigated the feasibility and toxicity of this approach in 57 patients with Ph-positive CML. For mobilization of Ph-negative PBSC, patients were treated either with '5 + 2/7 + 3'- type chemotherapy or with 'mini-ICE/ICE' chemotherapy followed by administration of G-CSF. Fourteen patients were in early chronic phase, 30 patients in late chronic phase and 13 patients in accelerated phase (AP) or blast crisis (BC). Cytogenetic responses in the PBSC harvests were dependent on both disease stage and type of chemotherapy: in late chronic phase and AP/BC, a complete or major cytogenetic response could be obtained in nine out of 13 patients treated with 'mini-ICE/ICE' but only in three out of 23 patients treated with '5 + 2/7 + 3' chemotherapy. However, in early chronic phase a Ph-negative autograft could be obtained in three out of eight patients upon mobilization with '5 + 2' chemotherapy. Thirty-one patients underwent PBSC transplantation and all of them successfully engrafted. Post-transplant cytogenetic analysis was available on 21 cases, of whom seven achieved a complete or major cytogenetic response, with two minor cytogenetic remissions. One patient (1/57) in blast crisis died during mobilization therapy (1.8%). Transplantation related mortality was 0%. This study demonstrates that mobilization of Ph-negative PBSC after myelosuppressive chemotherapy is feasible in CML patients and is associated with acceptable toxicity.

Only 65% of patients who reached CR and 51% of the initial 37 cases underwent the intended SCT.

The haematopoietic stem cells were infused into their HLA-identical recipients suffering from acute leukaemias in remission or chronic myeloid leukaemia in chronic phase. PBPC donors tolerated filgrastim administration and leukapheresis well with the most frequent side-effects being musculoskeletal pain, headache, and mild increases of LDH, AP, Gamma-GT or SGPT. Pain and haematoma at the harvest site and mild anaemia were the most frequent complaints of BM donors. Severe or life-threatening complications were not seen with any type of harvest procedure.

Administration of filgrastim and leukapheresis in normal donors were feasible and well tolerated. The number of days with restricted activity and of nights spent in hospital was lower in donors of PBPC. Transplantation of PBPC to HLA-identical siblings with early leukaemia resulted in earlier platelet engraftment. The incidence of moderate to severe acute GVHD, transplant-related mortality, and leukaemia-free survival did not show striking differences.

Elevation of intracellular cAMP levels completely blocked Raf-1 activation by LIF, but was without effect on the magnitude of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) stimulation by the cytokine, suggesting the presence of a Raf-1-independent, cAMP-insensitive MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK) pathway in 3T3-L1 cells. Mono Q-fractionation of LIF-stimulated 3T3-L1 extracts identified a single peak of MAPKKK activity that was largely insensitive to elevated intracellular levels of cAMP, and that failed to correlate with stimulation of either Raf-1 or MEKK1 protein kinases. Our results demonstrate that LIF-mediated activation of the MAP kinase cascade in 3T3-L1 cells proceeds through both Raf-1-dependent and -independent pathways which differ in their sensitivity to inhibition by intracellular cAMP.","['Schiemann, W P', 'Nathanson, N M']","['Schiemann WP', 'Nathanson NM']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Washington, Seattle 98195-7750, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Colforsin/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time Factors']",1998/06/19 00:00,1998/06/19 00:01,['1998/06/19 00:00'],"['1998/06/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/19 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/19 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1201800 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1998 May;16(20):2671-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1201800.,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '1F7A44V6OU (Colforsin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)']",,,"['NS30410/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32GM07750/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Extensive information is available on AML1, a member of the CBF family of transcription factors, containing a highly conserved domain, the runt box, of the Drosophila segmentation gene runt. This gene is essential for the hematopoietic development and is found disrupted in several leukemias. In contrast, the function of the MTG8 gene is poorly understood. The predicted protein sequence shows two unusual, putative zinc-fingers, three proline-rich regions, a PEST domain and several phosphorylation sites. In addition, we found a region encompassing aa 443-514 predicted to have a significant propensity to form coiled coil structures. MTG8 displays a high degree of similarity with nervy, a homeotic target gene of Drosophila, expressed in the nervous system. Human and mouse wild-type MTG8 are also highly expressed in brain relative to other tissues. For these reasons, we set out to investigate the expression and subcellular localization of the MTG8 protein in neural cells. Immunohistochemical experiments in a 12.5-day-old mouse embryo clearly showed that the protein was expressed in the neural cells of the developing brain and the spinal cord. In primary cultures of hippocampal neurons of 2-3 day-old mice, MTG8 was found in the nucleus, in the cytoplasm and as fine granules in the neurites. Cytoplasmic localization of the protein was observed in Purkinje cells of both human and mouse cerebellum. The molecular mass of MTG8 in total human and mouse brain was analysed by immunoblotting and determined to be between 70 and 90 kDa. Isoforms with the same molecular mass were demonstrated in synaptosomes isolated from mouse forebrain. The evidence of MTG8 in the nucleus and cytoplasm of neural cells suggests a specific mechanism regulating the subcellular localization of the protein.","['Sacchi, N', 'Tamanini, F', 'Willemsen, R', 'Denis-Donini, S', 'Campiglio, S', 'Hoogeveen, A T']","['Sacchi N', 'Tamanini F', 'Willemsen R', 'Denis-Donini S', 'Campiglio S', 'Hoogeveen AT']","['Department of Biology and Genetics, School of Medicine, University of Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,,"['Animals', 'Brain/embryology/metabolism', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Mice', 'Neurons/*metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Purkinje Cells/metabolism', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Synaptosomes/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism']",1998/06/19 00:00,1998/06/19 00:01,['1998/06/19 00:00'],"['1998/06/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/19 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/19 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1201824 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1998 May;16(20):2609-15. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1201824.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It enhances expression of differentiation antigens and stimulates chemotactic, phagocytic and the killing activities of monocytes. Macrophage CSF also stimulates production of several cytokines such as granulocyte-macrophage CSF, granulocyte CSF and interleukin (IL)-6 by priming monocytes, and directly stimulates production and secretion of IL-8 and reactive nitrogen intermediates. In addition to the stimulation of hematopoiesis, M-CSF also stimulates differentiation and proliferation of osteoclast progenitor cells and cytotrophoblasts.

Thus, olfactory progenitors are subject to a form of feedback control in vivo that regulates the types of cells that they produce within a broader-than-neuronal repertoire.","['Goldstein, B J', 'Fang, H', 'Youngentob, S L', 'Schwob, J E']","['Goldstein BJ', 'Fang H', 'Youngentob SL', 'Schwob JE']","['Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, SUNY Health Science Center, Syracuse 13210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Neuroreport,Neuroreport,9100935,IM,,"['Alkaline Phosphatase/biosynthesis', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Neurons/*cytology/physiology', 'Olfactory Bulb/*physiology', 'Olfactory Mucosa/*cytology/physiology/*transplantation', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Stem Cells', 'Transfection', 'Transplantation, Heterotopic', 'beta-Galactosidase/biosynthesis']",1998/06/19 00:00,1998/06/19 00:01,['1998/06/19 00:00'],"['1998/06/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/19 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/19 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00001756-199805110-00065 [doi]'],ppublish,Neuroreport. 1998 May 11;9(7):1611-7. doi: 10.1097/00001756-199805110-00065.,"['0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)']",,,"['K04 DC00080/DC/NIDCD NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 DC00220/DC/NIDCD NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DC02167/DC/NIDCD NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Addition of LIF onto NGF-containing cultures did not produce a significant increase, while addition of LIF to NGF-deprived cultures caused an upregulation of galanin mRNA which was significantly stronger than that of NGF withdrawal alone.

The exfoliation of small membranous vesicles from the cell surface is a continuous and normal activity in many cells. If microdomains are relatively large or stable, they may influence the structure and composition of exfoliated vesicles, which are easy to isolate. We tested the ability of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), a fatty acid proposed to alter the structure of microdomains, to change the structure and composition of vesicles exfoliated from a murine leukemia cell line. Cells were cultured in normal and DHA-enriched media for 72 h, then washed and given a 15-h exfoliation period. Afterwards, the pooled vesicles and their parent plasma membrane were collected and analyzed. Vesicles and plasma membrane from cells grown in normal culture medium had similar fatty acid compositions, including equal, and low, proportions of DHA, but the vesicles had much more cholesterol and displayed higher anisotropy than the plasma membrane. When cells were grown in DHA-enriched medium, both the plasma membrane and exfoliated vesicles had 10-fold elevated levels of DHA in their phospholipids, with the DHA displacing other polyunsaturates. These cells released vesicles having significantly reduced levels of cholesterol and monoenoic fatty acids than those in normal culture. The anisotropy of these vesicles was also dramatically reduced. These data are consistent with DHA altering the structure and composition of membrane microdomains on the cell surface, and suggest that exfoliated vesicles may prove useful in the further study of membrane microdomains.","['Williams, E E', 'Jenski, L J', 'Stillwell, W']","['Williams EE', 'Jenski LJ', 'Stillwell W']","['Department of Biology, Indiana University/Purdue University at Indianapolis, 723 West Michigan Street, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA. ewilliam@iupui.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Membrane/chemistry/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Docosahexaenoic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Lipids/*chemistry', 'Mice', 'Organelles/chemistry/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/06/19 00:00,1998/06/19 00:01,['1998/06/19 00:00'],"['1998/06/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/19 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/19 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0005-2736(98)00039-X [pii]', '10.1016/s0005-2736(98)00039-x [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1998 May 28;1371(2):351-62. doi: 10.1016/s0005-2736(98)00039-x.,"['0 (Membrane Lipids)', '25167-62-8 (Docosahexaenoic Acids)']",,,['R01-CA57212/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Copyright 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Structural analysis of Pgp was investigated by circular dichroism (CD) for the first time and in combination with amino acid sequence analysis. CD of highly purified Pgp from human, rat and murine Pgp-overexpressing drug resistant cells revealed slight variations in the spectral shape when recorded in the presence of dodecyl maltoside (DM). These species-dependent variations in CD shapes resulted from the interaction of the oligosaccharidic part with the protein core since they were abolished either in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) or after deglycosylation, the latter not altering the Pgp ATP-dependent drug transport activity. Whatever the level of Pgp glycosylation and the detergent used (SDS or DM), the content in secondary structure deduced from deconvolution of CD spectra is almost the same for the three sources of Pgp and estimated to 43% alpha-helix, 16% beta-sheet, 15% beta-turn and 26% of other structures. These data, which constitute the first report of Pgp structure analysis by circular dichroism, are consistent with the 48% alpha-helix and 16% beta-sheets global contents predicted by using recently reported efficient secondary structure prediction methods. This consistency reinforces the reliability of the probable nature and localization of predicted Pgp secondary structure elements. This provides a good framework for precise 3D structure modeling of Pgp by homology with proteins of known 3D structure, as it is illustrated here for the A motifs of the ATP-binding domains of Pgp.","['Dong, M', 'Ladaviere, L', 'Penin, F', 'Deleage, G', 'Baggetto, L G']","['Dong M', 'Ladaviere L', 'Penin F', 'Deleage G', 'Baggetto LG']","['Institut de Biologie et Chimie des Proteines, UPR 412 CNRS, 7 Passage du Vercors F-69367, Lyon Cedex 07, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*chemistry', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular', 'Circular Dichroism', 'Glycosylation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Rats', '*Sequence Analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/06/19 00:00,1998/06/19 00:01,['1998/06/19 00:00'],"['1998/06/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/19 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/19 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0005-2736(98)00032-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0005-2736(98)00032-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1998 May 28;1371(2):317-34. doi: 10.1016/s0005-2736(98)00032-7.,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)']",,,,['Copyright 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Danthron was more potent than emodin. Furthermore, we had found that these compounds bound non-covalently to DNA and inhibited topoisomerase II activity. Interestingly, in these systems emodin was more potent than danthron. This inversion of the ranking prompted us to investigate the underlying mechanism. Since emodin shows a high serum-protein binding affinity, horse serum used as a media-supplement in the mouse lymphoma genotoxicity assays was analyzed for a potential selective scavenging of emodin. Non-covalent DNA-binding in mouse lymphoma L5178Y cells was investigated in the absence or presence of serum. In the presence of 10% serum, the DNA-binding potency of emodin was markedly reduced and was lower than that of danthron. We also applied mutation assays with mouse lymphoma cells and AS52 cells and varied the serum concentration used.

For chrysophanol and physcion, a considerable reduction of the non-covalent DNA-binding potency in intact cells was found when compared to danthron, in concordance with their lower genotoxic potency.

These mice develop immunologic and cognitive deficits analogous to human HIV-1 infection. Met-enkephalin and substance-P levels declined approximately 50% in the striatum and hypothalamus beginning as early as 4 weeks after infection. Hippocampal met-enkephalin levels were reduced to 50% only at 12 weeks after inoculation. Significant decreases (60-70%) in acetylcholine concentrations were observed in the striatum, cerebral cortex and hippocampus by 12 weeks after virus inoculation, while striatal GABA concentrations decreased to 50-60% at 8-12 weeks after infection. Striatal somatostatin levels were unchanged. Administration of the NMDA receptor antagonists MK-801 or LY 274614 ameliorated the decline in striatal met-enkephalin levels observed in mice after 8 weeks of infection. This pattern of neurotransmitter depletion and the ability of NMDA receptor antagonists to attenuate the loss of striatal met-enkephalin are consistent with an excitotoxic lesion. Thus, the elevation of glutamate levels secondary to glial activation may contribute to the contemporaneous development of cognitive deficits observed in mice infected with the LP-BM5 virus.","['Kustova, Y', 'Ha, J H', 'Espey, M G', 'Sei, Y', 'Morse, D', 'Basile, A S']","['Kustova Y', 'Ha JH', 'Espey MG', 'Sei Y', 'Morse D', 'Basile AS']","['Laboratory of Bio-Organic Chemistry, NIDDK, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Brain Res,Brain research,0045503,IM,,"['Animals', 'Brain/*metabolism/pathology/physiopathology', '*Brain Chemistry', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Glutamic Acid/*physiology', 'Immunohistochemistry', '*Leukemia Virus, Murine', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neurotransmitter Agents/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae Infections/*metabolism/pathology/physiopathology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*metabolism/pathology/physiopathology']",1998/06/19 00:00,1998/06/19 00:01,['1998/06/19 00:00'],"['1998/06/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/19 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/19 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-8993(98)00167-X [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-8993(98)00167-x [doi]']",ppublish,Brain Res. 1998 May 18;793(1-2):119-26. doi: 10.1016/s0006-8993(98)00167-x.,"['0 (Neurotransmitter Agents)', '3KX376GY7L (Glutamic Acid)']",,,,['Copyright 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.'],,,,,,,,,,

Our goal was to determine the toxicity and pharmacokinetics of DT388-GM-CSF in C57BL/6 mice. Because human GM-CSF does not cross-react with the mouse GM-CSF receptor, the toxicity observed should be nonspecific toxicity of DT388.

Presently the majority of regimen for GVHD prophylaxis are centred on CsA and a short course of MTX with addition of some other immunosuppression (eg ATG or ALG) in patients with high risk for severe GVHD. The proposal defined different category of patients: patients with malignant disease who are either transplanted from HLA matched sibling donors or HLA mismatched family donors (or volunteer unrelated donors) and patients with non malignant disease who might not benefit from graft-versus-leukaemia effect having either an HLA matched sibling donor or an HLA mismatched family donor (or volunteer unrelated donor). Homogeneous GVHD prophylaxis for defined patient groups should provide better information to optimise strategies in reducing treatment related toxicity and incidence of relapse by increasing GVL effect.","['Peters, C', 'Minkov, M', 'Gadner, H', 'Klingebiel, T', 'Niethammer, D']","['Peters C', 'Minkov M', 'Gadner H', 'Klingebiel T', 'Niethammer D']","[""St Anna Children's Hospital, Vienna, Austria.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclosporine/therapeutic use', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant']",1998/06/18 00:00,1998/06/18 00:01,['1998/06/18 00:00'],"['1998/06/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/18 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/18 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1998 Apr;21 Suppl 2:S57-60.,['83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients given Cs-A at a dosage of 1 mg/kg/die had a higher probability of developing acute GVHD, but a lower relapse rate, which translated into a better probability of EFS. These preliminary results to be confirmed with a longer follow-up suggest that the use of low doses of CsA is feasible even though associated with a higher incidence of GVHD, but without any increment in TRM. The reduction of immunosuppressive treatment after BMT favoured the development of a graft-versus-leukemia effect, which seems to play a relevant role in preventing leukemia recurrence and in improving the cure rate.","['Pession, A', 'Locatelli, F', 'Zecca, M', 'Rondelli, R', 'Prete, A', 'Bonetti, F', 'Paolucci, G']","['Pession A', 'Locatelli F', 'Zecca M', 'Rondelli R', 'Prete A', 'Bonetti F', 'Paolucci G']","['Clinica Pediatrica Universita di Bologna, Policlinico S.

In AML in first remission, allogeneic PCT from an HLA-identical sibling is the treatment of choice in most cases, DFS of 60-80% has been attained in paediatric series. Indications appear clear except in M3 subtype, M7 in children with Down syndrome and possibly in patients with M2 and t(8;21) and MS-Eo and inv(16) who have a good early response to induction treatment. In some paediatric series, results with autologous transplants (APCT) are similar to those obtained with allo-PCT and superior to those obtained with chemotherapy alone, but this point is controversial. Allo-PCT and APCT are indicated in children in second remission, yielding 40% DFS. In children with ALL in first remission, indications for PCT are limited to only 8-10% of patients with very-high risk of relapse, mainly those with certain chromosome abnormalities or with poor or late response to induction treatment; a favourable outcome has been registered in 60%. Allo-PCT is the best choice for patients in second remission after an early marrow relapse and who have an adequate related or unrelated donor; DFS of 40-50% has been described in several paediatric series. Indications of allo-PCT from related donors after late bone marrow relapses or early extramedullary relapses appears more controversial but there are data in its favour. The role of APCT appears even more controversial but some authors favour its use in these situations. In more advanced stages of the disease the results obtained with allo-PCT are poorer (DFS between 10 and 20%). In summary, although many controversial points with regards to indications and modalities of transplants in acute leukaemia in children remain, it must be emphasized that with advances in both fields, chemotherapy and transplants, today 80% of children with ALL and 60-70% of those with AML are cured and enjoy good-quality of life.","['Ortega, J J', 'Olive, T']","['Ortega JJ', 'Olive T']","[""Department of Haematology/Oncology, Hospital Materno-Infantil Vall d'Hebron, Universidad Autonoma, Barcelona, Spain. jortega.hmi@ccs.vhebron.es""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,,"['Child', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy']",1998/06/18 00:00,1998/06/18 00:01,['1998/06/18 00:00'],"['1998/06/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/18 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/18 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1998 Apr;21 Suppl 2:S11-6.,,,20,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report seven patients with angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) who initially had hyperplastic GCs, shown to be malignant lymphoma by further studies and clinical follow-up. Clonal T-cell populations were observed in all specimens evaluated, and sequential biopsies showed histologic progression to typical AITL in two patients. Clinical presentation was characterized by generalized lymphadenopathy of acute onset, constitutional symptoms, hepatosplenomegaly, skin rash, and polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia in five patients; regional adenopathy preceded generalized adenopathy in two patients. Five patients had rapid progression of disease, and three patients whose treatment was delayed due to inadequate evidence to diagnose lymphoma died of infection. The initial biopsy findings of each patient were similar and showed angioimmunoblastic proliferation, hyperplastic GCs with ill-defined borders, and interfollicular tingible-body macrophages. These GCs differed from occasional residual follicles of typical AITL in that the GCs were enlarged and hyperplasia of follicular dendritic cells was not seen.

METHODS: Incidence of childhood (0-14 years) acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) at the local government area (LGA) level is related to estimated exposure levels of RFR from television transmission antennas, using Poisson regression techniques. RESULTS: Most of the association between ALL incidence and television transmission RFR is shown to be the result of an influential observation: one of the highly exposed LGAs contributes all the excess, while in a similarly exposed LGA childhood ALL incidence was found to be no higher than the rate expected for NSW. With the influential observation excluded from the analysis, no positive correlation between exposure to RFR and leukaemia is evident. Conversely, under the assumption of an association with RFR, the low probability of the observed incident cases in LGAs under conditions of relatively high exposure to RFR conflicts with the assumption of an effect. CONCLUSION: The apparent association between childhood ALL incidence and RFR radiation from television towers is weaker when an LGA-level analysis is conducted.","['McKenzie, D R', 'Yin, Y', 'Morrell, S']","['McKenzie DR', 'Yin Y', 'Morrell S']","['School of Physics, University of Sydney, New South Wales.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Australia,Aust N Z J Public Health,Australian and New Zealand journal of public health,9611095,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Age Distribution', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'New South Wales/epidemiology', 'Poisson Distribution', 'Population Surveillance', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Radio Waves/*adverse effects', 'Regression Analysis', 'Residence Characteristics', 'Small-Area Analysis', '*Television', 'Urban Health']",1998/06/18 00:00,1998/06/18 00:01,['1998/06/18 00:00'],"['1998/06/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/18 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1467-842x.1998.tb01392.x [doi]'],ppublish,Aust N Z J Public Health. 1998;22(3 Suppl):360-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1467-842x.1998.tb01392.x.,,,,,,,"['Aust N Z J Public Health. 1999 Feb;23(1):104-5.

These cognitive deficits are evident before the appearance of neuron loss and lymphoid cell invasion of the brain. Nonetheless, a prominent gliosis and a variety of neurochemical changes precede the development of cognitive deficits. The neurochemical abnormalities include significant decreases in striatal Met-enkephalin and substance P (but not somatostatin), increases in concentrations of quinolinic acid and platelet-activating factor, and alterations in brain fyn kinase. At this stage of the infection, some of these neurochemical changes can be reversed by glutamate receptor antagonists, cytokine inhibitors, and anti-retroviral agents. In later stages of the infection, however, the infected mice develop irreversible neuronal loss, invasion of hematopoietic cells, and increased viral burden in the CNS. In addition, motor-neuron dysfunction (hindlimb paralysis, weakness, and ataxia) and seizures are sometimes observed during the late stages of infection. Thus, the LP-BM5 MuLV-infected mouse is a useful model for studying the chronology of neurodegenerative changes, ranging from reversible neuron dysfunction to irreversible neuron loss, that are associated with retrovirus-induced immunodeficiency.","['Sei, Y', 'Kustova, Y', 'Li, Y', 'Morse, H C 3rd', 'Skolnick, P', 'Basile, A S']","['Sei Y', 'Kustova Y', 'Li Y', 'Morse HC 3rd', 'Skolnick P', 'Basile AS']","['Department of Anesthesiology, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA. ysei@mx3.usuhs.mil']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,IM,,"['Animals', 'Brain/metabolism/pathology', 'Brain Diseases/*physiopathology/psychology/*virology', 'Maze Learning/physiology', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/complications/*physiopathology/psychology', 'Neurotoxins/metabolism']",1998/06/18 02:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1998/06/18 02:00'],"['1998/06/18 02:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1998/06/18 02:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1749-6632.1998.tb09620.x [doi]'],ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 1998 May 1;840:822-34. doi: 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1998.tb09620.x.,['0 (Neurotoxins)'],,35,,,,,,,,,,,,

LIF induces basal, and augments CRH-induced, POMC mRNA and ACTH secretion from AtT20 cells. Therefore, we examined LIF signaling and LIF regulation of POMC expression in AtT20 cells. Immunoneutralization studies demonstrated the dependence of LIF action on both the specific LIF receptor (35% inhibition; p < 0.05) and also the gpl30 affinity converter (41% inhibition; p < 0.05). These antisera also attenuate basal ACTH secretion without added LIF. LIF rapidly induced tyrosyl phosphorylation of both STAT 1 alpha, and STAT beta and also induced phosphorylation of a novel STAT 1 alpha related protein p115. LIF induced POMC transcription (-706/+64) and strikingly potentiated CRH action (up to 18-fold induction). This synergy involved cAMP-dependent pathways, as forskolin action was also potentiated by LIF. Deletion of the major CRH-responsive region in POMC (-323/-166) abolished both CRH and LIF action on POMC transcription. Thus LIF action in pituitary corticotrophs is dependent on LIF receptor heterodimerisation with gpl30 and involves STAT protein tyrosyl phosphorylation. LIF enhances POMC transcription and strongly potentiates the well-documented action of CRH on the POMC gene. These results define a subcellular mechanism for an immuno-neuroendocrine interface between peripheral afferent signals and the HPA axis.","['Ray, D W', 'Ren, S G', 'Melmed, S']","['Ray DW', 'Ren SG', 'Melmed S']","['Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Research Institute-UCLA School of Medicine 90048, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,IM,,"['Adrenocorticotropic Hormone/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology/*physiology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Lysosome-Associated Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/physiology', 'Mice', 'Phosphorylation', 'Pituitary Gland, Anterior/cytology/metabolism', 'Pro-Opiomelanocortin/drug effects/*genetics', 'Receptors, Cytokine/physiology', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects/*physiology']",1998/06/18 00:00,1998/06/18 00:01,['1998/06/18 00:00'],"['1998/06/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/18 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1749-6632.1998.tb09560.x [doi]'],ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 1998 May 1;840:162-73. doi: 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1998.tb09560.x.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LAMP1 protein, human)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Lamp1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Lysosome-Associated Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '66796-54-1 (Pro-Opiomelanocortin)', '9002-60-2 (Adrenocorticotropic Hormone)']",,,['DK 42792/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

The neurotrophins use a family of receptor tyrosine kinases known as the Trk receptors, whereas ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) uses a ""cytokine receptor"" system that shares receptor components with a number of distantly related cytokines. We have used a human embryonal carcinoma cell line and human leukemia cell lines to examine the actions of the neurotrophins and CNTF on cellular differentiation. Our findings demonstrate that specific combinations of neurotrophic factors are required to influence the neuronal progenitor cells to become postmitotic mature CNS neurons. Such synergistic interactions may play an important role in modulating the differentiation of a wide assortment of neuronal precursors in the developing nervous system. Furthermore, our studies with leukemia cells suggest that neurotrophic factors may play a similar role in hematopoietic differentiation and that these factors may have therapeutic application in leukemia differentiation.","['Ip, N Y']",['Ip NY'],"['Department of Biology, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay.

We have previously reported stimulation of p21cip1/waf1 by steel factor and GM-CSF in a factor dependent cell line and of p21cip1/waf1 involvement in hematopoiesis in vivo in p21cip1/waf1 gene knockout (-/-) mice. To further assess a role for increased p21cip1/waf1 in hematopoietic progenitor cells, we developed the retroviral vector L(p21cip1)SN to transcriptionally regulate p21cip1/waf1 from the Mo-MLV LTR. L(p21cip1)SN and the control vector LXSN were used to transduce murine bone marrow progenitor cells from p21cip1/waf1 (-/-) and littermate control (+/+) mice, as well as from other mouse strains. Hematopoietic colony formation by transduced cells was assessed in semi-solid culture medium with multiple growth factors. Myeloid colony formation by bone marrow cells from p21cip1/waf1 (-/-) mice was significantly lower than that by (+/+) mouse cells. Transduction of cells with LXSN had no effect on colony formation: however, (-/-) cells transduced with L(p21cip1)SN formed significantly greater numbers of colonies than either LXSN-transduced (-/-) or (+/-) cells. Moreover, L(p21cip1)SN-transduced (+/+) cells formed significantly more colonies than LXSN-transduced (+/+) cells. Increased cloning efficiency of progenitors from normal strains of mice induced by L(p21cip1)SN compared to LXSN-transduced cells was seen whether unseparated or highly purified populations of Sca1+ Lin- marrow cells were used. Gene transfer of L(p21cip1)SN increased the size and number of cells per colony, as well as the number of colonies compared to LXSN gene transfer. No colonies grew from non-transduced, LXSN-, or L(p21cip1)SN-transduced cells when no growth factors were added to the cultures. These results document the positive effect of p21cip1/waf1 in the proliferation and/or differentiation of the murine myeloid progenitor cells that lead to colony formation.","['Braun, S E', 'Mantel, C', 'Rosenthal, M', 'Cooper, S', 'Liu, L', 'Robertson, K A', 'Hromas, R', 'Broxmeyer, H E']","['Braun SE', 'Mantel C', 'Rosenthal M', 'Cooper S', 'Liu L', 'Robertson KA', 'Hromas R', 'Broxmeyer HE']","['Department of Microbiology/Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis 46202, USA. sbraun@iupui.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/pharmacology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/genetics/*physiology', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Spleen/cytology', 'Transfection']",1998/06/17 00:00,1998/06/17 00:01,['1998/06/17 00:00'],"['1998/06/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/17 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1079-9796(98)90181-4 [pii]', '10.1006/bcmd.1998.0181 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 1998 Jun;24(2):138-48. doi: 10.1006/bcmd.1998.0181.,"['0 (Cdkn1a protein, mouse)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",,,"['R01 DK53674/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL54037/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL56416/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

In some patients, the lymphoproliferative disorder can resemble an aggressive monoclonal non-Hodgkins lymphoma (NHL). These NHL are poorly responsive to conventional therapy. Similarly, antiviral therapy with synthetic nucleosides such as ganciclovir are ineffective because the genes that render the virus susceptible to therapy are not expressed in EBV+ lymphomas. Using a cell line derived from a lung transplant recipient with an EBV+ immunoblastic NHL, we studied the ability of arginine butyrate to induce the expression of EBV thymidine kinase. Arginine butyrate was not only effective in inducing EBV thymidine kinase transcription, but also acted synergistically with the antiviral agent ganciclovir to inhibit cell proliferation and decrease cell viability. Based on these findings, the patient from whom the cell line was derived was treated with arginine butyrate/ganciclovir as well as conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy. No additional toxicity was observed with the arginine butyrate/ganciclovir therapy. Histologic examination of the tumor showed substantial necrosis. These observations suggest the feasibility of arginine butyrate induction of ganciclovir susceptibility in patients with EBV-associated lymphomas.","['Mentzer, S J', 'Fingeroth, J', 'Reilly, J J', 'Perrine, S P', 'Faller, D V']","['Mentzer SJ', 'Fingeroth J', 'Reilly JJ', 'Perrine SP', 'Faller DV']","[""Department of Surgery and Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,IM,,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Antiviral Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arginine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Aspergillosis/complications', 'Butyrates/*pharmacology', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/*drug therapy', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Ganciclovir/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/*drug effects', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/drug effects/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology/virology', 'Lung Transplantation', 'Necrosis', 'Postoperative Complications/drug therapy/virology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology/virology', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Thymidine Kinase/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/virology', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage', 'Viral Nonstructural Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis']",1998/06/17 00:00,1998/06/17 00:01,['1998/06/17 00:00'],"['1998/06/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/17 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1079-9796(98)90178-4 [pii]', '10.1006/bcmd.1998.0178 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 1998 Jun;24(2):114-23. doi: 10.1006/bcmd.1998.0178.,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Viral Nonstructural Proteins)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'IK8S1P79MU (arginine butyrate)', 'P9G3CKZ4P5 (Ganciclovir)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'CHOP protocol']",,,"['FD-R-000831/FD/FDA HHS/United States', 'HL37118/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL47078/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

We have cloned sequences within RMD-2 and screened for novel genes using a combination of direct sequencing, cDNA library screening, and exon trapping. Sequences generated from a cosmid fragment, mapping within RMD-2, showed homology to the Drosophila tailless gene (tll). The human homologue of the Drosophila tailless gene (human tlx; MGMW-approved symbol, TLX) was subsequently cloned from a fetal brain cDNA library. The gene is a member of the steroid nuclear receptor superfamily and is homologous to tll genes from other species that are involved in brain development. TLX is predominately expressed in the brain and maps to RMD-2 at 6q21 between DNA markers FYN and D6S447, in a YAC clone that also contains marker D6S246.

RESULTS: The twins studied had cytogenetically identical neoplastic clones with identical clonal evolution. Retrospective fluorescence in situ hybridization studies demonstrated the presence of the abnormal clone in the asymptomatic twin at the time of bone marrow transplant of the first twin. CONCLUSIONS: These observations support in utero twin-twin transfer as the origin of leukemic clones in pediatric and infant leukemia, demonstrate that clonal evolution of a leukemic clone may occur years before onset of overt disease, and indicate that knowledge of acquired genetic change(s) in one twin may provide markers to assess disease in the asymptomatic twin.","['Richkind, K E', 'Loew, T', 'Meisner, L', 'Harris, C', 'Wason, D']","['Richkind KE', 'Loew T', 'Meisner L', 'Harris C', 'Wason D']","['Genzyme Genetics, Santa Fe, New Mexico 87505, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,IM,,"['Child, Preschool', 'Clone Cells', '*Diseases in Twins', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Fetal Diseases/*etiology', 'Fetofetal Transfusion/*complications', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*etiology', 'Male', 'Pregnancy', 'Twins, Monozygotic']",1998/06/17 00:00,1998/06/17 00:01,['1998/06/17 00:00'],"['1998/06/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00043426-199805000-00015 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1998 May-Jun;20(3):264-7. doi: 10.1097/00043426-199805000-00015.,,,13,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ivermectin is the treatment of choice.","['Daubenton, J D', 'Buys, H A', 'Hartley, P S']","['Daubenton JD', 'Buys HA', 'Hartley PS']","[""Department of Paediatrics and Child Health, University of Cape Town, Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital, South Africa.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,IM,,"['Child', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/complications/*parasitology', 'Male', 'Strongyloidiasis/complications/*diagnosis']",1998/06/17 00:00,1998/06/17 00:01,['1998/06/17 00:00'],"['1998/06/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00043426-199805000-00014 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1998 May-Jun;20(3):260-3. doi: 10.1097/00043426-199805000-00014.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, bone mineral density (BMD) in young adult survivors of childhood cancer is assessed to determine what cancer-related factors, patient characteristics, or treatment-related complications correlate with reductions in BMD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study population consisted of 40 (24 women) long-term survivors of childhood cancer treated at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center for a solid tumor (n = 16), lymphoma (n = 14), or acute leukemia (n = 10) at a mean age of 12.7 +/- 0.96 years and evaluated at a mean age of 25.8 +/- 0.7 years. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry was used to determine BMD of the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and total body and single photon absorptiometry was used to determine BMD of the distal radius. RESULTS: The mean BMD standard deviation score (SDS) for the patients was significantly reduced compared to controls at the distal radius (-1.57 +/- 0.18, p = 0.0001), femoral neck (-0.68 +/- 0.20, p = 0.00014), and total body (-0.33 +/- 0.15, p = 0.03) but not at the lumbar spine (-0.22 +/- 0.22, p = 0.33). Univariate analysis revealed that gonadal dysfunction (i.e., estrogen or testosterone insufficiency) (p = 0.018) was the only variable that correlated with a reduced BMD. CONCLUSION: Young adult survivors of childhood cancer have reduced BMD. Because age at study coincides with the normal age of attainment of peak bone mass and peak bone mass is a major determinant of BMD later in life, many of these patients are at increased risk for osteoporosis and fractures.","['Aisenberg, J', 'Hsieh, K', 'Kalaitzoglou, G', 'Whittam, E', 'Heller, G', 'Schneider, R', 'Sklar, C']","['Aisenberg J', 'Hsieh K', 'Kalaitzoglou G', 'Whittam E', 'Heller G', 'Schneider R', 'Sklar C']","['Department of Pediatrics, New York Hospital-Cornell University Medical College, New York, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,IM,,"['Absorptiometry, Photon', 'Adult', '*Bone Density', 'Child', 'Female', 'Femur/diagnostic imaging', 'Gonadal Disorders/complications', 'Humans', 'Lumbar Vertebrae/diagnostic imaging', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/complications/diagnostic imaging/*physiopathology', 'Radius/diagnostic imaging', 'Survivors']",1998/06/17 00:00,1998/06/17 00:01,['1998/06/17 00:00'],"['1998/06/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00043426-199805000-00010 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1998 May-Jun;20(3):241-5. doi: 10.1097/00043426-199805000-00010.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was performed to determine the degree of possible osteopenia in long-term survivors of childhood ALL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Lumbar spine (L2-L4) and femoral neck bone mineral densities (BMDs) (g/cm2) were measured in 29 survivors (aged 12 to 30 years, median 17) of childhood ALL 2 to 20 (median 8) years after discontinuation of chemotherapy. These results were compared with those from 273 healthy controls and expressed as a percentage of the age- and sex-matched control values (mean +/- standard deviation). RESULTS: Lumbar and femoral BMDs were significantly reduced in survivors of childhood ALL. Particularly, male gender (lumbar: 91.7 +/- 10.4%, p = 0.008; femoral: 91.9 +/- 11.3%, p = 0.005) and a history of cranial irradiation (lumbar: 93.0 +/- 8.9%, p = 0.005; femoral: 94.4 +/- 13.3%, p = 0.03) were associated with low lumbar and femoral BMDs. CONCLUSIONS: The detected deficit in bone density in survivors of childhood ALL may predispose these patients to osteoporotic fractures later in adulthood. A follow-up of BMD in survivors of childhood ALL should facilitate the identification of patients who would require specific therapeutic interventions to prevent further decrease of their skeletal mass and preserve their BMD.","['Arikoski, P', 'Komulainen, J', 'Voutilainen, R', 'Riikonen, P', 'Parviainen, M', 'Tapanainen, P', 'Knip, M', 'Kroger, H']","['Arikoski P', 'Komulainen J', 'Voutilainen R', 'Riikonen P', 'Parviainen M', 'Tapanainen P', 'Knip M', 'Kroger H']","['Department of Pediatrics, Kuopio University Hospital, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,IM,,"['Absorptiometry, Photon', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Density', 'Bone Diseases, Metabolic/complications/*diagnosis', 'Child', 'Collagen/blood', 'Collagen Type I', 'Cranial Irradiation/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/analysis', 'Male', 'Osteocalcin/blood', 'Peptide Fragments/blood', 'Peptides/blood', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*physiopathology', 'Procollagen/blood', 'Sex Factors', 'Survivors']",1998/06/17 00:00,1998/06/17 00:01,['1998/06/17 00:00'],"['1998/06/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00043426-199805000-00009 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1998 May-Jun;20(3):234-40. doi: 10.1097/00043426-199805000-00009.,"['0 (Collagen Type I)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Procollagen)', '0 (collagen type I trimeric cross-linked peptide)', '0 (procollagen type I carboxy terminal peptide)', '104982-03-8 (Osteocalcin)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To prevent relapse, infants' tolerance of and benefits from early intensive rotating drug pairs as part of therapy were studied. METHODS: After prednisone, vincristine, asparaginase, and daunorubicin induction, 12 intensive treatments (ABACABACABAC) were administered in 30 weeks: A, intermediate dose methotrexate (MTX) and intermediate dose mercaptopurine (MP); B, cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) and daunorubicin (DNR); C, Ara-C and teniposide (VM-26). Triple intrathecal chemotherapy (Ara-C, MTX, and hydrocortisone) was administered for central nervous system prophylaxis. Continuation therapy consisted of weekly MTX and daily MP for a total of 130 weeks of continuous complete remission. RESULTS: Thirty-three infants (1 year old or younger) with newly diagnosed ALL were treated. Two infants did not respond to induction, 1 died from sepsis during continuation, 1 received a bone marrow transplant, and 24 relapsed. Median time to relapse was 39 weeks. The event-free survival rate at 5 years was 17% (standard error +/- 7.7%). The most significant toxicities occurred during intensification and included fever-neutropenia and bacterial sepsis.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventeen children with acute leukemia in complete remission, 12 with solid tumors, and 17 with benign blood diseases were included in this study. Bone marrow cells were analyzed by multicolor flow-cytometry and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect immunoglobulin gene rearrangement. The CD10-positive cells were purely sorted and examined by light microscopy and single cell hemopoietic progenitor assay. RESULTS: In patients with acute leukemia, CD10-positive cells were present in higher proportion after completion of therapy than during chemotherapy. They were also higher in the patients of preschool age than in the older age group with benign blood diseases and solid tumors. These CD10-positive cells were morphologically compatible with immature lymphocytes but some blast-like cells also occurred in this population. Most CD10-positive cells coexpressed CD19 and HLA-DR, although only 10 to 30% coexpressed CD20 and CD34. Although some CD10-positive cells expressed CD34, they did not make any colonies. PCR analysis did not show monoclonal bands in CD10-positive bone marrow cells in any patients in remission. CONCLUSION: Marrow CD10-positive cells possess immature B-lymphocyte phenotype and are present in higher proportion in the marrows of children with acute leukemia in continuous complete remission after completion of therapy and children of preschool age than school-age children with benign diseases or solid tumors without marrow involvement. The clonality of these cells was excluded by PCR, which is a distinct point from CD10-positive ALL blasts.","['Fukushima, T', 'Sumazaki, R', 'Koike, K', 'Tsuchida, M', 'Matsui, A', 'Nakauchi, H']","['Fukushima T', 'Sumazaki R', 'Koike K', 'Tsuchida M', 'Matsui A', 'Nakauchi H']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Ibaraki Children's Hospital, Mito, Japan.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,IM,,"['Bone Marrow Cells/*immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clone Cells', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematologic Diseases/*immunology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/pathology', 'Neprilysin/*analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/pathology']",1998/06/17 00:00,1998/06/17 00:01,['1998/06/17 00:00'],"['1998/06/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00043426-199805000-00007 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1998 May-Jun;20(3):222-8. doi: 10.1097/00043426-199805000-00007.,['EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Leukemic samples from 144 children with newly diagnosed ALL (104 with CD10-positive B-precursor ALL, 11 with CD10-negative B-precursor ALL, 5 with B-ALL, and 24 with T-ALL) were analyzed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The frequency of patients with TEL/AML1 was 16% (23 of 144) and all patients with TEL/AML1 also had CD10-positive B-precursor ALL. TEL/AML1 was not found in any samples from the patients with T-ALL, B-ALL, or CD10-negative B-precursor ALL. Among patients with CD10-positive B-precursor ALL, age, initial white blood cell count, and immunophenotype did not differ with TEL/AML1 positivity, although the patients were predominantly male (p < 0.01). Clinical outcomes of 94 patients treated with recent protocols were analyzed. Five of the 21 (23.8%) patients with TEL/AML1 relapsed and 4 of these relapsed > 24 months after diagnosis. Although the overall 5-year survival rate was better among patients with TEL/AML1 fusion transcript than among those without it (87.3 +/- 8.7% versus 75.9 +/- 5.8%, respectively), the 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rates of patients with TEL/AML1 fusion transcript and those without it were similar (64.0 +/- 13.5% versus 69.1 +/- 6.3%, respectively). However, for 57 patients treated with the latest intensive protocol, the 4-year DFS rate was much higher for the patients with TEL/AML1 fusion transcript than for those without it (100.0% v.s. 69.6 +/- 8.4%, respectively, p = 0.1472). CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed that TEL/AML1 gene fusion is the most common genetic event in pediatric ALL in Japan and is restricted to CD10-positive B-precursor ALL. Moreover, it was associated with an improved survival rate among patients treated with intensive therapy. Therefore, these data suggest that the patients with TEL/AML1 may not necessarily be candidates for less aggressive treatment.","['Takahashi, Y', 'Horibe, K', 'Kiyoi, H', 'Miyashita, Y', 'Fukuda, M', 'Mori, H', 'Nozaki, C', 'Hasegawa, S', 'Kawabe, T', 'Kato, K', 'Kojima, S', 'Matuyama, T', 'Naoe, T']","['Takahashi Y', 'Horibe K', 'Kiyoi H', 'Miyashita Y', 'Fukuda M', 'Mori H', 'Nozaki C', 'Hasegawa S', 'Kawabe T', 'Kato K', 'Kojima S', 'Matuyama T', 'Naoe T']","['Department of Pediatrics, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Japan', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Neprilysin/metabolism', '*Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/epidemiology/immunology', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1998/06/17 00:00,1998/06/17 00:01,['1998/06/17 00:00'],"['1998/06/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00043426-199805000-00002 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1998 May-Jun;20(3):190-5. doi: 10.1097/00043426-199805000-00002.,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, the involvement of proapoptotic (bax) and antiapoptotic (bcl-2) genes in the molecular mechanism of TGF-beta1-induced apoptosis of L1210 leukemic cells was investigated. Bax transcript was measured using the RT-PCR method with GAPDH as a ""housekeeping gene"" control, whereas Bcl-2 protein was determined using flow cytometry (FITC-conjugated monoclonal anti-Bcl-2 antibody and FITC-conjugated mouse anti-IgG1 antibody as a negative control). Apoptosis was evaluated using fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry after cell staining with DAPI and sulforhodamine or propidium iodide and Hoechst 33342. ROS generation was assessed by flow cytometry using the oxidation-sensitive fluorescent marker C-DCDHF-DA. The response of L1210 leukemic cells to TGF-beta1 was two-directional: 1) partial arrest of the cell cycle at G1-S transition, and 2) induction of apoptotic cell death. TGF-beta1 increased the number of leukemic cells with typical morphological features of apoptosis: cell shrinkage, condensation of chromatin, pyknosis and fragmentation of nuclei, followed by secondary necrosis. DNA cleavage led to a decrease of the nuclear DNA content and the appearance of a hypodiploid peak sub-G1 in the DNA histogram. The extraction of low-molecular weight DNA fragments from apoptotic cells showed that TGF-beta1-induced apoptosis concerned first of all the cells from G1 phase. Two phases of intracellular ROS generation in TGF-beta1-treated cultures were observed: the first (rapid, 60 min after TGF-beta1 administration), and the second (slow, occurring between 24 and 48h of experiment, respectively). The increase of apoptotic cell number in TGF-beta1-treated cultures (2% FCS/RPMI 1640) was associated with the decrease of cell number expressing bcl-2, and with a significant drop of Bcl-2 level in the remaining cells after 24 h. The dose-dependent relationship between TGF-beta1 concentration and Bcl-2 level was nonlinear and described by power series regression. The lowest Bcl-2 level was noted at 1 ng/ml of TGF-beta1 concentration. The increase of Bax mRNA:GAPDH mRNA ratio was observed 3h after TGF-beta1 (1 ng/ml) administration to both the maintenance (2% FCS/RPMI) and growth promoting (10% FCS/RPMI) medium. Regardless of TGF-beta1 treatment, the quantity of Bax transcript was dependent on FCS concentration, being higher in the growth promoting medium. The results of this study indicate that bax may function as a primary response gene and together with lowered Bcl-2 level may determine the induction of apoptotic process in L1210 leukemic cells exposed to TGF-beta1.","['Motyl, T', 'Grzelkowska, K', 'Zimowska, W', 'Skierski, J', 'Wareski, P', 'Ploszaj, T', 'Trzeciak, L']","['Motyl T', 'Grzelkowska K', 'Zimowska W', 'Skierski J', 'Wareski P', 'Ploszaj T', 'Trzeciak L']","['Department of Animal Physiology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Warsaw Agricultural University, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Cell Biol,European journal of cell biology,7906240,IM,,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Leukemia L1210/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*pharmacology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",1998/06/17 00:00,1998/06/17 00:01,['1998/06/17 00:00'],"['1998/06/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/17 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0171-9335(98)80070-8 [pii]', '10.1016/s0171-9335(98)80070-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cell Biol. 1998 Apr;75(4):367-74. doi: 10.1016/s0171-9335(98)80070-8.,"['0 (Bax protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the in vivo study, YPE-01 (0.1-3 mg/ear) was applied to the ear of mice at the same time as a 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) application or 1 h before an AA application. METHODS: In the in vitro study, the amounts of 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid and leukotrienes were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography and an enzyme immunoassay, respectively. In the in vivo study, a circular tissue sample from the ear of the mice was weighed. Statistical analysis was done using Dunnett's test. RESULTS: YPE-01 inhibited the 5-lipoxygenase activity (IC50, 0.28 microM) and the leukotriene B4 (IC50, 0.035 microM) and C4 (IC50, 0.046 microM) production by RBL-1 cells without any inhibition of cyclooxygenase activity in vitro. The topical application of YPE-01 significantly suppressed both the AA- and TPA-induced ear edemas in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: YPE-01 is a selective 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor with a suppressive effect against dermal inflammation.","['Yamazaki, R', 'Aiyama, R', 'Matsuzaki, T', 'Hashimoto, S', 'Yokokura, T']","['Yamazaki R', 'Aiyama R', 'Matsuzaki T', 'Hashimoto S', 'Yokokura T']","['Yakult Central Institute for Microbiological Research, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Inflamm Res,Inflammation research : official journal of the European Histamine Research Society ...

Final height and weight was studied in 50 long-term survivors (LTS) of childhood cancer (aged 17-31 years; 30 men, 20 women) 3-18 years after treatment for malignant diseases (7 acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 20 lymphoma, 8 sarcoma, 15 malignant central nervous system [CNS] tumours). None of the LTS had been treated with growth hormone (GH). A decrease in final height SDS (Standard deviation score) occurred in both LTS of malignant CNS tumours (median height SDS at diagnosis, 0.3; range, -0.9 to 2.2; median final height SDS, -1.3; range, -3.9 to 1.9; p < 0.01) and LTS of lymphoma (p < 0.05) or leukemia (p < 0.05). However, only LTS who received cranial (p < 0.05) or craniospinal (p < 0.001) irradiation (XRT) exhibited reduced final heights. LTS who had received XRT not involving the CNS or had received no XRT at all presented no reduction in final height. LTS of CNS tumours treated with high craniospinal XRT doses (24 to 56 Gy) reached lower (p < 0.01) final heights when compared with LTS of leukemia who received lower cranial XRT doses (18 to 24 Gy). Final height SDS correlated with chronological age at initiation of therapy (p < 0.05). No correlation was found between the cumulative doses of applied chemotherapeutic agents and the final height of LTS. During follow-up LTS developed an increase in weight for height index (WFH) which occurred independent of XRT. In conclusion, cranial and craniospinal XRT especially in young children with malignancies resulted in a decrease in final height SDS. As 6 of 15 LTS of malignant CNS tumours exhibited a final height SDS below -2 SD, analysis of pituitary function and substitution of GH after diagnosis of GH deficiency should be considered for these patients at a young age. Others factors not directly related to XRT are responsible for the increased risk for obesity in LTS of childhood cancer.","['Muller, H L', 'Klinkhammer-Schalke, M', 'Kuhl, J']","['Muller HL', 'Klinkhammer-Schalke M', 'Kuhl J']","['Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital, Wurzburg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Exp Clin Endocrinol Diabetes,"Experimental and clinical endocrinology & diabetes : official journal, German Society of Endocrinology [and] German Diabetes Association",9505926,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Age of Onset', 'Body Height/*physiology/radiation effects', 'Body Mass Index', 'Body Weight/*physiology/radiation effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cranial Irradiation', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Growth/physiology/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/*physiopathology/radiotherapy', 'Puberty/physiology/radiation effects', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Sex Factors', '*Survivors']",1998/06/17 00:00,1998/06/17 00:01,['1998/06/17 00:00'],"['1998/06/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-0029-1211965 [doi]'],ppublish,Exp Clin Endocrinol Diabetes. 1998;106(2):135-9. doi: 10.1055/s-0029-1211965.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we examined the possible mechanism of Tie gene up-regulation by LIF and SLF in CD34+ cells using semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis. In the presence of Actinomycin D (Act D) alone for 24 hrs, Tie transcripts in CD34+ cells decreased. Tie mRNA was increased by an average of 2-4 fold and remained elevated level for 24 hours in CD34+ cells prestimulated with LIF or SLF followed by Act D, compared to that in CD34+ cells treated with Act D without prestimulation. After treatment of CD34+ cells with cycloheximide, Tie mRNA levels were decreased in the presence or absence of LIF or SLF at 24 hours. These findings suggest that LIF and SLF regulate Tie gene expression in UCB CD34+ cells at least in part through an increase in Tie message stability.","['Ge, Y', 'Broxmeyer, H E', 'Lu, L']","['Ge Y', 'Broxmeyer HE', 'Lu L']","['Department of Microbiology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis 46202-5121, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Greece,In Vivo,"In vivo (Athens, Greece)",8806809,IM,,"['Antigens, CD34/*analysis', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Stability/drug effects/genetics', 'Fetal Blood/cytology/*enzymology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Growth Inhibitors/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*physiology', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/drug effects/metabolism', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/drug effects/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/drug effects/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, TIE', 'Stem Cell Factor/*physiology', 'Umbilical Cord']",1998/06/17 00:00,1998/06/17 00:01,['1998/06/17 00:00'],"['1998/06/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/17 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,In Vivo. 1998 Mar-Apr;12(2):149-53.,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, TIE)']",,,"['R01 DK 53674/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL54037/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL56416/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Biochemical and somatic cell genetics study. INTERVENTIONS: Aspects of cobalamin metabolism were measured in a panel of 14 human tumour cell lines that were unable to proliferate normally in medium in which methionine had been replaced by its metabolic precursor homocysteine (methionine-dependent cell lines). RESULTS: The human melanoma cell line MeWoLC1 was unique among these cell lines, in that it was characterized by decreased uptake of cobalamin, decreased synthesis of coenzyme derivatives, and decreased functional activity of the cobalamin-dependent enzymes methionine synthase and methylmalonylCoA mutase. This phenotype was identical to that observed in fibroblasts from patients with the cblC and cblD inborn errors of cobalamin metabolism. The defect in cobalamin metabolism in MeWoLC1 was complemented in somatic cell complementation analysis by cblA, cblB, cblD, cblE and cblG fibroblasts, but not by cblC fibroblasts, strongly suggesting that the defect in this cell line affects the cblC locus. Similar changes in cellular cobalamin metabolism were not seen in any other methionine-dependent cell line in the panel, suggesting that there may be multiple causes of methionine dependence, and that inactivation of the cblC locus may not be a common cause of this phenotype in transformed cells. CONCLUSIONS: The defect underlying methionine dependence in MeWoLC1 appears to involve the locus that is affected in patients with the cblC inborn error of metabolism. This defect does not seem to be common among other methionine-dependent cell lines.","['Watkins, D']",['Watkins D'],"['Department of Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, Que.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Canada,Clin Invest Med,Clinical and investigative medicine.

Long-term topical use of 1,25D, however, causes hypercalcemia. The precursor of 1,25D, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25D) is converted to 1,25D in the keratinocyte in a regulated manner. The action of 1,25D is reported to be mediated, at least in part, by cellular ceramides in the leukemia cell line, HL-60 cells. Therefore, in this study we evaluated the synergy between 25D and short chain cell permeable ceramides (SCC) or synthetic analogs of ceramides on keratinocyte growth and differentiation in vitro. C2 ceramide (acetyl sphingosine) synergistically enhanced the growth inhibitory effect of 25D and 1,25D in a concentration-dependent manner. Short chain analogs of ceramide-like compounds, neoceramides and pseudoceramides, also inhibited keratinocyte proliferation and acted in synergy with 25D and 1,25D. SCC alone increased transglutaminase and cornified envelope levels. 25D potentiated this prodifferentiating effect of SCC. Twenty-four-hour preincubation with SCC did not alter 25D or 1,25D uptake into keratinocytes. These studies demonstrate a synergy between vitamin D metabolites and ceramides in human keratinocytes and indicate the potential of using 25D as an effective and safer alternative to deliver 1,25D benefits to the epidermis.","['Pillai, S', 'Cho, S', 'Mahajan, M', 'Frew, L', 'Rawlings, A V']","['Pillai S', 'Cho S', 'Mahajan M', 'Frew L', 'Rawlings AV']","['Unilever Research, Edgewater, NJ 07020, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Investig Dermatol Symp Proc,The journal of investigative dermatology.

We studied the mechanism by which leukemic cells proliferated in patients. The indefinite growth of leukemic cells is supported by leukemic blast progenitors with a self-renewal capacity. Hematopoietic growth factors, such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-3 (IL-3) or stem cell factor (SCF), have been revealed to stimulate the growth of leukemic blast progenitors. Furthermore, leukemic cells themselves produce and secrete hematopoietic factors that stimulate leukemic blast progenitors. The so-called autocrine growth mechanism has been postulated to play an important role in the pathophysiology of acute myelocytic leukemia. Leukemic cells show terminal differentiation under certain circumstances. For example, leukemic cells differentiate to neutrophils or macrophages in suspension culture.

Results compared to the dUTP-fluorescein method by flow cytometry and dUTP-peroxidase labeling on slides (TUNEL) showed an excellent correlation (chi-square test: P < 0.01). This method is reliable and simple and allows one to measure routinely the percentage of apoptotic lymphoid cells at short notice in a laboratory of hematology. This is especially valuable, particularly in testing the predictive value of in vitro drug-induced apoptosis before starting a chemotherapy protocol.","['Mentz, F', 'Baudet, S', 'Blanc, C', 'Issaly, F', 'Binet, J L', 'Merle-Beral, H']","['Mentz F', 'Baudet S', 'Blanc C', 'Issaly F', 'Binet JL', 'Merle-Beral H']","[""Service d'Hematologie Biologique, Hopital Pitie-Salpetriere, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,IM,,"['*Apoptosis', 'Blood Cell Count/instrumentation/methods', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chlorambucil/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry/methods', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Jurkat Cells/physiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*blood', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/pathology/*physiology', 'Reference Values', 'Scattering, Radiation', 'Theophylline/pharmacology', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",1998/06/17 02:05,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/06/17 02:05'],"['1998/06/17 02:05 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/06/17 02:05 [entrez]']",['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0320(19980601)32:2<95::AID-CYTO4>3.0.CO;2-D [pii]'],ppublish,Cytometry. 1998 Jun 1;32(2):95-101.,"['18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', 'C137DTR5RG (Theophylline)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This phenotype is generally due to the expression of the mdr1 gene-encoded P-gp. Modulation of P-gp activity by chemotherapy has limited possibilities because of toxicity and poor specificity. In contrast, specific transcription blockage of the mdr1 gene can be obtained by oligonucleotides forming a triple helix structure at the DNA level. We used here immunofluorescence and both flow cytometry and image analysis to evaluate surface and total P-gp content in K562 MDR cells. The mdr1 mRNA content was measured by RT-PCR. We confirm the capacity of a 27-mer oligodeoxynucleotide, targeted to an mdr1 DNA fragment, to cause a 10-fold decrease in mdr1 mRNA level. However, this specific genetic inhibition was functionally limited because cellular growth was not modified in a cytotoxic environment. We found that total P-gp content was reduced in resistant cells treated with the mdr1-targeted oligonucleotide, while it remained in high levels on the cell surface, suggesting the existence of a large cytoplasmic pool of P-gp (approximately 50% of the total cellular P-gp). Moreover, when cycloheximide was used for 72 h to suppress protein synthesis, surface P-gp expression showed no decrease, whereas total P-gp was considerably lowered. A rapid 35% decrease in surface P-gp level was reached when resistant cells were treated for 24 h with brefeldin A, an inhibitor of intracellular protein trafficking. Simultaneously, the total P-gp level remained stable, thus indicating a probable accumulation of cytoplasmic P-gp, in agreement with the interruption of protein migration. We propose that the cytoplasmic P-gp pool could be a storage pool consumed for maintaining a steady-state level of surface P-gp. Cytometry could be a useful tool to study such a mechanism of P-gp trafficking and cellular distribution, which could explain the difficulties encountered in achieving stable and rapid effects of MDR reversal with oligonucleotides.","['Labroille, G', 'Belloc, F', 'Bilhou-Nabera, C', 'Bonnefille, S', 'Bascans, E', 'Boisseau, M R', 'Bernard, P', 'Lacombe, F']","['Labroille G', 'Belloc F', 'Bilhou-Nabera C', 'Bonnefille S', 'Bascans E', 'Boisseau MR', 'Bernard P', 'Lacombe F']","[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Hopital du Haut-Leveque, Pessac, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*biosynthesis', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Brefeldin A', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Cyclopentanes/pharmacology', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'DNA Primers', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia', 'Macrolides', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/pharmacology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/06/17 02:05,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/06/17 02:05'],"['1998/06/17 02:05 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/06/17 02:05 [entrez]']",['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0320(19980601)32:2<86::AID-CYTO3>3.0.CO;2-C [pii]'],ppublish,Cytometry. 1998 Jun 1;32(2):86-94.,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Cyclopentanes)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '20350-15-6 (Brefeldin A)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A new monoclonal antibody (anti-H3-P) was developed that recognizes phosphorylated H3 (H3-P). This antibody was used in multiparameter flow cytometric analysis to relate H3 phosphorylation in individual human leukemic cells to the cells' position in the cycle as well as their expression of cyclins A and B1. Mitotic cells, from prophase to telophase, reacted with anti-H3-P; the binding of the antibody to chromatin of interphase cells was several times weaker. Cell growth in the presence of staurosporine, an inhibitor of the kinase(s) that phosphorylate H3, abolished the cells' reactivity with the antibody. The reactivity also was abolished by incubation of permeabilized mitotic cells with alkaline phosphatase. These data indicate that, within permeabilized cells, the antibody is indeed specific for H3-P and does not detect the unphosphorylated epitope. All cells reacting with anti-H3-P, with the exception of prophase and early prometaphase, were cyclin A negative; the expression of cyclin B1 in these cells was threefold higher than in G2 cells. The analysis of phosphorylation of H3 in individual cells when combined with multiparameter analysis of their cycle position and expression of other proteins offers new possibilities to study molecular mechanisms associated with the G2 to M transition and chromatin condensation. It also offers an assay to screen in vivo inhibitors of kinase(s) or phosphatase(s) involved in H3 phosphorylation or dephosphorylation, and it provides a valuable marker to identify mitotic cells by cytometry.","['Juan, G', 'Traganos, F', 'James, W M', 'Ray, J M', 'Roberge, M', 'Sauve, D M', 'Anderson, H', 'Darzynkiewicz, Z']","['Juan G', 'Traganos F', 'James WM', 'Ray JM', 'Roberge M', 'Sauve DM', 'Anderson H', 'Darzynkiewicz Z']","['The Cancer Research Institute, New York Medical College, Valhalla, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,IM,,"['Alkaline Phosphatase/pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', '*Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'Cyclin A/*biosynthesis', 'Cyclin B/*biosynthesis', 'Cyclin B1', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects/metabolism', 'G2 Phase', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interphase', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia', 'Mitosis', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphoserine', 'Staurosporine/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vinblastine/pharmacology']",1998/06/17 02:05,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/06/17 02:05'],"['1998/06/17 02:05 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/06/17 02:05 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0320(19980601)32:2<71::AID-CYTO1>3.0.CO;2-H [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0320(19980601)32:2<71::aid-cyto1>3.0.co;2-h [doi]']",ppublish,Cytometry. 1998 Jun 1;32(2):71-7. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0320(19980601)32:2<71::aid-cyto1>3.0.co;2-h.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (CCNB1 protein, human)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Cyclin A)', '0 (Cyclin B)', '0 (Cyclin B1)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Histones)', '17885-08-4 (Phosphoserine)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It encodes a kruppel-like zinc finger protein with a POZ domain shared with a subset of regulatory proteins including the BCL6 leukemogenic protein. PLZF, like BCL6, strongly represses transcription initiated from different promoters. Here we show that PLZF associates in vitro and in vivo with the Mad co-repressor mSin3A and the histone deacetylase HDAC1. Two domains in PLZF and the PAH1 structure of mSin3A mediate these interactions. Trichostatin A, a specific inhibitor of histone deacetylases, significantly reduces PLZF repression. These data strongly suggest that, like nuclear receptors and Mad, PLZF represses transcription by recruiting a histone deacetylase through the SMRT-mSin3-HDAC co-repressor complex. We also show that BCL6 associates with HDAC1 indicating that this type of regulation might be common to POZ/Zinc finger proteins involved in human leukemias. This work supports a role for deregulated histone deacetylation in the development of both lymphoid and myeloid neoplasia in human and suggests that targeted histone deacetylase inhibitors may be useful for treatment of certain types of malignancies.","['David, G', 'Alland, L', 'Hong, S H', 'Wong, C W', 'DePinho, R A', 'Dejean, A']","['David G', 'Alland L', 'Hong SH', 'Wong CW', 'DePinho RA', 'Dejean A']","['Unite de Recombinaison et Expression Genetique, INSERM U163, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,,"['Binding Sites', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Histone Deacetylase 1', 'Histone Deacetylases/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Sin3 Histone Deacetylase and Corepressor Complex', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', '*Zinc Fingers']",1998/06/17 00:00,1998/06/17 00:01,['1998/06/17 00:00'],"['1998/06/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1202043 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1998 May 14;16(19):2549-56. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1202043.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SIN3A transcription factor)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (HDAC1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylase 1)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Sin3 Histone Deacetylase and Corepressor Complex)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Twenty-nine consecutive patients with biopsy-proven CLL were investigated on a .5-T MR imager to determine bulk T1 relaxation times of the vertebral bone marrow and proportion of proximal femur surface area occupied by nonfatty marrow on coronal T1-weighted MR images of one hip. Of the 29 patients, 12 (41%) had abnormal increase in lumbar marrow T1 values (>600 msec) and 16 (55%) had increased proportion of surface area occupied by nonfatty marrow in the proximal femur (>+1 SD compared to normal values determined in sex- and age-matched healthy subjects).

Patients with alterations in peripheral marrow distribution had significantly higher T1 relaxation times (P = .001) than those with normal peripheral marrow. Patients with abnormal marrow composition or distribution at MRI had significantly higher blood and marrow lymphocytosis than patients without these features. In conclusion, the agreement between both quantitative MR methods suggests a parallelism between changes in axial marrow composition and in peripheral marrow distribution in patients with CLL.

Whereas the expression of CD56 defines a particular subset of myeloma patients, CD28 is the only antigen for which expression correlates with tumor progression. Our data show that an aggressive compartment of CD28+ and CD86+ myeloma cells emerges during the course of MM in vivo, indicating that CD28 could be aberrantly expressed on highly malignant (possibly mutated) myeloma cells. Conversely, a subset of proliferative plasmablasts coexpressing CD28 and CD86 could be the normal counterpart of the clonogenic myeloma stem cell because a subset of CD28+ plasma cells was observed in 6 of 6 cases of reactive plasmocytosis.","['Robillard, N', 'Jego, G', 'Pellat-Deceunynck, C', 'Pineau, D', 'Puthier, D', 'Mellerin, M P', 'Barille, S', 'Rapp, M J', 'Harousseau, J L', 'Amiot, M', 'Bataille, R']","['Robillard N', 'Jego G', 'Pellat-Deceunynck C', 'Pineau D', 'Puthier D', 'Mellerin MP', 'Barille S', 'Rapp MJ', 'Harousseau JL', 'Amiot M', 'Bataille R']","[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Institut de Biologie, Nantes, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,,"['Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'B7-1 Antigen/analysis', 'B7-2 Antigen', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'CD28 Antigens/*analysis', 'CD56 Antigen/analysis', 'Cell Line', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis', 'Multiple Myeloma/*pathology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/pathology', 'Paraproteinemias/pathology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Recurrence', 'Treatment Failure', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/06/17 00:00,1998/06/17 00:01,['1998/06/17 00:00'],"['1998/06/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/17 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1998 Jun;4(6):1521-6.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (B7-2 Antigen)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (CD86 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous human trials have used low intermittent dosing of HuM195 at 3 mg/m2/day, which is adequate to saturate all available CD33 sites in vivo. In the current trial, we investigated supersaturating doses of HuM195. Ten patients with relapsed or refractory myelogenous leukemia (nine acute myelogenous leukemias and one chronic myelogenous leukemia) were treated on days 1-4 and 15-18 with a 4-h daily infusion of HuM195 at three different dose levels: 12, 24, and 36 mg/m2/day. The total maximum dose of HuM195 was 576 mg. The most common toxicities were grade II fever and rigors, seen more frequently at the highest dose. Interestingly, a transient and reversible drop in hemoglobin of 1-3 g/dl was seen during the infusion in several patients. Flow cytometric analysis showed that antigen sites in the peripheral blood and bone marrow (BM) remained saturated with HuM195 during the entire 4-week trial period. At these high doses, the average plasma half-life of HuM195 was approximately 1 week, compared to 38 h, seen in previous studies. Human anti-HuM195 immune responses were not observed. One patient with acute myelogenous leukemia, whose disease was refractory to two rounds of chemotherapy, with < 10% blasts in his BM, achieved a complete remission, lasting > 32 months, at the first dose level. Another three patients showed a reduction in leukemic BM cells. These studies suggest that high doses of HuM195 achieve a long serum half-life, with tolerable toxicity and without immunogenicity. In addition, antileukemic activity was seen.","['Caron, P C', 'Dumont, L', 'Scheinberg, D A']","['Caron PC', 'Dumont L', 'Scheinberg DA']","['Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antigens, CD/blood/*immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/blood/*immunology', 'Blast Crisis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3']",1998/06/17 00:00,1998/06/17 00:01,['1998/06/17 00:00'],"['1998/06/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/17 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1998 Jun;4(6):1421-8.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '0 (monoclonal antibody M195)']",,,"['P01 CA 33049/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 55349/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

The in vitro antiglioblastoma activity of WHI-P154 was amplified > 200-fold and rendered selective by conjugation to recombinant human epidermal growth factor (EGF). The EGF-P154 conjugate was able to bind to and enter target glioblastoma cells within 10-30 min via receptor (R)-mediated endocytosis by inducing internalization of the EGF-R molecules. In vitro treatment with EGF-P154 resulted in killing of glioblastoma cells at nanomolar concentrations with an IC50 of 813 +/- 139 nM, whereas no cytotoxicity against EGF-R-negative leukemia cells was observed, even at concentrations as high as 100 microM. The in vivo administration of EGF-P154 resulted in delayed tumor progression and improved tumor-free survival in a severe combined immunodeficient mouse glioblastoma xenograft model. Whereas none of the control mice remained alive tumor-free beyond 33 days (median tumor-free survival, 19 days) and all control mice had tumors that rapidly progressed to reach an average size of > 500 mm3 by 58 days, 40% of mice treated for 10 consecutive days with 1 mg/kg/day EGF-P154 remained alive and free of detectable tumors for more than 58 days with a median tumor-free survival of 40 days.

However, less than 10% of the CLL patients shows bcl-2 gene rearrangement in blood cells, using traditional Southern blotting analysis. In the present study, rearrangement of the bcl-2 gene in CLL cells was studied by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). With this method, large DNA fragments (> 50-10,000 kb) could be analyzed. Blood CLL cells from 9 of 9 patients and 2 of 2 CLL cell lines showed rearranged bcl-2 gene. In comparison, healthy blood B cells and lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) established from normal peripheral blood lymphocytes of the patients showed only germ line configuration. Thus, the possibility of restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) in this gene could be excluded. The primary cell involved in CLL might be a progenitor B cell that has accidentally rearranged the bcl-2 gene. As a consequence, such cells express stable amount of Bcl-2 protein and do not enter apoptosis.

Cyclin D1 was also demonstrated to be identical to the long-sought bcl-1 oncogene in B-cell malignancies with the t(11;14)(q13;q32) translocation. We report here a small deletion in the 3'-untranslated portion of the cyclin D1 gene in leukemia cells of a patient diagnosed with B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), associated with overexpression of the corresponding cyclin D1 mRNA. During a Northern blot survey of B-cell malignancies, we identified a patient whose CLL cells showed a marked increase in 1.5-1.6 kb cyclin D1 mRNA species. Subsequent Southern blot analysis showed that genomic DNA from the patient's cells contained an extra band in the EcoRI digest, suggesting that one allele of the cyclin D1 gene may be altered. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of the genomic DNA and direct DNA sequencing clearly disclosed that one allele of the cyclin D1 gene was deleted in the 3'-untranslated region, which would contribute to an increased stability of its mRNA. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis and direct DNA sequencing revealed that the cyclin D1 mRNA was deleted at the corresponding region. This finding provides further evidence for a critical role of cyclin D1 in the pathogenesis of B-cell malignancies and highlights a novel mechanism, a small deletion in the 3'-untranslated region, responsible for deregulation of the cyclin D1 gene in oncogenesis.","['Hosokawa, Y', 'Suzuki, R', 'Joh, T', 'Maeda, Y', 'Nakamura, S', 'Kodera, Y', 'Arnold, A', 'Seto, M']","['Hosokawa Y', 'Suzuki R', 'Joh T', 'Maeda Y', 'Nakamura S', 'Kodera Y', 'Arnold A', 'Seto M']","['Laboratory of Chemotherapy, Aichi Cancer Research Institute, Nagoya, Japan. yhosokaw@aichi-cc.pref.aichi.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,,"['Base Sequence', 'Cyclin D1/*genetics', '*Gene Deletion', '*Genes, bcl-1', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis']",1998/06/17 02:03,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/06/17 02:03'],"['1998/06/17 02:03 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/06/17 02:03 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19980610)76:6<791::AID-IJC4>3.0.CO;2-T [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(19980610)76:6<791::aid-ijc4>3.0.co;2-t [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1998 Jun 10;76(6):791-6. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(19980610)76:6<791::aid-ijc4>3.0.co;2-t.,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)']",,,['CA55905/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

We conducted a phase I trial to identify the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of this regimen with concomitant thoracic radiation (RT) in patients with advanced chest malignancies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with advanced chest malignancies that required RT were enrolled onto this phase I study of standard chest radiation (30 daily 2-Gy fractions for a total of 60 Gy) and concurrent chemotherapy with cisplatin starting at 100 mg/m2 every 3 weeks and vinorelbine starting at 20 mg/m2/wk. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients were treated on this study. Two of three patients treated at the maximum-administered dose of cisplatin 100 mg/m2 per cycle and vinorelbine 25 mg/m2/wk experienced acute DLT (neutropenia), which required deescalation. The dose level of cisplatin 100 mg/m2 and vinorelbine 20 mg/m2/wk, although tolerated acutely, produced delayed esophagitis, which proved dose-limiting. The recommended phase II dose was cisplatin 80 mg/m2 every 3 weeks and vinorelbine 15 mg/m2 given 2 of every 3 weeks with concomitant chest RT. CONCLUSION: Concomitant chemoradiotherapy with cisplatin and vinorelbine is feasible. The recommended phase II dose is cisplatin 80 mg/m2 every 3 weeks with vinorelbine 15 mg/m2 given twice over 3 weeks on a day 1/day 8 schedule. Esophagitis is the DLT, with neutropenia occurring at higher dose levels.

A BCR/ABL mutant lacking amino acids 176-426 in the BCR domain (p185DeltaBCR) failed to protect interleukin 3-deprived 32Dcl3 myeloid precursor cells from apoptosis, although it possessed tyrosine kinase activity and was capable of activating the Ras-Raf-MAP kinase pathway. Compared to p185 wild-type transfectants, p185DeltaBCR-transfected cells showed markedly reduced levels of Bcl-2 and expressed the hypophosphorylated, proapoptotic form of BAD. Bcl-2 expression in the mitochondrial fraction of p185DeltaBCR cells was also markedly diminished and mitochondrial RAF was undetectable. In p185DeltaBCR cells transfected with a mitochondria-targeted, constitutively active RAF (M-Raf) BAD was expressed in the hyperphosphorylated form and released from the mitochondria into the cytosol. p185DeltaBCR/M-Raf-transfected cells were completely resistant to apoptosis induced by growth factor deprivation in vitro. Moreover, constitutive expression of dominant-negative M-Raf (K375W) enhanced the susceptibility of 32Dcl3 cells expressing wild-type BCR/ABL to apoptosis. In severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice, p185DeltaBCR/M-Raf double transfectants were leukemogenic, whereas cells expressing only p185DeltaBCR showed no leukemogenic potential. Together, these data support the existence of a BCR/ABL-dependent pathway that leads to expression of an active RAF in the mitochondria and promotes antiapoptotic and leukemia-inducing effects of BCR/ABL.","['Salomoni, P', 'Wasik, M A', 'Riedel, R F', 'Reiss, K', 'Choi, J K', 'Skorski, T', 'Calabretta, B']","['Salomoni P', 'Wasik MA', 'Riedel RF', 'Reiss K', 'Choi JK', 'Skorski T', 'Calabretta B']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,IM,,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Interleukin-3/deficiency', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/*enzymology', 'Mutation', 'Oncogenes/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'ras Proteins/metabolism']",1998/06/24 00:00,1998/06/24 00:01,['1998/06/24 00:00'],"['1998/06/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/24 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.187.12.1995 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1998 Jun 15;187(12):1995-2007. doi: 10.1084/jem.187.12.1995.,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",,,['R29 CA70815/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC2212373,,,,,,,,,

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.",975-81,"BACKGROUND: Hepatic complications are a major cause of illness and death after bone marrow transplantation. OBJECTIVE: To confirm the results of a pilot study that indicated that ursodiol prophylaxis could reduce the incidence of veno-occlusive disease of the liver. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. SETTING: Tertiary care teaching hospital. PATIENTS: 67 consecutive patients undergoing transplantation with allogeneic bone marrow (donated by a relative) in whom busulfan plus cyclophosphamide was used as the preparative regimen and cyclosporine plus methotrexate was used to prevent graft-versus-host disease. INTERVENTION: Before the preparative regimen was started, patients were randomly assigned to receive ursodiol, 300 mg twice daily (or 300 mg in the morning and 600 mg in the evening if body weight was > 90 kg), or placebo. MEASUREMENTS: Patients were prospectively evaluated for the clinical diagnosis of veno-occlusive disease, the occurrence of acute graft-versus-host disease, and survival. RESULTS: The incidence of veno-occlusive disease was 40% (13 of 32 patients) in placebo recipients and 15% (5 of 34 patients) in ursodiol recipients (P = 0.03). Assignment to placebo was the only pretransplantation characteristic that predicted the development of veno-occlusive disease. The most significant predictor of 100-day mortality was the diagnosis of veno-occlusive disease. The difference in actuarial risk for hematologic relapse in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia and nonhepatic toxicities between the two groups was not statistically significant (13% in the ursodiol group and 20% in the placebo group; P > 0.2). CONCLUSION: Ursodiol prophylaxis seemed to decrease the incidence of hepatic complications after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in patients who received a preparative regimen with busulfan plus cyclophosphamide.","['Essell, J H', 'Schroeder, M T', 'Harman, G S', 'Halvorson, R', 'Lew, V', 'Callander, N', 'Snyder, M', 'Lewis, S K', 'Allerton, J P', 'Thompson, J M']","['Essell JH', 'Schroeder MT', 'Harman GS', 'Halvorson R', 'Lew V', 'Callander N', 'Snyder M', 'Lewis SK', 'Allerton JP', 'Thompson JM']","['Wilford Hall Medical Center, Lackland Air Force Base, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,Ann Intern Med,Annals of internal medicine,0372351,IM,,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects/mortality', 'Busulfan/therapeutic use', 'Cholagogues and Choleretics/*therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Hepatic Veno-Occlusive Disease/*prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Placebos', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Ursodeoxycholic Acid/*therapeutic use']",1998/06/13 00:00,1998/06/13 00:01,['1998/06/13 00:00'],"['1998/06/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/13 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/13 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.7326/0003-4819-128-12_part_1-199806150-00002 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Intern Med. 1998 Jun 15;128(12 Pt 1):975-81. doi: 10.7326/0003-4819-128-12_part_1-199806150-00002.,"['0 (Cholagogues and Choleretics)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Placebos)', '724L30Y2QR (Ursodeoxycholic Acid)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report in this study a concentration-dependent decrease in c-myc mRNA levels upon exposure of both cell lines to amsacrine and doxorubicin, with a more pronounced effect for amsacrine in the resistant line. In either case, c-myc down-regulation closely paralleled the drug-induced growth inhibition. We have also used the technique of PCR stop-assay to detect the occurrence of DNA breaks within the P2 promoter of the c-myc gene. We have shown that Topo II-mediated breaks induced by amsacrine are probably responsible for the down-regulation of c-myc in the resistant line. In addition, amsacrine induced apoptosis only in the resistant line while doxorubicin did not induce apoptosis in any cell line. These results suggest that c-myc is not involved in the resistance of K562 DoxR cells, but can induce the apoptosis pathway in these cells, while no drug-induced apoptosis could be detected in the sensitive line.","['Clary, A', 'Larrue, A', 'Pourquier, P', 'Robert, J']","['Clary A', 'Larrue A', 'Pourquier P', 'Robert J']","['Department of Medical Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Universite Victor Segalen Bordeaux 2, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,IM,,"['Amsacrine/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'DNA Probes', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/06/13 00:00,1998/06/13 00:01,['1998/06/13 00:00'],"['1998/06/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/13 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/13 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00001813-199803000-00007 [doi]'],ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 1998 Mar;9(3):245-54. doi: 10.1097/00001813-199803000-00007.,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A UV/Vis analysis was performed confirming the reduction of the cobalt atom of hydroxocobalamin (vitamin B12a) with the binding of NO, causing a shift in the absorption spectra of CO3+ (lambdamax=530) to CO2+ (lambdamax=500) with the formation of nitrosylcobalamin. The extinction coefficient (epsilonmax) of nitrosylcobalamin, as calculated, was 4.8 (mM(-1), cm(-1)). An IR analysis determined the v(NO) vibrational frequency at 1652 cm(-1), supporting the binding of NO and suggesting a bent bonding geometry. NO release was maximized utilizing acidic conditions (pH 4.9, 32 degrees C) with a cumulative release of about 4610 nmol of NO in 675 h (calculated half-life of 210 h), representing 39% NO loading based on 11,890 nmol NO, theoretically possible (one NO per molecule of hydroxocobalamin). The cumulative NO release followed first-order kinetics and was pH dependent. NO release was minimal at pH 6.0 and 7.4 (37 degrees C), and undetected at pH 10 (37 degrees C). The possibility for nitrosylcobalamin to deliver NO (the active chemotherapeutic agent) to neoplastic cells is suggested because tumor cells, specifically leukemia cells, possess surface cell receptors for vitamin B12 which is readily utilized in the cellular proliferation process.

Retroviral IRES-STVs (R-IRES-STVs) were assembled using an LNCX backbone (Miller and Rosman, 1989). In all of these constructs, a multiple cloning site (MCS) is located immediately downstream of the single promoter and is followed by the IRES sequence and a selectable marker. This configuration ensures that the MCS-inserted gene will be expressed in selected cells. The selectable markers of these vectors provide resistance to G418, puromycin, hygromycin B, histidinol D, and phleomycin. One STV contains green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a selectable marker, permitting FACS-mediated selection, which may prove useful in gene therapy applications. More than 70% of recipient cells could be infected with R-IRES-STVs after one round of infection. Up to 99% of infected cells expressed the reporter gene (GFP) after selection with an appropriate drug.

Since clinical trials employing these methodologies have been proposed for anti-HIV gene therapy of HIV-infected children, we wished to assess, by in vitro modeling, the expected limits of transduction efficiency, expression, and antiviral activity using currently available methods. We measured retrovirus-mediated transduction in cord blood progenitors and their in vitro-derived progeny macrophages by Mo-MuLV vectors expressing a transdominant negative Rev (RevTD). CFU-GM transduction efficiency ranged from 7 to 85%, with an average of 28%. Semiquantitative DNA PCR demonstrated < or =100 vector sequence copies per 1000 cells in monocyte/macrophage cultures, which were grown without selection to better model in vivo conditions. When challenged with the macrophagetropic HIV-1BaL isolate, cultured macrophages from mock-transduced CFU-GM colonies supported infection in eight of eight experimental cultures, control LXSN-transduced progenitors supported infection in six of eight cultures, while macrophages derived from RevTD-transduced CFU-GM colonies supported infection in four of eight cultures. Although these results support the ability of neo(r) retroviral vectors containing RevTD to inhibit HIV replication, they indicate that further optimization of transduction efficiency and sustained expression will be required for effective anti-HIV protection in vivo.","['Davis, B R', 'Saitta, F P', 'Bauer, G', 'Bunnell, B A', 'Morgan, R A', 'Schwartz, D H']","['Davis BR', 'Saitta FP', 'Bauer G', 'Bunnell BA', 'Morgan RA', 'Schwartz DH']","['Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,IM,,"['Antigens, CD34/*blood', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cryopreservation', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood/cytology/immunology', 'Genes, Dominant', '*Genetic Therapy', 'HIV Infections/congenital/*prevention & control', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Macrophages/virology', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Pregnancy', '*Transduction, Genetic']",1998/06/13 00:00,1998/06/13 00:01,['1998/06/13 00:00'],"['1998/06/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/13 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/13 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/hum.1998.9.8-1197 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 1998 May 20;9(8):1197-207. doi: 10.1089/hum.1998.9.8-1197.,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Writing Committee for the Collaborative CML Prognostic Factors Project Group.,850-8,"BACKGROUND: Interferon alfa is a conservative and widely used alternative to bone marrow transplantation in treatment of patients with early chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). A meta-analysis was conducted to develop a reliable prognostic scoring system for estimation of survival of patients with CML treated with interferon alfa. METHODS: Patients treated in prospective studies, including major randomized trials, were separated into learning and validation samples. Cox regression analysis and the minimum P-value approach were used to identify prognostic factors for patient survival and to discover groups in the learning sample with the greatest differences in survival. These findings were then validated by applying the new scoring system to patients in the validation sample. RESULTS: We collected data on 1573 patients who were participants in 14 studies involving 12 institutions; 1303 patients (learning sample, n = 981; validation sample, n = 322) were eligible for inclusion in this analysis, and their median survival time was 69 months (range, 1-117 months). Because two previously described prognostic scoring systems failed to discriminate risk groups satisfactorily, we developed a new scoring system that utilizes the following covariates: age, spleen size, blast count, platelet count, eosinophil count, and basophil count. Among 908 patients with complete data in the learning sample, three distinct risk groups were identified (median survival times of 98 months [n = 369; 40.6%], 65 months [n = 406; 44.7%], or 42 months [n = 133;14.6%]; two-sided logrank test, P< or =.0001). The ability of the new scoring system to discriminate these risk groups was confirmed by analysis of 285 patients with complete data in the validation sample (two-sided logrank test, P = .0002). CONCLUSIONS: A new prognostic scoring system for estimating survival of patients with CML treated with interferon alfa has been developed and validated through use of a large dataset.","['Hasford, J', 'Pfirrmann, M', 'Hehlmann, R', 'Allan, N C', 'Baccarani, M', 'Kluin-Nelemans, J C', 'Alimena, G', 'Steegmann, J L', 'Ansari, H']","['Hasford J', 'Pfirrmann M', 'Hehlmann R', 'Allan NC', 'Baccarani M', 'Kluin-Nelemans JC', 'Alimena G', 'Steegmann JL', 'Ansari H']","['Institute for Medical Informatics, Biometry, and Epidemiology, University of Munich, Germany. has@ibe.med.uni-muenchen.de']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Europe/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/*therapeutic use', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', '*Severity of Illness Index', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate', 'United States/epidemiology']",1998/06/13 00:00,1998/06/13 00:01,['1998/06/13 00:00'],"['1998/06/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/13 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/13 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/90.11.850 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1998 Jun 3;90(11):850-8. doi: 10.1093/jnci/90.11.850.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Visceral involvement with varicella-zoster may be incorrectly ascribed to graft-versus-host disease, resulting in delayed diagnosis and misguided therapy. METHODS: A 4-yr retrospective chart review was performed to determine the presenting symptoms and clinical outcome of visceral varicella-zoster virus infection in BMT recipients. RESULTS: Ten BMT recipients who subsequently developed visceral varicella-zoster virus infection were identified. The mean age at diagnosis was 40 yr (range 27-56 yr). Primary hematological malignancies were leukemia (N = 7), myelodysplasia (N = 2), and myelofibrosis (N = 1). Bone marrow transplants in affected patients were autologous (N = 2), related allogeneic (N = 5), or matched unrelated allogeneic (N = 3). The mean time interval from BMT to symptomatic visceral varicella-zoster virus infection was 153 days (range 60-280 days). Presenting symptoms included abdominal pain in all patients, nausea (60%), fever > 38 degrees C (60%), vomiting (50%), pneumonitis (50%), skin rash (40%), and diarrhea (30%). All patients had moderately or profoundly elevated aminotransferases and most had elevated pancreatic enzymes (80%). The mean time interval from the development of abdominal pain to the characteristic skin rash and then diagnosis was 6 and 7 days, respectively (range 4-10 and 4-14 days). Active graft-versus-host disease had previously been documented in five of the eight allogeneic BMT recipients. Immunosuppressive medications were increased at the onset of the abdominal pain in seven of these eight patients for suspected exacerbation of graft-versus-host disease. After recognition of varicella infection, antiviral therapy was promptly initiated; despite this, mortality was still 50%. CONCLUSIONS: Visceral involvement with varicella-zoster virus infection can occur as a late complication after both allogeneic and autologous BMT. In these cases, symptoms of severe abdominal pain with associated nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea and elevated liver and pancreatic enzymes preceded the vesicular skin eruption and were confused with graft-versus-host disease. With the increasing application of high-dose chemotherapy followed by stem cell rescue for both hematological and solid tumors, clinicians should be aware of this potentially treatable and often lethal complication.","['David, D S', 'Tegtmeier, B R', ""O'Donnell, M R"", 'Paz, I B', 'McCarty, T M']","['David DS', 'Tegtmeier BR', ""O'Donnell MR"", 'Paz IB', 'McCarty TM']","['Department of Gastroenterology, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California 91010, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Gastroenterol,The American journal of gastroenterology,0421030,IM,,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Chickenpox/diagnosis/*etiology/pathology', 'Female', '*Herpesvirus 3, Human', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Opportunistic Infections/*etiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Virus Activation', '*Viscera']",1998/06/13 00:00,1998/06/13 00:01,['1998/06/13 00:00'],"['1998/06/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/13 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/13 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0002927098001105 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1572-0241.1998.230_a.x [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Gastroenterol. 1998 May;93(5):810-3. doi: 10.1111/j.1572-0241.1998.230_a.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Computed tomography and magnetic resonance images of the brain were nonspecific. Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) revealed lymphocytosis and an increased protein level. Using polymerase chain reaction methods, HHV-6 was the only pathogen detected in CSF, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and bone marrow. The patient was treated with ganciclovir and foscarnet for 3 months. All clinical manifestations resolved and HHV-6 polymerase chain reaction analysis of CSF became negative 40 days after the beginning of antiviral treatment.

METHODS: The ability of human CD34+ cells to possess potent tolerizing activity was studied by limiting dilution analysis of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) precursors (CTL-p) in human peripheral blood lymphocytes after addition of purified CD34+ cells. RESULTS: The addition of purified human CD34+ cells to primary mixed lymphocyte culture led to a marked reduction of antiallogeneic CTL-p frequency against stimulator cells of the same origin, compared with the response against cells of third-party origin. The CD34+ cells caused a marked inhibition of the CTL activity, when added at an equal number with the responder T cells, and they were still present after the mixed lymphocyte culture, which suggests that no significant killing of CD34+ cells had occurred. The tolerizing activity is abrogated by irradiation and requires cell contact. This pattern of tolerization most closely resembles what has been ascribed to veto cells in other systems. Phenotypic analysis of the purified CD34+ cells showed that they express MHC class I and class II antigens, but do not express costimulatory molecules of the B7 family. CONCLUSIONS: It is possible, that CD34+ cells in the megadose transplants-perhaps by their inability to provide costimulatory molecules-are actively reducing the frequency of CTL-p directed against their antigens, and thereby help to overcome allogeneic rejection, and enhance their own engraftment.","['Rachamim, N', 'Gan, J', 'Segall, H', 'Krauthgamer, R', 'Marcus, H', 'Berrebi, A', 'Martelli, M', 'Reisner, Y']","['Rachamim N', 'Gan J', 'Segall H', 'Krauthgamer R', 'Marcus H', 'Berrebi A', 'Martelli M', 'Reisner Y']","['Department of Immunology, The Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,IM,,"['Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Cell Communication/physiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology/physiology/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance/*physiology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Phenotype', 'Stem Cells/physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/physiology']",1998/06/13 00:00,1998/06/13 00:01,['1998/06/13 00:00'],"['1998/06/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/13 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/13 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00007890-199805270-00017 [doi]'],ppublish,Transplantation. 1998 May 27;65(10):1386-93. doi: 10.1097/00007890-199805270-00017.,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We assessed the incidence of subdural hygromas after BMT and tried to define possible risk factors associated with this complication. METHODS: Fifty bone marrow graft recipients surviving more than 30 days were consecutively enrolled into a prospective study. Cranial CT scans were performed before and 30 days after BMT. Clinical data and symptoms were recorded daily during the first 30 days after BMT. In patients with subdural hygromas, a magnetic resonance imaging scan and monthly follow-up cranial computed tomography scans were performed until fluid collections had resolved completely. RESULTS: In 9 of the 50 patients (18%) who survived 30 days after transplantation, newly acquired subdural hygromas were found. Patients with hygromas suffered significantly longer and more severely from headache and vomiting (P=0.01). Application of intrathecal methotrexate and arterial hypertension occurred significantly more often in patients with hygromas (P=0.01). In a stepwise logistic regression model, arterial hypertension and intrathecal methotrexate application were the only independent risk factors for the development of hygromas. Monthly follow-up cranial computed tomography scans showed that all hygromas resolved completely after a median of 60 days after diagnosis (range: 30-120 days). CONCLUSIONS: Subdural hygromas are a frequent complication after BMT within the first 30 days after transplantation. They are reversible and disappear within 2-3 months. The need for routine application of intrathecal methotrexate in standard risk leukemia patients should be critically addressed. Furthermore, close monitoring of blood pressure and immediate antihypertensive therapy might contribute to avoid formation of subdural hygromas.","['Staudinger, T', 'Heimberger, K', 'Rabitsch, W', 'Schneider, B', 'Greinix, H T', 'Nowzad, S', 'Brugger, S', 'Reiter, E', 'Keil, F', 'Lechner, K', 'Kalhs, P']","['Staudinger T', 'Heimberger K', 'Rabitsch W', 'Schneider B', 'Greinix HT', 'Nowzad S', 'Brugger S', 'Reiter E', 'Keil F', 'Lechner K', 'Kalhs P']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, University of Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphangioma, Cystic/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Middle Aged', '*Postoperative Complications', 'Prospective Studies', 'Radiography', 'Subdural Space/diagnostic imaging/pathology']",1998/06/13 00:00,1998/06/13 00:01,['1998/06/13 00:00'],"['1998/06/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/13 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/13 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00007890-199805270-00010 [doi]'],ppublish,Transplantation. 1998 May 27;65(10):1340-4. doi: 10.1097/00007890-199805270-00010.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These cells are phenotypically heterogenous and include natural killer (NK) and cytotoxic T cells. This study investigated the role of cytotoxic lymphocytes directed against autologous bladder cancer cells. METHODS: PBL were obtained at intervals before and after surgery and analyzed for cytotoxic activity against autologous bladder cancer cells in 4-hour 51Cr release assay. PBL stimulated with autologous tumor cells were also transformed with human T-lymphotropic virus type-1, establishing a cell line (KB31) which was analyzed for phenotype and cytotoxic activity against the autologous tumor cells. RESULTS: PBL preoperative cytotoxic activity was low, but increased after surgery. Cytotoxic activity was found not only against autologous bladder cancer cells, but also against heterologous bladder cancer (KK-47) and myeloid leukemia (K562) cells, with the highest activity against the heterologous cell lines. The cytotoxic activity of KB31 was 40% against autologous tumor cells 6 weeks after initiation of the cell line, but decreased to 5% by 6 months. This activity was lower than that against the other cell lines, and was similar to that of PBL in short-term culture. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis demonstrated that in KB31 cells at 6 weeks, CD8+ cells were dominant, but CD56+ cells predominated at 6 months. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the presence of cytotoxic activity in the peripheral blood of the patient was due to both cytotoxic T cells and NK cells. The cytotoxic activity was lowest prior to surgery and increased postoperatively.","['Kim, C J', 'Yuasa, T', 'Kushima, R', 'Tomoyoshi, T', 'Seto, A']","['Kim CJ', 'Yuasa T', 'Kushima R', 'Tomoyoshi T', 'Seto A']","['Department of Urology, Shiga University of Medical Science, Otsu, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Australia,Int J Urol,International journal of urology : official journal of the Japanese Urological Association,9440237,IM,,"['Aged', 'Animals', 'Blood Cells/*physiology', 'Carcinoma, Transitional Cell/*blood/pathology', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Female', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/physiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/*blood/pathology']",1998/06/13 00:00,1998/06/13 00:01,['1998/06/13 00:00'],"['1998/06/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/13 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/13 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1442-2042.1998.tb00595.x [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Urol. 1998 May;5(3):230-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1442-2042.1998.tb00595.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rare APL cases lacking the t(15;17) have been described. We have previously reported two cases presenting with submicroscopic insertions of RARA or PML into chromosome 15 or 17, respectively. These insertions lead to the formation of potentially functional, nonreciprocal, PML/RARA or RARA/PML fusion genes, providing the unique opportunity to investigate in a human noncell-line model the respective role of PML/RARA or RARA/PML in retinoid signaling. Here, we report the in vitro response to ATRA of these two cases as well as of a third case presenting with submicroscopic insertion (15;17) and expressing exclusively PML/RARA, by morphological, functional, and immunological assays. The two cases expressing PML/RARA presented with an immunostaining pattern typical of APL and a positive response to ATRA, whereas the APL case expressing only a RARA/PML fusion transcript exhibited an immunostaining pattern typical of non-APL cells, and was resistant to ATRA. Our results confirm that sensitivity to ATRA requires expression of PML/RARA and strongly correlates with immunostaining, and demonstrate that expression of RARA/PML alone is sufficient for a cytological APL phenotype, but does not confer sensitivity to ATRA.","['Mozziconacci, M J', 'Liberatore, C', 'Brunel, V', 'Grignani, F', 'Arnoulet, C', 'Ferrucci, P F', 'Fernandez, F', 'Sainty, D', 'Pelicci, P G', 'Birg, F', 'Lafage-Pochitaloff, M']","['Mozziconacci MJ', 'Liberatore C', 'Brunel V', 'Grignani F', 'Arnoulet C', 'Ferrucci PF', 'Fernandez F', 'Sainty D', 'Pelicci PG', 'Birg F', 'Lafage-Pochitaloff M']","['Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,IM,,"['Adult', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/genetics', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Gene Conversion/drug effects/genetics', 'Genes, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/drug effects/*genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/drug effects/*genetics/metabolism', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/06/13 02:17,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/06/13 02:17'],"['1998/06/13 02:17 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/06/13 02:17 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1098-2264(199807)22:3<241::AID-GCC10>3.0.CO;2-R [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1098-2264(199807)22:3<241::aid-gcc10>3.0.co;2-r [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1998 Jul;22(3):241-50. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1098-2264(199807)22:3<241::aid-gcc10>3.0.co;2-r.,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Accordingly, alleles that show concomitant expression replicate synchronously, while those displaying an allele-specific mode of expression show temporal differences in their replication timing, i.e., they replicate asynchronously. We aimed in our study to see whether the cancer phenotype is accompanied by a relaxation in the temporal control of allelic replication. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to determine the level of synchronization in replication timing of four pairs of homologous loci in samples of malignant cells derived from patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and lymphoma and in samples from healthy individuals. Four loci, HER2 mapped to 17q11.2-q12, a locus at 21q22, TP53 mapped to 17q13.1, and MYC mapped to 8q24 were studied. In each sample we analyzed two chromosomal regions, either 17q11.2-q12 and 21q22 or 17p13.1 and 8q24. The results showed distinct differences between healthy individuals and CML/lymphoma patients: all samples derived from noncancerous subjects showed high levels of synchrony in replication timing of alleles, whereas those of cancer patients displayed a large temporal difference in replication timing, indicating early and late replicating alleles. Thus, as judged by four unrelated loci, malignancy is associated with changes in the replication pattern of homologous loci.","['Amiel, A', 'Litmanovitch, T', 'Lishner, M', 'Mor, A', 'Gaber, E', 'Tangi, I', 'Fejgin, M', 'Avivi, L']","['Amiel A', 'Litmanovitch T', 'Lishner M', 'Mor A', 'Gaber E', 'Tangi I', 'Fejgin M', 'Avivi L']","['Genetic Institute, Meir Hospital, Kfar Saba, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,IM,,"['Alleles', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/genetics', '*DNA Replication', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Lymphoma/*genetics', '*Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/06/13 02:17,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/06/13 02:17'],"['1998/06/13 02:17 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/06/13 02:17 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1098-2264(199807)22:3<225::AID-GCC8>3.0.CO;2-Y [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1098-2264(199807)22:3<225::aid-gcc8>3.0.co;2-y [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1998 Jul;22(3):225-31. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1098-2264(199807)22:3<225::aid-gcc8>3.0.co;2-y.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Concerns about a possible association of 1,3-butadiene and styrene with lymphohaematopoietic, gastrointestinal, and lung cancers prompted the investigation. METHODS: A retrospective follow up study was conducted of 15,649 men employed for at least one year at any of eight North American styrene-butadiene rubber plants. Analyses used standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) to compare styrene-butadiene rubber workers' cause specific mortalities (1943-91) with those of the United States and Ontario general populations. RESULTS: On average, there were 25 years of follow up per subject. The standardised mortality ratio (SMR) was 87 (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 85 to 90) for all causes of death combined and was 93 (95% CI 87 to 99) for all cancers. There was an excess of leukaemia (SMR 131, 95% CI 97 to 174), restricted to hourly workers (SMR 143, 95% CI 104 to 191). For causes of death other than leukaemia, SMRs were close to or below the null value of 100. Results by work area (process group) were unremarkable for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and stomach cancer. Maintenance workers had a slight increase in deaths from lung cancer, and certain subgroups of workers had more than expected deaths from cancer of the large intestine and the larynx. CONCLUSION: This study found an excess of leukaemia that is likely to be due to exposure to butadiene or to butadiene plus other chemicals. Deaths from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and stomach cancer did not seem to be related to occupational exposure. The excess deaths from lung cancer among maintenance workers may be due in part to confounding by smoking, which was not controlled for, and in part to an unidentified occupational exposure other than butadiene or styrene. Increases in cancer of the large intestine and larynx were based on small numbers, did not seem to be due to exposure to butadiene or styrene, and may be chance observations.","['Sathiakumar, N', 'Delzell, E', 'Hovinga, M', 'Macaluso, M', 'Julian, J A', 'Larson, R', 'Cole, P', 'Muir, D C']","['Sathiakumar N', 'Delzell E', 'Hovinga M', 'Macaluso M', 'Julian JA', 'Larson R', 'Cole P', 'Muir DC']","['Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of Alabama at Birmingham, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Occup Environ Med,Occupational and environmental medicine,9422759,IM,,"['Butadienes/*adverse effects', 'Chemical Industry/*statistics & numerical data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Kentucky/epidemiology', 'Louisiana/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/etiology/*mortality', 'Occupational Diseases/etiology/*mortality', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Ontario/epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', '*Rubber', 'Styrenes/*adverse effects', 'Texas/epidemiology', 'Time Factors']",1998/06/13 00:00,1998/06/13 00:01,['1998/06/13 00:00'],"['1998/06/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/13 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/13 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/oem.55.4.230 [doi]'],ppublish,Occup Environ Med. 1998 Apr;55(4):230-5. doi: 10.1136/oem.55.4.230.,"['0 (Butadienes)', '0 (Styrenes)', '9006-04-6 (Rubber)']",,,,,PMC1757573,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, intracellular DOX accumulation, determined by high-performance liquid chromatography, was also increased when cells were treated with MEBCD combined with DOX (approximately 2-3 fold). The effects of MEBCD in resistant sublines were greater than in their parental sensitive cell lines. Other experiments demonstrated that the action of the MEBCD was independent of DOX.

Identification of retinoic acid response element in the first intron.,15429-34,"CD38 is a nonlineage-restricted type II transmembrane glycoprotein possessing ecto-NAD+ glycohydrolase activity. Because of its unique expression pattern in lymphocyte differentiation, it appears to function as an immunoregulatory molecule. We previously reported that CD38 was specifically induced by all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) in human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells. Here we studied the molecular mechanism of the RA-dependent induction of human CD38. The expression of CD38 mRNA by RA appeared to be caused by the transcriptional stimulation of the gene, since it was blocked by an RNA synthesis inhibitor, but not by a protein synthesis inhibitor. In search of the RA response element (RARE) possibly present in human CD38 gene promoter, we isolated and sequenced the genomic DNA covering the 5'-flanking region, exon 1, and partial intron 1. Transient transfection experiments revealed that the responsiveness to RA was conferred through an RARE consisting of two direct repeat TGACCT-like hexamer motifs with a 5-nucleotide spacer, which was located in the first intron rather than the 5'-flanking region of the CD38 gene. This RARE interacted with heterodimer composed of RA receptor and retinoid X receptor in vitro. Thus, the RA-induced expression of the human CD38 gene was demonstrated to be mediated through the RARE located in the first intron.","['Kishimoto, H', 'Hoshino, S', 'Ohori, M', 'Kontani, K', 'Nishina, H', 'Suzawa, M', 'Kato, S', 'Katada, T']","['Kishimoto H', 'Hoshino S', 'Ohori M', 'Kontani K', 'Nishina H', 'Suzawa M', 'Kato S', 'Katada T']","['Department of Physiological Chemistry, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', '*Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, Differentiation/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Exons', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Introns', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NAD+ Nucleosidase/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",1998/06/23 00:00,1998/06/23 00:01,['1998/06/23 00:00'],"['1998/06/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/23 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/23 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.273.25.15429 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)80811-0 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1998 Jun 19;273(25):15429-34. doi: 10.1074/jbc.273.25.15429.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (NAD+ Nucleosidase)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",,,,,,,,,,,['GENBANK/AB009298'],,,

Here we have shown that the adherent cells rapidly died by apoptosis after forced detachment (anoikis), indicating that phorbol diester induced apoptosis by default. Dimethylsphingosine induced apoptosis in the adherent cells, and sphingosine-1-phosphate rescued the detached cells from apoptosis. Sphingosine kinase activity in adherent cells was higher than that in nonadherent cells and was decreased by forced detachment. It is likely that the phorbol diester-induced apoptosis and the adhesion-mediated survival are modulated by sphingosine and sphingosine-1-phosphate, respectively. The adherent cells were reverted and reproliferated when allowed to spontaneously detach from plastic surfaces by removal of phorbol diester. This result suggests that after removal of phorbol diester, the commitment signal of apoptosis by default is lost faster than the survival signal by adherence.","['Nakamura, H', 'Oda, T', 'Hamada, K', 'Hirano, T', 'Shimizu, N', 'Utiyama, H']","['Nakamura H', 'Oda T', 'Hamada K', 'Hirano T', 'Shimizu N', 'Utiyama H']","['Life Science Group, Faculty of Integrated Arts and Sciences, Hiroshima University, Kagamiyama 1-7-1, Higashi-Hiroshima 739-8521, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,,"['*Apoptosis', '*Cell Adhesion', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Indoles/metabolism', '*Lysophospholipids', 'Nuclear Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate/*pharmacology', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/metabolism', 'Sphingosine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/*pharmacology']",1998/06/23 00:00,1998/06/23 00:01,['1998/06/23 00:00'],"['1998/06/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/23 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/23 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.273.25.15345 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)80799-2 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1998 Jun 19;273(25):15345-51. doi: 10.1074/jbc.273.25.15345.,"['0 (Indoles)', '0 (Lysophospholipids)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '26993-30-6 (sphingosine 1-phosphate)', '37558-16-0 (Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate)', '47165-04-8 (DAPI)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))', 'EC 2.7.1.- (sphingosine kinase)', 'L9QRA71834 (N,N-dimethylsphingosine)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, two embryonic stem (ES) cell lines were used to further investigate the action of TNFalpha. The expression of TNFalpha receptors in ES cells was tested by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Northern blot analysis. Transcripts encoding the two distinct receptor isoforms were detected in these cells. Using different approaches, our data showed a TNFalpha dose-dependent decrease in the number of ES cells after 24 h of exposure. Simultaneous blocking of the two receptors with antagonist antibodies was needed to completely abrogate the inhibitory effect of the cytokine. Extensive DNA nicks (visualized by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end-labeling [TUNEL] method), but not nuclear fragmentation, was found with a higher incidence in ES cells exposed to TNFalpha. The possibility that TNFalpha may stimulate ES cell differentiation was investigated with a test based on the expression of alkaline phosphatase. The results indicated that TNFalpha cannot over-ride the negative control exerted by leukemia inhibitory factor on differentiation. The opposite possibility, that TNFalpha blocks differentiation, was tested in suspended medium drops. In this system, TNFalpha was found to decrease the ability of ES cells to differentiate into embryoid bodies. In addition, expression of Rex-1, a marker gene for undifferentiated ES cells, was increased in ES cells exposed to TNFalpha. Thus our data support the hypothesis that TNFalpha is a significant (negative) effector of proliferation and differentiation in inner cell mass-derived ES cells.","['Wuu, Y D', 'Pampfer, S', 'Vanderheyden, I', 'Lee, K H', 'De Hertogh, R']","['Wuu YD', 'Pampfer S', 'Vanderheyden I', 'Lee KH', 'De Hertogh R']","['University of Louvain Medical School, Physiology of Human Reproduction Research Unit, Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biol Reprod,Biology of reproduction,0207224,IM,,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Fragmentation', '*Embryo, Mammalian', 'Gene Expression', 'Mice', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/genetics', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",1998/06/12 00:00,1998/06/12 00:01,['1998/06/12 00:00'],"['1998/06/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/12 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/12 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1095/biolreprod58.6.1416 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Reprod. 1998 Jun;58(6):1416-24. doi: 10.1095/biolreprod58.6.1416.,"['0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ATM gene was shown to sustain frequent loss-of-function mutations in T-PLL tumor cells, consistent with functioning as a tumor suppressor gene in this leukemia. To investigate the possibility of nonmutational or nonrecombinational mechanisms of T-PLL development, we have used bisulfite genomic sequencing to analyze DNA methylation in the putative bidirectional promoter region of the closely linked ATM and NPAT/E14 genes within the CpG island at 11q22-q23. We show that this region is completely demethylated in lymphocytes expressing ATM; however, no extensive hypermethylation was found in 9 T-PLL tumor DNA samples without evidence of ATM/p53 mutations. Because acute T-cell lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALL) were also observed in ataxia-telangiectasia patients and T-ALL tumor cells contain chromosome 14 abnormalities, 19 presentation samples of T-ALL patients were analyzed for ATM mutations. Although T-ALL patients exhibited rare nucleotide substitutions not previously found in ATM, all were identified in the germ-line, indicating constitutional polymorphisms, potentially confined to ethnic subpopulations. The absence of somatic nucleotide changes in ATM in T-ALL as compared with T-PLL suggests a distinct pattern of genetic events in the development of the two leukemias.","['Luo, L', 'Lu, F M', 'Hart, S', 'Foroni, L', 'Rabbani, H', 'Hammarstrom, L', 'Yuille, M R', 'Catovsky, D', 'Webster, A D', 'Vorechovsky, I']","['Luo L', 'Lu FM', 'Hart S', 'Foroni L', 'Rabbani H', 'Hammarstrom L', 'Yuille MR', 'Catovsky D', 'Webster AD', 'Vorechovsky I']","['Karolinska Institute, Department of Biosciences at NOVUM, Huddinge, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,['Cancer Res 1998 Aug 1;58(15):3488'],"['Ataxia Telangiectasia/*genetics', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Chromosome Inversion', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic/*genetics', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', '*Mutation', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proteins/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1998/06/11 00:00,1998/06/11 00:01,['1998/06/11 00:00'],"['1998/06/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/11 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/11 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1998 Jun 1;58(11):2293-7.,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (NPAT protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Originally, the focal adhesion was thought to only provide structural support for the actin-based cytoskeleton of the cell. However, the last decade has yielded considerable information linking various protein components of the focal adhesion to signal transduction pathways. Examples of focal adhesion proteins include the catalytically active p125FAK, SH2-containing tensin, and the multifunctional LIM domain-containing paxillin. The interactions of focal adhesion proteins may be altered after cellular transformation. This review details how certain focal adhesion proteins are associated in cellular signaling as well as transformation. The importance of various GTP-binding proteins in interacting with and forming the focal adhesion, and the influence they have on neoplastic transformation, are discussed. A key feature of this review is how oncogenes and their respective oncoproteins affect the focal adhesion. Classically, v-src transformation of adherent cells has been studied to characterize focal adhesions, namely, because of the distinct morphological changes that occur in the focal adhesion concomitantly with src transformation. Similarly, the BCR/ABL oncogene, which causes chronic myelogenous leukemia, leads to adhesion defects and can alter the properties of focal adhesion proteins. Thus, we describe some of the relevant interactions between the focal adhesion and the Src and BCR/ABL oncoproteins, respectively.","['Weisberg, E', 'Sattler, M', 'Ewaniuk, D S', 'Salgia, R']","['Weisberg E', 'Sattler M', 'Ewaniuk DS', 'Salgia R']","['Division of Cell Biology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Crit Rev Oncog,Critical reviews in oncogenesis,8914610,IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Adhesion/*physiology', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*physiology', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Focal Adhesion Kinase 1', 'Focal Adhesion Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Genes, src', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics', '*Oncogenes', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*physiology', '*Signal Transduction', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1997/01/01 00:00,1998/06/11 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/11 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1615/critrevoncog.v8.i4.40 [doi]'],ppublish,Crit Rev Oncog. 1997;8(4):343-58. doi: 10.1615/critrevoncog.v8.i4.40.,"['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Focal Adhesion Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Focal Adhesion Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (PTK2 protein, human)']",,110,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patient suffered from an acute myocardial infarction from which he recovered completely when he was 42 years old. One year prior to his death, he was found to have increase in monocyte count (35.5% of leukocytes) in peripheral blood and splenomegaly; he was admitted to the hematology service of our hospital. He was diagnosed as having chronic myelomonocytic leukemia after bone marrow examination. He was treated with radiation therapy with improvement in splenomegaly. In May of 1995, he had fever, anemia, and thrombocytopenia for which he needed daily blood transfusion. In November of 1995, he had an onset of weakness in his right hand, and neurologic consultation was asked for in November 27, 1995. Neurologic examination revealed a chronically ill japanese man in no acute distress. He was alert and not demented. Higher cerebral functions were intact. Cranial nerve examination revealed right facial paresis of the central type. Motor-wise, he was right hemiparetic. Generalized muscle wasting was noted apparently due to the chronic debilitating disease. Deep tendon reflexes were within normal range in the right upper extremity, but were diminished in other areas. Sensation was intact, and no meningeal signs were noted. Pertinent laboratory findings were as follows: Hb 8 g/dl, RBC 238 x 10(4)/microliter, WBC 2,900/microliter (band 1.0%, seg 18.5%, lym 28.0%, mono 44.0%, Baso 2.5%), Plt 13 x 10(4)/microliter, PT 16.6""/10.9"", APTT 44.7""/35.0"". CSF contained 87 mg/dl of protein, 155 mg/dl of glucose and 2 mononuclear cells/microliter. Bone marrow was slightly hypercellular with mild increase in blast forms. No chromosome abnormality was found. CT and MRI revealed a large mass in the left fronto-parietal region and the meninges showed marked thickening with enhancement after gadolinium-DTPA in MRI. The patient was treated with glycerol and steroid, but the subsequent course was complicated by a seizure, agitation, and pneumonia. He died from respiratory failure on January 13, 1996. The patient was discussed in a neurologic CPC and the chief discussant arrived at the conclusion that the patient had chronic myelomonocytic leukemia with infiltration of leukemic cells into meninges and the parenchyme of the cerebrum. Thickening of the dura was thought to be in part a reaction to the subdural hematoma as well as to leukemic cells along the meninges. Postmortem examination revealed hypercellular bone marrow with increase in monocytic cells (more than 20%). The lungs showed pneumonia with scattered old tuberculous lesions. The heart showed an old myocardial infarction in the posterior wall of the left ventricle. The brain showed an old chronic subdural hematoma in the left fronto-temporal region and a cystic mass lesion in the left frontoparietal region. The mass was hypercellular and most of them were monocytes. The dura mater showed reactive thickening without leukemic cell infiltration. It was concluded that this patient had chronic myelomonocytic leukemia with a formation of leukemic mass in the brain. Pathologists thought that the mass was a hematogenous spread. It is rare for chronic myelomonocytic leukemia to form a mass lesion in the brain.","['Takubo, H', 'Hattori, N', 'Irie, S', 'Mizutani, Y', 'Mori, H', 'Suda, K', 'Kondo, T', 'Oshimi, K', 'Mizuno, Y']","['Takubo H', 'Hattori N', 'Irie S', 'Mizutani Y', 'Mori H', 'Suda K', 'Kondo T', 'Oshimi K', 'Mizuno Y']","['Department of Neurology, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['jpn'],"['Case Reports', 'Clinical Conference', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,No To Shinkei,No to shinkei = Brain and nerve,0413550,IM,,"['Brain/pathology', 'Hemiplegia/etiology/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/complications/*pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Leukocytosis/complications/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Monocytes/pathology']",1998/06/11 00:00,1998/06/11 00:01,['1998/06/11 00:00'],"['1998/06/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/11 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/11 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,No To Shinkei. 1998 May;50(5):481-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this procedure, the leukocytes are distributed in the buffy coat along a density gradient, and the composition of the final product depends on which layer was collected. For the Haemonetics MCS3p Cell Separator, the manufacturer recommended starting the progenitor cell collection at a light transmission of 30%-40% (compared with plasma) and continue it for 40-50 ml. To optimize the use of this machine, the buffy coat it produces was studied in 12 patients by collecting it in fractions of increasing specific weight. Each fraction was analyzed by morphology, immunocytometry, and cell culture. We found that the buffy coat uniformly contains 8 times more leukocytes than blood, but the proportion of each white cell type varies along a gradient. The lymphocyte-predominant lighter layers are richer in CD34+ cells when compared with the granulocyte-predominant denser layers (6-14 times versus 2-4 times more than blood). The majority of CD34+ cells are found at a light transmission of 10%-70% (hematocrit 6-9).

In contrast, human stromal cells, purified from primary confluent layers grown for 3-4 weeks, could not be transduced. However, stromal cells generated after 10-12 days in culture from Stro-1+ and 1B10+ stromal precursors were successfully transduced in the presence of basic fibroblast growth factor. Transduced stromal cells maintained a myofibroblastic phenotype, although with a decreased number of alpha-SM actin-positive microfilaments in MS-5 cells. The ability to support the generation of stroma-adherent colony-forming cells from cocultured cord blood CD34+ cells after 4 weeks in culture was similar before and after transduction and G418 selection.

However, the relatively low titer of retroviral supernatants and the requirement for cell division to ensure integration have meant that transduction efficiency has been low. We have modified a flowthrough approach to cell transduction and have been able consistently to increase gene transfer efficiency into human hematopoietic progenitor cells. We transduced CD34 cells with retroviral vectors encoding a truncated nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR) or neo. Retroviral supernatant was pulled through 0.2-micron polycarbonated membranes, followed by placement of cells on the filter. In the absence of cytokines, the transduction efficiency of CD34 cells with a NGFR vector was increased 3-11-fold over that obtained at an identical MOI in liquid culture to produce 11%-44% transduction. Furthermore, both Thy1+ and Thy1- subsets in a total CD34 population were transduced with similar efficiency, and transduction with a neo vector, as measured by G418 resistance in clonogenic assays, increased 1.5-5-fold. The mechanism by which gene transfer is improved may reflect colocalization of cells and retrovirus. Costaining of cells transduced on the filter with an NGFR retrovirus with both an NGFR antibody and a gp70 antibody that recognizes viral coat protein revealed high-level coexpression. The levels of in vitro gene transfer we obtain are equivalent to those observed when CD34 cells are cocultured in liquid culture with cytokines. However, culture with cytokines may commit CD34 cells to differentiation and has produced disappointingly low levels of subsequent in vivo gene transfer. Gene marking studies using distinguishable retroviral vectors will provide a means of learning whether the effects of flowthrough transduction genuinely enhance the efficiency of gene transfer to human marrow-repopulating cells.","['Hutchings, M', 'Moriwaki, K', 'Dilloo, D', 'Hoffmann, T', 'Kimbrough, S', 'Johnsen, H E', 'Brenner, M K', 'Heslop, H E']","['Hutchings M', 'Moriwaki K', 'Dilloo D', 'Hoffmann T', 'Kimbrough S', 'Johnsen HE', 'Brenner MK', 'Heslop HE']","[""Division of Bone Marrow Transplantation, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Hematother,Journal of hematotherapy,9306048,IM,,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Fetal Blood/cytology', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/immunology', 'Humans', 'Kanamycin Kinase/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor/*biosynthesis', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis', '*Retroviridae', 'Transfection/*methods', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/06/11 00:00,1998/06/11 00:01,['1998/06/11 00:00'],"['1998/06/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/11 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/scd.1.1998.7.217 [doi]'],ppublish,J Hematother. 1998 Jun;7(3):217-24. doi: 10.1089/scd.1.1998.7.217.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.1.95 (Kanamycin Kinase)']",,,"['CA 20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 55703/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P 30CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: In this assay, the gamma T-cell receptor gene rearrangements serve as marker genes. The gene rearrangements are amplified from the diagnostic specimens using a consensus V segment primer and a consensus J segment primer to which the promoter T7 RNA polymerase has been appended. The PCR product from this amplification is transcribed into a radiolabeled RNA probe. The opposite DNA strand is transcribed into test RNA from the PCR product of different staged specimens. The test RNA is hybridized with the probe, and later the digestion with RNase A, Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography are in progress. RESULTS: According to the mechanism, the perfectly matched RNA duplex can prevent the digestion of RNase A, and the presence of the leukemia cells in the test specimen can be determined. Logarithmical dilution experiments with DNA of a cell line from ALL have shown that this assay's sensitivity is at the 10(-5) level.

We used in vivo dimethyl sulfate footprinting by ligation-mediated PCR to detect constitutive in vivo protein-DNA interactions in a BLV-producing cell line, Bat2Cl6. The U3 region and part of the R region of the LTR were footprinted. In addition to the cis-acting elements (three cyclic AMP-responsive elements [CREs] and two AP4 sites) reported by others to be important for Tax-mediated activation of the BLV LTR, we found footprints in regions flanking these elements and in the core promoter region. The importance of these sites for transcriptional activation was studied by site-directed mutagenesis followed by promoter function analysis of the mutants with a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter system. Our data corroborate those of others showing that the CREs are necessary for transactivation of the LTR, and they identify two new functional sites not previously reported by others. We show that the middle region of the BLV U3 contains multiple dual-functioning cis-acting elements which act as either positive or negative regulatory elements depending on the cell type tested.

Thirty novel retroviral sequences were isolated and characterized by sequencing approximately 1 kb of their encoded protease and reverse transcriptase genes. Isolation of novel viruses from so many disparate hosts suggests that retroviruses are likely to be ubiquitous within all but the most basal vertebrate classes and, furthermore, gives a good indication of the overall retroviral diversity within vertebrates. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that viruses clustering with (but not necessarily closely related to) the spumaviruses and murine leukemia viruses are widespread and abundant in vertebrate genomes. In contrast, we were unable to identify any viruses from hosts outside of mammals and birds which grouped with the other five currently recognized retroviral genera: the lentiviruses, human T-cell leukemia-related viruses, avian leukemia virus-related retroviruses, type D retroviruses, and mammalian type B retroviruses. There was also some indication that viruses isolated from individual vertebrate classes tended to cluster together in phylogenetic reconstructions. This implies that the horizontal transmission of at least some retroviruses, between some vertebrate classes, occurs relatively infrequently. It is likely that many of the retroviral sequences described here are distinct enough from those of previously characterized viruses to represent novel retroviral genera.","['Herniou, E', 'Martin, J', 'Miller, K', 'Cook, J', 'Wilkinson, M', 'Tristem, M']","['Herniou E', 'Martin J', 'Miller K', 'Cook J', 'Wilkinson M', 'Tristem M']","['Department of Biology, Imperial College, Ascot, Berkshire SL5 7PY, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phylogeny', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Retroviridae/*classification/genetics', 'Vertebrates/*virology']",1998/06/17 00:00,1998/06/17 00:01,['1998/06/17 00:00'],"['1998/06/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.72.7.5955-5966.1998 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1998 Jul;72(7):5955-66. doi: 10.1128/JVI.72.7.5955-5966.1998.,,,,,,PMC110400,,,,,,"['GENBANK/AJ225207', 'GENBANK/AJ225208', 'GENBANK/AJ225209', 'GENBANK/AJ225210', 'GENBANK/AJ225211', 'GENBANK/AJ225212', 'GENBANK/AJ225213', 'GENBANK/AJ225214', 'GENBANK/AJ225215', 'GENBANK/AJ225216', 'GENBANK/AJ225217', 'GENBANK/AJ225218', 'GENBANK/AJ225219', 'GENBANK/AJ225220', 'GENBANK/AJ225221', 'GENBANK/AJ225222', 'GENBANK/AJ225223', 'GENBANK/AJ225224', 'GENBANK/AJ225225', 'GENBANK/AJ225226', 'GENBANK/AJ225227', 'GENBANK/AJ225228', 'GENBANK/AJ225229', 'GENBANK/AJ225230', 'GENBANK/AJ225231', 'GENBANK/AJ225232', 'GENBANK/AJ225233', 'GENBANK/AJ225234', 'GENBANK/AJ225235', 'GENBANK/AJ225236']",,,

We have previously described a mutant RT of the Moloney murine leukemia virus in which F155 was replaced by valine, and we demonstrated that this substitution allowed the enzyme to incorporate ribonucleotides to form RNA while still retaining its normal ability to incorporate deoxyribonucleotides to form DNA. When introduced into the viral genome, this mutation rendered the virus incapable of replication. Characterization of the mutant virus revealed that the enzyme was still active and able to synthesize minus-strand strong stop DNA and some longer products but failed to make full-length minus-strand DNA. We propose that the failure of the enzyme to complete DNA synthesis in vivo resulted from its ability to incorporate ribonucleotides into the products, which served as inhibitors for DNA synthesis. We also tested seven other amino acid residues for their abilities to substitute for F155 in virus replication; of these, only tyrosine could support virus replication. In an attempt to select for second-site suppressor mutations, the F155V mutant was subjected to random mutagenesis and was used as a parent for the isolation of revertant viruses. Two independent revertants were found to have changed the valine residue at position 155 back to the wild- type phenylalanine. These results suggest that an aromatic ring at this position is important for virus replication.","['Gao, G', 'Goff, S P']","['Gao G', 'Goff SP']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York 10032, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'DNA, Viral/biosynthesis', 'Deoxyribonucleotides/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*physiology', 'Mutation', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*physiology', 'Ribonucleotides/*metabolism', 'Virion/genetics', '*Virus Replication']",1998/06/17 00:00,1998/06/17 00:01,['1998/06/17 00:00'],"['1998/06/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.72.7.5905-5911.1998 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1998 Jul;72(7):5905-11. doi: 10.1128/JVI.72.7.5905-5911.1998.,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Deoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Ribonucleotides)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",,,"['R01 CA030488/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA030488/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 30488/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC110394,,,,,,,,,

Herpesvirus saimiri (HVS) and other lymphotropic herpesviruses code for proteins that are homologous to the cellular antiapoptotic Bcl-2. In this study HVS-Bcl-2 was stably expressed in the human leukemia cell line Jurkat and in the murine T-cell hybridoma DO to assess its antiapoptotic spectrum and to gain further insight into its mode of action. HVS- Bcl-2 prevented apoptosis that occurs as a result of a disturbance of intracellular homeostasis by, for example, DNA damage or menadione, which gives rise to oxygen radicals. In Jurkat cells, HVS-Bcl-2 also inhibited apoptosis mediated by the death receptor CD95. In DO cells, HVS-Bcl-2 did not interfere with CD95-mediated apoptosis but blocked dexamethasone-induced cell death. Mitochondrial damage is a central coordinating event in apoptosis induced by different stimuli. To assess the integrity of mitochondria, we used rhodamine 123, which is released upon disturbance of the mitochondrial membrane potential, and determined the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol. Both signs of mitochondrial damage were prevented by HVS-Bcl-2. This viral protein also inhibited the generation of caspase-3-like DEVDase activity and blocked the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, a natural substrate of caspase-3-like proteases. In conclusion, HVS-Bcl-2 protects against a great variety of apoptotic stimuli, stabilizes mitochondria, and acts upstream of the generation of caspase-3-like activity.","['Derfuss, T', 'Fickenscher, H', 'Kraft, M S', 'Henning, G', 'Lengenfelder, D', 'Fleckenstein, B', 'Meinl, E']","['Derfuss T', 'Fickenscher H', 'Kraft MS', 'Henning G', 'Lengenfelder D', 'Fleckenstein B', 'Meinl E']","['Institut fur Klinische und Molekulare Virologie, University of Erlangen-Nurnberg, D-91054 Erlangen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3', '*Caspases', 'Cell Line', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Free Radicals', 'Herpesvirus 2, Saimiriine/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects', 'Phosphatidylserines/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*pharmacology', 'Serine Proteinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Viral Proteins/*pharmacology', 'fas Receptor/physiology']",1998/06/17 00:00,1998/06/17 00:01,['1998/06/17 00:00'],"['1998/06/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.72.7.5897-5904.1998 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1998 Jul;72(7):5897-904. doi: 10.1128/JVI.72.7.5897-5904.1998.,"['0 (Free Radicals)', '0 (Phosphatidylserines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Serine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)']",,,,,PMC110393,,,,,,,,,

It has served as a prototype nonpathogenic or weakly pathogenic reference virus for studies of closely related potent lymphomagenic viruses such as the T-lymphomagenic SL3-3. We here report that Akv and an Akv mutant (Akv1-99) with only one copy of the 99-bp transcriptional enhancer induce malignant lymphomas with nearly 100% incidence and mean latency periods of 12 months after injection into newborn NMRI mice. Molecular analysis of tumor DNA showed that the majority of the tumors were of the B-cell type. Sequence analysis of proviral transcriptional enhancers in DNA of B-cell lymphomas revealed conservation of the enhancer sequence, as well as a lack of sequence duplications of the Akv1-99 variant, while the repeat copy number in Akv was subject to fluctuations. In support of a B-cell specificity of the Akv enhancer, a murine plasmacytoma cell line was found to sustain three- to fivefold-higher transient transcriptional activity upon the Akv and Akv1-99 enhancers than upon the enhancer of the T-lymphomagenic SL3-3 MuLV. Thus, the overall picture is that Akv MuLV possesses a B- lymphomagenic potential and that the second copy of the 99-bp sequence seems to be of minor importance for this potential. However, in one animal the lymphomas induced by Akv1-99 were of the T-cell type. Among the 24 tumors analyzed only this one harbored a clonal proviral integration in the c-myc locus. This provirus had undergone a duplication of a 113-bp sequence of the enhancer region, partly overlapping with the 99-bp repeat of Akv, as well as a few single nucleotide alterations within and outside the repeats. Taken together with previous studies, our results suggest that T- versus B-lymphomagenic specificity of the enhancer is governed by more than one nucleotide difference and that alterations in binding sites for transcription factors of the AML1 and nuclear-factor-1 families may contribute to this specificity.","['Lovmand, J', 'Sorensen, A B', 'Schmidt, J', 'Ostergaard, M', 'Luz, A', 'Pedersen, F S']","['Lovmand J', 'Sorensen AB', 'Schmidt J', 'Ostergaard M', 'Luz A', 'Pedersen FS']","['Department of Molecular and Structural Biology, University of Aarhus, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Genes, myc', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*etiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Point Mutation', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Virus Integration']",1998/06/17 00:00,1998/06/17 00:01,['1998/06/17 00:00'],"['1998/06/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.72.7.5745-5756.1998 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1998 Jul;72(7):5745-56. doi: 10.1128/JVI.72.7.5745-5756.1998.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",,,,,PMC110375,,,,,,,,,

For murine leukemia viruses, an important determinant of neuroinvasiveness is the virus-encoded protein glycosylated Gag, the function of which in the virus life cycle is not known. While this protein is dispensable for virus replication, mutations which prevent its expression slow the spread of virus in vivo and restrict virus dissemination to the brain. To further explore the function of this protein, we compared two viruses, CasFrKP (KP) and CasFrKP41 (KP41), which differ dramatically in neurovirulence. KP expresses high early viremia titers, is neuroinvasive, and induces clinical neurologic disease in 100% of neonatally inoculated mice, with an incubation period of 18 to 23 days. In contrast, KP41 expresses early viremia titers 100- fold lower than those of KP, exhibits attenuated neuroinvasiveness, and induces clinical neurologic disease infrequently, with a relatively long incubation period. The genomes of these two viruses differ by only 10 nucleotides, resulting in differences at five residues, all located within the N-terminal cytoplasmic tail of glycosylated Gag. In this study, using KP as the parental virus, we systematically mutated each of the five amino acid residues to those of KP41 and found that substitution mutation of two membrane-proximal residues, E53 and L56, to K and P, respectively produced the greatest effect on early viremia kinetics and neurovirulence. These mutations disrupted the KP sequence E53FLL56, the leucine dipeptide of which suggests the possibility that it may represent a sorting signal for glycosylated Gag. Supporting this idea was the finding that alteration of this sequence motif increased the level of cell surface expression of the protein, which suggests that analysis of the intracellular trafficking of glycosylated Gag may provide further clues to its function.","['Fujisawa, R', 'McAtee, F J', 'Wehrly, K', 'Portis, J L']","['Fujisawa R', 'McAtee FJ', 'Wehrly K', 'Portis JL']","['Laboratory of Persistent Viral Diseases, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Hamilton, Montana 59840, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Brain/*virology', 'Cytoplasm/chemistry', 'Gene Products, gag/*chemistry', 'Glycosylation', 'Leucine', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/chemistry/*pathogenicity', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Spleen/virology', 'Viremia/virology', 'Virulence']",1998/06/17 00:00,1998/06/17 00:01,['1998/06/17 00:00'],"['1998/06/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.72.7.5619-5625.1998 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1998 Jul;72(7):5619-25. doi: 10.1128/JVI.72.7.5619-5625.1998.,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', 'GMW67QNF9C (Leucine)']",,,['69607/PHS HHS/United States'],,PMC110223,,,,,,,,,

Methylation interference analysis with different hematopoietic nuclear extracts showed the importance of the G residues in these GATA sites, and supershift assays clearly identified the binding factors as GATA-1, GATA-2, and GATA-3.

Thus, the availability and relative abundance of the various members of the GATA family of transcription factors in a given cell type could influence the transcriptional tissue specificity of murine leukemia viruses and hence their disease specificity.","['Barat, C', 'Rassart, E']","['Barat C', 'Rassart E']","['Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire, Departement de Sciences Biologiques, Universite du Quebec a Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3C 3P8.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor', 'GATA3 Transcription Factor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', '*Transcriptional Activation']",1998/06/17 00:00,1998/06/17 00:01,['1998/06/17 00:00'],"['1998/06/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.72.7.5579-5588.1998 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1998 Jul;72(7):5579-88. doi: 10.1128/JVI.72.7.5579-5588.1998.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA2 protein, human)', '0 (GATA3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA3 protein, human)', '0 (Gata1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Gata2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Gata3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,,PMC110213,,,,,,,,,

The virus-encoded transactivator, Tax, is necessary for efficient transcription from the BLV promoter, although it is not present during the early stages of infection. Therefore, sequences that control Tax-independent transcription must play an important role in the initiation of viral gene expression. This study demonstrates that the R-U5 sequence of BLV stimulates Tax-independent reporter gene expression directed by the BLV promoter. R-U5 was also stimulatory when inserted immediately downstream from the transcription initiation site of a heterologous promoter. Progressive deletion analysis of this region revealed that a 46-bp element corresponding to the 5' half of U5 is principally responsible for the stimulation. This element exhibited enhancer activity when inserted upstream or downstream from the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter. This enhancer contains a binding site for the interferon regulatory factors IRF-1 and IRF-2. A 3-bp mutation that destroys the IRF recognition site caused a twofold decrease in Tax-independent BLV long terminal repeat-driven gene expression. These observations suggest that the IRF binding site in the U5 region of BLV plays a role in the initiation of virus replication.","['Kiermer, V', 'Van Lint, C', 'Briclet, D', 'Vanhulle, C', 'Kettmann, R', 'Verdin, E', 'Burny, A', 'Droogmans, L']","['Kiermer V', 'Van Lint C', 'Briclet D', 'Vanhulle C', 'Kettmann R', 'Verdin E', 'Burny A', 'Droogmans L']","['Department of Molecular Biology, University of Brussels, B1640 Rhode-Saint-Genese, Belgium. vkiermer@dbm.ulb.ac.be']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cattle', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/*physiology', 'Interferon Regulatory Factor-1', 'Interferon Regulatory Factor-2', 'Interferon-alpha/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*genetics', 'Phosphoproteins/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', '*Repressor Proteins', '*Transcription Factors']",1998/06/17 00:00,1998/06/17 00:01,['1998/06/17 00:00'],"['1998/06/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.72.7.5526-5534.1998 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1998 Jul;72(7):5526-34. doi: 10.1128/JVI.72.7.5526-5534.1998.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factor-1)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factor-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,,PMC110197,,,,,,,,,

Although the SNV packaging signal (E) and MLV packaging signal (Psi) have little sequence homology, similar double-hairpin RNA structures were predicted and supported by experimental evidence. To test whether SNV RNA can be packaged by MLV proteins, we modified an SNV vector to be expressed in an MLV-based murine helper cell line. Surprisingly, we found that MLV proteins could not support the replication of SNV vectors. The decrease in titer was approximately 2,000- to 20,000-fold in one round of retroviral replication. RNA analysis revealed that SNV RNA was not efficiently packaged by MLV proteins. RNA hybridization of the cellular and viral RNAs indicated that SNV RNA was packaged at least 25-fold less efficiently than MLV RNA, which was the sensitivity limit of the hybridization assay. The contrast between the MLV and SNV packaging specificity is striking. SNV proteins can recognize both SNV E and MLV Psi, but MLV can recognize only MLV Psi.

SU binds to the viral receptor and is thought to trigger conformational changes in the associated TM protein that ultimately lead to the fusion of viral and host cell membranes. For Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMuLV), the envelope protein probably exists as a trimer. We have previously demonstrated that the coexpression of envelope proteins that are individually defective in either the SU or TM subunits can lead to functional complementation (Y. Zhao et al., J. Virol. 71:6967-6972, 1997). We have now extended these studies to investigate the abilities of a panel of fusion-defective TM mutants to complement each other. This analysis identified distinct complementation groups within TM, with implications for interactions between different regions of TM in the fusion process. In viral particles, the C-terminal 16 amino acids of the MoMuLV TM (the R peptide) are cleaved by the viral protease, resulting in an increased fusogenicity of the envelope protein. We have examined the consequences of R peptide cleavage for the different TM fusion mutants and have found that this enhancement of fusogenicity can only occur in cis to certain of the TM mutants. These results suggest that R peptide cleavage enhances the fusogenicity of the envelope protein by influencing the interaction of two distinct regions in the TM ectodomain.","['Zhao, Y', 'Zhu, L', 'Benedict, C A', 'Chen, D', 'Anderson, W F', 'Cannon, P M']","['Zhao Y', 'Zhu L', 'Benedict CA', 'Chen D', 'Anderson WF', 'Cannon PM']","['Gene Therapy Laboratories, Norris Cancer Center, University of Southern California School of Medicine, Los Angeles, California 90033, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,,"['3T3 Cells', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*chemistry', 'Mutation', 'Retroviridae Proteins/*chemistry/physiology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*chemistry', 'Viral Fusion Proteins/physiology']",1998/06/17 00:00,1998/06/17 00:01,['1998/06/17 00:00'],"['1998/06/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.72.7.5392-5398.1998 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1998 Jul;72(7):5392-8. doi: 10.1128/JVI.72.7.5392-5398.1998.,"['0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Fusion Proteins)']",,,"['P01 CA059318/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA59318/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC110168,,,,,,,,,

We have investigated the role of the PRR in the function of murine leukemia virus (MuLV) envelope protein. In the MuLVs, the PRR contains a highly conserved N-terminal sequence and a hypervariable C-terminal sequence. Despite this variability, the amphotropic PRR could functionally substitute for the ecotropic PRR. The hypervariable region of the PRR was not absolutely required for envelope protein function. However, truncations in this region resulted in decreased levels of both the SU and TM proteins in viral particles and increased amounts of the uncleaved precursor protein, Pr85. In contrast, the N-terminal conserved region was essential for viral infectivity. Deletion of this region prevented the stable incorporation of envelope proteins into viral particles in spite of normal envelope protein processing, wild-type levels of cell surface expression, and a wild-type ability to induce syncytia in an XC cell cocultivation assay. However, higher levels of the SU protein were shed into the supernatant, suggesting a defect in SU-TM interactions. Our data are most consistent with a role for the PRR in stabilizing the overall structure of the protein, thereby affecting the proper processing of Pr85, SU-TM interactions, and the stable incorporation of envelope proteins into viral particles. In addition, we have demonstrated that the PRR can tolerate the insertion of a peptide-binding domain, making this a potentially useful site for constructing targetable retroviral vectors.","['Weimin Wu, B', 'Cannon, P M', 'Gordon, E M', 'Hall, F L', 'Anderson, W F']","['Weimin Wu B', 'Cannon PM', 'Gordon EM', 'Hall FL', 'Anderson WF']","['Gene Therapy Laboratories, Norris Cancer Center, University of Southern California School of Medicine, Los Angeles, California 90033, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,,"['3T3 Cells', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Collagen/metabolism', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*chemistry', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptides/*chemistry', 'Proline-Rich Protein Domains', 'Temperature', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*chemistry']",1998/06/17 00:00,1998/06/17 00:01,['1998/06/17 00:00'],"['1998/06/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.72.7.5383-5391.1998 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1998 Jul;72(7):5383-91. doi: 10.1128/JVI.72.7.5383-5391.1998.,"['0 (Peptides)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)']",,,"['P01 CA059318/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA59318-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC110165,,,,,,,,,

Whereas in situ hybridization confirmed the expression of CD23 mRNA in eosinophils, RT-PCR analysis of human eosinophil cDNA derived from a cDNA library revealed the presence of CD23, totally homologous with the CD23 a and b sequences. Eosinophils from different hypereosinophilic patients as well as the eosinophilic leukemia cell line EoL-3, analyzed by RT-PCR, expressed both CD23 a and b isoforms. In situ RT-PCR confirmed that mRNA corresponding to CD23 a and b isoforms was detected in human eosinophils. Finally, immunocytochemistry allowed us to show a differential expression of Fc epsilonRII/CD23 and Fc epsilonRI by subpopulations of eosinophils, with a preferential expression of Fc epsilonRII/CD23 in the hypodense population.

As a member of the I kappaB family, BCL3 plays a role in the immune response by interactions with the NF-kappaB family of transcription factors. In order to study the role of BCL3 overexpression in lymphoid malignancies, we generated five lines of E mu-BCL3 transgenic mice. Transgenic animals develop normally but show splenomegaly and an accumulation of mature B cells in lymph nodes, bone marrow and peritoneal cavity. A hyperresponsive immune system is suggested by the follicular hyperplasia and plasmacytosis in lymph nodes of unimmunized animals, increased incidence of antibodies to self-antigens, and a heightened response to cross-linking of surface IgM. Statistically significant decreases in serum IgM and IgG3, but an increase in IgG1 and IgA were also observed. No lymphoid neoplasms have been identified in transgenic animals. The expansion of B cells in vivo is consistent with the overexpression of BCL3 as being one step in the multi-step process of leukemogenesis. The phenotype also suggests that BCL3 plays a part in B cell proliferation and isotype switching.","['Ong, S T', 'Hackbarth, M L', 'Degenstein, L C', 'Baunoch, D A', 'Anastasi, J', 'McKeithan, T W']","['Ong ST', 'Hackbarth ML', 'Degenstein LC', 'Baunoch DA', 'Anastasi J', 'McKeithan TW']","['University of Chicago, Department of Medicine, Illinois 60637, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis', 'Autoantibodies/biosynthesis', 'B-Cell Lymphoma 3 Protein', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'B7-2 Antigen', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'DNA/immunology', 'Germinal Center', 'Immunoglobulin Isotypes/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Experimental/etiology', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Lymphatic Diseases', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*genetics', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'NF-kappa B/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', '*Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr', 'Spleen/pathology', 'Splenomegaly', 'Transcription Factors']",1998/06/10 00:00,1998/06/10 00:01,['1998/06/10 00:00'],"['1998/06/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1201771 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1998 May 7;16(18):2333-43. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1201771.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (B-Cell Lymphoma 3 Protein)', '0 (B7-2 Antigen)', '0 (Bcl3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cd86 protein, mouse)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Isotypes)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Bcr protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",,,"['CA55356/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30CA14599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

It has also been reported that myeloma cells express Fas antigen, and in some of these cells apoptosis was induced by treatment with anti-Fas monoclonal antibody (mAb). In the present study, we demonstrated that ATRA increased Fas expression in the human myeloma cell line, U266B1. We observed that both apoptosis induction and growth inhibition were enhanced in cells exposed to a combination of anti-Fas mAb and ATRA compared with cells exposed to either treatment alone. We also examined whether ATRA modulated bcl-2, an anti-apoptosis protein, in U266B1 cells. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that the mean fluorescence intensity of bcl-2 protein was slightly decreased in cells treated with ATRA. These results indicate that in U266B1 cells, combined treatment with anti-Fas mAb and ATRA enhances the induction of apoptosis by modulating the expression of Fas and bcl-2 by ATRA.","['Okamura, T', 'Masuda, M', 'Arai, Y', 'Ishida, C', 'Shudou, K', 'Mizoguchi, H']","['Okamura T', 'Masuda M', 'Arai Y', 'Ishida C', 'Shudou K', 'Mizoguchi H']","[""Department of Hematology, Tokyo Women's Medical College, Japan.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/immunology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Keratolytic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Multiple Myeloma/*immunology/*pathology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fas Receptor/*immunology']",1998/06/10 00:00,1998/06/10 00:01,['1998/06/10 00:00'],"['1998/06/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/10 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1998 Jun;26(6):501-6.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Keratolytic Agents)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These substances are prototypes of a new class of prodrugs for activated oxazaphosphorines. They were developed according to our hypothesis on the mechanism of action of oxazaphosphorine cytostatics. According to this hypothesis, toxicity and canceroselectivity are the results of phosphoramide mustard (PAM) release from 4-OH-CP catalysed by two classes of phosphodiesterase. 4-OH-CP toxicity results (a) from oxazaphosphorine-specific toxicity due to reactivity of the hemiaminal group with thiol groups of membrane proteins and (b) from PAM release catalysed by ubiquitous phosphodiesterases present in blood and tissues. Specific cytotoxicity suitable for antitumour therapy is based on specific PAM release in the vicinity of the target molecule DNA by the exonuclease subsites of DNA polymerases delta and epsilon. To unfold this specific core, which, we assume, improves efficacy in cancer treatment, low, long-lasting concentrations of OH-CP have to be guaranteed beneath the affinity range of the ubiquitous phosphodiesterase. This goal is facilitated by the rapid transfer of 4-OH-CP released from the perhyrothiazine derivative NSC 612567 to protein SH groups, as shown by protein-binding studies. Half-lives of hydrolysis and dissociation constants of the thiazolidine and perhydrothiazine derivatives, in which the reactivity of the hemiaminal group is inactivated by inclusion into the thiazolidine or perhydrothiazine ring, were determined to be 23 h and 6.0 x 10(-6) mol/l for NSC 613060 and 1.5 h and 1.1 x 10(-4) mol/l for NSC 312567. Accordingly the compounds guarantee low but long-lasting steady-state concentrations of 4-OH-CP. The acute toxicity determined in mice was 2400 mg/kg for NSC 613060 and 1900 mg/kg for NSC 612567. Except for a 30% decrease in leucocytes, daily i.p. injections of 260 mg/kg NSC 612567 (15% of LD50) were tolerated without signs of toxicity over a period of 4 weeks. In contrast, equitoxic doses of cyclophosphamide caused severe signs of toxicity, only five daily applications were tolerated. In mice treated repeatedly with NSC 613060, oxazaphosphorine toxicity was overlapped by thiazolidine toxicity. Scheduled activity tests in mice bearing P815 ascites tumour showed optimal therapeutic response when mice were treated daily. Repeated applications of 4% LD50 of NSC 613060 and 13% LD50 of NSC 612567 prevented tumour growth in mice with advanced, P388 lymphomas, implanted subcutaneously, without signs of overall toxicity to the host.","['Voelcker, G', 'Bielicki, L', 'Hohorst, H J']","['Voelcker G', 'Bielicki L', 'Hohorst HJ']","['Zentrum der Biologischen Chemie der Johann Wolfgang, Goethe-Universitat, Franfurt am Main, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Cyclophosphamide/analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/toxicity', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Female', 'Injections, Intraperitoneal', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mast-Cell Sarcoma/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Nitrogen Mustard Compounds/chemistry/therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'Prodrugs/*toxicity', 'Protein Binding', 'Thiazines/chemistry/therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'Thiazoles/chemistry/therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'Thiazolidines', 'Tissue Distribution']",1997/01/01 00:00,1998/06/10 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/10 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s004320050116 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 1997;123(11-12):623-31. doi: 10.1007/s004320050116.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Nitrogen Mustard Compounds)', '0 (Prodrugs)', '0 (Thiazines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '0 (Thiazolidines)', '111606-88-3 (NSC 612567)', '115952-49-3 (NSC 613060)', '1XBF4E50HS (4-hydroxycyclophosphamide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Growth factor treatment included single agent therapy with G-CSF (three patients), GM-CSF (one patient), or simultaneous therapy with G-CSF and GM-CSF (two patients). In two patients, there was a dramatic increase in blasts in the peripheral blood (39% and 20%), whereas four had substantial increases in blasts on the aspirate smear (8%-41%). One patient had a medium-sized blast cluster shown on the core biopsy specimen. The blasts decreased after removal of growth factor in all patients.

These observations make a striking contrast with other previous reports on the biological activities of G-CSF. In the present study, in order to further clarify the G-CSF-induced apoptosis of C2M cells, we studied the effects of G-CSF on the cell cycle as well as the molecular events involving D-type cyclines and their cyclin-dependent kinases (cdk) in G-CSF-treated C2M cells. Cell cycle analysis revealed that G-CSF treatment of C2M cells resulted in accelerated entry from the first gap (G1) phase into the DNA synthesis (S) phase. Western blotting disclosed that G-CSF treatment resulted in down-regulation of cyclin D2 and cdk2 and up-regulation of cyclin D1 and cdk4. The reciprocal relationship between the up-regulation of cyclin D1 and down-regulation of cyclin D2 was closely associated with accelerated entry into S phase and subsequent apoptosis of C2M cells. These results suggest that G-CSF-induced apoptosis of C2M cells might be ascribed to imbalanced cell cycle progression due to deregulated expression of D-type cyclins and their cdks.","['Kohno, T', 'Yoshida, S', 'Bessho, M']","['Kohno T', 'Yoshida S', 'Bessho M']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Saitama Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'CHO Cells/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cricetinae', 'Cyclin D1/*biosynthesis/physiology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/biosynthesis', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'S Phase/drug effects/*physiology', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects/physiology']",1998/06/10 00:00,1998/06/10 00:01,['1998/06/10 00:00'],"['1998/06/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/10 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(97)00161-6 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(97)00161-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1998 Mar;22(3):257-63. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(97)00161-6.,"['136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We designed flow cytometric assays to measure cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples treated in vitro with relevant therapeutic agents so as to functionally characterize checkpoints in these samples and to ask if checkpoint abnormalities are common in AML and contribute to therapeutic failures. We show here that cell cycle responses to daunomycin (DNR), cytosine arabinoside (ARA-C) and gamma irradiation (RAD) were reproducibly treatment agent- and dose-dependent and distinct in different myeloid cell lines. DNR treatments differentially induced cell accumulations in the gap 2 and mitosis (G2/M) phases of the cell cycle and/or in the gap 1 (G1) phase, as did RAD, while ARA-C induced accumulations in the DNA synthesis (S) phase or in the G1 phase. Flow cytometric gates were devised to exclude lymphocytes and mature neutrophils in analyses of primary myeloid cell samples. Cell subsets in bone marrow samples from normal donors were thus enriched for myeloid constituents and used as normal myeloid cell controls. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) immunostaining was used to further identify actively dividing cell subpopulations in primary cell samples. AML samples were similarly analyzed and the majority showed lower DNA synthesis cell cycle phase (S) fractions and lower PCNA-positive fractions than normal myeloid cells, suggesting that AMLs are generally less proliferative in these culture conditions. Exceptional AML samples with high S phase fractions had cytogenetic abnormalities associated with poor prognosis. Most AML samples mounted weak cell cycle responses relative to normal myeloid cells, while a minority showed robust, agent-specific cell cycle arrests. This non-responsiveness was not simply associated with lower cycling indices-neither the response patterns nor the degrees of response were correlated with untreated S phase fractions or with PCNA-positive fractions. Cell cycle responses were also not associated with clinical parameters including patient age, FAB class, or white blood cell count, nor with immunophenotypic features including CD34 status, nor with specific cytogenetic markers. This suggests that functional cell cycle response assays could provide unique diagnostic information in AML. These assays might also have prognostic value as ARA-C induced G1 arrests and DNR-specific G2/M arrests tended to be associated with failure to achieve clinical remission. In addition, G1 arrests after ARA-C and G2/M accumulations after DNR treatments tended to be more robust in samples that had previously been shown to be more highly immunopositive for bcl-2 expression. This data suggests that the association of bcl-2 expression with particular cell cycle responses to therapeutic agents may contribute to the association of bcl-2 with poor clinical responses in AML. These data provide the basis for further laboratory studies aimed at examining specific cell cycle arrests as mechanisms of therapeutic resistance and prospective studies aimed at rigorously assessing the prognostic utility of in vitro assays of checkpoint function.","['Banker, D E', 'Groudine, M', 'Willman, C L', 'Norwood, T', 'Appelbaum, F R']","['Banker DE', 'Groudine M', 'Willman CL', 'Norwood T', 'Appelbaum FR']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/*pathology/radiotherapy', 'Mutation', 'Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen/analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",1998/06/10 00:00,1998/06/10 00:01,['1998/06/10 00:00'],"['1998/06/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/10 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(97)00174-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(97)00174-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1998 Mar;22(3):221-39. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(97)00174-4.,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,"['CA 18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 18105/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32102/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

In the present studies, by using video enhancement contrast (VEC) microscopy, we dynamically analyzed changes in intracellular calcium distribution in a single HL-60 cell over the period from the initiation of apoptosis to the obvious appearance of chromatin condensation. The results from this paper demonstrated the striking distinction of intracellular calcium distribution at different time points after treatment with HT. Before treatment in normal HL-60 cells the highest [Ca2+]i accumulation was observed in the peri-nuclear area and the lowest was observed in the nucleus; after treatment with 1 microg/ml HT for 30 min intracellular calcium diffused all over the cell compartments, while intranuclear calcium increased comparatively and significantly. The phenomenon of intranuclear calcium accumulation was further confirmed by using laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM).

A correlation between mdm2-P2 transcript levels and p53 gene status was observed in all cell lines examined. Primary malignant cells from 10 leukemic patients were also analysed for both mdm2-P2 levels and p53 gene status. All five patients with detectable mdm2-P2 transcripts possessed wild-type p53 alleles. However, only two of five patients with undetectable mdm2-P2 transcripts possessed mutant p53. mdm2-P2 levels were also determined in primary leukemic cells from 14 additional cases both before and after in vitro exposure to cisplatin. The p53 gene was found to be wild-type in all cases where mdm2-P2 levels were induced by cisplatin. There were four cases where no, or only modest, increases in mdm2-P2 levels were detected after cisplatin exposure. Two of these patients were found to harbor mutant p53 while one other possessed leukemic cells with elevated levels of mdm2 protein.

The role of phosphorylation in their functional activities remains unknown. As a model for the Human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I), Bovine Leukemia Virus (BLV) permits the characterization of viral replication and leukemogenesis in vivo. Here, we show that the BLV Tax protein is phosphorylated on serine residues 106 and 293 both in insect and in mammalian cells. These sites can also be efficiently phosphorylated by the cdc2 and MAP kinases in vitro. Mutation of these residues does not affect the capacity of the Tax protein to function as a transactivator. Indeed, the Tax proteins mutated at one or both serines increase LTR-directed viral transcription at levels similar to those obtained with wild-type Tax in cell culture. Moreover, inhibition of Tax phosphorylation by W7, a calmodulin antagonist, does not alter its transactivation activity. Thus, phosphorylation on serines 106 and 293 is not required for transactivation by Tax. However, simultaneous substitution of both serines into alanine residues destroys the capacity of Tax to cooperate with the Ha-ras oncogene to transform primary rat embryo fibroblasts and induce tumors in nude mice. When the serines were replaced with aspartic acid residues, the oncogenic potential of Tax was maintained indicating that the negative charge rather than the phosphate group itself was required for Tax oncogenicity. Finally, to assess the role of the serine residues in vivo, recombinant viruses which express the Tax mutants were constructed and injected into sheep. It appeared that the mutated proviruses replicate at levels similar to the wild-type virus in vivo. We conclude that Tax phosphorylation is dispensable for transactivation and viral replication in vivo but is required for its oncogenic potential in vitro.","['Willems, L', 'Grimonpont, C', 'Kerkhofs, P', 'Capiau, C', 'Gheysen, D', 'Conrath, K', 'Roussef, R', 'Mamoun, R', 'Portetelle, D', 'Burny, A', 'Adam, E', 'Lefebvre, L', 'Twizere, J C', 'Heremans, H', 'Kettmann, R']","['Willems L', 'Grimonpont C', 'Kerkhofs P', 'Capiau C', 'Gheysen D', 'Conrath K', 'Roussef R', 'Mamoun R', 'Portetelle D', 'Burny A', 'Adam E', 'Lefebvre L', 'Twizere JC', 'Heremans H', 'Kettmann R']","['Department of Molecular Biology, Faculte Universitaire des Sciences Agronomiques, Gembloux, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,,"['Animals', 'CDC2 Protein Kinase/metabolism', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Viral/*genetics', 'Fibroblasts', 'Gene Products, tax/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*genetics/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Phosphorylation', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Serine/genetics/metabolism', 'Spodoptera', 'Transcriptional Activation/*physiology', 'Virus Replication/genetics']",1998/06/10 00:00,1998/06/10 00:01,['1998/06/10 00:00'],"['1998/06/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1201765 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1998 Apr 30;16(17):2165-76. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1201765.,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2 Protein Kinase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The apoptosis- and necrosis-inducing potential of the anticancer drugs cladribine (CDA), cytarabine (ARA-C), cisplatin (CDDP), and 5-fluorouracil (5FU) were studied in vitro in the human leukemia cell lines HSB2 and Jurkat using a flow-cytometry assay that permits the simultaneous quantification of vital, apoptotic, and necrotic cells by double-staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled Annexin-V and propidium iodide. The results were fit to different multicompartmental models and the sensitivity of the cell lines to apoptosis and necrosis was estimated. RESULTS: A time- and dose-dependent decrease in vital cells as well as an increase in apoptotic and necrotic cells was observed in HSB2 cells upon continuous incubation with 10(-5)-10(-7) MCDA, 10(-5)-10(-8) MARA-C, 5 x10(-5)-5 x 10(-6) M CDDP, and 10(-4)-10(-5) M 5FU, whereas no effect was observed relative to controls upon incubation with 10(-8)-10(-9) M CDA, 10(-9) M ARA-C, 10(-7)-10(-8) M CDDP, or 10(-6)-10(-9) M 5FU. In Jurkat cells, apoptosis- and necrosis-inducing effects were observed at 10(-4)-5 x 10(-6) M CDA, 10(-5)-10(-7) M ARA-C, 5 x 10(-5)-5 x 10(-6) M CDDP, and 10(-4)-10(-5) M 5FU. In all experiments, apoptotic cells reached a peak after 6-48 h of drug exposure. These data were best fit by a model in which vital cells became irreversibly apoptotic by a direct pathway and necrotic by an irreversible indirect pathway following the apoptotic state (mean R = 0.9876; range 0.9510-0.9993; mean modified Akaike's information criterion 3.88; range 1.86-5.82) and the rate constants of either pathway (Kva and Kan, respectively) were assessed. The sensitivity of both cell lines to apoptosis and necrosis (expressed as EC50 and Emax values) induced by the anticancer drugs could be calculated from the sigmoidal concentration-effect curves. Furthermore, it was shown that drug treatment (10(-6) M CDA or 10(-6) M ARA-C) potentiated the apoptosis-inducing effects of irradiation (6 Gy) but not its necrosis-inducing potential. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that CDA, ARA-C, CDDP, and 5FU possess concentration-dependent apoptosis-inducing potential in the cell lines studied. The cytotoxic mechanism and cell-killing potential of these drugs is different, which is reflected by different EC50 and Emax values. Furthermore, a method for pharmacodynamic modeling is introduced that permits a quantitative approach for the assessment of the sensitivity of tumor cells to anticancer drugs and combined treatments.","['Guchelaar, H J', 'Vermes, I', 'Koopmans, R P', 'Reutelingsperger, C P', 'Haanen, C']","['Guchelaar HJ', 'Vermes I', 'Koopmans RP', 'Reutelingsperger CP', 'Haanen C']","['Department of Pharmacy, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

This study was performed to investigate whether or not FK317, a new benzmethoxy derivative of FK973, retains the antitumor activity of FK973 without the side effect of VLS. METHODS: VLS was evaluated by the volume of pleural effusion in rats. Cytotoxic activities were determined by a tetrazolium-based colorimetric assay (MTT assay) against murine (B16, P388) and human (HeLa S3, KB) tumor cell lines. Antitumor activities against murine ascitic leukemia (P388, L1210), murine solid tumors (reticulum cell sarcoma M5076, Colon 38 carcinoma) and human xenografts (mammary carcinoma MX-1, lung carcinoma LX-1) were examined. RESULTS: FK973 (1.8 mg/kg) given i.v. to rats induced pleural effusion, one of the elements of VLS, 36 days after the first dosing, but did not 28 days after dosing. This model reflects clinical VLS delayed-type effusion with high protein concentrations. In contrast, FK317 (1.0-3.2 mg/kg) did not induce pleural effusion at all. FK317 had stronger cytotoxic effects against in vitro cultured B16, P388, HeLa S3 and KB tumor cell lines, and in in vivo experiments, FK317 showed equivalent antitumor activity against P388, M5076 and MX-1, and more potent antitumor activity against L1210, Colon 38 and LX-1 compared with FK973. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that FK317 retains the antitumor activity of FK973 and does not induce VLS, and FK317 is a drug with high clinical potential for treating tumors in humans.","['Naoe, Y', 'Inami, M', 'Matsumoto, S', 'Nishigaki, F', 'Tsujimoto, S', 'Kawamura, I', 'Miyayasu, K', 'Manda, T', 'Shimomura, K']","['Naoe Y', 'Inami M', 'Matsumoto S', 'Nishigaki F', 'Tsujimoto S', 'Kawamura I', 'Miyayasu K', 'Manda T', 'Shimomura K']","['Department of Pharmacology, Pharmacological Research Laboratories, Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Capillary Leak Syndrome/*chemically induced', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Female', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Mitomycin/adverse effects/pharmacology', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Oxazines/*adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Pleural Effusion/chemically induced', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/06/10 00:00,1998/06/10 00:01,['1998/06/10 00:00'],"['1998/06/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002800050781 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1998;42(1):31-6. doi: 10.1007/s002800050781.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Oxazines)', '114580-45-9 (FK 973)', '50SG953SK6 (Mitomycin)', '85J6JHT779 (FK 317 dihydrobenzoxazine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The frequency and type of s-AML and s-MDS are reviewed for patients treated with standard and/or high-dose chemotherapy for Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), and breast or testicular cancer. Patients treated for Hodgkin's disease, have a 20- to 40-fold increased risk of developing s-AML, this risk increasing with the number of mechlorethamine-containing cycles given as well as following splenectomy and in patients more than 40-50 years of age. Generally, patients with NHL, breast or testicular cancer experience a lower, 2- to 15-fold, risk of developing s-AML. Epipodophyllotoxins appear to be the most important factor for s-AML in patients treated for testicular cancer. Doses of 2g/m2 or more are associated with an increased risk of s-AML and, with these high doses, a cumulative incidence of 2% 3% at 5 years is observed. Adjuvant cyclophosphomide, methobrexate, 5-Fu therapy in breast cancer patients does not appear to increase risk significantly as compared to the general population. The extent of the leukemogenic potential of anthracyclines remains to be defined. NHL patients receiving mechlorethamine, prednimustine or long-term maintenance therapy are also at an increased risk of s-AML. A considerably increased risk of developing AML, with a cumulative incidence of approximately 9% at 5 years, has been observed following allogenic bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) or peripheral stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) in patients with NHL. It is likely that the increased risk of s-AML/s-MDS following high-dose chemotherapy with ABMT or PBSCT is related to prior treatment rather than to high-dose chemotherapy itself. However, this issue remains to be conclusively addressed. s-AML or s-MDS rarely develops after allogenic bone marrow transplantation. s-AML and s-MDS increasingly represent a problem in modern cancer therapy because of better treatment strategies, which result in improved cure rates.

Cytogenetic studies are hindered by the low in vitro mitotic activity of the tumor cells and the limited resolution of chromosome banding. Molecular genetic analyses are hampered by nonclonal cells contained in the specimens and by the limited knowledge of candidate genes involved. As a complement to cytogenetic and molecular genetic techniques, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) has proven powerful in the molecular cytogenetic analysis of B-CLL. FISH allows the detection of aberrations such as trisomies, deletions, and translocation breakpoints on the single cell level in dividing as well as non-dividing cells without the prerequisite of detailed physical maps or knowledge of involved genes. As detected by the interphase cytogenetic FISH approach, the most common chromosome abnormalities of B-CLL are deletions in band 13q14, followed by deletions in 11q22-q23, trisomy 12, deletions in 17p13, and deletions in 6q21. Abnormalities in 17p13 seem to involve the TP53 tumor suppressor gene, but as yet no candidate genes have been identified for the other frequent aberrations. Toward the identification of such genes by positional cloning, FISH can be applied for detailed aberration mapping at the molecular level. Furthermore, the accurate detection of chromosome aberrations in B-CLL by FISH provides a valid basis for the evaluation of their prognostic significance. Inactivation of TP53 in 17p13 and deletions in 11q22-q23 have already been shown to be among the most important independent prognostic factors. Genetic abnormalities may eventually provide biological parameters, allowing a risk assessment for individual patients at the time of diagnosis of this clinically heterogeneous disease.","['Stilgenbauer, S', 'Dohner, K', 'Bentz, M', 'Lichter, P', 'Dohner, H']","['Stilgenbauer S', 'Dohner K', 'Bentz M', 'Lichter P', 'Dohner H']","['Medizinische Klinik and Poliklinik V, University of Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,,"['*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosome Disorders', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*genetics/physiopathology']",1998/06/10 00:00,1998/06/10 00:01,['1998/06/10 00:00'],"['1998/06/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002770050373 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 1998 Mar-Apr;76(3-4):101-10. doi: 10.1007/s002770050373.,,,99,,,,,,,,,,,,

Apoptosis as the mechanism of cell death induced by a new cytotoxic and anticancer agent (N.C.1213) was investigated by morphological and biochemical criteria in human Jurkat T leukemia cells. 2. The effect of N.C.1213 on the survival of Jurkat T, LV-50, H-9, and Molt-3 cells was measured. Jurkat T cells exhibited the highest response, with less than 10% of the cells remaining viable after exposure to 10 microM N.C.1213 for a 24 hr period. All other cell cultures were also affected but to a lesser extent. 3. With the use of a fluorescence microscope, several morphological features characteristic of apoptosis such as condensed chromatin and apoptotic bodies were identified in Jurkat T cells after exposure to N.C.1213 and melphalan. The results indicated that melphalan was more cytotoxic than N.C.1213 as shown by the dye exclusion test. However, N.C.1213 showed a greater apoptotic index than melphalan. The IC50 of N.C.1213 in Jurkat T cells was determined to be 3.5 microM. 4. A DNA ladder (fragmentation of DNA into multimers of approximately 200 base pairs), which is one characteristic feature of apoptosis, was not detected when Jurkat T cells were exposed to N.C.1213.

However, the mechanism by which P-gp confers resistance to a large variety of structurally diverse molecules has remained elusive. In this study, classical multidrug resistant human CEM and K562 tumor cell lines expressing high levels of P-gp were less sensitive to multiple forms of caspase-dependent cell death, including that mediated by cytotoxic drugs and ligation of Fas. The DNA fragmentation and membrane damage inflicted by these stimuli were defined as caspase dependent by various soluble peptide fluoromethylketone caspase inhibitors. Inhibition of P-gp function by the anti-P-gp mAb MRK-16 or verapamil could reverse resistance to these forms of cell death. Inhibition of P-gp function also enhanced drug or Fas-mediated activation of caspase-3 in drug-resistant CEM cells. By contrast, caspase-independent cell death events in the same cells, including those mediated by pore-forming proteins or intact NK cells, were not affected by P-gp expression. These observations suggest that, in addition to effluxing drugs, P-gp may play a specific role in regulating some caspase-dependent apoptotic pathways.","['Smyth, M J', 'Krasovskis, E', 'Sutton, V R', 'Johnstone, R W']","['Smyth MJ', 'Krasovskis E', 'Sutton VR', 'Johnstone RW']","['Cellular Cytotoxicity Laboratory, The Austin Research Institute, Studley Road, Heidelberg, 3084, Victoria, Australia. m.smyth@ari.unimelb.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', '*Apoptosis', 'Caspase 3', '*Caspases', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*metabolism', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/06/17 00:00,1998/06/17 00:01,['1998/06/17 00:00'],"['1998/06/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.95.12.7024 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1998 Jun 9;95(12):7024-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.95.12.7024.,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)']",,,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,PMC22726,,,,,,,,,

A copy of this element has been recovered from a Glycine max genomic library. DNA sequence analysis of two SIRE-1 subclones revealed that SIRE-1 contains a long, uninterrupted, ORF between the 3' end of the pol ORF and the 3' long terminal repeat (LTR), a region that harbors the env gene in retroviral genomes. Conceptual translation of this second ORF produces a 70-kDa protein. Computer analyses of the amino acid sequence predicted patterns of transmembrane domains, alpha-helices, and coiled coils strikingly similar to those found in mammalian retroviral envelope proteins. In addition, a 65-residue, proline-rich domain is characterized by a strong amino acid compositional bias virtually identical to that of the 60-amino acid, proline-rich neutralization domain of the feline leukemia virus surface protein. The assignment of SIRE-1 to the copia/Ty1 family was confirmed by comparison of the conceptual translation of its reverse transcriptase-like domain with those of other retroelements. This finding suggests the presence of a proretrovirus in a plant genome and is the strongest evidence to date for the existence of a retrovirus-like genome closely related to copia/Ty1 retrotransposons.","['Laten, H M', 'Majumdar, A', 'Gaucher, E A']","['Laten HM', 'Majumdar A', 'Gaucher EA']","['Biology Department, Loyola University Chicago, 6525 North Sheridan Road, Chicago, IL 60626, USA. hlaten@orion.it.luc.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cats', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Transposable Elements/*genetics', '*Genome, Plant', '*Genome, Viral', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Soybeans/*genetics', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*genetics']",1998/06/17 00:00,1998/06/17 00:01,['1998/06/17 00:00'],"['1998/06/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.95.12.6897 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1998 Jun 9;95(12):6897-902. doi: 10.1073/pnas.95.12.6897.,"['0 (DNA Transposable Elements)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",,,,,PMC22677,,,,,,"['GENBANK/AF053008', 'GENBANK/U96295']",,,

Molecular clones of HTLV-I are now available and represent a powerful tool to link virus structure to pathogenesis. Present studies to explore in vivo infectivity and pathogenicity of an HTLV-I molecular clone, K30p, have utilized the rabbit as a model system. This clone was administered to neonatal or adult rabbits by several different routes and infectivity and pathogenicity were examined. Detection of antiviral humoral immune responses, presence of provirus in tissue samples, and isolation of virus in cultures of blood lymphocytes were used to establish systemic HTLV-I infection. Intramuscular, but not nervous system, exposure to K30p HTLV-I naked DNA resulted in infection. Conversely, neural exposure to T cells that had been transfected with the K30p HTLV-I DNA consistently resulted in systemic infection. Despite detection of HTLV-I provirus in brain and spinal cord of some infected rabbits, no clinical or neuropathological changes occurred.

We studied the interactions between HCMV and HTLV-I in monocyte-derived macrophages cultured in vitro. We found that coinfection of macrophages with HCMV and HTLV-I significantly enhanced HCMV replication, resulting in release of infectious HCMV from dually infected cells. On the other hand, HCMV inhibited HTLV-I replication in macrophages coinfected with both viruses. Reciprocal interactions between HCMV and HTLV-I were mediated by their trans-acting proteins. Results of transfection studies demonstrated that the tax gene product of HTLV-I alone was capable of upregulating HCMV production. In a transient gene expression assay the immediate-early 2 (IE2) protein of HCMV alone could inhibit HTLV-I replication, whereas the IE1 protein, which had no effect by itself, produced a synergistic inhibitory effect together with the IE2 protein. Results from this study suggest that in vivo double infection of macrophages with HCMV and HTLV-I may contribute to the dissemination of HCMV infection in patients suffering from HTLV-I-associated T cell leukemia-lymphoma.","['Szabo, J', 'Bacsi, A', 'Andirko, I', 'Kiss, J', 'Nemes, J', 'Toth, F D']","['Szabo J', 'Bacsi A', 'Andirko I', 'Kiss J', 'Nemes J', 'Toth FD']","['Institute of Microbiology, University Medical School, Debrecen, Hungary.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses,AIDS research and human retroviruses,8709376,IM,,"['Antigens, Viral/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytomegalovirus/immunology/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/physiology', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/immunology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Macrophages/*virology', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Monocytes/virology', '*Trans-Activators', 'Transfection', '*Viral Envelope Proteins', '*Viral Proteins', 'Virus Replication/*physiology']",1998/06/09 00:00,1998/06/09 00:01,['1998/06/09 00:00'],"['1998/06/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/09 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/aid.1998.14.699 [doi]'],ppublish,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses. 1998 May 20;14(8):699-709. doi: 10.1089/aid.1998.14.699.,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (IE1 protein, cytomegalovirus)', '0 (IE2 protein, Cytomegalovirus)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (UL115 protein, Human herpesvirus 5)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (glycoprotein H, Cytomegalovirus)', '0 (glycoprotein H, Human cytomegalovirus)', '0 (glycoprotein O, cytomegalovirus)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Intravenous injection of irradiated scid mice with human bone marrow, cord blood, or G-CSF cytokine-mobilized peripheral blood mononuclear cells, all rich in human hemopoietic stem cell activity, results in the engraftment of a human hemopoietic system in the murine recipient. This model has been used to identify a pluripotent stem cell, termed ""scid-repopulating cell"" (SRC) that is more primitive than any of the hemopoietic stem cell populations identified using the currently available in vitro methodology. In this review, we describe the development and use of this model system, termed Hu-SRC-SCID, and summarize the discoveries that have resulted from the investigation of human stem cells in this model. Finally, we detail the recent extension of the original Hu-SRC-SCID model system based on the C.B-17-scid mouse as the murine host to the Hu-SRC-NOD-SCID model based on the NOD-scid mouse as the host. The engraftment of human stem cells in the Hu-SRC-NOD-SCID model is enhanced over that observed in the Hu-SRC-SCID model and results in exceptionally high levels of human hemopoietic cells in the murine recipient.

Plasma IL-6 levels increased during ECC, reaching a 33-fold increase 6 h after surgery as compared to pre-operative values. In contrast, plasma sIL-6R and LIF concentrations did not vary significantly during cardiac surgery. Thus, LIF is not implicated in the haematological changes and in the inflammatory syndrome observed after CABG. Despite the fact that LIF and IL-6 exhibit several common biological activities, the production of these two cytokines is differently regulated during cardiac surgery with ECC. Plasma IL-6 levels increased during cardiac surgery while sIL-6R levels did not changed. These data contrast with the decreased sIL-6R concentrations with concomitantly high IL-6 levels in patients with sepsis syndrome suggesting that inflammatory reactions in sepsis and after cardiopulmonary bypass are triggered by different mechanisms.","['Denizot, Y', 'Lorgeot, V', 'Cornu, E', 'Nathan, N']","['Denizot Y', 'Lorgeot V', 'Cornu E', 'Nathan N']","[""Departement d'Anesthesie, CHRU Dupuytren, Limoges, France.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cytokine,Cytokine,9005353,IM,,"['Aged', '*Cardiopulmonary Bypass', '*Extracorporeal Circulation', 'Growth Inhibitors/*blood', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*blood', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*blood', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6/*blood', 'Solubility']",1998/06/09 00:00,1998/06/09 00:01,['1998/06/09 00:00'],"['1998/06/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/09 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/09 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1043466697902854 [pii]', '10.1006/cyto.1997.0285 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytokine. 1998 Apr;10(4):303-6. doi: 10.1006/cyto.1997.0285.,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OSM is structurally and functionally related to leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), another cytokine in the interleukin 6 (IL-6) family. The biological activities of OSM are mediated through two types of receptor complexes, the LIF/OSM shared receptor (type I) and OSM-specific receptor (OSM-R, type II), which is composed of gp130 as a binding subunit and a newly identified affinity conversion subunit, OSM-R beta. Previous research conducted in the authors' laboratory has shown that OSM inhibits the growth of several breast cancer cell lines. To investigate whether OSM has a similar effect in primary normal human mammary epithelial (HME) cells, the activity of OSM in HME cells derived from four donors was examined. OSM produced a dose-dependent inhibition of DNA synethesis in these cells. In order to determine the receptor subtypes mediating OSM activity in HME and breast cancer cells, flow cytometry analysis using anti-gp130mAb and anti-OSM-R beta mAb was performed. In these studies, the authors were able to examine expressions of gp130 and OSM-R beta. In addition, quantitative RT-PCR assays were conducted to measure expressions of the mRNAs of the subunits for type I and type II OSM receptor. The results show that HME cells and most breast cancer cell lines express both the type I and the type II OSM receptors. However, type II, OSM-specific receptors are expressed at a higher levels than type I, OSM/LIF shared receptors. Accordingly, we compared the growth regulatory activities of OSM with LIF in HME cells and in breast cancer cells. In contrast to the inhibitory activity of OSM, LIF stimulated the growth of breast cancer cells, whereas it had no effect on normal mammary epithelial cell growth. Together, these data suggest that OSM plays an inhibitory role in normal and malignant mammary epithelial cell growth in vitro. OSM activity is mediated by the OSM-specific receptor (type II), not by the OSM/LIF shared receptor.","['Liu, J', 'Hadjokas, N', 'Mosley, B', 'Estrov, Z', 'Spence, M J', 'Vestal, R E']","['Liu J', 'Hadjokas N', 'Mosley B', 'Estrov Z', 'Spence MJ', 'Vestal RE']","['Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Mountain States Medical Research Institute, Boise, Idaho 83702, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Cytokine,Cytokine,9005353,IM,,"['Binding Sites', 'Breast/cytology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Epithelial Cells/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology/physiology', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology/physiology', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Receptors, Cytokine/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Receptors, Oncostatin M', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/06/09 00:00,1998/06/09 00:01,['1998/06/09 00:00'],"['1998/06/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/09 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/09 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1043-4666(97)90283-0 [pii]', '10.1006/cyto.1997.0283 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytokine. 1998 Apr;10(4):295-302. doi: 10.1006/cyto.1997.0283.,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Oncostatin M)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mortality rate ratios for leukemia ranged from 0.8-1.5. For brain cancer, increasing cumulative magnetic field exposure was associated with increasing mortality in virtually all models, with rate ratios between 1.3-3.4 for the most exposed workers.

Failure to appreciate that local invasion and distant metastasis rather then cell proliferation itself are lethal, obsession with cure of advanced disease rather than prevention of early disease, and neglect of the need to arrest preneoplastic lesions, may all have served to make victory elusive.","['Sporn, M B']",['Sporn MB'],"['Department of Pharmacology, Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, New Hampshire 03755, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,IM,,"['Adult', 'Cell Division', 'Child', 'Hodgkin Disease/therapy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Molecular Biology', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplasms/mortality/*prevention & control/therapy', 'Neoplasms, Glandular and Epithelial/mortality', 'Precancerous Conditions/prevention & control/therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', 'Testicular Neoplasms/therapy']",1998/06/09 00:00,1998/06/09 00:01,['1998/06/09 00:00'],"['1998/06/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/09 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1749-6632.1997.tb48599.x [doi]'],ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 1997 Dec 29;833:137-46. doi: 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1997.tb48599.x.,,,48,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the cohort study reported here was to analyse the incidence of cancer in the offspring of young lung cancer patients on the basis of the assumption that all of the offspring were exposed passively to smoke. The files of the Danish Cancer Registry provided 3348 cases of lung cancer patients born after 1935, and their offspring (n = 6417) were identified through the Danish Population Register. The files of the offspring were then linked with the files of the Danish Cancer Registry and the numbers of cancers observed in the offspring were compared with those expected from national age-specific and calendar-time-specific rates. A total of 135,333 person-years was the basis for analysis. Twenty-six cancers were observed, with 30.3 expected, yielding a standardised incidence ratio (SIR) of 0.9 (90% confidence interval (CI), 0.6-1.2). There was no excess of brain tumours, leukaemias or lymphomas. Stratification for sex of the lung cancer patients revealed a non-significantly increased risk for both non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (three cases; SIR = 3.4; 90% CI: 0.9-8.7) and Hodgkin's disease (three cases; SIR = 2.6; 90% CI: 0.7-6.6) in the offspring of female lung cancer patients. These results suggest that there is little evidence of an excess cancer risk in childhood, whether due to passive smoking or to as yet unidentified genetic factors, among the offspring of people who develop lung cancer. However, the results are limited by the fact that exposure was only assessed indirectly, with no measurement of actual cigarette consumption made.","['Seersholm, N', 'Hertz, H', 'Olsen, J H']","['Seersholm N', 'Hertz H', 'Olsen JH']","['Division for Cancer Epidemiology, Danish Cancer Society, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age of Onset', 'Aged', 'Child', '*Child of Impaired Parents', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Denmark/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', '*Lung Neoplasms', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Risk Factors', '*Tobacco Smoke Pollution']",1998/06/09 00:00,1998/06/09 00:01,['1998/06/09 00:00'],"['1998/06/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/09 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/09 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0959-8049(97)10004-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s0959-8049(97)10004-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 1997 Dec;33(14):2376-9. doi: 10.1016/s0959-8049(97)10004-1.,['0 (Tobacco Smoke Pollution)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, little is known about the effects of vitamin A on normal hematopoietic cells. Therefore, we investigated the effect of vitamin A on differentiation and activation of human blood monocytes (MO). Culturing MO for up to 4 days with 9-cis retinoic acid (RA) and all-trans RA but not retinol reduced MO survival, with the remaining cells being morphologically comparable to control cells. Because macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) is a well-known survival factor for MO, we measured the M-CSF content of MO culture supernatants using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and found that RA suppressed the constitutive secretion of M-CSF. Northern analysis showed that the M-CSF mRNA expression was only slightly reduced by RA treatment, suggesting regulation on the posttranscriptional level. In contrast to MO, M-CSF secretion by MO-derived macrophages (MAC) was not altered by RA, suggesting a differentiation-dependent switch in the responsiveness of MO/MAC to RA. Because M-CSF is not only a survival-promoting but also a differentiation-promoting factor for myeloid cells, we analyzed the effect of RA on MO to MAC maturation. RA suppressed the expression of the maturation-associated antigen carboxypeptidase M (CPM)/MAX.1 at both the protein and mRNA levels and modulated the lipopolysaccharide-stimulated cytokine secretion of MO/MAC. The addition of exogenous M-CSF to RA-containing MO cultures fails to overcome the RA-induced inhibition of MO differentiation. However, the survival rate was improved by exogenous M-CSF. We conclude that RA acts via two different mechanisms on monocyte survival and differentiation: posttranscriptionally by controlling M-CSF secretion, which decreases MO survival, and transcriptionally regulating the expression of differentiation-associated genes. The regulation of M-CSF production may contribute to the antileukemic effect of RA in vivo by reducing autocrine M-CSF production by leukemic cells.","['Kreutz, M', 'Fritsche, J', 'Ackermann, U', 'Krause, S W', 'Andreesen, R']","['Kreutz M', 'Fritsche J', 'Ackermann U', 'Krause SW', 'Andreesen R']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.

To clarify the role of PTHrP and bone remodeling in the development of hypercalcemia in ATL, we examined the SCID mouse model of ATL that has previously been shown to mimic the disease in humans. Using this model, we found clear elevations in serum levels of calcium and C-terminal PTHrP (C-PTHrP). PTHrP mRNA was highly expressed in ATL cells proliferating in vivo. After the development of hypercalcemia, ATL mice were killed and bone histomorphometric analysis was performed. Bone volume was clearly decreased in the ATL mice. In comparison to control SCID mice, bone formation indices were very low in the ATL mice. Surprisingly, no significant difference was detected between the ATL mice and the control SCID mice in eroded surface/bone surface (ES/BS), a parameter of bone resorption. To our knowledge, the model presented here is the first animal model of ATL with humoral hypercalcemia. This is in contrast to previously reported, well-characterized animal models of human solid tumors associated with humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy (HHM). Furthermore, this model not only provides us with the opportunity to study the mechanisms underlying development of elevated calcium levels in ATL, but also allows us to test new therapeutic agents designed to treat hypercalcemia.","['Takaori-Kondo, A', 'Imada, K', 'Yamamoto, I', 'Kunitomi, A', 'Numata, Y', 'Sawada, H', 'Uchiyama, T']","['Takaori-Kondo A', 'Imada K', 'Yamamoto I', 'Kunitomi A', 'Numata Y', 'Sawada H', 'Uchiyama T']","['Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Animals', 'Calcium/*blood', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein', 'Proteins/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",1998/06/17 00:00,1998/06/17 00:01,['1998/06/17 00:00'],"['1998/06/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)53818-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Jun 15;91(12):4747-51.,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PTHLH protein, human)', '0 (Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A central obstacle in the therapeutic application of ODN is their poor cellular uptake. Adding various lipophilic conjugates to the ODN backbone has been reported to improve uptake, and electroporation of target cells has also been shown to enhance intracellular ODN delivery. We have shown that (1) BCR-ABL-directed ODN will specifically decrease the level of BCR-ABL mRNA, provided that cells are first permeabilized with Streptolysin-O (SL-O), and (2) chimeric methylphosphonodiester:phosphodiester ODN directed against 9 bases either side of the BCR-ABL junction are more efficient ODN effectors than structures composed solely of phosphodiester or phosphorothioate linkages. In this study, we compared the efficacy of lipophilic conjugation, SL-O permeabilization and electroporation on the intracellular delivery and molecular effect of BCR-ABL-directed ODN. b2a2- and b3a2-directed chimeric ODN were synthesized either unmodified or with one of the following groups at the 5' end: cholesterol, vitamin E, polyethylene glycol of average molecular weight 2,000 or 5,000, N-octyl-oligo-oxyethylene, or dodecanol. ODN associated with Lipofectin was also studied. Comparison was made in untreated, electroporated, and SL-O permeabilized KYO1 cells. Uptake was examined by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry, using ODN structures that were 3' labeled with fluorescein. The effect on target BCR-ABL mRNA expression was analyzed by Northern blotting. Several conjugated structures associated avidly with the cell membrane without achieving significant intracellular uptake or molecular effect. Similarly, ODN:Lipofectin complexes moderately increased cell association, without enhancing intracellular levels of ODN or inducing detectable molecular effect. In SL-O permeabilized or electroporated cells, uptake was approximately 1 to 2 logs greater than in untreated cells, and rapid nuclear localization was seen, especially with unmodified chimeric ODN. In SL-O permeabilized cells treated with ODN directed to the b2a2 and b3a2 junctions respectively, b2a2 BCR-ABL mRNA levels at 4 hours were reduced to 2. 6% +/- 2.1% and 38.4% +/- 1.3% of control values. In cells permeabilized by electroporation, BCR-ABL mRNA levels were decreased to 4.0% +/- 1.4% of control levels by b2a2 directed ODN, although very little nontargeted suppression was seen with b3a2-targeted ODN (93.4% +/- 4.2% of control). Greater cell to cell variation in ODN uptake was seen for SL-O permeabilized cells when compared with electroporated cells, suggesting that, after SL-O permeabilization, relatively unpermeabilized and overpermeabilized populations may coexist. No structure had any effect on the level of irrelevant (p53, MYC, and GADPH) mRNA levels. We conclude that the conjugation of chimeric ODN with one of the above-mentioned lipophilic groups or the complexing of ODN with Liopfectin does not improve either intracellular delivery of ODN or the molecular effect. In contrast, both electroporation and SL-O permeabilization (1) considerably enhanced uptake of chimeric ODN (even for structures without a conjugate group) and (2) achieved significant suppression of target mRNA levels.","['Spiller, D G', 'Giles, R V', 'Grzybowski, J', 'Tidd, D M', 'Clark, R E']","['Spiller DG', 'Giles RV', 'Grzybowski J', 'Tidd DM', 'Clark RE']","['University Department of Haematology, Royal Liverpool University Hospital, Liverpool, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Bacterial Proteins', 'Chronic Disease', '*Drug Carriers', '*Drug Delivery Systems', '*Electroporation', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/therapy', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/*administration & dosage/*genetics', '*Phosphatidylethanolamines', '*Streptolysins', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/06/17 00:00,1998/06/17 00:01,['1998/06/17 00:00'],"['1998/06/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)53817-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Jun 15;91(12):4738-46.,"['0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Phosphatidylethanolamines)', '0 (Streptolysins)', '0 (streptolysin O)', '76391-83-8 (1,2-dielaidoylphosphatidylethanolamine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The agonist anti-gp130 MoAbs neither bound to murine gp130 nor activated murine cells and, as a consequence, did not induce interleukin-6 (IL-6)-related toxicities in mice. They have a 2-week half-life in vivo when injected in the peritoneum. The agonist antibodies made possible the in vivo growth of exogenous IL-6-dependent human myeloma cells as well as that of freshly explanted myeloma cells from 1 patient with secondary plasma cell leukemia. Tumors occurred 4 to 10 weeks after myeloma cell graft and weighed 3 to 5 g. They grew as solid tumors in the peritoneal cavity and metastasized to the different peritoneal organs: liver, pancreas, spleen, and intestine. Tumoral cells were detected in blood and bone marrow of mice grafted with the XG-2 myeloma cells. Tumoral cells grown in SCID mice had kept the phenotypic characteristics of the original tumoral cells and their in vitro growth required the presence of IL-6 or agonist anti-gp130 MoAbs. Myeloma cells from 4 patients with medullary involvement persisted for more than 1 year as judged by detectable circulating human Ig.

All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) induces granulocytic differentiation of APL-derived cells and is used to treat APL patients. However, ATRA interacts with normal cells with RAR throughout the entire body, and when used at high doses or over a long duration, it induces several adverse effects. The development of drugs that selectively act on APL cells may contribute to increasing the therapeutic efficacy of APL treatment as well as elucidating the mechanisms of response to ATRA. In this study, 9-cis retinoic acid alpha-tocopherol ester (9CTT) inhibited the proliferation of APL-derived NB4 and HT93 cells and induced differentiation markers, such as granulocytic maturation, nitroblue tetrazolium reduction, and CD11b expression, in these cells. The effects of 9CTT on non-APL cells, including HL-60 and U937 cells, were much weaker than those on APL cells, and tretinoin tocoferil (TT), which is an alpha-tocopherol ester of ATRA, did not induce the differentiation of APL cells as effectively as 9CTT. The differentiation-inducing effects of 9CTT were inhibited by RAR antagonists. 9CTT and TT similarly induced the transactivating activity of RARs, but were not effective on RXRs. 9CTT downregulated the expression of PML/RAR-alpha protein more effectively than TT, which suggests that it may be involved in the selectivity of 9CTT against APL cells. Interestingly, 9CTT enhanced the differentiation of APL cells induced by ATRA, 9-cis retinoic acid, and synthetic retinobenzoic acids. Combined with 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (VD3), 9CTT also more than additively induced the differentiation of APL cells. Thus, 9CTT, alone or in combination with other retinoids or VD3, may be useful for the treatment of APL.","['Makishima, M', 'Umesono, K', 'Shudo, K', 'Naoe, T', 'Kishi, K', 'Honma, Y']","['Makishima M', 'Umesono K', 'Shudo K', 'Naoe T', 'Kishi K', 'Honma Y']","['Department of Chemotherapy, Saitama Cancer Center Research Institute, Saitama, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Drug Combinations', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Tretinoin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Vitamin E/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",1998/06/17 00:00,1998/06/17 00:01,['1998/06/17 00:00'],"['1998/06/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)53815-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Jun 15;91(12):4715-26.,"['0 (Drug Combinations)', '1406-18-4 (Vitamin E)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'CTD060B1SS (tocoretinate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The expression of p27 protein was higher in B-CLL samples with variations among them. In B-CLL, p27 levels were independent of absolute number of circulating lymphocytes, but strongly correlated with both lymphocyte and total tumor mass (TTM) doubling time. High p27 expression was associated with a poorer overall prognosis. In vitro, there was an increased spontaneous survival of B-CLL cells expressing high p27 levels. Interleukin-4 (IL-4) upregulated p27 levels in B-CLL cells, while fludarabine decreased p27 levels. Thus, our results indicate that p27 may be a valuable kinetic marker in B-CLL by providing instantaneous estimation of the disease doubling time.

In the present study, we compared the cellular uptake of 59Fe-transferrin (Tf) and 59Fe-pyridoxal isonicotinoyl hydrazone (PIH) to determine whether the decrease in iron uptake by R cells is caused by changes in Tf receptor (TfR)-dependent or TfR-independent iron uptake. We found that both 59Fe-Tf and 59Fe-PIH uptake were decreased in R cells. The uptake of 59Fe-Tf but not 59Fe-PIH could be blocked by an anti-TfR monoclonal antibody. After 59Fe-Tf uptake, R cells released greater amounts of 59Fe than gallium-sensitive (S) cells. However, after 59Fe-PIH uptake 59Fe release from S and R cells was similar. 125I-Tf exocytosis was greater in R cells. At confluency, S and R cells expressed equivalent amounts of TfR; however, at 24 and 48 hours in culture, TfR expression was lower in R cells. Our study suggests that the decrease in Tf-Fe uptake by R cells is caused by a combination of enhanced iron efflux from cells and decreased TfR-mediated iron transport into cells. Furthermore, because TfR-dependent and -independent iron uptake is decreased in R cells, both uptake systems may be controlled at some level by similar regulatory signal(s).","['Chitambar, C R', 'Wereley, J P']","['Chitambar CR', 'Wereley JP']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI 53226, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Biological Transport', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gallium/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Transferrin/*metabolism', 'Transferrin/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/06/17 00:00,1998/06/17 00:01,['1998/06/17 00:00'],"['1998/06/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)53811-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Jun 15;91(12):4686-93.,"['0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Transferrin)', 'CH46OC8YV4 (Gallium)']",,,['R01 CA68028/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

A recent study showed a MLL/AF10 fusion in all cases of AML with t(10;11) and various breakpoints on chromosome 11 ranging from q13 to q23. We recently cloned CALM (Clathrin Assembly Lymphoid Myeloid leukemia gene), the fusion partner of AF10 at 11q14 in the monocytic cell line U937. To further define the role of these genes in acute leukemias, 10 cases (9 AML and 1 ALL) with cytogenetically proven t(10;11)(p12-14;q13-21) and well-characterized morphology, immunophenotype, and clinical course were analyzed. Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed with 2 YACs flanking the CALM region, a YAC contig of the MLL region, and a YAC spanning the AF10 breakpoint. Rearrangement of at least one of these genes was detected in all cases with balanced t(10;11). In 4 cases, including 3 AML with immature morphology (1 AML-M0 and 2 AML-M1) and 1 ALL, the signals of the CALM YACS were separated in interphase cells, indicating a translocation breakpoint within the CALM region. MLL was rearranged in 3 AML with myelomonocytic differentiation (2 AML-M2 and 1 AML-M5), including 1 secondary AML. In all 3 cases, a characteristic immunophenotype was identified (CD4+, CD13-, CD33+, CD65s+). AF-10 was involved in 5 of 6 evaluable cases, including 1 case without detectable CALM or MLL rearrangement. In 2 complex translocations, none of the three genes was rearranged. All cases had a remarkably poor prognosis, with a mean survival of 9.6 +/- 6.6 months. For the 7 AML cases that were uniformly treated according to the AMLCG86/92 protocols, disease-free and overall survival was significantly worse than for the overall study group (P = .03 and P = .01, respectively).

NFkappaB activity is independent from FADD, caspases, and apoptosis induction. To study the influence of NFkappaB activity on apoptosis mediated by TRAIL, CD95, TNFalpha, or doxorubicin, NFkappaB activation was inhibited using the proteasome inhibitor N-acetyl-L-leucinyl-L-leucinyl-L-norleucinal or transient overexpression of mutant IkappaBalpha. Sensitivity for induction of apoptosis was markedly increased by these treatments in apoptosis sensitive cell lines. Moreover, both in cell lines and in primary leukemia cells that are resistant towards induction of apoptosis by DILs and doxorubicin, antagonization of NFkappaB activity partially restored apoptosis sensitivity.

To facilitate detailed investigation of their functional capacity and the mechanism leading to their differentiation, several cell lines have been established from primary material.

(1) UG3 cells harbor the t(9;11)(p22;q23) translocation that results in fusion of the MLL and the AF9 genes and produce the corresponding AF9-MLL and MLL-AF9 fusion transcripts. (2) UG3 cells rely on the presence of exogenous growth factors for viability and proliferation, such as interleukin-3 (IL-3), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), or macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). (3) When cultured in the presence of G-CSF, UG3 cells differentiate along the granulocytic lineage, as evidenced by segmentation of nuclei and positive staining for neutrophilic alkaline phosphatase and peroxidase. (4) When cultured in the presence of GM-CSF or M-CSF, UG3 cells differentiate into mature macrophages while preserving surface expression of CD14 and CD68 and also start to release cytokines into cell-culture supernatants. Under these culture conditions, UG3 cells also take up acetylated LDL.

Migration of leukemic cells might also depend on the expression of chemokine receptors. Therefore, we analyzed expression of CXCR-4 on mobilized normal CD34+ progenitors and leukemic cells. In addition, SDF-1-induced transendothelial migration across a bone marrow endothelial cell layer was assessed in vitro. By flow cytometry, CXCR-4 was found to be expressed in significant amounts on circulating CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells, including more primitive subsets (CD34+/CD38- and CD34+/Thy-1+ cells). In accordance with the immunofluorescence data, CD34+ progenitors efficiently migrated across endothelium in response to SDF-1 containing conditioned medium from the stromal cell line MS-5. Leukemic blasts (mostly CD34+) from patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) expressed variable amounts of CXCR-4, which was functionally active, as demonstrated by a positive correlation between the SDF-1-induced transendothelial migration and the cell surface density of CXCR-4 (r = 0.97). Also recombinant SDF-1beta induced migration of CXCR-4-positive leukemic blasts. The effect of both conditioned medium and recombinant SDF-1 was inhibited by a CXCR-4 blocking antibody. In contrast, CD34+ leukemic cell lines (KG1, KG1a, Kasumi-1, MOLM-1) expressed low levels or were negative for CXCR-4, and did not migrate. By reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), however, basal levels of CXCR-4 mRNA were also detected in all leukemic cell lines. We conclude that CXCR-4 is expressed on CD34+ cells including more primitive, pluripotent progenitors, and may therefore play a role in the homing of hematopoietic stem cells. CXCR-4 expressed in variable amounts on primary AML leukemic cells is functionally active and may be involved in the trafficking of malignant hematopoietic cells.","['Mohle, R', 'Bautz, F', 'Rafii, S', 'Moore, M A', 'Brugger, W', 'Kanz, L']","['Mohle R', 'Bautz F', 'Rafii S', 'Moore MA', 'Brugger W', 'Kanz L']","['Department of Medicine II, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Antigens, CD34', 'Cell Movement/*drug effects/*physiology', 'Chemokine CXCL12', 'Chemokines, CXC/*pharmacology', 'Endothelium, Vascular/pathology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Receptors, CXCR4/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/06/17 00:00,1998/06/17 00:01,['1998/06/17 00:00'],"['1998/06/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)53793-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Jun 15;91(12):4523-30.,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Chemokines, CXC)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)']",,,['KO8-HL-02926/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

To develop methods to identify patients at risk for this complication, we have investigated the predictive value of clonal bone marrow (BM) hematopoiesis for the development of t-MDS/AML, as defined by an X-inactivation based clonality assay at the human androgen receptor locus (HUMARA), in a group of patients undergoing ABMT for NHL from a single institution (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA). One hundred four female patients were analyzed. At the time of ABMT, the prevalence of polyclonal hematopoiesis was 77% (80/104), of skewed X-inactivation pattern (XIP) was 20% (21/104), and of clonal hematopoiesis was 3% (3/104). To determine the predictive value of clonality for the development of t-MDS/AML, a subgroup of 78 patients with at least 18 months follow-up was analyzed. As defined by the HUMARA assay, 53 of 78 patients had persistent polyclonal hematopoiesis, 15 of 78 had skewed XIP, and 10 of 78 (13.5%) either had clonal hematopoiesis at the time of ABMT or developed clonal hematopoiesis after ABMT. t-MDS/AML developed in 2 of 53 patients with polyclonal hematopoiesis and in 4 of 10 with clonal hematopoiesis.

Because gene amplification potential accompanies loss of wild-type p53, we examined the p53 gene in a case of treatment-related acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML) with MLL segmental jumping translocation. The child was diagnosed with ganglioneuroma and embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS) at 2 years of age. Therapy for ERMS included alkylating agents, DNA topoisomerase I and DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors, and local radiation. t-AML was diagnosed at 4 years of age. The complex karyotype of the t-AML showed structural and numerical abnormalities. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis showed multiple copies of the MLL gene, consistent with segmental jumping translocation. A genomic region including CD3, MLL, and a segment of band 11q24 was unrearranged and amplified by Southern blot analysis. There was no family history of a cancer predisposing syndrome, but single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis detected identical band shifts in the leukemia, ganglioneuroma, ERMS, and normal tissues, consistent with a germline p53 mutation, and there was loss of heterozygosity in the ERMS and the t-AML.

Southern blot analysis of patient bone marrow cells with a PDGFbetaR gene probe demonstrated rearrangement of the PDGFbetaR gene. Anchored polymerase chain reaction using PDGFbetaR primers identified a chimeric transcript containing the HIP1 gene located at 7q11.2 fused to the PDGFbetaR gene on 5q33. HIP1 is a 116-kD protein recently cloned by yeast two-hybrid screening for proteins that interact with Huntingtin, the mutated protein in Huntington's disease. The consequence of t(5;7)(q33;q11.2) is an HIP1/PDGFbetaR fusion gene that encodes amino acids 1 to 950 of HIP1 joined in-frame to the transmembrane and tyrosine kinase domains of the PDGFbetaR. The reciprocal PDGFbetaR/HIP1 transcript is not expressed. HIP1/PDGFbetaR is a 180-kD protein when expressed in the murine hematopoietic cell line, Ba/F3, and is constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated. Furthermore, HIP1/PDGFbetaR transforms the Ba/F3 cells to interleukin-3-independent growth. These data are consistent with an alternative mechanism for activation of PDGFbetaR tyrosine kinase activity by fusion with HIP1, leading to transformation of hematopoietic cells, and may implicate Huntingtin or HIP1 in the pathogenesis of hematopoietic malignancies.","['Ross, T S', 'Bernard, O A', 'Berger, R', 'Gilliland, D G']","['Ross TS', 'Bernard OA', 'Berger R', 'Gilliland DG']","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Division of Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*genetics', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta', 'Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1998/06/17 00:00,1998/06/17 00:01,['1998/06/17 00:00'],"['1998/06/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)53779-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Jun 15;91(12):4419-26.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (HIP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)']",,,"['P01CA66996-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL07623/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: 11 pigs (danish landrace) were used to investigate the effect of tamponade by increased joint pressure (Dextran 70) on the perfusion of the femoral head. Additional 8 pigs were used as control. The blood flow in the hip joint was studied by means of the microsphere technique. The flow was determined before, during and after intraarticular pressure increase. With the ""radioactive tracer microsphere""-method the blood flow of the epiphysis, metaphysis and proximal femoral corticalis could be measured. RESULTS: In the epiphyseal femoral head the initial blood flow rate, 11.7 ml/min/100 g, was not significant different from that of the control side (11.1 ml/min/100 g). The blood flow decreased in the ischemic phase to 1.8 ml/min/100 g followed by reperfusion to 13.5 ml/min/100 g (p < 0.01). The bone blood flow of reperfusion was not significant different from that of the initial blood flow rate but in 2 cases a ""blow out"" of the epiphyseal bone blood flow was seen. The proximal femoral metaphysis showed the highest of the measured intraosseous flow rates (17.9 resp. 23.3 ml/min/100 g). During ischemia and reperfusion of the epiphysis bone blood flow of the metaphysis remained the same. The proximal femoral corticalis showed the lowest of the measured intraosseous flow rates. The operated (10.1 ml/min/100 g) and contralateral hip side (11.7 ml/min/100 g) showed no significant differences in the initial blood flow rate. During ischemia and reperfusion the blood flow of the proximal corticalis showed no significant difference to the initial blood flow corresponding to the metaphysis. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates disturbances of the circulation of different regions of the femoral head during intraarticular pressure increase and following pressure decrease of the growing pig. 2 ""blow outs"" document a vulnerable proximal epiphysis already after a 6-hour ischemia. Additional minor ""bone quality"" in cases of certain diseases (kidney transplantation, leukemia) and special administration of drugs (corticosteroids) seem to create an additional vulnerability of the proximal femoral head. The experiment proves to be a reliable model for decreasing the blood flow of the growing epiphysis temporarily and to document the beginning of normal reperfusion. With this model it is possible to examine the vulnerability of the epiphyseal perfusion after different diseases and under the influence of different medication.","['Schneider, T', 'Drescher, W', 'Becker, C', 'Cremer, D', 'Weile, C', 'Heydthausen, M', 'Ruther, W', 'Hansen, E S', 'Bunger, C']","['Schneider T', 'Drescher W', 'Becker C', 'Cremer D', 'Weile C', 'Heydthausen M', 'Ruther W', 'Hansen ES', 'Bunger C']","['Orthopadische Klinik, Heinrich-Heine-Universitat Dusseldorf.']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Z Orthop Ihre Grenzgeb,Zeitschrift fur Orthopadie und ihre Grenzgebiete,1256465,IM,,"['Animals', 'Blood Flow Velocity/physiology', 'Blood Pressure/physiology', 'Cardiac Output/physiology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Epiphyses/blood supply', 'Femur Head/*blood supply', 'Femur Head Necrosis/*physiopathology', 'Ischemia/*physiopathology', 'Regional Blood Flow/physiology', 'Reperfusion Injury/*physiopathology', 'Swine']",1998/06/06 00:00,1998/06/06 00:01,['1998/06/06 00:00'],"['1998/06/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/06 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2008-1051295 [doi]'],ppublish,Z Orthop Ihre Grenzgeb. 1998 Mar-Apr;136(2):132-7. doi: 10.1055/s-2008-1051295.,,Die Reperfusionsfahigkeit des Femurkopfes nach Ischamie--Eine experimentelle Studie.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry using specific antisera were performed with a panel of human ovarian carcinomas and normal human ovaries. RESULTS: All Bcl-2 related proteins were expressed in normal and malignant ovarian tissues. Higher levels of Bcl-2 versus Bcl-xLong were observed in normal ovary by immunoblotting, compared to a majority of cancer samples. Increased levels of death-inducing Bax were related to malignant transformation across all types of ovarian cancer included in this study.

To evaluate the MDR phenotype, rationale investigations of the cytotoxic processes and effect,s of Adriamycin (ADR) were done to obtain information on individual cells. Such information could be obtained through a multiparametric approach involving multiwavelength microfluorometry and numerical image analysis on single living cells. To achieve this, cells should be simultaneously stained with Hoechst 33342 (nuclear staining), Rhodamine 123 (mitochondria staining) and Nile Red (cell contour delineation). Changes in the biological parameters accessible from R123, Ho33342 and C-SNARF-1/AM (probe used for the pHi measurements) labelling were found more informative than changes in morphological parameters for the discrimination of sensitive and resistant cells.

The drug depletes asparagine (Asn) in serum and cells and since the leukemic T-cells (thymic origin cells) lack asparagine synthetase, the amino acid starvation leads to apoptosis. When PEG-ASNase is combined with antimetabolite drugs such as ara-C, or combinations of 6-MP followed by ara-C, it augments the cytotoxic effect synergistically against human T-leukemia cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Synergism studies with two- or three-drug combination regimens in the human leukemia cell lines, CEM/0 and CEM/ara-C/7A have been investigated along with its effect in inducing apoptosis. RESULTS: The IC50 (approximately Dm) values of ara-C were 0.032 microM and 0.11 microM, and that of PEG-ASNase were 0.002 IU/ml and 1.52 IU/ml against CEM/0 and CEM/ara-C/7A cells, respectively. Thus, CEM/ara-C/7A cell line that is partially resistant to ara-C exhibited 681-fold cross-resistant to PEG-ASNase as compared to CEM/0. The concurrent drug exposure of ara-C and PEG-ASNase for 48 hours resulted in IC50 values of 0.56 nM for ara-C and 0.56 mIU/ml for PEG-ASNase respectively, in CEM/0 cells which represents a 57.4-fold synergism compared to ara-C alone. In the CEM/ara-C/7A cell line, the co-incubation with these two drugs resulted in IC50 value of 0.015 microM for ara-C and 0.015 IU/ml for PEG-ASNase respectively, or a 7.25-fold synergism as compared to ara-C and 101.1-fold synergism in comparison with PEG-ASNase alone. Pre-clinical studies involving three-drug combination consisting of 6-MP, ara-C and PEG-ASNase in a sequence-specific manner showed a 15.6-fold synergism against CEM/0 cell line over the two-drug combination of 6-MP followed by ara-C or approximately 160-fold syneryism over ara-C alone. CONCLUSION: The two-drug combination of ara-C and PEG-ASNase or the three-drug combination of 6-MP, ara-C and PEG-ASNase in the ara-C sensitive and resistant cell line showed significant drug synergism and CEM/ara-C/7A cells exhibited collateral sensitivity to PEG-ASNase. The three-drug combination also induced dose-dependent apoptotic DNA fragmentation which was higher than the two-drug combination of 6-MP and ara-C. We also conclude that the sequence specific use of PEG-ASNase in combination with the nucleoside analog drugs may benefit leukemia patients in early relapse.","['Nandy, P', 'Periclou, A P', 'Avramis, V I']","['Nandy P', 'Periclou AP', 'Avramis VI']","['Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, CA 90027, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Asparaginase/*administration & dosage', 'Asparagine/analysis', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Mercaptopurine/*administration & dosage', 'Polyethylene Glycols/*administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/06/06 00:00,1998/06/06 00:01,['1998/06/06 00:00'],"['1998/06/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/06 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/06 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1998 Mar-Apr;18(2A):727-37.,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '7006-34-0 (Asparagine)', '7D96IR0PPM (pegaspargase)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A sample of 28 survivors participated in the study. Quality of life was described in terms of ""normality,"" enjoyment, and fulfillment with life: being psychologically and physically healthy, being independent, having family and relationships, having work, experiencing happiness, and having material support. There were many factors with which survivors found it difficult to cope: symptoms, frustration brought from the inabilities to function in life, family life, returning to work, and infertility. However, about 25% of the survivors reported a positive impact of the BMT on their lives. Main concerns about the future were related to health status, the long-term effects of the transplant, financial concern, infertility, the normalization process, and the family. These data confirmed that unrelated donor BMT patients do not have a different perception about their QOL than other BMT patients receiving autologous or allogeneic marrow transplants. Some of the issues that differed from the previous BMT literature included higher inability to perform daily tasks and dependency on others, adverse memories of the transplant, and concerns about the future. These areas should be the target of pretransplant interventions and the long-term psychosocial services provided to patients. As mentioned by the respondents, health care professionals could further improve their patients' QOL by providing counseling and psychologic support, education about the effects of the various treatments, and improved research in BMT treatment and side effects.","['Molassiotis, A', 'Morris, P J']","['Molassiotis A', 'Morris PJ']","['Faculty of Medicine, Department of Nursing, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Nurs,Cancer nursing,7805358,IM,,"['Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/*psychology', 'Clinical Nursing Research', 'Counseling', 'Female', 'Health Status', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*psychology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Patient Education as Topic', '*Quality of Life', 'Social Support', '*Survivors']",1998/06/06 00:00,1998/06/06 00:01,['1998/06/06 00:00'],"['1998/06/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/06 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00002820-199806000-00008 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Nurs. 1998 Jun;21(3):205-11. doi: 10.1097/00002820-199806000-00008.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bryostatin 1 exerts variable effects on leukemic cell differentiation, and has been reported by some investigators to inhibit the proliferation of the monocytic leukemic cell line U937. In this study, we have compared the efficacy of bryostatin 1 and PMA with respect to U937 cell maturation, with a major emphasis on differential actions on the cell cycle arrest machinery. At equimolar concentrations (10 nM), PMA, in contrast to bryostatin 1, induced cellular differentiation of U937 cells, reflected by growth inhibition, increased plastic adhesion, and expression of the monocytic differentiation marker, CD11b. Consistent with these results, bryostatin 1 was less effective in inducing G0/G1 arrest and inhibiting cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) activity. Bryostatin 1, unlike PMA, failed to induce expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKI), p21CIP1/WAF1, and blocked the ability of PMA to induce this protein. Bryostatin 1 exposure resulted in increased expression of the CDKI p27KIP1 in these cells, although the kinetics differed from PMA. In addition, bryostatin 1 was less effective than PMA in dephosphorylating pRb, modifying E2F complexes, and downregulating c-Myc. Co-administration of bryostatin 1 with PMA antagonized the latter's differentiation-inducing capacity and anti-proliferative effects, actions that were accompanied by a reduction in PMA-mediated p21CIP1/WAF1 induction, CDK2 inhibition, pRb dephosphorylation, and c-Myc downregulation. Antagonistic effects of bryostatin 1 on PMA-related cell cycle events were mimicked by the specific PKC inhibitor GF109203X. Together, these studies indicate that bryostatin 1 is a considerably weaker stimulus than PMA for U937 cell differentiation, and raise the possibility that this deficiency arises from its failure to induce p21CIP1/WAF1 and trigger cell cycle arrest.","['Vrana, J A', 'Saunders, A M', 'Chellappan, S P', 'Grant, S']","['Vrana JA', 'Saunders AM', 'Chellappan SP', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Virgina, Richmond, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Differentiation,Differentiation; research in biological diversity,0401650,IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bryostatins', '*CDC2-CDC28 Kinases', '*Carrier Proteins', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Cyclins/drug effects/metabolism', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'E2F Transcription Factors', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Lactones/*pharmacology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*metabolism', 'Macrolides', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/metabolism', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/metabolism', 'Retinoblastoma-Binding Protein 1', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factor DP1', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/06/06 00:00,1998/06/06 00:01,['1998/06/06 00:00'],"['1998/06/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/06 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/06 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-4681(09)60632-0 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1432-0436.1998.6310033.x [doi]']",ppublish,Differentiation. 1998 May;63(1):33-42. doi: 10.1046/j.1432-0436.1998.6310033.x.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (E2F Transcription Factors)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Retinoblastoma-Binding Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factor DP1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2-CDC28 Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,"['CA09564/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Of 52 newly diagnosed cases of APL between February 1992 and December 1996, 15 were in the pediatric age group (younger than 15 years). Four patients were treated with ATRA alone and 11 were allocated to receive ATRA followed by chemotherapy. Eighty-six percent of the patients achieved a complete response. The patients who received ATRA alone as maintenance therapy had relapses with a median duration of remission of 8 months (range 6-12). The patients who received ATRA, followed by consolidation chemotherapy, had a prolonged duration of remission, with a median of 20 months (range 13-28). In addition, rapid correction of coagulopathy was observed in these patients. The median duration for correction of coagulopathy was 7 days (range 5-11) and the median duration for recovery from neutropenia after chemotherapy was 10 days (range 7-20). Two major side effects of ATRA were hyperleukocytosis and retinoic acid syndrome. Significantly prolonged disease-free survival was seen in patients who received ATRA with chemotherapy.

Cadherins are cellular adhesion molecules. Since disturbance of intracellular adhesion is important for invasion and metastasis of tumor cells, cadherins are considered prime candidates for tumor suppressor genes. A variety of solid tumors show loss of heterozygosity of the long arm of chromosome 16, which is indicative of the potential location of tumor suppressor genes. Refined and new localizations of six cadherin genes (CDH3, 5, 8, 11, 13, and 15) to the long arm of chromosome 16 are shown. CDH15 was localized to 16q24.3, in a region that exhibits loss of heterozygosity in a number of sporadic breast cancer tumors. Previous localization of CDH13 (H-cadherin) to 16q24 suggested this gene as a tumor suppressor candidate in the 16q24.3 loss of heterozygosity region; however, refined mapping presented in this report localizes CDH13 proximal to this region. A human EST homologous to the chicken cadherin-7 was partially sequenced and found to represent a new human cadherin. This cadherin mapped to chromosome 18q22-q23, a region that exhibits loss of heterozygosity in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. CDH16 was localized to 8q22.1, a region exhibiting loss of heterozygosity in adult acute myeloid leukemia.","['Kremmidiotis, G', 'Baker, E', 'Crawford, J', 'Eyre, H J', 'Nahmias, J', 'Callen, D F']","['Kremmidiotis G', 'Baker E', 'Crawford J', 'Eyre HJ', 'Nahmias J', 'Callen DF']","[""Department of Cytogenetics and Molecular Genetics, Women's and Children's Hospital, North Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genomics,Genomics,8800135,IM,,"['Breast Neoplasms/genetics', 'Cadherins/*genetics', '*Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 18', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Female', '*Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*genetics']",1998/06/06 00:00,1998/06/06 00:01,['1998/06/06 00:00'],"['1998/06/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/06 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/06 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0888-7543(98)95281-8 [pii]', '10.1006/geno.1998.5281 [doi]']",ppublish,Genomics. 1998 May 1;49(3):467-71. doi: 10.1006/geno.1998.5281.,['0 (Cadherins)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues revealed low-level expression of a functional member of this gene family in almost all samples. Marked levels of transcripts were detected by in situ hybridization in the retina, the olfactory epithelium, the peripheral neuronal ganglia, and distinct areas of the gut.

These abnormalities have also been described in persistent expanding pre-malignant T-cell clones in patients with ataxia telangiectasia (AT). We have previously reported that in T-PLL and AT developing T-cell leukemia, the above abnormalities occur with additional abnormalities, mainly trisomy for 8q resulting predominantly from an i(8)(q10) and an increased expression of MYC. In this series, 81% of cases had chromosome 8 abnormalities including i(8)(q10)[43%]/t(8;8)(p12;q11)[14%], + 8[14%], and 8p + [14%]. The use of probes for MYC (8q24) and chromosome 8 centromere on metaphase chromosomes revealed that cases with i(8)(q10) were dicentric and t(8;8) monocentric. These abnormalities are not only associated with increase in dosage of 8q and the MYC gene, but also involved 8p. 8p is known to have several suppressor genes associated with solid tumors.

We have used this method to define the methylated areas of chromosomes from normal donors and from leukemia cell lines. The chromosomes were exposed for a short time to UV light to induce mild denaturation. The methylated sites were detected in situ by using monoclonal antibodies against 5-methylcytosine (prepared in mouse), and fluorescein-conjugated antimouse immunoglobulins. The chromosomes from normal cells exhibited a fluorescent pattern with RCT banding, although some differences from previously reported patterns could be detected. With this method we have been able to show the presence of two types of R-bands: High fluorescence R-band (HFR) and low fluorescence R-band (LFR). Chromosomes from leukemia cell lines exhibited low global staining with disrupted RCT banding of the chromosomes. The decreased level of the methylation status of the chromosomes from leukemia cells was confirmed by detection of 5-methylcytosines on total immobilized DNA. Thus, we have shown that this method can be used to determine the methylated status of chromosomes and, in turn, to map not only the structural (banding) but also the functional (methylation status) properties of the different chromosome domains in normal and pathologic human cells.","['Bensaada, M', 'Kiefer, H', 'Tachdjian, G', 'Lapierre, J M', 'Cacheux, V', 'Niveleau, A', 'Metezeau, P']","['Bensaada M', 'Kiefer H', 'Tachdjian G', 'Lapierre JM', 'Cacheux V', 'Niveleau A', 'Metezeau P']","['SC9 INSERM-Pasteur, Paris, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,IM,,"['5-Methylcytosine', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/analysis', 'Chromosomes, Human/*genetics/immunology/radiation effects', 'Cytosine/*analogs & derivatives/analysis/immunology', '*DNA Methylation/radiation effects', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes', 'Female', '*Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Telomere/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",1998/06/06 00:00,1998/06/06 00:01,['1998/06/06 00:00'],"['1998/06/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/06 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/06 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0165460897004093 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-4608(97)00409-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1998 Jun;103(2):101-9. doi: 10.1016/s0165-4608(97)00409-3.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '6R795CQT4H (5-Methylcytosine)', '8J337D1HZY (Cytosine)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This molecular clone directed the synthesis of viral proteins and the induction of syncytia in transiently transfected cells. In addition, virus particles were released into the culture medium. Serial passages of transient transfectants also resulted in propagation of BLV. After transfection of five cell lines with linearized pBLV-IF and a neomycin-resistance gene, BLV-producing transfectants were established in cell lines COS-1 and 23CLN that did not form syncytia upon expression of BLV. In HeLa and FLK cells, BLV produced by a stable COS-1 transfectant was transmitted by both cell-free and cell-to-cell infection. Thus, pBLV-IF encoded an infectious provirus that successfully induced primary and secondary infections. This study indicates that the infectious molecular clone and the virus-producing transfectants could be useful for further examination of the biological properties of BLV.","['Inabe, K', 'Ikuta, K', 'Aida, Y']","['Inabe K', 'Ikuta K', 'Aida Y']","['Tsukuba Life Science Center, Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (RIKEN), Ibaraki, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,IM,,"['Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Cattle', 'Coculture Techniques', 'DNA, Viral/*genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*physiology', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid/genetics', 'Transfection', 'Viral Proteins/*physiology', '*Virus Replication']",1998/06/06 00:00,1998/06/06 00:01,['1998/06/06 00:00'],"['1998/06/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/06 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/06 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(98)99140-1 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1998.9140 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 1998 May 25;245(1):53-64. doi: 10.1006/viro.1998.9140.,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To establish further the therapeutic effect of Fas-mediated apoptosis on RA taking into consideration safety and practicality, we investigated the effect of cells transfected with human Fas ligand (hFasL) gene on proliferating human rheumatoid synovium engrafted in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID-RA) mice. The hFasL transfectants exhibited cytotoxic activity against RA synoviocytes via the Fas/FasL system in vitro. Histopathological and immunohistochemical studies showed that local injection of irradiated-hFasL transfectants eliminated synoviocytes and mononuclear cells in engrafted human rheumatoid synovium of SCID-RA mice. Furthermore, in situ nick and labeling analysis confirmed that the cells in engrafted synovium frequently underwent apoptosis by irradiated-hFasL transfectants. Our results clearly demonstrated that hFasL transfectants induced apoptosis by cell-to-cell interaction via the Fas/FasL system.

RESULTS AND METHODS: A case report is presented of an 80-year-old woman suffering from blepharospasm and chronic myeloid leukaemia, who developed necrotising fasciitis 3 days after a botulinum toxin injection. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic debilitating processes such as diabetes, alcoholism and polymyositis have been suggested as predisposing factors in the development of necrotising fasciitis. We believe this is the first reported case of necrotising fasciitis occurring secondary to a botulinum toxin injection. The fact that this infection extended through the fascial planes and led to the death of muscle was, probably, because an inoculum was introduced directly into the muscle at the time of botulinum toxin treatment. This may have led to its deep spread and difficulty in debriding the area. Chronic myeloid leukaemia does not in itself cause significant immunosuppression, but our patient was on anti-proliferative treatment and had a low leucocyte count, which may have been a predisposing factor in this case.","['Latimer, P R', 'Hodgkins, P R', 'Vakalis, A N', 'Butler, R E', 'Evans, A R', 'Zaki, G A']","['Latimer PR', 'Hodgkins PR', 'Vakalis AN', 'Butler RE', 'Evans AR', 'Zaki GA']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Queen Alexandra Hospital, Portsmouth, UK.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Eye (Lond),"Eye (London, England)",8703986,IM,,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anti-Dyskinesia Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Blepharospasm/therapy', 'Botulinum Toxins/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Fasciitis, Necrotizing/*etiology/immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Injections, Subcutaneous', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/immunology']",1998/06/06 00:00,1998/06/06 00:01,['1998/06/06 00:00'],"['1998/06/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/06 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/eye.1998.9 [doi]'],ppublish,Eye (Lond). 1998;12 ( Pt 1):51-3. doi: 10.1038/eye.1998.9.,"['0 (Anti-Dyskinesia Agents)', 'EC 3.4.24.69 (Botulinum Toxins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A number of hypotheses have been built for the mechanism, none of them satisfactory. Difficulty in evaluating bone marrow activity hampers the elucidation. Therefore, we focused on patients who had non-hematological cancer and no evidence of bone marrow suppression. METHODS: Twelve patients, who had lung cancer (four with small cell cancer and eight with non-small cell cancer) and who had not undergone any chemotherapy, were studied. During chemotherapy, we measured serum erythropoietin, serum iron, unsaturated iron binding capacity and hemoglobin concentration in these patients. RESULTS: The serum erythropoietin level before chemotherapy (10.8 +/- 7.4 mU/ml) was within the normal range but the peak values after the first treatment (73.4 +/- 90.4 mU/ml) increased in all patients. In the patients with small cell cancer, a transient but marked increase in erythropoietin value (204.6 +/- 167.3 mU/ml) was observed after each session of chemotherapy while hemoglobin concentration decreased gradually. Throughout treatments, elevation of the serum iron concentration and concomitant reduction of unsaturated iron binding capacity were observed after each session of chemotherapy. They regained their original values whilst the serum erythropoietin level decreased after each chemotherapy session was completed. CONCLUSIONS: It is suggested that the suppression of erythroid marrow by chemotherapeutic agents causes the changes in serum erythropoietin level during chemotherapy in patients with lung cancer.","['Sawabe, Y', 'Takiguchi, Y', 'Kikuno, K', 'Iseki, T', 'Ito, J', 'Iida, S', 'Kuriyama, T', 'Yonemitsu, H']","['Sawabe Y', 'Takiguchi Y', 'Kikuno K', 'Iseki T', 'Ito J', 'Iida S', 'Kuriyama T', 'Yonemitsu H']","['Division of Laboratory Medicine, Chiba University Hospital, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Jpn J Clin Oncol,Japanese journal of clinical oncology,0313225,IM,,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*blood/drug therapy', 'Carcinoma, Small Cell/*blood/drug therapy', 'Erythropoietin/*blood', 'Female', 'Hemoglobins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Iron/*blood/metabolism', 'Lung Neoplasms/*blood/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Binding']",1998/06/06 00:00,1998/06/06 00:01,['1998/06/06 00:00'],"['1998/06/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/06 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jjco/28.3.182 [doi]'],ppublish,Jpn J Clin Oncol. 1998 Mar;28(3):182-6. doi: 10.1093/jjco/28.3.182.,"['0 (Hemoglobins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: For six months randon and gamma radiation was measured with solid state nuclear track detectors and thermoluminescent dosimeters in dwellings of 44 adult male cases of acute myeloid leukaemia and 211 controls (all subjects deceased). Conditional logistic regression ORs (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated for quartiles of radon and gamma radiation and for municipality and dwelling characteristics. RESULTS: The risk of leukaemia was associated with an increasing urbanisation index (p value for trend = 0.008). An increased OR was found among those living in more modern houses (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.4 to 6.6). Confirming the findings of a previous study in the same area, geological features bore a positive association with myeloid leukemia, even by adjusting for level of urbanisation. Contrary to expectations from the previous study, however, no association appeared between myeloid leukaemia and radon and gamma radiation; for the highest quartiles of exposure, ORs were 0.56 (95% CI 0.2 to 1.4) and 0.52 (95% CI 0.2 to 1.4), respectively. Considering only subjects who had lived > or = 20 years in the monitored home and adjusting for urbanisation, there was still no effect of exposure to radiation. CONCLUSIONS: In view of the limited numbers, the results do not in general refute a possible risk of myeloid leukaemia from exposure to indoor radon or gamma radiation, but decrease the credibility of such a relation in the area studied and also of other studies suggesting an effect without monitoring indoor radiation. Some other fairly strong determinants have appeared--that is, level of urbanisation and living in modern houses--that might need further consideration.","['Forastiere, F', 'Sperati, A', 'Cherubini, G', 'Miceli, M', 'Biggeri, A', 'Axelson, O']","['Forastiere F', 'Sperati A', 'Cherubini G', 'Miceli M', 'Biggeri A', 'Axelson O']","['Department of Epidemiology, Lazio Regional Health Autority, Rome, Italy.

The aim of the present study was to examine the status of leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in day 6 gestational endometrium of rhesus monkeys with or without exposure to a single dose (2 mg/kg body weight, s.c.) of mifepristone on day 2 after ovulation. Densitometric analyses of immunoblots of endometrial spent media revealed an increase (P < 0.01) in TGF beta pan (TGF beta 1, 2, 3 and 5) and a decrease (P < 0.01) in VEGF secretion from RU486-exposed endometrial samples compared with control samples. Secretory profiles for LIF, TGF beta 1 and TGF beta 1 LAP (latency associated peptide) remained unchanged in the two treatment groups. Morphometric analyses of immunohistochemical staining showed altered cell-specific distribution. TGF beta 1 (P < 0.01) and TGF beta pan (P < 0.02) were higher, while VEGF declined (P < 0.05) in endometrial glands of RU486-exposed endometria compared with control tissue samples. Stromal cell staining patterns for all experimental cytokines studied remained unchanged. In blood vessels, VEGF was found to be low (P < 0.05), while LIF (P < 0.05) and TGF beta 1 (P < 0.01) were higher in mifepristone-exposed endometrial samples compared with control tissue samples. Increased TGF beta secretion together with elevated levels of TGF beta in glandular epithelia and in blood vessels with no apparent change in stromal levels of TGF beta or in levels of TGF beta LAP in any endometrial compartment in the two treatment groups suggest an altered paracrine involvement of this cytokine and an enhanced activation of latent TGF beta in endometrium following mifepristone treatment. Higher levels of TGF beta in gland cells may result in dysregulated growth control and degenerative morphology. Also, higher levels of LIF and TGF beta together with lower levels of VEGF in the vascular compartment in mifepristone-exposed endometrium suggest that endometrial vascular physiology is a target of this anti-progestin during the peri-implantation stage. It is thus plausible that LIF, TGF beta and VEGF in the glandular and vascular compartments of implantation stage endometrium play important roles in rendering the endometrium receptive, and that early luteal phase treatment with an anti-progestin such as mifepristone affects the involvement of these cytokines resulting in endometrial contraception.","['Ghosh, D', 'Kumar, P G', 'Sengupta, J']","['Ghosh D', 'Kumar PG', 'Sengupta J']","['Department of Physiology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Endocrinol,The Journal of endocrinology,0375363,IM,,"['Animals', 'Densitometry', '*Embryo Implantation', 'Endometrium/chemistry/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Endothelial Growth Factors/analysis/metabolism', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/analysis/metabolism', 'Growth Substances/analysis/*metabolism', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunohistochemistry', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Luteal Phase', 'Luteolytic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Lymphokines/analysis/metabolism', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Male', 'Mifepristone/*pharmacology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/analysis/metabolism', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors']",1998/06/06 00:00,1998/06/06 00:01,['1998/06/06 00:00'],"['1998/06/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/06 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1677/joe.0.1570115 [doi]'],ppublish,J Endocrinol. 1998 Apr;157(1):115-25. doi: 10.1677/joe.0.1570115.,"['0 (Endothelial Growth Factors)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Luteolytic Agents)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors)', '320T6RNW1F (Mifepristone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Risk factors for an adverse event in the entire cohort included a white-cell count of 200,000 per cubic millimeter or higher (P=0.004), race other than black or white (P<0.001), and the presence of a t(9;22) translocation (P=0.007). The toxic effects of augmented therapy were considerable but manageable. CONCLUSIONS: Augmented post-induction chemotherapy results in an excellent outcome for most patients with high-risk ALL and a slow response to initial therapy.","['Nachman, J B', 'Sather, H N', 'Sensel, M G', 'Trigg, M E', 'Cherlow, J M', 'Lukens, J N', 'Wolff, L', 'Uckun, F M', 'Gaynon, P S']","['Nachman JB', 'Sather HN', 'Sensel MG', 'Trigg ME', 'Cherlow JM', 'Lukens JN', 'Wolff L', 'Uckun FM', 'Gaynon PS']","['Section of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, University of Chicago, IL, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality/radiotherapy', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",1998/06/06 00:00,1998/06/06 00:01,['1998/06/06 00:00'],"['1998/06/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/06 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1056/NEJM199806043382304 [doi]'],ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1998 Jun 4;338(23):1663-71. doi: 10.1056/NEJM199806043382304.,,,,"['CA 02971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 17829/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,['N Engl J Med. 1998 Oct 8;339(15):1080-1.

The expressed protein had molecular mass of 37 kDa. Treatment of the protein with PNGase F produced a protein of molecular mass of 30 kDa, indicating that the protein contained asparagine-linked glycosylation. Sequence analysis of the expressed protein indicated that a 24-amino-acid signal peptide had been removed. A polyclonal antibody to the expressed enzyme was used in Western blot analysis of partially purified lysates of HL-60 promyeloid leukemia cells and MCF-7 breast cancer cells. The HL-60 and MCF-7 enzymes appeared as two closely spaced bands with a molecular mass of 37 kDa. Treatment of the HL-60 enzyme with PNGase F produced a protein with a molecular mass of 30 kDa. The activities of the expressed enzyme and the enzyme from HL-60 cells were similar on methotrexate polyglutamates. Methotrexate-gamma-Glu is a poor substrate for the human enzyme relative to methotrexate gamma-Glu2-5. During hydrolysis of methotrexate-gamma-Glu4, all possible pterin-containing cleavage products (methotrexate and methotrexate-gamma-Glu1-3) appear. The results demonstrated that the human enzyme cleaves both the ultimate and penultimate gamma-linkages of methotrexate polyglutamates. Glutamate was released as either glutamic acid or gamma-Glu2. Longer chain species of gamma-Glun>2 were not observed. Inhibition by iodoacetic acid suggested that both the expressed enzyme and the HL-60 enzyme may contain a catalytically essential cysteine. These results indicate that the identified cDNA encodes the intracellular gamma-glutamyl hydrolase found in a variety of human tumor cells and that the baculovirus-expressed enzyme is a suitable model for further structural and enzymatic studies.","['Rhee, M S', 'Lindau-Shepard, B', 'Chave, K J', 'Galivan, J', 'Ryan, T J']","['Rhee MS', 'Lindau-Shepard B', 'Chave KJ', 'Galivan J', 'Ryan TJ']","['Wadsworth Center, Division of Molecular Medicine, New York State Department of Health, Albany, New York 12201-0509, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,IM,,"['Animals', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Methotrexate/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Spodoptera', 'gamma-Glutamyl Hydrolase/*metabolism']",1998/06/17 00:00,1998/06/17 00:01,['1998/06/17 00:00'],"['1998/06/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/17 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 1998 Jun;53(6):1040-6.,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.19.9 (gamma-Glutamyl Hydrolase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,['CA25933/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Its high level of conservation among different species suggests that it serves functions fundamental to cell survival. The role originally proposed for CRT, i.e., the main Ca2+ buffer of the ER, has been obscured or even casted by its implication in processes as diverse as gene expression, protein folding, and cell adhesion. In this work we seek the role of CRT in Ca2+ storing and signaling by evaluating its effects on the kinetics and amplitude of the store-operated Ca2+ current (ICRAC). We show that, in the rat basophilic leukemia cell line RBL-1, overexpression of CRT, but not of its mutant lacking the high-capacity Ca2+-binding domain, markedly retards the ICRAC development, however, only when store depletion is slower than the rate of current activation. On the contrary, when store depletion is rapid and complete, overexpression of CRT has no effect. The present results are compatible with a major Ca2+-buffering role of CRT within the ER but exclude a direct, or indirect, role of this protein on the mechanism of ICRAC activation.","['Fasolato, C', 'Pizzo, P', 'Pozzan, T']","['Fasolato C', 'Pizzo P', 'Pozzan T']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences, National Research Center for Biomembranes, University of Padova, I-35121 Padova, Italy. fasolato@civ.bio.unipd.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Biol Cell,Molecular biology of the cell,9201390,IM,,"['Animals', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calcium Channels/*physiology', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Calreticulin', 'Chelating Agents/pharmacology', 'Egtazic Acid/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Electrophysiology', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate/pharmacology', 'Ionomycin/pharmacology', 'Ionophores/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Ribonucleoproteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/06/17 00:00,1998/06/17 00:01,['1998/06/17 00:00'],"['1998/06/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1091/mbc.9.6.1513 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Biol Cell. 1998 Jun;9(6):1513-22. doi: 10.1091/mbc.9.6.1513.,"['0 (Calcium Channels)', '0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Calreticulin)', '0 (Chelating Agents)', '0 (Ionophores)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Ribonucleoproteins)', '526U7A2651 (Egtazic Acid)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', '85166-31-0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate)', ""K22DDW77C0 (1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid)"", 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,['845/Telethon/Italy'],,PMC25376,,,,,,,,,

In these cells, cross-linking the high-affinity immunoglobulin E receptor (FcepsilonR1) leads to activation of phospholipase C gamma isoforms via tyrosine kinase- and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent pathways, release of InsP3-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ stores, and a sustained phase of Ca2+ influx. These events are accompanied by a redistribution of type II InsP3 receptors within the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear envelope, from a diffuse pattern with a few small aggregates in resting cells to large isolated clusters after antigen stimulation. Redistribution of type II InsP3 receptors is also seen after treatment of RBL-2H3 cells with ionomycin or thapsigargin. InsP3 receptor clustering occurs within 5-10 min of stimulus and persists for up to 1 h in the presence of antigen. Receptor clustering is independent of endoplasmic reticulum vesiculation, which occurs only at ionomycin concentrations >1 microM, and maximal clustering responses are dependent on the presence of extracellular calcium. InsP3 receptor aggregation may be a characteristic cellular response to Ca2+-mobilizing ligands, because similar results are seen after activation of phospholipase C-linked G-protein-coupled receptors; cholecystokinin causes type II receptor redistribution in rat pancreatoma AR4-2J cells, and carbachol causes type III receptor redistribution in muscarinic receptor-expressing hamster lung fibroblast E36(M3R) cells. Stimulation of these three cell types leads to a reduction in InsP3 receptor levels only in AR4-2J cells, indicating that receptor clustering does not correlate with receptor down-regulation. The calcium-dependent aggregation of InsP3 receptors may contribute to the previously observed changes in affinity for InsP3 in the presence of elevated Ca2+ and/or may establish discrete regions within refilled stores with varying capacity to release Ca2+ when a subsequent stimulus results in production of InsP3.","['Wilson, B S', 'Pfeiffer, J R', 'Smith, A J', 'Oliver, J M', 'Oberdorf, J A', 'Wojcikiewicz, R J']","['Wilson BS', 'Pfeiffer JR', 'Smith AJ', 'Oliver JM', 'Oberdorf JA', 'Wojcikiewicz RJ']","['Department of Pathology and Cancer Research and Treatment Center, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, New Mexico 87131, USA. bwilson@rapunzel.unm.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Biol Cell,Molecular biology of the cell,9201390,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/metabolism', 'Antigens/metabolism', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calcium Channels/*metabolism', 'Cell Fractionation', 'Cell Line', 'Centrifugation, Density Gradient', 'Cricetinae', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/metabolism', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate Receptors', 'Ionomycin/pharmacology', 'Isomerism', 'Nuclear Envelope', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/*metabolism', 'Sucrose', 'Thapsigargin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/06/17 00:00,1998/06/17 00:01,['1998/06/17 00:00'],"['1998/06/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1091/mbc.9.6.1465 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Biol Cell. 1998 Jun;9(6):1465-78. doi: 10.1091/mbc.9.6.1465.,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antigens)', '0 (Calcium Channels)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate Receptors)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', '57-50-1 (Sucrose)', '67526-95-8 (Thapsigargin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,"['GM50562/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HL56384/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM49814/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC25370,,,,,,,,,

In rat basophilic leukemia cells, emptying of the stores activates a highly selective Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ current (CRAC), ICRAC. We have recently found that ICRAC activates in an essentially all-or-none manner when the current is evoked by receptor stimulation, dialysis with inositol 1, 4,5-trisphosphate via the patch pipette, or through the Ca2+ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin (Parekh, A. B., Fleig, A., and Penner, R. (1997) Cell 89, 973-980). Regulatory mechanisms must therefore operate to control the overall amount of Ca2+ that enters through CRAC channels. Such mechanisms include membrane potential and protein kinase C. In the present study, we have investigated additional inhibitory pathways that serve to determine just how much Ca2+ can enter through ICRAC. We have directly measured the current using the whole cell patch clamp technique. We report the presence of a slow Ca2+-dependent inactivation mechanism that curtails Ca2+ entry through CRAC channels. This inactivation mechanism is switched on by Ca2+ entering through CRAC channels, and therefore constitutes a slow negative feedback process. Although it requires a rise in intracellular Ca2+ for activation, it maintains CRAC channels inactive even under conditions that lower intracellular Ca2+ levels. The inactivation mechanism does not involve store refilling, protein phosphorylation, G proteins, nor Ca2+-dependent enzymes. It accounts for up to 70% of the total inactivation of ICRAC, and therefore appears to be a dominant inhibitory mechanism. It is likely to be an important factor that shapes the profile of the Ca2+ signal in these nonexcitable cells.","['Parekh, A B']",['Parekh AB'],"['Department of Physiology, University of Oxford, Oxford OX1 3PT, United Kingdom. anant.parekh@physiol.ox.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,,"['Animals', 'Calcium/*pharmacokinetics', 'Calcium Channels/*physiology', 'Calcium-Transporting ATPases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Egtazic Acid/pharmacology', 'Electrophysiology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Feedback/physiology', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate/pharmacology', 'Ion Channels/drug effects/physiology', 'Ionomycin/pharmacology', 'Patch-Clamp Techniques', 'Rats', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Thapsigargin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/06/17 00:00,1998/06/17 00:01,['1998/06/17 00:00'],"['1998/06/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/17 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.273.24.14925 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)65372-X [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1998 Jun 12;273(24):14925-32. doi: 10.1074/jbc.273.24.14925.,"['0 (Calcium Channels)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Ion Channels)', '526U7A2651 (Egtazic Acid)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', '67526-95-8 (Thapsigargin)', '85166-31-0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate)', 'EC 7.2.2.10 (Calcium-Transporting ATPases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,

All samples were found to be bcl-2 positive, with a staining intensity that was moderate to strong in CLL and weak to moderate in HCL. 83% of CLL and 100% of HCL patients were responsive to purine analogues.

We have studied the chimerism pattern and the bcr/abl status by Southern-blot in 15 CML patients (M/F:6/9) transplanted with unmanipulated BM from HLA identical sibling donors, persistently bcr/abl positive by RT-PCR. The median age of the series was 31 years (18-49) and disease status at BMT was: chronic phase: 11, accelerated phase: 3 and blast crisis: 1 patient. Of the 15 patients, 9 are alive and in complete remission (CR), 4 have died in CR and 2 are alive but suffered relapse at + 19 and +26 months post-BMT. The median follow-up is 81 months (13,7-168). Rearrangement of the BCR gene was performed by Southern-blot using P32-labeled transprobe-1. PCR analysis of chimerism was assessed using primers for the following VNTR loci: D1S80, D1S111, 33.1, APO-B, YNZ-22, lambdag3 and DXS52. Seventy-nine samples were analyzed (median per patient 5 (range 2-9)). Thirteen patients showed complete chimerism and lacked BCR rearrangement over time by Southern-blot. The 2 patients who relapsed showed mixed chimera status from +9 and +5 months respectively until the end of the study. Persistent BCR rearrangement was observed in these 2 patients from +12 and +11 months respectively. Our data suggest that mixed chimerism may predict hematologic or cytogenetic relapse by several months in those patients who are persistently PCR-positive post-BMT.","['Roman, J', 'Martin, C', 'Torres, A', 'Garcia, A', 'Andres, P', 'Garcia, M J', 'Baiget, M']","['Roman J', 'Martin C', 'Torres A', 'Garcia A', 'Andres P', 'Garcia MJ', 'Baiget M']","['Department of Hematology, Reina Sofia Hospital, Cordoba, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,,"['Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/analysis/*genetics', 'Graft Survival/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/*pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Recurrence', 'Transplantation Chimera/*genetics', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1998/06/05 00:00,1998/06/05 00:01,['1998/06/05 00:00'],"['1998/06/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/05 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199809058362 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1998 Feb;28(5-6):541-50. doi: 10.3109/10428199809058362.,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clinical outcome with fewer infections have been reported in a few studies using rhG-CSF or rhGM-CSF, including a large randomized, controlled trial with rhGM-CSF. Clinical effective stimulation of megakaryopoiesis and erythropoiesis are however infrequent. Recently, rh erythropoietin (rhEpo) has been used to overcome the ineffective erythropoiesis in MDS to reduce transfusions needed. However, the efficiency has been low in most studies with marked differences in response rates. The most impressive clinical results were obtained in patients with milder forms of MDS combined with low prestudy endogenous S-Epo levels. The possible synergistic effect of combining rhEpo with rhG-CSF or rhGM-CSF has been studied with erythropoietic response rates of about 40%. The safety of the cytokine administration seems acceptable with no significant stimulation of leukemic myelopoiesis and subsequent progression into overt acute myeloid leukemia. In conclusion, combinations of hematopoietic growth factors may be of clinical benefit in some patients with MDS. However, due to the cost and unpredictable clinical outcome there is a need for extended laboratory research to understand the functional defects of MDS stem cells and progenitors.","['Hansen, P B', 'Penkowa, M', 'Johnsen, H E']","['Hansen PB', 'Penkowa M', 'Johnsen HE']","['Department of Hematology L, Herlev Hospital, University of Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,,"['Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/*therapeutic use', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",1998/06/05 00:00,1998/06/05 00:01,['1998/06/05 00:00'],"['1998/06/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/05 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199809058356 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1998 Feb;28(5-6):491-500. doi: 10.3109/10428199809058356.,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,57,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have shown a good correlation between circulating soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) levels and disease activity and response to therapy was always associated with a decrease in sIL-2R levels. The interleukin-1 (IL-1) family of agonists and antagonists may also be involved in the regulation of hematopoietic malignancies. In the present study, we evaluated members of the IL-1 family (IL-1beta, IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) and IL-1 soluble receptors Type I and Type II (IL-1sRI and IL-1sRII) in 23 patients with HCL. Patients were classified according to the clinical state of their disease. Most were treated with 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadercosine (2-CDA) and treatment was associated with a significant decrease in the serum levels of sIL-2R, IL-1beta and IL-1sRII in patients achieving a complete or partial response. In contrast to the above, levels of IL-1Ra increased during response to treatment and clinical response to 2-CDA was associated with an increase of 122% in IL-1Ra levels, in parallel with a decrease of 63% in IL-1beta and 47% in IL-1sRII levels. These results suggest that the balance between IL-1beta, IL-2 and their soluble receptors or antagonists may be involved in the pathogenesis and immunoregulation of HCL. Serum levels of these cytokines may therefore be used to monitor therapeutic efficacy of therapy in HCL and to detect any residual disease.","['Barak, V', 'Nisman, B', 'Polliack, A', 'Vannier, E', 'Dinarello, C A']","['Barak V', 'Nisman B', 'Polliack A', 'Vannier E', 'Dinarello CA']","['Department of Oncology, Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",France,Eur Cytokine Netw,European cytokine network,9100879,IM,,"['2-Chloroadenosine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Deoxyadenosines/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Interleukin 1 Receptor Antagonist Protein', 'Interleukin-1/*blood', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*blood/drug therapy', 'Receptors, Interleukin-1/blood/drug effects', 'Receptors, Interleukin-1 Type II', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Sialoglycoproteins/blood/drug effects']",1998/06/05 00:00,1998/06/05 00:01,['1998/06/05 00:00'],"['1998/06/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/05 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/05 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Eur Cytokine Netw. 1998 Mar;9(1):33-9.,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '0 (IL1RN protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin 1 Receptor Antagonist Protein)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-1)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-1 Type II)', '0 (Sialoglycoproteins)', '146-77-0 (2-Chloroadenosine)', ""JYW18Y92UP (2-chloro-3'-deoxyadenosine)""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They interact with transcriptional activators as well as repressors, direct chromatin-mediated transcription, function in TP53-mediated apoptosis, and participate in terminal differentiation of certain tissue types. Recent evidence suggests that the demand for CBP/p300 is greater than the supply, and that competition for CBP/p300 might play an important role in cell growth regulation. Alterations of the human CBP gene have been implicated in hematological malignancies as well as in congenital malformation and mental retardation. Likewise, the p300 gene has been recently implicated in leukemia and mutations in both alleles have been observed in gastric and colorectal carcinomas. The role of these proteins in human disease coupled with biochemical evidence suggests that CBP and p300 are tumor suppressor proteins essential in cell-cycle control, cellular differentiation and human development.","['Giles, R H', 'Peters, D J', 'Breuning, M H']","['Giles RH', 'Peters DJ', 'Breuning MH']","['Department of Human Genetics, Leiden University Medical Center, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Trends Genet,Trends in genetics : TIG,8507085,IM,,"['Animals', 'CREB-Binding Protein', 'Cell Division', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*physiology', '*Trans-Activators', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1998/06/05 00:00,1998/06/05 00:01,['1998/06/05 00:00'],"['1998/06/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/05 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/05 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0168-9525(98)01438-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s0168-9525(98)01438-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Trends Genet. 1998 May;14(5):178-83. doi: 10.1016/s0168-9525(98)01438-3.,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREB-Binding Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREBBP protein, human)']",,60,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three statistical complications are that the time to each non-fatal event and subsequent residual survival may be either positively or negatively associated, the times to death with or without an antecedent event often have very different distributions, and death may censor some of the non-fatal event times. Consequently, the overall survival time distribution is a mixture of the distributions corresponding to the possible antecedent non-fatal events. These conditions violate the usual assumptions underlying many statistical methods for analysing multivariate time-to-event data. In this paper, we consider a general parametric model for multiple non-fatal competing risks and death. The model accounts for positive or negative association between the time of each non-fatal event and subsequent survival while accommodating covariates and the usual administrative censoring. Each event time distribution is specified marginally by a three-parameter generalized odds rate model, and the time of each non-fatal event and subsequent residual survival are combined under a bivariate generalized von Morgenstern distribution. The approach is illustrated by application to two data sets from clinical trials in colon cancer and acute leukaemia.","['Shen, Y', 'Thall, P F']","['Shen Y', 'Thall PF']","['Department of Biomathematics, UT M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Stat Med,Statistics in medicine,8215016,IM,,"['Carcinoma/drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/statistics & numerical data', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Likelihood Functions', '*Models, Statistical', '*Multivariate Analysis', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/drug therapy/epidemiology', '*Survival Analysis']",1998/06/05 02:04,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/06/05 02:04'],"['1998/06/05 02:04 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/06/05 02:04 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0258(19980515)17:9<999::AID-SIM785>3.0.CO;2-3 [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0258(19980515)17:9<999::aid-sim785>3.0.co;2-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Stat Med. 1998 May 15;17(9):999-1015. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0258(19980515)17:9<999::aid-sim785>3.0.co;2-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AIMS: To determine whether advances in basic and clinical research into AML have translated into improved survival for patients in the community. METHODS: A retrospective survey of records of all patients with AML presenting to the Royal Melbourne Hospital (RMH) over a 16 year period, analysed according to induction therapy and established prognostic factors. Between 1980 and December 1996 223 (98%) of 227 patients were evaluable. RESULTS: The probability of survival at five years for patients treated since 1990 has improved significantly compared to the cohort treated between 1980-89 (34 +/- 5% vs 4 +/- 2%; mean +/- standard error). This benefit is most evident in patients less than 60 years of age (50 +/- 7% vs 11 +/- 4%). Successive induction protocols in the context of clinical trials conducted since 1985 contributed to improved outcomes. The selective application of bone marrow transplantation, and use of retinoic acid as induction therapy for acute promyelocytic leukaemia has also improved survival. Despite increases in dose-intensity, early death rates for patients undergoing induction therapy fell during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: Participation in clinical and basic research with the development of more intense and specific treatments for patients with AML has contributed to better outcomes, underpinned by improvements in supportive care.","['Thomas, D M', 'Seymour, J F', 'Szer, J', 'Grigg, A P', 'Basser, R L', 'Green, M D', 'Fox, R M']","['Thomas DM', 'Seymour JF', 'Szer J', 'Grigg AP', 'Basser RL', 'Green MD', 'Fox RM']","['Royal Melbourne Hospital, Department of Haematology and Medical Oncology, Parkville, Vic.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Australia,Aust N Z J Med,Australian and New Zealand journal of medicine,1264322,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Australia/epidemiology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis']",1998/06/05 00:00,1998/06/05 00:01,['1998/06/05 00:00'],"['1998/06/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/05 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1445-5994.1998.tb02968.x [doi]'],ppublish,Aust N Z J Med. 1998 Apr;28(2):190-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1445-5994.1998.tb02968.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In fact, interferons are intercellular signalling proteins produced by cells in response to various biological and synthetic stimuli. Three major classes of interferons have been identified: interferons alpha, beta and gamma. Interferons originate from natural sources and are products of recombinant technology. Two forms of recombinant alpha-interferons, 2a and 2b, are available. Alpha-interferons are secreted and synthetised by leucocytes and lymphoblasts. The objective herein is to review the current therapeutic implications of alpha-interferons. Interferons alpha have antiviral, anticancer and immunomodulatory activities. Clinical trials have proved interferons alpha to be of special value as adjuvant therapy (first line drugs) for hairy cell leukemia, virus hepatitis B and C and condylomata acuminata. The efficacy of interferons alpha is now also being evaluated in other malignancies and virus diseases. For instance, interferons alpha are an important advanced modality in the management of chronic myelogenous leukemia and can be considered a first-line therapy option in patients who cannot receive or relapse following allogenic bone marrow transplant. Of course, further research is also required to evaluate combination therapies with interferons alpha and other agents. Presently malignancies have the broadest potential in application of interferons alpha therapy. Hairy cell leukemia responds to interferons alpha in up to 90% of patients, Kaposi's sarcoma, which occurs primarily in association with AIDS, benefit in up to 40% of patents, lymphomas respond in about 65% of patients whereas chronic myelogeneous leukemia in more than 80% of patients in early cases. The uses of interferons alpha in infectious diseases (condylomaty acuminata, rhinovirus infection, protozoal, parasitic and fungal intracellular infections) may also be significant. However, the cost of interferons alpha is too high. This makes interferons alpha a second line therapy, but not in patients where it is more effective than alternative treatment. Interferons alpha are cytokines (intercellular signalling proteins) which have antiviral, anticancer and immunomodulatory activities. Interferons alpha therapy represents an important advanced modality in the management of patients with hematological diseases, malignancies, lymphomas, solid malignant tumours and viral infections. Clinical trials have proved interferons alpha to be of special value as first line drugs for hairy cell leukemia, virus hepatitis B and C and condylomata accuminata. Interferons alpha are used as single primary therapy, adjuvant therapy and maintenance therapy. The limiting factor for the application of interferons alpha is the cost of treatment.","['Bajcetic, M', 'Zigon, N', 'Samardzic, R', 'Beleslin, D B']","['Bajcetic M', 'Zigon N', 'Samardzic R', 'Beleslin DB']","['Institut za klinicku farmakologiju, farmakologiju i toksikologiju, Medicinski fakultet, Beograd.']",['hrv'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Serbia,Med Pregl,Medicinski pregled,2985249R,IM,,"['Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Virus Diseases/drug therapy']",1998/06/05 00:00,1998/06/05 00:01,['1998/06/05 00:00'],"['1998/06/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/05 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/05 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Med Pregl. 1998 Mar-Apr;51(3-4):135-9.,['0 (Interferon-alpha)'],Alfa interferoni--nove terapijske mogucnosti.,19,,,,,,,,,,,,

It represents the acquired megakaryocytic thrombocytopenia with the shortened life of platelets because of immunologic damage (antibodies absorbed by platelets). In the case of this acquired hemorrhagic disorder, in spite of compensatory increased function of the bone marrow, there is a reduced number of platelets because of their increased destruction by the reticuloendothelial system (destructive thrombocytopenia). There are three forms of ITP: acute, chronic and intermittent. The acute form occurs in 80-90% of cases with bleeding episodes lasting a few days or weeks, but no longer than 6 months. The chronic form occurs in 10-15% of children, while the rarest-intermittent form is characterized by periods of normalization in regard to the number of platelets but also with relapse in intervals of 1-3 months. The disease is caused by an immunological disorder in the sense of an imbalanced immune response. Immunologic damages of platelets cause shortening of the opsonized platelets life span. The most frequent platelet opsonins are the immumoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies directed at the platelet membrane in the form of autoantibodies, alloantibodies or possibly absorbed antigen caused by microorganism infection or drug intake. CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS: It is typical for the phenomenon of bleeding that it starts suddenly and without any other sign of illness. The most frequent acute form appears between the second and fourth year, and is characterized by seasonal occurrence usually after acute viral infections. Children older than 10 years of age, like adults, often have the chronic form associated with other immunologic disorders. The disease affects girls more often than boys (about three times more often) with moderate and constant increase of antiplatelet antibodies. Hemorrhagic manifestations include: petechiae, purpura, epistaxis, gastrointestinal and genitourinary bleeding. They depend on the grade of thrombocytopenia, although there is no strict correlation between the number of platelets and volume of bleeding. Low mortality of the acute ITP is almost exclusively due to intracranial hemorrhage. LABORATORY STUDIES: Thrombocytopenia represents a decrease in the number of blood platelets being a basic abnormality of the blood count. The half-life of platelets in ITP is shortened. Detection of antiplatelet antibodies is connected with technical difficulties, so they are established in about 30% of cases. Bleeding time is prolonged and so is the coagulum retraction which may be completely missed. The Rumpel-Leede test is positive. Clinical differentiation of drug-induced thrombocytopenia is not possible. However, other differential diagnostic possibilities are thrombotic-thrombocytopenic purpura and hemolytic-uremic syndrome. A child with aplastic anemia or acute leukemia, beside thrombocytopenia, has a characteristic finding of white and red blood cell count. Thrombocytopenia with absent radii syndrome is associated with skeletal system abnormalities. TREATMENT: New knowledge about the role of the immune system in ITP determines the modern therapeutic modalities. In cases of acute ITP in children, there are two therapeutic options or therapies of choice: corticosteroids and high doses of intravenous immunoglobulin. Immunosupressive therapy means anti Rh(D) immunoglobulin, cyclosporine, cytostatics, danazol, loaded platelets. In cases of distinctive hemorrhagic syndrome there are also indications for platelet transfusion. Nowadays splenectomy is more restricted, because one third of cases is unsuccessful, whereas plasmapheresis is rarely used in children because of possible complications. CONCLUSION: ITP is the most frequent hemorrhagic disease in children. The disease is basically caused by an immunologic disorder with platelet destruction due to increased immunoglobulin on their membrane.

They exhibit pharmacological properties which were not predicted from the constituents of the conjugates. Cytotoxicity and calmodulin antagonism of N1-dansylspermine were especially impressive. Calmodulin antagonism implies that N1-dansylspermine prevents induction of ornithine decarboxylase and inhibits its own active uptake via the polyamine transport system. Structure-activity considerations demonstrated that an aromatic character of the substituent is not required; amide bond formation with an aliphatic sulfonic acid is sufficient to transform spermine into a highly toxic calmodulin antagonist. Cytotoxicity and calmodulin antagonism are properties which are intrinsic to spermine, but they are observed only at very high concentrations. Amide bond formation at N1 with a lipophilic residue appears to 'amplify' these normally latent properties. The use of polyamine conjugates structurally related to the amides described in this work for targeting tumours may be marred by their calmodulin antagonism.","['Seiler, N', 'Douaud, F', 'Renault, J', 'Delcros, J G', 'Havouis, R', 'Uriac, P', 'Moulinoux, J P']","['Seiler N', 'Douaud F', 'Renault J', 'Delcros JG', 'Havouis R', 'Uriac P', 'Moulinoux JP']","['Groupe de Recherche en Therapeutique Anticancereuse, UPRES-A CNRS 6027, Faculte de Medecine, Universite de Rennes, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Int J Biochem Cell Biol,The international journal of biochemistry & cell biology,9508482,IM,,"[""3',5'-Cyclic-AMP Phosphodiesterases/antagonists & inhibitors"", '*Amine Oxidase (Copper-Containing)', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Biological Transport, Active/drug effects', 'Calmodulin/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Cattle', 'Dansyl Compounds/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Mice', 'Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donors/metabolism', 'Polyamines/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Putrescine/metabolism', 'Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Spermine/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Sulfonamides/chemistry/metabolism/pharmacology']",1998/06/05 00:00,1998/06/05 00:01,['1998/06/05 00:00'],"['1998/06/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/05 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/05 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1357-2725(97)00150-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s1357-2725(97)00150-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Biochem Cell Biol. 1998 Mar;30(3):393-406. doi: 10.1016/s1357-2725(97)00150-7.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Calmodulin)', '0 (Dansyl Compounds)', '0 (N(1)-dansylspermine)', '0 (Polyamines)', '0 (Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '2FZ7Y3VOQX (Spermine)', 'EC 1.4.3.21 (Amine Oxidase (Copper-Containing))', 'EC 1.5.- (Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donors)', ""EC 3.1.4.17 (3',5'-Cyclic-AMP Phosphodiesterases)"", 'V10TVZ52E4 (Putrescine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Persistent changes in gene expression were examined after exposure of cells of a murine bone marrow stromal cell line to ionizing radiation. Analysis of mRNA transcript levels by differential display led to the identification of a band, C122, which increased in abundance 1 week after exposure. Northern blot hybridization verified these results and revealed a 12-fold increase in abundance of this message for up to 3 weeks after irradiation in vitro. DNA sequence analysis identified clone C122 as murine serum amyloid A 3 (Saa3), a member of the Saa family of acute-phase or inflammatory response genes. Saa message levels were then examined in vivo in the bone marrow of mice exposed to total-body irradiation. Semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction revealed a 15-20-fold increase in Saa3 message levels in the bone marrow of irradiated mice from 3 days to 2 weeks after exposure. Saa3 message levels continued to be 2-3-fold above control for up to 28 weeks in vivo. Two additional members of the murine Saa gene family, Saa1 and Saa2, were also detected in irradiated bone marrow. The expression of SAA1 and SAA2 was also detected in irradiated cells of human bone marrow stromal cell lines in vitro. These results suggest that SAA genes are involved in the radiation response in the bone marrow, but their role in the recovery of the marrow after irradiation or in the development of radiation-induced hematopoietic disorders remains to be established. Additionally, the persistent radiation-induced increase in expression suggests the potential utility of using SAA3 transcript levels as a molecular marker of past radiation exposure.","['Goltry, K L', 'Epperly, M W', 'Greenberger, J S']","['Goltry KL', 'Epperly MW', 'Greenberger JS']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Pennsylvania 15261, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,IM,,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*radiation effects', 'Cell Line', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hematopoiesis/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Serum Amyloid A Protein/*genetics', 'Stromal Cells/radiation effects']",1998/06/04 00:00,1998/06/04 00:01,['1998/06/04 00:00'],"['1998/06/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/04 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/04 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Radiat Res. 1998 Jun;149(6):570-8.,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Serum Amyloid A Protein)']",,,"['CA39851/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DE08798/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

The amount of both soluble and insoluble long-chain polyphosphate in unstimulated osteoblast-like cells was higher than in human gingival cells, erythrocytes, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and human blood plasma. The cellular content of polyphosphate in osteoblast-like cells strongly decreased after a combined treatment of the cells with the stimulators of osteoblast proliferation and differentiation, dexamethasone, beta-glycerophosphate, epidermal growth factor, and ascorbic acid. The amount of soluble long-chain polyphosphate, but not the amount of insoluble long-chain polyphosphate, further decreased after an additional treatment with 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3). The decrease in polyphosphate content during treatment with dexamethasone, beta-glycerophosphate, epidermal growth factor, and ascorbic acid was accompanied by a decrease in exopolyphosphatase, pyrophosphatase, and alkaline phosphatase activity. However, additional treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3 resulted in an increase in these enzyme activities. Osteoblast-like cell exopolyphosphatase activity and exopolyphosphatase activity in yeast, rat tissues, and human leukemia cell line HL60 were inhibited by the bisphosphonates etidronate and, to a lesser extent, clodronate and pamidronate. From our results, we assume that inorganic polyphosphate may be involved in modulation of the mineralization process in bone tissue.","['Leyhausen, G', 'Lorenz, B', 'Zhu, H', 'Geurtsen, W', 'Bohnensack, R', 'Muller, W E', 'Schroder, H C']","['Leyhausen G', 'Lorenz B', 'Zhu H', 'Geurtsen W', 'Bohnensack R', 'Muller WE', 'Schroder HC']","['Poliklinik fur Zahnerhaltung und Parodontologie, Medizinische Hochschule, Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Bone Miner Res,Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research,8610640,IM,,"['Acid Anhydride Hydrolases/metabolism', 'Alkaline Phosphatase/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Calcitriol/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Diphosphonates/pharmacology', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/pharmacology', 'Etidronic Acid/pharmacology', 'Glycerophosphates/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Inorganic Pyrophosphatase', 'Mandible/cytology/metabolism', 'Osteoblasts/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Polyphosphates/*metabolism', 'Pyrophosphatases/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Solubility']",1998/06/04 00:00,1998/06/04 00:01,['1998/06/04 00:00'],"['1998/06/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/04 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/04 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1359/jbmr.1998.13.5.803 [doi]'],ppublish,J Bone Miner Res. 1998 May;13(5):803-12. doi: 10.1359/jbmr.1998.13.5.803.,"['0 (Diphosphonates)', '0 (Glycerophosphates)', '0 (Polyphosphates)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)', 'EC 3.6.- (Acid Anhydride Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Pyrophosphatases)', 'EC 3.6.1.1 (Inorganic Pyrophosphatase)', 'EC 3.6.1.11 (exopolyphosphatase)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'M2F465ROXU (Etidronic Acid)', 'WWH06G87W6 (beta-glycerophosphoric acid)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mice not bearing plasmacytoma treated with an identical dose of melphalan chemotherapy did not exhibit such abnormalities. In the present study we show that plasmacytoma-regressor mice (PRM) contain preleukemic cells which do not progress to leukemia in these mice. However, adoptive transfer of splenocytes originating in PRM to preirradiated but otherwise untreated syngeneic recipients resulted in the development of overt leukemia in these recipients. The presence of leukemia in the primary recipient mice was ascertained by blood counts as well as by spleen histology. Furthermore, splenocytes from the irradiated primary recipients adoptively transferred to non-irradiated secondary recipients caused leukemia formation in 100% of the secondary recipients. Sex chromosome analysis of the leukemic cells in the irradiated primary recipients clearly showed that they originated in the PRM donors. Two leukemic lines were established from leukemias developing in the secondary recipients and both expressed surface markers of hematopoietic progenitor cells as well as markers of T cells. We suggest that PRM could serve as an animal model to investigate development of chemotherapy-related leukemia in humans.","['Sagi-Assif, O', 'Trakhtenbrot, L', 'Douer, D', 'Witz, I P']","['Sagi-Assif O', 'Trakhtenbrot L', 'Douer D', 'Witz IP']","['Department of Cell Research and Immunology, George S.

A primary reason is the gender bias that has been inherent in medical education, research and clinical practice. The prevailing medical viewpoint has often been that the male body is considered to be the norm and that the female body exactly the same except for the reproductive function. This attitude has led to a lack of interest in researching gender differences and a consequent lack of knowledge of women's health issues. Fortunately, there is a movement for change. The Women's Health Interschool Curriculum Committee was formed in January 1992 to develop curricula concerning women's health and examine bias that may exist in existing curricula. The Canadian Women's Health Network has been growing across the country and there have been calls to create a new specialty in women's health. According to Angell, this proposal for a new specialty was provocatively debated in the Journal of Women's Health, which started publication in 1992. There is also a growing concern on how to conduct better research to address women's health needs. As more attention is paid to women's health issues, what will happen in the area of oral health? In health care, it would seem that the mouth has become completely separated from the rest of the body. Health conferences rarely have any oral health content at all. To correct this problem, there must be an increase in general awareness of the importance of oral health as it relates to the overall health of both women and men. Good oral health is more than just decay-free teeth. Oral health encompasses the teeth, the supporting periodontal structures, soft tissues of the mouth and oral pharynx area, temporomandibular joints and muscles of mastication. The mouth is a gateway to the body and will also reflect many systemic health problems, such as diabetes, leukemia and lupus. The second step would be the recognition that women may have different oral health needs and issues than men. The common view may be that teeth are gender free, but how can this be when teeth exist in a body, and that body is male or female? For many years, the primary acknowledged difference between men and women's oral health was pregnancy gingivitis. Like medicine, dentistry must re-examine the viewpoint that women's oral health differs from men's only as it is influenced by reproductive processes. There are many areas where women's oral health may differ from that of men. This paper will explore the literature for potential women's oral health issues in the areas of oral hygiene behaviours, esthetics, eating disorders, temporomandibular disorders, and hormonal influences on periodontal health.","['Covington, P']",['Covington P'],,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Canada,Probe,"Probe (Ottawa, Ont.)",8703585,,,"['Aging/physiology', 'Canada/epidemiology', 'Esthetics, Dental', 'Feeding and Eating Disorders/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Gonadal Steroid Hormones/physiology', 'Health Behavior', 'Humans', 'Life Change Events', '*Oral Health', 'Periodontal Diseases/epidemiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Sex Factors', 'Temporomandibular Joint Disorders/epidemiology', ""*Women's Health"", 'Xerostomia/epidemiology']",1996/09/01 00:00,1998/06/04 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/04 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Probe. 1996 Sep-Oct;30(5):173-7.,['0 (Gonadal Steroid Hormones)'],,28,,,,,,,,,,,,

EORTC Quality of Life Study Group.,291-300,"The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Study Group has adopted a modular approach to quality of life (QoL) assessment in cancer clinical trials. The core instrument (the EORTC QLQ-C30) covers a range of QoL issues relevant to a broad spectrum of patients with cancer. The QLQ-C30 is designed to be supplemented by more specific subscales ('modules') to assess aspects of QoL of particular importance to specific subgroups of patients. Since individual members of the study group were to be involved in module development, guidelines were established. The primary aim of these guidelines was to standardize the module development process in order to ensure uniformly high quality across modules. This paper gives an update of the work completed to date. First, while the guidelines proved practical for module development, producing modules that exhibit adequate levels of psychometric and cross-cultural validity, experience pointed to three areas where the guidelines required more precision. These amendments will be provided and include (1) stricter monitoring of the developmental process from within the study group, (2) the explicit requirement of involvement of the study group and (3) a more precise definition of the criteria to be fulfilled before modules are allowed to be called 'EORTC modules'. Second, an overview of the modules currently under development or available for general use is provided. These modules include those for body image, high-dose chemotherapy, leukaemia, myeloma, palliative care and the following cancers: bladder, brain, breast, colorectal, head and neck, lung, oesophageal, ophthalmic, ovarian, pancreas and prostate. Finally, the need for the coordination of efforts in module development, both from within and outside the EORTC, is discussed.","['Sprangers, M A', 'Cull, A', 'Groenvold, M', 'Bjordal, K', 'Blazeby, J', 'Aaronson, N K']","['Sprangers MA', 'Cull A', 'Groenvold M', 'Bjordal K', 'Blazeby J', 'Aaronson NK']","['Department of Medical Psychology, Academic Hospital, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Qual Life Res,"Quality of life research : an international journal of quality of life aspects of treatment, care and rehabilitation",9210257,IM,,"['Algorithms', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/*standards', 'Cross-Cultural Comparison', 'Guidelines as Topic', 'Humans', 'International Agencies', 'Neoplasms/*psychology/therapy', 'Program Development', 'Psychometrics', '*Quality of Life', 'Surveys and Questionnaires/*standards']",1998/06/04 00:00,1998/06/04 00:01,['1998/06/04 00:00'],"['1998/06/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/04 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/04 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1024977728719 [doi]'],ppublish,Qual Life Res. 1998 May;7(4):291-300. doi: 10.1023/a:1024977728719.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytogenetic analysis or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) can help in discriminating between these rare haematological disorders, but often treatment decisions cannot wait for the results of these time-consuming techniques. Recently, we and others found Wilms' tumour (WT1) gene expression to be increased in virtually all patients with acute leukaemias, whereas normal haemopoietic progenitors express the WT1 gene at much lower levels or not at all. To determine whether detection of WT1 gene expression is useful to distinguish EoL from HES patients, we analysed, by RT-PCR, bone marrow or blood mononuclear cells from EoL (n=3), HES (n=3) and reactive eosinophilia patients (n = 4) for WT1 gene expression. Using our WT1-RT-PCR protocol, we found WT1 gene expression to be restricted to EoL patients. By detecting WT1 mRNA transcripts in the cerebrospinal fluid using RT-PCR, we were also able to diagnose isolated CNS-relapsed leukaemia, initially confused with bacterial meningitis, in an EoL patient. In conclusion, we show that WT1-RT-PCR is a powerful complementary diagnostic tool to distinguish acute eosinophilic leukaemia from the hypereosinophilic syndromes. This observation needs confirmation in a larger series of EoL and HES patients.","['Menssen, H D', 'Renkl, H J', 'Rieder, H', 'Bartelt, S', 'Schmidt, A', 'Notter, M', 'Thiel, E']","['Menssen HD', 'Renkl HJ', 'Rieder H', 'Bartelt S', 'Schmidt A', 'Notter M', 'Thiel E']","['Medizinische Klinik III, Hamatologie, Onkologie und Transfusionsmedizin, Universitatsklinikum Benjamin Franklin der Freien Universitat Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,,"['Adult', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/diagnosis', 'Child', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', '*Genes, Wilms Tumor', 'Humans', 'Hypereosinophilic Syndrome/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Leukemia, Eosinophilic, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis']",1998/06/03 00:00,1998/06/03 00:01,['1998/06/03 00:00'],"['1998/06/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.00701.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1998 May;101(2):325-34. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.00701.x.,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Seroconversion to BA21 protein was also documented. PCR analyses confirmed the low incidence of protypical HTLV sequences (2/41, 5%). These data document an association between BA21 seroreactivity and LGL leukaemia.

The aim of our study was to evaluate the production of LIF by culturing blood cells from patients with ARDS. PATIENTS: 8 patients with ARDS, 8 patients with pneumonia and 5 healthy subjects. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: The blood samples were taken on day 1 after onset of ARDS. LIF was measured, in the cell-free supernatant, with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay after 24 h, 48 h and 72 h of blood cell culture. LIF was detectable in some patients in the ARDS group: at i) at 24 h and 48 h: in 2 patients ii) at 72 h in 4/5 patients (140 +/- 231 pg/ml). Only in the 4 patients in whom LIF was measured at 72 h was ARDS associated with the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Furthermore, among the 5 patients with ARDS who subsequently died, 4 had a detectable LIF. CONCLUSIONS: We have observed that LIF was produced only in ARDS, but not in all patients. The production of LIF seems to be a good indicator of the severity of ARDS. These preliminary results must be confirmed by a larger study.","['Gruson, D', 'Hilbert, G', 'Juzan, M', 'Taupin, J L', 'Coulon, V', 'Moreau, J F', 'Gualde, N', 'Gbikpi-Benissan, G']","['Gruson D', 'Hilbert G', 'Juzan M', 'Taupin JL', 'Coulon V', 'Moreau JF', 'Gualde N', 'Gbikpi-Benissan G']","['Reanimation medicale B, Hopital Pellegrin, Bordeaux, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Intensive Care Med,Intensive care medicine,7704851,IM,,"['Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/*blood', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Organ Failure/etiology', 'Pneumonia/blood/immunology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Respiratory Distress Syndrome/*blood/complications/*immunology/mortality', 'Time Factors']",1998/06/03 00:00,1998/06/03 00:01,['1998/06/03 00:00'],"['1998/06/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s001340050582 [doi]'],ppublish,Intensive Care Med. 1998 Apr;24(4):366-8. doi: 10.1007/s001340050582.,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite most cases are secondary to non-immune causes, the most serious is that associated to alloimmunization. The incidence and consequences of HLA and non-HLA (platelet specific) antibodies are unknown in our country. AIM: To prospectively determine the frequency and characteristics of post transfusion alloimmunization and the incidence of platelet specific antibodies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty one adults and 24 children with a recently diagnosed malignancy and undergoing chemotherapy that required multiple transfusions were studied. Screening for antiplatelet antibodies (platelet membrane ELISA) was performed before the first transfusion, every four weeks or whenever the 1 hour corrected count increment for platelet transfusions was lower than 5000. Platelet specific antibodies were identified with a monoclonal antibody-specific immobilization of platelet antigens (MAIPA), with anti-GPIb, GPIIb/IIIa, GPIa/Iia and anti-HLA class I. RESULTS: Adult patients received an average of 10.2 +/- 5.5 units of red blood cells and 58.6 +/- 35.4 units of platelets. Children received 4.8 +/- 3.7 units of red blood cells and 9.6 +/- 6.7 units of platelets. HLA antibodies appeared in 7 of 41 adult patients (17%), platelet specific alloantibodies were found in two patients (one anti GP Ia/IIa and one anti GP Ib). Platelet refractoriness appeared in three alloimmunized patients. No child had detectable serum antibodies during follow up. CONCLUSIONS: Platelet transfusion refractoriness of immune origin occurs infrequently in our population and the presence of platelet antibodies does not mean that it will appear. The use of leukocyte depleted blood components to prevent refractoriness cannot be justified at this time.","['Pereira, J', 'Bronfman, L', 'Bertin, P', 'Marzouka, E', 'Hidalgo, P', 'Amaya, S', 'Mezzano, D']","['Pereira J', 'Bronfman L', 'Bertin P', 'Marzouka E', 'Hidalgo P', 'Amaya S', 'Mezzano D']","['Departamento de Hematologia-Oncologia, Escuela de Medicina P Universidad Catolica de Chile, Santiago. jpereira@osler.med.uc.cl']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Chile,Rev Med Chil,Revista medica de Chile,0404312,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anemia, Aplastic/*immunology/*therapy', 'Antibody Specificity/immunology', 'Antigens, Human Platelet/*immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'HLA Antigens/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Isoantibodies/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Platelet Transfusion/*adverse effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology/*therapy', 'Prospective Studies']",1998/06/03 00:00,1998/06/03 00:01,['1998/06/03 00:00'],"['1998/06/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/03 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Rev Med Chil. 1997 Nov;125(11):1305-12.,"['0 (Antigens, Human Platelet)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Isoantibodies)']",Aloinmunizacion plaquetaria en pacientes onco-hematologicos politransfundidos: estudio prospectivo en adultos y ninos.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For untreated female F344 rats, the most frequently occurring neoplasms were pituitary gland neoplasms (54.2%), mammary gland fibroadenoma (41.2%), and mononuclear cell leukemia (28.1%). The most frequently occurring neoplasms in untreated male B6C3F1 mice were liver adenoma/carcinoma (42.2%), lung adenoma/carcinoma (20.5%), and malignant lymphoma (8.3%). For untreated female B6C3F1 mice, the most frequently occurring neoplasms were liver adenoma/carcinoma (23.6%), malignant lymphoma (20.9%), and pituitary gland adenoma/carcinoma (14.8%). The tumor rates observed in feeding study (untreated) and inhalation study (chamber) control rats were generally similar. The major exceptions were pituitary gland tumors and testicular adenoma in male F344 rats. The overall incidence of testicular adenoma was much lower in chamber controls (69.4%) than in feeding study controls (89.1%), whereas pituitary gland neoplasm showed the opposite trend (60.7% vs 30.4%). The most likely explanation for this difference is related to the individual housing of chamber controls and the group housing of feeding study controls. Differences in diagnostic criteria may influence reported tumor rates. To ensure consistency and comparability of tumor diagnosis from study to study, the NTP uses rigorous histopathology quality assurance and peer review procedures. Biological factors such as body weight may also affect tumor incidence. For example, increased body weights are associated with increased incidences of certain site-specific neoplasms, especially pituitary gland and mammary gland neoplasms in rats and liver tumors in mice. The presence of Helicobacter hepaticus has been associated with an increased incidence of liver neoplasms in male B6C3F1 mice. Other factors that may produce differences in control tumor rates from study to study include diet, environmental factors, genetic drift, study duration, and survival differences. The NTP database provides historical control data that may be useful in the evaluation of possible chemically related changes in tumor incidence. However, it is essential that the study being evaluated be comparable to those in the NTP database with respect to those factors that are known to influence tumor occurrence.","['Haseman, J K', 'Hailey, J R', 'Morris, R W']","['Haseman JK', 'Hailey JR', 'Morris RW']","['Biostatistics Branch, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Toxicol Pathol,Toxicologic pathology,7905907,IM,,"['Animals', 'Body Weight', 'Female', 'Male', 'Mice', '*Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/pathology/*veterinary', 'Rats', '*Rats, Inbred F344', 'Rodent Diseases/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Survival Rate']",1998/06/03 00:00,1998/06/03 00:01,['1998/06/03 00:00'],"['1998/06/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/019262339802600318 [doi]'],ppublish,Toxicol Pathol. 1998 May-Jun;26(3):428-41. doi: 10.1177/019262339802600318.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aims of this study were to analyse the characteristics of this particular type of infection in a large series of a single institution and to determine the factors associated with the outcome and therapeutic response. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study reviews the clinical and microbiological features of 155 IFI occurred among 144 patients with hematologic disorders throughout a period of 17 years in a single institution. RESULTS: In 118 cases (82%) the diagnosis was acute leukemia. The main risk factors for developing IFI included a persistent and profound granulocytopenia, the use of broad-spectrum antibacterial agents, indwelling central venous catheters and the damage of normal host barriers following intensive cytotoxic chemotherapy. Candida (65 cases [44%]) and Aspergillus (38 cases [26%]) species were the most common fungal species isolated. An increasing number of IFI were caused by fungi previously considered as contaminants or harmless colonizers. The outcome of IFI was favourable in 78 cases (50%). The most important prognostic factors for the outcome of the IFI were the phase of cytotoxic chemotherapy (p = 0.005), the response of the underlying disease to the cytotoxic chemotherapy (p < 0.00001), and the recovery of neutropenia during the infection course (p < 0.00001). An earlier use of empirical antifungal therapy was also associated with a better outcome. CONCLUSIONS: In spite of earlier treatment and regardless the development of new antifungal agents, the prognosis of IFI in patients with hematological malignancies remains poor. The use of hematopoietic growth factors, through their impact in the duration and severity of neutropenia, may prove valuable the management of IFI in this setting.","['Lopez, F', 'Jarque, I', 'Martin, G', 'Sanz, G F', 'Palau, J', 'Martinez, J', 'de la Rubia, J', 'Larrea, L', 'Arnao, M', 'Solves, P', 'Cervera, J', 'Martinez, M L', 'Peman, J', 'Gobernado, M', 'Sanz, M A']","['Lopez F', 'Jarque I', 'Martin G', 'Sanz GF', 'Palau J', 'Martinez J', 'de la Rubia J', 'Larrea L', 'Arnao M', 'Solves P', 'Cervera J', 'Martinez ML', 'Peman J', 'Gobernado M', 'Sanz MA']","['Servicios de Hematologia y Microbiologia, Hospital Universitario La Fe, Valencia.']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Spain,Med Clin (Barc),Medicina clinica,0376377,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications/diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/*complications', 'Neutropenia/*complications/diagnosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Severity of Illness Index']",1998/06/03 00:00,1998/06/03 00:01,['1998/06/03 00:00'],"['1998/06/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/03 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Med Clin (Barc). 1998 Mar 28;110(11):401-5.,,Infecciones fungicas invasoras en pacientes con hemopatias.,,,,,['Med Clin (Barc). 1998 Mar 28;110(11):416-8.

Children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) are predisposed to juvenile chronic myelogenous leukemia (JCML) and other malignant myeloid disorders, and heterozygous Nf1 knockout mice spontaneously develop a myeloid disorder that resembles JCML. Both human and murine leukemias show loss of the normal allele. JCML cells and Nf1-/- hematopoietic cells isolated from fetal livers selectively form abnormally high numbers of colonies derived from granulocyte-macrophage progenitors in cultures supplemented with low concentrations of granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Taken together, these data suggest that neurofibromin is required to downregulate Ras activation in myeloid cells exposed to GM-CSF. We have investigated the growth and proliferation of purified populations of hematopoietic progenitor cells isolated from Nf1 knockout mice in response to the cytokines interleukin (IL)-3 and stem cell factor (SCF), as well as to GM-CSF. We found abnormal proliferation of both immature and lineage-restricted progenitor populations, and we observed increased synergy between SCF and either IL-3 or GM-CSF in Nf1-/- progenitors. Nf1-/- fetal livers also showed an absolute increase in the numbers of immature progenitors. We further demonstrate constitutive activation of the Ras-Raf-MAP (mitogen-activated protein) kinase signaling pathway in primary c-kit+ Nf1-/- progenitors and hyperactivation of MAP kinase after growth factor stimulation. The results of these experiments in primary hematopoietic cells implicate Nf1 as playing a central role in regulating the proliferation and survival of primitive and lineage-restricted myeloid progenitors in response to multiple cytokines by modulating Ras output.","['Zhang, Y Y', 'Vik, T A', 'Ryder, J W', 'Srour, E F', 'Jacks, T', 'Shannon, K', 'Clapp, D W']","['Zhang YY', 'Vik TA', 'Ryder JW', 'Srour EF', 'Jacks T', 'Shannon K', 'Clapp DW']","['Department of Pediatrics, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana 46202, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,IM,,"['Animals', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Cell Division', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', 'Macrophages/drug effects', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neurofibromin 1', 'Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Stem Cell Factor/*pharmacology']",1998/06/10 00:00,1998/06/10 00:01,['1998/06/10 00:00'],"['1998/06/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.187.11.1893 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1998 Jun 1;187(11):1893-902. doi: 10.1084/jem.187.11.1893.,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Neurofibromin 1)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))']",,,"['P50DK49218/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R29 CA-74177-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC2212307,,,,,,,,,

Up to 6 mo of age, hyperplasia in lpr and gld mice results from the predominant accumulation of polyclonal T cell subsets and smaller numbers of polyclonal B cells and plasma cells.

By 1 yr of age, approximately 60% of BALB-gld and 30% of C3H-gld mice had monoclonal B cell populations that grew and metastasized in scid recipients but in most cases were rejected by immunocompetent mice. The tumors developed in a milieu greatly enriched for plasma cells, CD23- B cells and immunodeficient memory T cells and variably depleted of B220+ DN T cells. Growth factor-independent cell lines were established from five of the tumors. The majority of the tumors were CD23- and IgH isotype switched and a high proportion was CD5+ and dull Mac-1+. Considering their Ig secretion and morphology in vivo, most tumors were classified as malignant plasmacytoid lymphomas. The delayed development of the gld tumors indicated that genetic defects in addition to the Fas/Fasl mutations were necessary for malignant transformation. Interestingly, none of the tumors showed changes in the genomic organization of c-Myc but many had one or more somatically-acquired MuLV proviral integrations that were transmitted in scid passages and cell lines. Therefore, insertional mutagenesis may be a mechanism for transformation in gld B cells. Our panel of in vivo passaged and in vitro adapted gld lymphomas will be a valuable tool for the future identification of genetic abnormalities associated with B cell transformation in aging and autoimmune mice.","['Davidson, W F', 'Giese, T', 'Fredrickson, T N']","['Davidson WF', 'Giese T', 'Fredrickson TN']","['Laboratory of Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA. davidson@hlsun.recross.org']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,IM,,"['Aging/immunology', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/cytology', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred MRL lpr', 'Mice, SCID', 'Phenotype', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/cytology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Virus Integration', 'fas Receptor/*immunology']",1998/06/10 00:00,1998/06/10 00:01,['1998/06/10 00:00'],"['1998/06/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.187.11.1825 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1998 Jun 1;187(11):1825-38. doi: 10.1084/jem.187.11.1825.,"['0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Fasl protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)']",,,,,PMC2212316,,,,,,,,,

Early irreversible ATP depletion was observed concomitant with oxidative inactivation of the mitochondrial ATP synthase. Cell proliferative capacity was also impaired within 2 h of the treatment, and progressive delayed cell lethality, starting 2 h after the insults, was also found. Based on the prevention provided by specific antioxidants and on the absence of malodialdehyde production, all the effects were ascribed to the oxidant action of .OH radicals, or closely related species, generated through iron-catalyzed reactions of H2O2, which apparently caused site-directed oxidative modifications of iron-binding proteins, in particular mitochondrial ATP synthase, rather than peroxidation of membrane lipids. Similar effects were mimicked even in the parental cell line when oligomycin was used to inhibit selectively mitochondrial ATP synthase activity, thereby lowering the enzyme activity to a level similar to that found in H2O2-damaged differentiating cells. Hence, induction of erythroid differentiation makes the mitochondrial ATP synthase a major target of H2O2 by enhancing the availability of redox-active iron in the local environment of the enzyme. Subsequent oxidative inactivation of the mitochondrial ATP synthase, resulting in severe energy impairment, leads to loss of cell growth capacity. Erythroleukemia cells may serve as a model system for the combination of two selective properties: (1) the capacity for carrying out efficient heme synthesis and/or for undergoing iron overload-like state; and (2) subsequent enhanced sensitivity to reactive oxygen species generators. Early severe mitochondrial dysfunction and energy impairment may be a major part of the mechanism of the sensitivity.","['Comelli, M', 'Londero, D', 'Mavelli, I']","['Comelli M', 'Londero D', 'Mavelli I']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences and Technologies, University of Udine, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Free Radic Biol Med,Free radical biology & medicine,8709159,IM,,"['ATP Synthetase Complexes', 'Acetamides/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Energy Metabolism/*drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Free Radical Scavengers/pharmacology', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/*enzymology', 'Multienzyme Complexes/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Oligomycins/pharmacology', 'Phosphotransferases (Phosphate Group Acceptor)/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/06/02 00:00,1998/06/02 00:01,['1998/06/02 00:00'],"['1998/06/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/02 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/02 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0891-5849(97)00373-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s0891-5849(97)00373-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Free Radic Biol Med. 1998 Apr;24(6):924-32. doi: 10.1016/s0891-5849(97)00373-0.,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Free Radical Scavengers)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (Oligomycins)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 2.7.4.- (ATP Synthetase Complexes)', 'EC 2.7.4.- (Phosphotransferases (Phosphate Group Acceptor))', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

WSU-CLL cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 at a concentration of 2 x 10(5)/ml using a 24-well plate. Agents were added to triplicate wells, and cell count, viability, mitosis, and apoptosis were assessed after 24 h of incubation at 37 degrees C. Results showed that dolastatin 10 had no apparent inhibition of cell growth at concentrations less than 500 pg/ml. Auristatin PE, on the other hand, showed significant growth inhibition at concentrations as low as 50 pg/ml. Auristatin PE-treated cultures, at this concentration, exhibited 27 and 4.5% mitosis and apoptosis, respectively. Dolastatin 10, at the same concentration, did not exert any effect and was comparable with that of control cultures. In the WSU-CLL-SCID mouse xenograft model, the efficacy of these agents alone and in combination with bryostatin 1 was evaluated. Tumor growth inhibition (T/C), tumor growth delay (T-C), and log10 kill for dolastatin 10, auristatin PE, and bryostatin 1 were 14%, 25 days, and 1.98; 2%, 25 days, and 1.98; 19%, 13 days, and 1.03, respectively. Auristatin-PE produced cure in three of five mice, whereas dolastatin 10 showed activity but no cures. When given in combination, auristatin PE + bryostatin 1-treated animals were all free of tumors (five of five) for 150 days and were considered cured. Dolastatin 10 + bryostatin 1-treated animals produced cure in only two of five mice. We conclude that: (a) auristatin-PE is more effective in this model than dolastatin 10; (b) auristatin PE can be administered at a concentration 10 times greater than dolastatin 10; (c) there is a synergetic effect between these agents and bryostatin 1, which is more apparent in the bryostatin 1 + auristatin PE combination.

We report a large cohort of adult trisomy 8 patients and examine whether increasing age within a homogeneous cytogenetic group alters clinical outcome. Characteristics and outcome of patients with isolated trisomy 8 enrolled in the prospective Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) cytogenetic study CALGB 8461 are described. Isolated trisomy 8 was identified in 42 (3.03%) of 1387 patients enrolled in five CALGB treatment protocols. These patients had a median age of 64 (range, 16-79) years, 50% female proportion, and a low frequency of hepatomegaly (10%) or splenomegaly (10%). Laboratory features included a median white blood count of 7.3 x 10(9)/L, nonspecific French-American-British distribution, with 36% of patients having Auer rods. Treatment outcome was unsatisfactory with a complete remission (CR) rate of 59%, median CR duration of 13.6 months, and median survival of 13.1 months. Older age adversely affected outcome; trisomy 8 patients > or =60 years had both an inferior CR rate (40% versus 88%; P = 0.004) and overall survival (median, 4.8 versus 17.5 months; P = 0.01), as compared with those <60 years of age. Of the patients <60 years of age, only four remain alive, and all received noncytarabine-based intensive chemotherapy, followed in three cases by autologous (n = 2) or allogeneic (n = 1) stem cell transplant in CR1. Adults with AML and isolated trisomy 8 have a poor outcome that is accentuated by increasing age and is rarely cured with cytarabine-based therapy.

Children with cancer seem to be particularly susceptible to the development of brain abscesses because of the immunological changes induced by cancer and its treatment. We reviewed the records of children who developed a brain abscess during treatment of a malignancy to define the clinical characteristics, prognosis, and management of these patients. PROCEDURE: We performed a retrospective review of the clinical and laboratory characteristics of all cancer patients younger than age 20 years who were admitted to our institution between 1980 and 1996 for a brain abscess. RESULTS: Twelve children were identified. Cancer diagnoses were brain tumor in two, systemic PNET in two, and leukemia in eight. Six patients had multiple abscesses. Eleven received prior chemotherapy. Abscesses were surgically excised or aspirated in seven, and empiric antibiotics were given to the other five. At surgery, Listeria monocytogenes, Aspergillus fumigatus (3), Fusarium, and Candida lusitanea were cultured. Aspergillus was identified in other locations in four patients. Abscesses were successfully treated in seven patients, two of whom received antibiotics only; five patients (42%) died from infection. CONCLUSIONS: Mortality is high in this immunosuppressed population, in part due to the preponderance of fungal infection. The finding of very rare organisms suggests that drainage and culture should be performed whenever possible; empiric antibiotics that include an antifungal agent may, on occasion, be successful.","['Antunes, N L', 'Hariharan, S', 'DeAngelis, L M']","['Antunes NL', 'Hariharan S', 'DeAngelis LM']","['Department of Neurology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The baseline rate of secondary cancers following prostate cancer was obtained from a study of 18,135 patients from the Connecticut Tumor Registry, of whom only 12.5% received radiotherapy. These patients, with a mean age of 72 and a mean follow-up of 3.9 years, were compared to a cohort of 543 patients (median age 70) with similar follow-up (median 3.9 years), all of whom were treated with definitive radiotherapy at Fox Chase Cancer Center. The possible association between various covariates (age, dose, palpation stage, field size, Gleason score, pretreatment PSA) and the development of a secondary cancer was assessed. RESULTS: 1,053 of 18,135 patients (5.8%) in the Connecticut Tumor Registry developed a second primary cancer compared with 31 of 543 (5.7%) patients treated with prostate radiation (p = 0.99). Although this risk increases gradually over time, it is not significantly different, at any time period, between the two groups of patients. Of the 31 secondary primaries in the irradiated group, 82% had a history of tobacco and/or alcohol use. Only melanomas were significantly increased compared to the expected rate in an age-matched population (p < 0.001). Five of the 31 secondary cancers occurred within the radiation field (four bladder, one colon), four within 3 years and only one occurred 9 years after radiotherapy. No association was found between age (<70 vs. > or =70 and as a continuous variable), dose (<74 vs. > or =74 Gy), palpation stage (<T2C vs. > or =T2C), field size (prostate vs. pelvic), radiation technique (conventional vs. conformal), Gleason score (2-6 vs. 7-10), or pretreatment PSA (<15 vs. > or =15 and as a continuous variable) and the risk of developing a second primary. Although a lower radiation dose (as a continuous variable) correlated with an increased risk of developing a secondary cancer (p = 0.04), this phenomenon is likely due to differences in follow-up time. CONCLUSION: Up to at least 10 years, there is no increased risk of developing a second primary cancer following prostate irradiation compared to the baseline rate from prostate cancer itself. This risk is not higher in younger patients with localized disease (<T2C), who often must choose between surgery and radiation. The vast majority of secondary cancers occurred outside of the radiation field (84%) and/or within 3 years of radiotherapy (97%), suggesting they were not caused by radiation. Most of these patients had lifestyles with predisposing risk factors. Patients with prostate cancer manifested a significantly increased risk of developing melanomas, suggesting that they may benefit from patient education and skin screening examinations.","['Movsas, B', 'Hanlon, A L', 'Pinover, W', 'Hanks, G E']","['Movsas B', 'Hanlon AL', 'Pinover W', 'Hanks GE']","['Fox Chase Cancer Center, Department of Radiation Oncology, Philadelphia, PA 19111, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,IM,,"['Aged', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen/analysis', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/metabolism/*radiotherapy', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Risk Assessment', 'Time Factors']",1998/06/02 00:00,1998/06/02 00:01,['1998/06/02 00:00'],"['1998/06/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/02 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/02 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0360-3016(97)00570-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s0360-3016(97)00570-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1998 May 1;41(2):251-5. doi: 10.1016/s0360-3016(97)00570-1.,['EC 3.4.21.77 (Prostate-Specific Antigen)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leder's chloroacetate esterase stain; immunostaining for myeloperoxidase, CD34, CD43, CD68, and lysozyme; and ultrastructural finding of cytoplasmic lysosomal granules and Auer bodies all aided in confirming the diagnosis.

Of interest was the observation in induced cells of a marked rearrangement of the plasma membrane architecture as well as that of the nuclear envelope, with a massive translocation and/or decrease in the nuclear pore complexes.","['Di Pietro, R', 'Centurione, M A', 'Falcieri, E', 'Centurione, L', 'Santavenere, E', 'Rana, R']","['Di Pietro R', 'Centurione MA', 'Falcieri E', 'Centurione L', 'Santavenere E', 'Rana R']","['Istituto di Morfologia Umana Normale, Chieti, Italy. r.dipietro@morpho.unich.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Signal,Cellular signalling,8904683,IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Death/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Cell Nucleus/ultrastructure', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Envelope/ultrastructure', '*Radiation, Ionizing', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/06/02 00:00,1998/06/02 00:01,['1998/06/02 00:00'],"['1998/06/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/02 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/02 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0898-6568(97)00118-6 [pii]', '10.1016/s0898-6568(97)00118-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Signal. 1998 Mar;10(3):205-9. doi: 10.1016/s0898-6568(97)00118-6.,['YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DC from RLV-infected mice failed to stimulate significant allogeneic T cell proliferation but T cells from RLV-infected mice showed normal responses to allogeneic DC. In RLV-infected mice treatment with 5 doses of 100 or 300 ng IL-12 around the time of infection resulted in DC that stimulated normal T cell proliferation. Treatment of mice with 300 ng IL-12 but not 100 ng reduced T cell responses. RLV-infected mice showed reduced delayed hypersensitivity to a contact sensitizer. Infected animals receiving the low dose of IL-12 which allowed normal DC and T cell function gave normal delayed hypersensitivity reactions; IL-12 thus resulted in both normal T cell stimulation by DC and cell-mediated immunity. A failure of T cell stimulation by DC is associated with immunosuppression in retrovirus infection and the enhanced capacity of DC to stimulate T cells after IL-12 treatment may be beneficial.,"['Williams, N J', 'Harvey, J J', 'Duncan, I', 'Booth, R F', 'Knight, S C']","['Williams NJ', 'Harvey JJ', 'Duncan I', 'Booth RF', 'Knight SC']","['Antigen Presentation Research Group, Imperial College School of Medicine, Northwick Park Institute for Medical Research, Harrow, Middlesex, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Apoptosis', 'Dendritic Cells/*drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Hypersensitivity, Delayed', '*Immunity, Cellular', 'Interleukin-12/*pharmacology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Rauscher Virus/*immunology', 'Retroviridae Infections/*immunology', 'Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms', 'Spleen/virology', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology']",1998/06/02 00:00,1998/06/02 00:01,['1998/06/02 00:00'],"['1998/06/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/02 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/02 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0008-8749(98)91240-0 [pii]', '10.1006/cimm.1998.1240 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1998 Feb 1;183(2):121-30. doi: 10.1006/cimm.1998.1240.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The relative composition of Stat factors in the protein-DNA complexes changed during time. Whereas Stat3 was activated up to 36 h during treatment with LIF, Stat5a was activated only short-termed. Similarly, high expression of the immediate early gene CIS (cytokine-inducible SH2-containing protein), a known target gene of Stat5 in hematopoietic cells, occurred only during the onset of differentiation.

The time course of accumulation of these drugs, and the effect of energy starvation and the presence of chloroquine on the level of their steady-state accumulation were quite disparate. Vinblastine inhibited the accumulation of verapamil whereas it enhanced the accumulation of daunomycin, another classic substrate of P-glycoprotein. Verapamil did not compete with the intracellular binding sites of vinblastine. In all these aspects, vinblastine behaved as a typical substrate of P-glycoprotein but verapamil did not.

In the t(8;21) translocation, the AML1 (CBFA2/PEBP2alphaB) gene becomes fused to the MTG8 (ETO) gene. We previously found that the terminal differentiation step leading to mature neutrophils in response to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was inhibited by the ectopic expression of the AML1-MTG8 fusion protein in L-G murine myeloid progenitor cells. We show here that overexpression of normal AML1 proteins reverses this inhibition and restores the competence to differentiate. Immunoprecipitation analysis shows that p300 and CREB-binding protein (CBP) interact with AML1. The C-terminal region of AML1 is responsible for the induction of cell differentiation and for the interaction with p300. Overexpression of p300 stimulates AML1-dependent transcription and the induction of cell differentiation. These results suggest that p300 plays critical roles in AML1-dependent transcription during the differentiation of myeloid cells. Thus, AML1 and its associated factors p300 and CBFbeta, all of which are targets of chromosomal rearrangements in human leukemia, function cooperatively in the differentiation of myeloid cells.","['Kitabayashi, I', 'Yokoyama, A', 'Shimizu, K', 'Ohki, M']","['Kitabayashi I', 'Yokoyama A', 'Shimizu K', 'Ohki M']","['Radiobiology Division, National Cancer Center Research Institute, 5-1-1 Tsukiji, Chuo-ku, Tokyo 104, Japan. ikitabay@ncc.go.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,IM,,"['Acetyltransferases/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Animals', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Growth Inhibitors/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Histone Acetyltransferases', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism/physiology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'p300-CBP Transcription Factors']",1998/06/26 00:00,1998/06/26 00:01,['1998/06/26 00:00'],"['1998/06/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/26 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/emboj/17.11.2994 [doi]'],ppublish,EMBO J. 1998 Jun 1;17(11):2994-3004. doi: 10.1093/emboj/17.11.2994.,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.3.1.- (Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Histone Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (p300-CBP Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (p300-CBP-associated factor)']",,,,,PMC1170639,,,,,,,,,

Additionally, CD26 is a nonintegrin receptor that contains a binding site for extracellular matrix and other molecules. In order to further define the expression and functional activity of this membrane exopeptidase in human T cells, we developed a nondisruptive, four-color cytofluorogenic assay that utilizes three separate antibodies to cell-surface molecules (e.g., CD4/CD8/CD26 and CD19/CD56/CD26) along with a rhodamine 110-conjugated dipeptide substrate that allows the measurement of DPP IV activity in phenotypically defined cells. We found normal human thymi to have notable differences in time-dependent DPP IV activity among the thymocyte subsets defined by their CD4/CD8 phenotype, with CD4-/CD8- thymocytes containing less DPP IV activity than cells expressing CD4 and/or CD8 (i.e., maturing). CD26 positivity was moderately intense in thymocytes and tended to identify cells with higher DPP IV activity. The four-color technique was also used to examine mature peripheral blood lymphocytes, along with an assortment of leukemias and transformed T-cell lines. These experiments revealed that while DPP IV was consistently evident in normal T cells, neoplastic T cells could vary in their expression patterns. Furthermore, the presence (or intensity) of surface CD26 in some abnormal T cells and certain normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells was separable from the level of DPP IV measured intracellularly. Our results established that multicolor cytofluorographic analysis can be a practical means to measure DPP IV activity in various human cell populations. Furthermore, we found that DPP IV activity could vary in T cells according to their differentiation status and that under certain circumstances surface CD26 expression can be disassociated from the level of measured enzyme (i.e., DPP IV) activity.","['Ruiz, P', 'Zacharievich, N', 'Shenkin, M']","['Ruiz P', 'Zacharievich N', 'Shenkin M']","['Department of Pathology, University of Miami School of Medicine, Florida 33101, USA. pruiz@mednet.med.miami.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Clin Diagn Lab Immunol,Clinical and diagnostic laboratory immunology,9421292,IM,,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Dipeptides/metabolism', 'Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4/*blood/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Fluorescent Dyes/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/enzymology/*immunology', 'Rhodamines/metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/enzymology/*immunology', 'Thymus Gland/cytology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/05/30 00:00,1998/05/30 00:01,['1998/05/30 00:00'],"['1998/05/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/30 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/30 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/CDLI.5.3.362-368.1998 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Diagn Lab Immunol. 1998 May;5(3):362-8. doi: 10.1128/CDLI.5.3.362-368.1998.,"['0 (Dipeptides)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Rhodamines)', '13558-31-1 (rhodamine 110)', 'EC 3.4.14.5 (Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4)']",,,,,PMC104525,,,,,,,,,

Our data show that both type I and type II TNF receptors (TNF-RI and TNF-RII) are expressed on all of these cells, and TNF-alpha significantly stimulates the proliferation of growth factor-dependent Mo7e cells but not of Meg-01 or Dami/HEL cells, which grow in a factor-independent manner. TNF-alpha serves predominantly as a mitogen for Mo7e cell proliferation and does not induce Mo7e cell differentiation. Coincubation with both TNF-alpha and anti-TNF-alpha neutralizing antibody completely abolishes the TNF-alpha-induced proliferation of Mo7e cells. In bioassays, there is no detectable level of other stimulatory cytokines in conditioned medium from Mo7e cells previously stimulated by TNF-alpha, implying that the stimulatory effect of TNF-alpha on Mo7e cells is derived from the direct action of TNF-alpha rather than via the induction of secondary cytokines by TNF-alpha. Flow cytometric studies demonstrated that TNF-alpha binds to Mo7e cells that have been pretreated with either anti-TNF-RI or anti-TNF-RII neutralizing antibody, but TNF-alpha does not bind to cells pre-exposed to both receptor antibodies. However, the incubation of Mo7e cells with either TNF-RI or TNF-RII neutralizing antibodies or with either soluble TNF-RI or TNF-RII inhibits TNF-alpha-induced cell proliferation, indicating the requirement of interactions with both TNF receptors for the mitogenic activity of TNF-alpha. Furthermore, our data suggest that an alternative signaling pathway may be involved in TNF-alpha-induced Mo7e cell proliferation, because the common mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathways activated by other cytokines that induce Mo7e cell proliferation are not activated by TNF-alpha.","['Liu, R Y', 'Fan, C', 'Mitchell, S', 'Chen, Q', 'Wu, J', 'Zuckerman, K S']","['Liu RY', 'Fan C', 'Mitchell S', 'Chen Q', 'Wu J', 'Zuckerman KS']","['H.

Recent reports have confirmed the validity of this approach by demonstrating that elevated levels of chromosome aberrations in lymphocytes are associated with subsequent increased cancer risk, especially for increased mortality from hematological malignancies including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We postulated that this approach could be improved in two ways: (a) by detecting oncogenic disease-specific aberrations; and (b) by using chromosome painting so that many more metaphases could be analyzed. Numerical and structural aberrations in chromosomes 8 and 21 are commonly observed in AML. In the present study, we painted chromosomes 8 and 21 in lymphocyte metaphases from 43 healthy workers exposed to benzene, an established cause of AML, and from 44 matched controls. To examine dose-response relationships the workers were divided into two groups at the median exposure level, a lower-exposed group (< or = 31 ppm; n = 21), and a higher-exposed group (> 31 ppm; n = 22). Benzene exposure was associated with significant increases in hyperdiploidy of chromosomes 8 (1.2, 1.5, and 2.4 per 100 metaphases; P < 0.0001) and 21 (0.9, 1.1, and 1.9 per 100 metaphases; P < 0.0001). Translocations between chromosomes 8 and 21 were increased up to 15-fold in highly exposed workers (0.01, 0.04, and 0.16 per 100 metaphases; P < 0.0001). In one highly exposed individual, these translocations were reciprocal and were detectable by reverse transcriptase-PCR. These data indicate a potential role for t(8;21) in benzene-induced leukemogenesis and are consistent with the hypothesis that detection of specific chromosome aberrations may be a powerful approach to identify populations at increased risk of leukemia.","['Smith, M T', 'Zhang, L', 'Wang, Y', 'Hayes, R B', 'Li, G', 'Wiemels, J', 'Dosemeci, M', 'Titenko-Holland, N', 'Xi, L', 'Kolachana, P', 'Yin, S', 'Rothman, N']","['Smith MT', 'Zhang L', 'Wang Y', 'Hayes RB', 'Li G', 'Wiemels J', 'Dosemeci M', 'Titenko-Holland N', 'Xi L', 'Kolachana P', 'Yin S', 'Rothman N']","['Division of Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley 94720-7360, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Benzene/*toxicity', 'Carcinogens/*toxicity', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/*drug effects/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/*drug effects/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*chemically induced/genetics', 'Male', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1998/05/30 00:00,1998/05/30 00:01,['1998/05/30 00:00'],"['1998/05/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/30 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/30 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1998 May 15;58(10):2176-81.,"['0 (Carcinogens)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",,,"['P42 ES004705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 ES01896/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P42 ES04705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES06721/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment of tumor cells for 12-24 h with 3-BAABU resulted in mitotic arrest at prometaphase/metaphase/anaphase, with separation and dispersion of chromosomes and with the absence of mitotic spindle apparatus in cytoplasm. Treatment with 3-BAABU had no cytotoxic and mitotic blocking effect in normal human lymphocytes, proliferating fibroblast cells (3T3), or proliferating myocardial cells (MOT). Cell cycle analyses showed that most treated leukemic cells accumulated at M phase 12 h after treatment. By the end of 48 h of treatment, the cells underwent apoptosis with DNA fragmentation. 3-BAABU inhibited the assembly of microtubules from tubulin but did not interfere with the disassembly of microtubules. The presence and the position of bromine and urea groups on the benzoic ring are the determining factors for its inhibition of microtubule assembly. Replacing bromine with chlorine yielded much less mitotic blocking activity and increased the ID50 40-fold. Substitution of the urea group with ethyl ester abrogated the activity of blocking mitosis but induced apoptosis. Moving the bromoacetylamino group from the 3-position to the 4-position removed blocking activity for mitosis but induced necrosis. These results suggest that 3-BAABU possesses a unique and functional structure and is a potential agent for cancer chemotherapy.","['Jiang, J D', 'Wang, Y', 'Roboz, J', 'Strauchen, J', 'Holland, J F', 'Bekesi, J G']","['Jiang JD', 'Wang Y', 'Roboz J', 'Strauchen J', 'Holland JF', 'Bekesi JG']","['Department of Medicine, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, New York 10029, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation/*drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/pathology', 'Microtubules/*drug effects', 'Mitosis/*drug effects', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology', 'Spindle Apparatus/drug effects', 'Tubulin/drug effects/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Urea/chemistry/*pharmacology']",1998/05/30 00:00,1998/05/30 00:01,['1998/05/30 00:00'],"['1998/05/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/30 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/30 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1998 May 15;58(10):2126-33.,"['0 (3-bromoacetylamino benzoylurea)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Tubulin)', '8W8T17847W (Urea)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of these proteins was topoisomerase I, whose interaction with p53 was recently reported. A carboxyl-terminal fragment containing the last 92 amino acids of p53 (GST-299-390) was sufficient for binding to topoisomerase I. Nanomolar concentrations of either GST-p53 or GST-299-390 enhanced the catalytic activity of purified human topoisomerase I. Purified wild-type human p53 and point mutants Ser-239, Ser-245, and His-273 were equivalent in their enhancement of human topoisomerase I activity.

In this study, we analyzed Fas and FasL expression in normal esophageal mucosa and esophageal squamous cell carcinomas. Reverse transcriptase-PCR revealed that Fas, soluble Fas, and FasL were expressed in all eight esophageal squamous carcinoma cell lines analyzed. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that FasL expressed in esophageal carcinoma cells is functional because coculture experiments using FasL-expressing TE-15 esophageal carcinoma cells resulted in apoptosis of Jurkat T leukemia cells, which are sensitive to Fas-mediated apoptosis. Immunohistochemistry of Fas and FasL showed that they are constitutively expressed in normal esophageal mucosa, FasL being predominantly in the basal and suprabasal layers, whereas Fas is in more differentiated layers, i.e., rows of polyhedral cells of the intermediate layers and squamous cells forming the outer layers. In 18 of 19 invasive esophageal squamous cell carcinomas, FasL expression was found in >50% of tumor cells. In contrast, most tumors (15 of 19, 79%) either showed no Fas expression or showed expression in <5% of tumor cells. These alterations were already detected in dysplasia and carcinoma in situ. These results suggest that up-regulation of FasL and down-regulation of Fas expression are early and frequent events associated with the evolution of esophageal squamous cell carcinomas.","['Gratas, C', 'Tohma, Y', 'Barnas, C', 'Taniere, P', 'Hainaut, P', 'Ohgaki, H']","['Gratas C', 'Tohma Y', 'Barnas C', 'Taniere P', 'Hainaut P', 'Ohgaki H']","['Unit of Molecular Pathology, International Agency for Research on Cancer, Lyon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Down-Regulation', 'Esophageal Neoplasms/*chemistry/metabolism/pathology', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*analysis', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation', 'fas Receptor/*analysis']",1998/05/30 00:00,1998/05/30 00:01,['1998/05/30 00:00'],"['1998/05/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/30 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/30 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1998 May 15;58(10):2057-62.,"['0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among the compounds we examined, tautomycin was the most potent inhibitor and the most effective inducer of apoptosis. It inhibited PP1 and PP2A enzymatic activity concentration-dependently with IC50 values of 20 and 75 pM, respectively, in the presence of 0.01% Brij-35, and an LC50 value of 1 microM. Esterification of the anhydride moiety of tautomycin markedly increased the IC50 for the protein phosphatases. The C1'-C7' fragment of tautomycin had no inhibitory effect, but the fragment containing the C22-C26 moiety was inhibitory. These results suggest that the C22-C26 moiety is essential for inhibition of protein phosphatase activity and that the anhydride moiety enhances the inhibition. However, the esterification of the anhydride did not decrease, nor did the inclusion of the C22-C26 moiety increase the apoptosis-inducing activity. On the other hand, the C1-C18 moiety of tautomycin was essential for induction of apoptosis, and the conformation and the arrangement of functionalities of the C18-C26 carbon chain affected the apoptosis activity. However, modification of C1-C18, C1-C21, or C1-C26 compounds had little effect on phosphatase inhibitory activity.

The mechanisms responsible for GVHD prevention are unknown. We show that RAPA is more effective in inhibiting CD8+ or TCR gammadelta+ than CD4+ T cell-mediated murine GVHD. To determine how RAPA inhibited GVHD, thoracic duct lymphocytes (TDL) were isolated from recipients of allogeneic donor grafts. Compared with controls, RAPA-treated recipients had a marked decrease in donor TDL T cell number between days 5 and 24 posttransplant. CD8+ T cell expansion was preferentially inhibited. RAPA inhibited Th1 or Th1 cytotoxic (Tc1) cytokines, but not Th2 or Tc2, cell generation. In situ mRNA hybridization also showed that TDL T cells from RAPA-treated mice had a lower frequency of granzyme B+ cells, indicating that RAPA inhibited the generation of CTL capable of mediating cytolysis through the release of granzyme B.

Since CD8+ T cells are the primary effectors in this system, these data suggest that RAPA directly interfered with GVL effector cell expansion or function.

Cold target inhibition assays showed that the antigenic determinant(s) recognized by type II clones are expressed not only on TL+ Con A blasts but also on other TL+ target cells. The relation of the target specificity to the killing machinery and the accessory molecules involved in cytotoxicity were therefore analyzed using four representative clones selected from each type. Of the target cells tested, Fas was only expressed on Con A blasts, indicating that Fas ligand (FasL)-dependent cytotoxicity is limited to such cells. All four type II and one of four type I clones expressed FasL on the surface, while both types contained perforin in the cytoplasm. Blocking studies using neutralizing anti-FasL mAbs and concanamycin A (CMA), a selective inhibitor of the perforin pathway, suggested that type I clones kill target cells by way of perforin, while type II clones kill TL+ Con A blasts through FasL together with perforin. For their cytotoxicity, type I CTLs require a signal through CD8, while type II require LFA-1/ICAM-1 interactions. Type II clones also need a co-stimulatory signal through an unknown molecule for perforin-dependent cytotoxicity. These results taken together suggest that the difference in the target specificity of anti-TL CTL clones is due to variation in the killing machineries and the dependence on accessory molecules.","['Tsujimura, K', 'Takahashi, T', 'Iwase, S', 'Matsudaira, Y', 'Kaneko, Y', 'Yagita, H', 'Obata, Y']","['Tsujimura K', 'Takahashi T', 'Iwase S', 'Matsudaira Y', 'Kaneko Y', 'Yagita H', 'Obata Y']","['Laboratory of Immunology, Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,,"['Animals', '*Antigen Presentation', 'Antigens, Ly/immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'Clone Cells', 'Concanavalin A/pharmacology', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/*immunology', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Female', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/immunology', 'Ligands', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1/immunology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis/*immunology/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Perforin', 'Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology/metabolism', 'Thymus Gland/immunology/metabolism', 'fas Receptor/metabolism']",1998/05/30 00:00,1998/05/30 00:01,['1998/05/30 00:00'],"['1998/05/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/30 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/30 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1998 Jun 1;160(11):5253-61.,"['0 (Antigens, Ly)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Fasl protein, mouse)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '0 (thymus-leukemia antigens)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)', '126465-35-8 (Perforin)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Peripheral blood and bone marrow cells of patients with T-ALL, B-precursor ALL and AML were studied. The method of silver staining was used to determine the number of AgNORs per cell. Cell surface markers were detected by a standard immunofluorescence assay. To demonstrate the relationship between AgNOR quantity and cell proliferation, the expression of activation and proliferation antigens CD38 and CD71 was investigated. To characterize the immunophenotype and the discrete stages of differentiation, the wide panel of antibodies against lymphoid, myeloid and non-lineage specific antigens was used. The number of AgNORs at diagnosis ranged from 3.05 to 6.70. Immunophenotypic analysis showed a variation in CD38 and CD71 expression among different leukemia subtypes. CD71 antigen was more expressed in T-ALL than in B-precursor ALL or in AML. Notable was the relationship between increased AgNOR quantity and antigens that characterize the immaturity of leukemic cells. The association with CD7, CD2, CD5 (without CD3 membrane expression) and CD34 in T blasts was evident. High positivity of CD19, CD10, CD34 and HLA-DR in relation to the increased amount of AgNORs in B-lineage ALL was observed. The vast majority of AML patients with high numbers of AgNORs simultaneously expressed CD13, CD33, CD34 and HLA-DR. One third of AML cases coexpressed T cell marker CD7. In conclusion, the presence of increased numbers of AgNORs at diagnosis might reflect the dependence on an early stage of leukemia cell differentiation.","['Klobusicka, M', 'Babusikova, O']","['Klobusicka M', 'Babusikova O']","['Cancer Research Institute, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Cell Division', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis', 'Nuclear Proteins/analysis', 'Nucleolus Organizer Region/*chemistry', '*Silver Staining']",1997/01/01 00:00,1998/05/30 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/30 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Neoplasma. 1997;44(6):356-60.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We showed that quantitative immune fluorescence could provide new data contributing to a more precise definition of cell differentiation. We documented the significant difference between antigen density of early and late markers in B-cell and myeloid malignancies. Further, we demonstrated that quantitative immune phenotyping could help in determination of exact definition of pathologic clone in morphologically immature leukemia population and showed that parameters of this method are also convenient for cytoplasmic marker evaluation. In our study we were able to demonstrate that CD45 quantitative expression appeared to be a more informative parameter than its percentage of antigen-positive cells as a measure of antigen expression only and we pointed out that low and high CD45 densities enabled to differentiate between pathological clone and residual healthy population in examined sample.

Flow cytometry analysis showed a high level of Fas-antigen expression in P388/DOX cells treated with cepharanthine.

A rat basophilic leukemia cell line, RBL-2H3, expresses similar levels of two Syk isoforms that differ with respect to the presence of a 23-amino acid insert within the ""linker"" region located between the second Src homology 2 and the catalytic domain. Although they exhibit comparable intrinsic enzymatic activity, functional differences between the two isoforms are unknown. Here we report that the deleted Syk isoform can mediate signal transduction in RBL-2H3 cells. Aggregation of chimeric kinase, consisting of either form of Syk fused to the transmembrane and extracellular domains of guinea pig type II IgG Fc receptor, on RBL transfectants resulted in degranulation, release of leukotrienes, and enhanced gene expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha. The chimeras as well as phospholipase C-gamma1 and Vav became tyrosine-phosphorylated upon aggregation of chimeras. We also found that both Syk isoforms from transiently transfected COS-7 cells were capable of binding to phosphorylated FcepsilonRI, and their kinase activities were similarly up-regulated in the presence of tyrosine-phosphorylated synthetic peptides based on the sequence of the gamma subunit of FcepsilonRI. Thus, these results establish that both isoforms of Syk can mediate signal transduction in mast cells and suggest that the 23-amino acid insert in the linker region of Syk may not be obligatory for FcepsilonRI signaling.","['Yamashita, T', 'Kairiyama, L', 'Araki, M', 'Nagasawa, S']","['Yamashita T', 'Kairiyama L', 'Araki M', 'Nagasawa S']","['Department of Hygienic Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hokkaido University, Kita-ku, Sapporo, 060-0812, Japan. yamashit@pharm.hokudai.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Biochem,Journal of biochemistry,0376600,IM,,"['Animals', 'Enzyme Precursors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Immunoglobulin E/metabolism', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Isoenzymes/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Syk Kinase', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/05/30 00:00,1998/05/30 00:01,['1998/05/30 00:00'],"['1998/05/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/30 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/30 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a022061 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biochem. 1998 Jun;123(6):1199-207. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a022061.,"['0 (Enzyme Precursors)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk protein, rat)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HL-60 cells treated with 1alpha, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 did not express MRP binding sites on the cell membrane, but a high level of MRPs accumulated in the cells. The occurrence of MRP binding sites on the cell surface of leukemia cell lines of monocyte and lymphocyte origin suggests that MRPs, released from neutrophils under certain conditions, may contribute to the activation and recruitment of effector cells to inflammatory lesions.","['Koike, T', 'Kondo, K', 'Makita, T', 'Kajiyama, K', 'Yoshida, T', 'Morikawa, M']","['Koike T', 'Kondo K', 'Makita T', 'Kajiyama K', 'Yoshida T', 'Morikawa M']","['Tokyo Institute for Immunopharmacology, Inc., and Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Toshima-ku, Tokyo, 171-0033, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Biochem,Journal of biochemistry,0376600,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Binding Sites', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Leukocyte L1 Antigen Complex', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecules/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/05/30 00:00,1998/05/30 00:01,['1998/05/30 00:00'],"['1998/05/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/30 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/30 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a022046 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biochem. 1998 Jun;123(6):1079-87. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a022046.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Leukocyte L1 Antigen Complex)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neural Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The transcriptional regulatory region of the gp34 gene was activated by HTLV-I Tax in the human T cell line Jurkat, in which endogenous gp34 is induced by Tax. Sequence analysis demonstrated that two NF-kappaB-like elements (1 and 2) were present in the regulatory region. Both NF-kappaB-like elements were able to bind to NF-kappaB or its related factor(s) in a Tax-dependent manner. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays indicated that NF-kappaB-like element 1 was Tax-responsive, although the activity was lower than that the native promoter. NF-kappaB-like element 2 elevated promoter activity when combined with NF-kappaB-like element 1, indicating cooperative function of the elements for maximum promoter function. Unlike typical NF-kappaB elements, the NF-kappaB-like elements in gp34 were not activated by treatment of Jurkat cells with phorbol ester despite induction of the NF-kappaB-like binding activity. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter assays using the region upstream of the NF-kappaB-like elements identified an upstream region that reduced transcription from cognate and noncognate core promoters in a Tax-independent manner. Our results imply complex regulation of expression of the gp34 gene and suggest implication of gp34 in proliferation of HTLV-I infected T cells.","['Ohtani, K', 'Tsujimoto, A', 'Tsukahara, T', 'Numata, N', 'Miura, S', 'Sugamura, K', 'Nakamura, M']","['Ohtani K', 'Tsujimoto A', 'Tsukahara T', 'Numata N', 'Miura S', 'Sugamura K', 'Nakamura M']","['Human Gene Sciences Center, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,,"['Antigens, Surface', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/genetics/metabolism', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/genetics', 'Gene Products, tax/*physiology', 'Genes, Reporter/genetics', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-kappa B/chemistry', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Receptors, OX40', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sequence Deletion/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/physiology', 'Transcriptional Activation/*physiology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*genetics']",1998/06/11 00:00,1998/06/11 00:01,['1998/06/11 00:00'],"['1998/06/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/11 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/11 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.273.23.14119 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)77444-4 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1998 Jun 5;273(23):14119-29. doi: 10.1074/jbc.273.23.14119.,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, OX40)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (TNFRSF4 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)']",,,,,,,,,,,['GENBANK/AB007839'],,,

To further delineate the functions of C3a and C3a(desArg) on this cell type we used the murine macrophage (Mo) cell line J774A.1 which is known to respond to the anaphylatoxin C5a. J774 cells specifically bound fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled recombinant human C3a (rC3a). The cells migrated along rC3a concentration gradients in a dose-dependent manner with an optimal concentration of about 3 nM (rC5a:7 nM) and a half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of about 1.2 nM (rC5a: 2 nM). The degradation product rC3a(desArg) was devoid of chemotactic activity. mRNA for the recently cloned G protein-coupled mouse high-affinity C3a receptor (C3aR) was detected in J774 cells, suggesting that this receptor represents the binding site for C3a on J774 Mo. In support of the specific nature of C3a-stimulated cellular mobility, RBL-2H3 transfectants expressing the human C3aR were also shown to migrate along gradients of rC3a (optimal concentration about 8 nM; EC50 about 3.5 nM) whereas rC3a(desArg) was again inactive. In summary, our findings demonstrate for the first time a specific, receptor-mediated chemoattraction of cells of the monocytic lineage to the anaphylatoxin C3a which may contribute to the accumulation of Mo at sites of inflammation.","['Zwirner, J', 'Werfel, T', 'Wilken, H C', 'Theile, E', 'Gotze, O']","['Zwirner J', 'Werfel T', 'Wilken HC', 'Theile E', 'Gotze O']","['Department of Immunology, Georg-August-University, Gottingen, Germany. jzwirne@gwdg.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Movement/genetics/immunology', 'Chemotactic Factors/metabolism/*physiology', 'Complement C3a/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/*physiology', 'Fibroblasts', 'Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Macrophages/*immunology/metabolism', '*Membrane Proteins', 'Mice', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Complement/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/05/29 02:04,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/05/29 02:04'],"['1998/05/29 02:04 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/05/29 02:04 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1521-4141(199805)28:05<1570::AID-IMMU1570>3.0.CO;2-6 [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1521-4141(199805)28:05<1570::AID-IMMU1570>3.0.CO;2-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1998 May;28(5):1570-7. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1521-4141(199805)28:05<1570::AID-IMMU1570>3.0.CO;2-6.,"['0 (Chemotactic Factors)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Complement)', '0 (complement C3a receptor)', '0 (complement C3a, des-Arg-(77)-)', '80295-42-7 (Complement C3a)', 'I223NX31W9 (Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GVHD is frequently associated with morbidity and mortality, but also with the beneficial graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect, demonstrated by a reduction in the incidence of leukemia relapse. In this study, we investigated whether UVB treatment of allogeneic T cells could prevent GVHD while sparing the beneficial GVL effect following allogeneic BMT in the Brown Norway myelocytic leukemia (BNML) rat model analogous to human acute myelocytic leukemia (AML). The dose of UVB required to abolish lethal GVHD in the rat allogeneic BMT model (WAG/Rij donors into BN recipients) was 4000 J/m2. However, this UVB dose simultaneously abrogated all GVL activity mediated by the T cells in the graft, while the radio-protective capacity of rat BM cells was strongly reduced. The number of allogeneic BM cells required to protect lethally irradiated BN rats was increased 50 to 100-fold. It is concluded that UVB acts as a non-selective form of T cell inactivation, and that UVB pretreatment of an allogeneic marrow graft is unlikely to be useful clinically as a preventive measure for GVHD, since other means of reduction of the number of functional T cells are less damaging to bone marrow stem cells.","['Gowing, H', 'Braakman, E', 'Hagenbeek, A', 'Lawler, M', 'McCann, S R', 'Pamphilon, D H', 'Martens, A C']","['Gowing H', 'Braakman E', 'Hagenbeek A', 'Lawler M', 'McCann SR', 'Pamphilon DH', 'Martens AC']","['Institute of Hematology, Erasmus University Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/radiation effects', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Male', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred BN', 'Transplantation, Homologous', '*Ultraviolet Rays/adverse effects']",1998/05/29 00:00,1998/05/29 00:01,['1998/05/29 00:00'],"['1998/05/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1701164 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1998 Apr;21(8):801-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1701164.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Certain conditions are known to compromise the integrity of PML-bodies; these include environmental stress (e.g. heat shock), a chromosomal translocation-associated acute promyelocytic leukaemia, and infection with certain viruses [including human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), herpes simplex virus type 1 and adenovirus]. Expression of the HCMV major immediate early (IE) protein (IE1(491aa)) is by itself sufficient to cause disruption of PML-bodies, resulting in the dispersal of the PML antigen uniformly throughout the nucleus. In uninfected cells undergoing mitosis PML is excluded from chromatin. However, both IE1(491aa) and PML were observed to associate with mitotic chromosomes in cells infected with HCMV or transfected with the IE1 gene. A series of in-frame IE1 deletion mutants was used in DNA transfection experiments to identify two large sequence elements (aa 132-274 and the C-terminal aa 347-491) not required for dispersal of the PML antigen. However, a putative leucine-zipper domain (aa 105-139), a putative zinc-finger domain (aa 267-286) and exon 2 and 3 coding sequences (aa 6-85) were required. The association of the IE1 gene product with chromatin required an acidic domain near the C terminus (aa 421-486). The interaction of IE1(491aa) with chromatin was therefore not required for the disruption of PML-bodies. Exon 2 (aa 1-24) was shown to encode a nuclear localization signal.","['Wilkinson, G W', 'Kelly, C', 'Sinclair, J H', 'Rickards, C']","['Wilkinson GW', 'Kelly C', 'Sinclair JH', 'Rickards C']","['Department of Medicine, University of Wales College of Medicine, Cardiff, UK.

This ideal has not yet been successfully achieved with current strategies. Recent results indicate that eliminating residual disease with current chemotherapy is not normally achievable. The use of more sensitive technologies such as polymerase chain reaction has revealed persistent disease in most if not all apparently Philadelphia negative cases. This is confirmed by results where disease relapse occurs following transplant in these cases. Despite this, clinically relevant remissions are obtained and further trials are indicated.

We have studied the geographical pattern of admissions to hospital with severe malaria and the stability of this pattern over time in Kilifi District on the Kenyan Coast. METHODS: Over a 2-year period all children under 5 years of age with severe malaria admitted to the district hospital and living in a rural study population of about 50,000 people were identified. Annual censuses were carried out in the study area, and all households were mapped using a hand-held satellite navigation system. The resulting databases were linked using a geographical information system (GIS). RESULTS: Using methods originally developed for the study of the geographical distribution of childhood leukaemia we assessed the spatial pattern of hospital admission rates for severe malaria. As expected, admission rates were significantly higher in children with easier access to the hospital. For example, those living more than 25 km from the hospital had admission rates which were about one-fifth of those for children living within 5 km of the hospital. Those living more than 2.5 km from the nearest road had admission rates that were about half of those for children living within 0.5 km of a road. We also investigated short-term local fluctuations in severe malaria and found evidence of space-time clustering of severe malaria. CONCLUSIONS: Hospital admission rates for severe malaria are higher in households with better access to hospital than in those further away. The finding of space-time clusters of severe malaria suggests that it would be of value to conduct case-control studies of environmental, genetic and human behavioural factors involved in the aetiology of the disease.","['Schellenberg, J A', 'Newell, J N', 'Snow, R W', ""Mung'ala, V"", 'Marsh, K', 'Smith, P G', 'Hayes, R J']","['Schellenberg JA', 'Newell JN', 'Snow RW', ""Mung'ala V"", 'Marsh K', 'Smith PG', 'Hayes RJ']","['Tropical Health Epidemiology Unit, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J Epidemiol,International journal of epidemiology,7802871,IM,,"['Animals', 'Child, Preschool', 'Geography', 'Hospitalization/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Kenya/epidemiology', 'Malaria, Falciparum/*epidemiology', '*Plasmodium falciparum', 'Space-Time Clustering']",1998/05/29 00:00,1998/05/29 00:01,['1998/05/29 00:00'],"['1998/05/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ije/27.2.323 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Epidemiol. 1998 Apr;27(2):323-9. doi: 10.1093/ije/27.2.323.,,,,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,"['PIP: 132965', 'POP: 00276289']",['PIP'],"['Africa', 'Africa South Of The Sahara', 'Age Factors', '*Child', '*Correlation Studies', 'Demographic Factors', 'Developing Countries', 'Diseases', '*Distance', 'Eastern Africa', 'English Speaking Africa', '*Geographic Factors', 'Kenya', '*Malaria', 'Parasitic Diseases', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Research Methodology', '*Research Report', 'Statistical Studies', 'Studies', 'Youth']",['PIP: TJ: INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY.'],,,"['To investigate the geographic pattern of severe malaria and the stability of this', 'pattern over time, all 358 children under 5 years of age admitted to a district', ""hospital in Kenya's Kilifi District with severe malaria in 1991-93 and living in"", 'a rural study population of about 50,000 people were identified.

Four stem bark extracts from H. klaineana and four quassinoids from H. chlorantha were examined in vitro against Plasmodium falciparum NF 54. The extracts displayed good activities, while the quassinoids were highly active, with IC50 values well below 1 microgram ml-1, those of chaparrinone and 15-desacetylundulatone being much lower than 0.1 microgram ml-1 (0.037 and 0.047 microgram ml-1, respectively). Chaparrinone is five times more active than 14-hydroxychaparrinone against P. falciparum, indicating that the hydroxyl function at C-14 is unfavourable for antiplasmodial activity. As 14-hydroxychaparrinone has a seven-times higher cytotoxic activity against P-388 cells than chaparrinone, the latter compound has the better antiplasmodial therapeutic index. All four quassinoids were evaluated in vivo in a standard 4-day test as well. 15-Desacetylundulatone was proven to be the most active compound, almost totally suppressing the parasitaemias of OF1 mice for at least 7 days, while both chaparrinone and 14-hydroxychaparrinone were active for at least 4 days.

Subsequent differentiation to a mature plasma cell is accompanied by further events in the Ig genes, including VL-JL joining, somatic hypermutation and isotype switching. Chromosomal changes leading to B-cell tumors can occur at many points in this sequence, and may be partly a consequence of the genetic mobility and mutability permitted in order to generate a diverse antibody repertoire. V genes of neoplastic B cells may reflect the point of maturation reached by the B cell of origin, prior to transformation. Analysis of tumors therefore provides useful information on V-gene patterns in normal B cells, and may add another dimension to classification of B-cell tumors. Transformation may also preserve cell populations normally destined to die by apoptosis. Tumor cells arrested in the site where somatic hypermutation and isotype switch are occurring can still be subject to these processes, and could be influenced by persisting antigen. However, mutation is silenced at the point of exit to the periphery, leading to fixed mutational patterns in tumors of mature B cells. V-gene analysis provides an invaluable tool for understanding the genesis of neoplastic change. It also has a clear clinical relevance in tracking tumor cells, measuring residual disease, and finally in offering the opportunity of developing vaccines for treatment.","['Stevenson, F', 'Sahota, S', 'Zhu, D', 'Ottensmeier, C', 'Chapman, C', 'Oscier, D', 'Hamblin, T']","['Stevenson F', 'Sahota S', 'Zhu D', 'Ottensmeier C', 'Chapman C', 'Oscier D', 'Hamblin T']","['Tenovus Laboratory, Southampton University Hospitals Trust, UK. fs@soton.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Immunol Rev,Immunological reviews,7702118,IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Clone Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation']",1998/05/29 00:00,1998/05/29 00:01,['1998/05/29 00:00'],"['1998/05/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-065x.1998.tb01446.x [doi]'],ppublish,Immunol Rev. 1998 Apr;162:247-59. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-065x.1998.tb01446.x.,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)']",,101,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cancer and Leukemia Group B.,297-306,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to compare the long-term psychosocial adaptation of Hodgkin's disease and adult acute leukemia survivors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred seventy-three Hodgkin's disease (HD) and 206 adult acute leukemia (AL) survivors were interviewed by telephone concerning their psychosocial adjustment and problems they attributed to having been treated for cancer, using identical research procedures and a common set of instruments. The following measures were used: Psychosocial Adjustment to Illness Scale (PAIS); Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI); current Conditioned Nausea and Vomiting triggered by treatment-related stimuli (CNVI); Indices of Employment, Insurance and Sexual Problems Attributed to Cancer; Negative Socioeconomic Impact of Cancer Index (NSI). All participants had been treated on one of nine Hodgkin's disease or 13 acute leukemia Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) clinical trials from 1966-1988, and had been off treatment for one year or more (mean years: HD = 5.9; AL = 5.6). RESULTS: HD survivors' risk of having a high distress score on the BSI was almost twice that found for AL survivors (odds ratio = 1.90), with 21% of HD vs. 14% of AL survivors (P < 0.05) having scores that were 1.5 standard deviations above the norm, suggestive of a possible psychiatric disorder. HD survivors reported greater fatigue (POMS Fatigue, P = 0.01; Vigor Subscales, P = 0.001), greater conditioned nausea (CNVI, P < 0.05), greater impact of cancer on their family life (PAIS Domestic Environment, P = 0.004) and poorer sexual functioning (PAIS Sexual Relationships, P = 0.0001), than AL survivors. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment-related issues may have placed HD survivors at a greater risk for problems in long-term adaptation than AL survivors.","['Kornblith, A B', 'Herndon, J E 2nd', 'Zuckerman, E', 'Cella, D F', 'Cherin, E', 'Wolchok, S', 'Weiss, R B', 'Diehl, L F', 'Henderson, E', 'Cooper, M R', 'Schiffer, C', 'Canellos, G P', 'Mayer, R J', 'Silver, R T', 'Schilling, A', 'Peterson, B A', 'Greenberg, D', 'Holland, J C']","['Kornblith AB', 'Herndon JE 2nd', 'Zuckerman E', 'Cella DF', 'Cherin E', 'Wolchok S', 'Weiss RB', 'Diehl LF', 'Henderson E', 'Cooper MR', 'Schiffer C', 'Canellos GP', 'Mayer RJ', 'Silver RT', 'Schilling A', 'Peterson BA', 'Greenberg D', 'Holland JC']","['Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,IM,,"['*Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Child', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/mortality/pathology/*psychology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/mortality/*psychology/therapy', '*Quality of Life', 'Registries', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Sex Factors', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Stress, Psychological/etiology/physiopathology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Survivors/*psychology']",1998/05/29 02:02,2001/03/28 10:01,['1998/05/29 02:02'],"['1998/05/29 02:02 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1998/05/29 02:02 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1008297130258 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Oncol. 1998 Mar;9(3):297-306. doi: 10.1023/a:1008297130258.,,,,['CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

At a donor:recipient ratio of 1:2, cell fusion occurred and a new round of HTLV-1 genome replication was initiated in the cocultured cells. Newly synthesized unintegrated viral DNA was detected by Southern blot within 4-8 h and then increased between 8 and 48 h following cell mixing. The most dominant species of unintegrated viral DNA was 3.7 kb in size which hybridized to a full-length HTLV-1 DNA probe but not to a Kpnl viral DNA fragment that is absent from a defective proviral genome that has been previously identified in MT-2 cells. Northern blot analysis showed large amounts of viral RNA in the virus donor cells and in the cocultured cells, with a 3.4-kb species being the most abundant. This 3.4-kb RNA gave a pattern identical to that of the 3.7-kb unintegrated viral DNA in hybridization studies using the two probes. It seems likely that the unspliced RNA transcript from the defective proviral genome in MT-2 cells was effectively reverse transcribed upon initiation of cell-to-cell viral transmission to susceptible HUT78 cells. Despite active de novo reverse transcription, however, viral RNA levels remained unchanged following cell-to-cell transmission of HTLV-1 infection and no viral antigen production could be attributed to the newly initiated round of viral genome replication. As an abortive infection model this simple cell-to-cell infection system warrants more detailed study as it has the potential to provide reliable information regarding the early events in HTLV-1 transmission and infection.","['Benovic, S', 'Kok, T', 'Stephenson, A', 'McInnes, J', 'Burrell, C', 'Li, P']","['Benovic S', 'Kok T', 'Stephenson A', 'McInnes J', 'Burrell C', 'Li P']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Adelaide, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,IM,,"['Cell Line', 'Coculture Techniques', 'DNA, Viral/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Genome, Viral', 'HTLV-I Infections/etiology/*transmission/*virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/pathogenicity/physiology', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'RNA, Viral/genetics/metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Virus Replication']",1998/05/28 00:00,1998/05/28 00:01,['1998/05/28 00:00'],"['1998/05/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/28 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/28 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(98)99111-5 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1998.9111 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 1998 May 10;244(2):294-301. doi: 10.1006/viro.1998.9111.,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The primary event in the development of this disease is the infection and polyclonal expansion of the target cells of this defective virus, which have been reported to belong to the B cell lineage. To further study the central role that these cells play in the development of MAIDS, we attempted to establish MAIDS-defective virus-infected B cell lines in vitro. We succeeded in establishing two cell lines, SD1 and CSTB5, from the enlarged organs of C57BL/6 mice inoculated with helper-free stocks of the MAIDS-defective virus. Both cell lines are not transplantable in syngeneic C57BL/6 mice or in nude or CD8-/- mice and are apparently not malignant. They both belong to the B lineage, as their immunoglobulin (Ig) genes, but not the T cell receptor (TcR) beta locus, are rearranged, suggesting that they are relatively mature B cells. However, analysis of cell surface marker expression by FACS revealed a surface phenotype similar to that of pre-B cells (MHC I+, MHC II+, B7.2+, sIgM-, sIgG-, kappa-, B220-, CD5-, Thy1.2-, TcR-, CD3-, CD4-, CD8-, Mac-1-, 33D1-). Additionally, the CSTB5 cells express CD40 and the SD1 cells express CD43. Both cell lines contain the MAIDS-defective provirus and express the expected 4.2-kb viral RNA and the corresponding Pr60gag protein. The CSTB5 cells are nonproducer, while the SD1 cell line produces what appears to be an endogenous MuLV. The phenotype of these cell lines is very similar to what is known about the target B cells of this virus in vivo. These new established cell lines are likely to be useful in elucidating the mechanism(s) by which the MAIDS-defective virus causes its target B cells to proliferate and induce T cell anergy in infected animals.","['Klein, S J', 'Simard, C', 'Jolicoeur, P']","['Klein SJ', 'Simard C', 'Jolicoeur P']","['Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Clinical Research Institute of Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,IM,,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/*virology', 'Cell Line', 'Defective Viruses/immunology/*pathogenicity', 'Gene Products, gag/genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/immunology/*pathogenicity', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphoid Tissue/immunology/virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mice, SCID', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*etiology/immunology/virology', 'Proviruses/immunology/pathogenicity', 'Viral Proteins/genetics']",1998/05/28 00:00,1998/05/28 00:01,['1998/05/28 00:00'],"['1998/05/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/28 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/28 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(98)99112-7 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1998.9112 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 1998 May 10;244(2):283-93. doi: 10.1006/viro.1998.9112.,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Pr60(gag) protein, murine AIDS virus)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Southern blot analysis in both cases showed two identical MLL gene rearrangements indicating chromosomal translocation. The rearrangements were detectable in the second twin before signs of clinical disease and the intensity relative to the normal fragment indicated that the translocation was not constitutional. Fluorescence in situ hybridization with an MLL-specific probe and karyotype analyses suggested t(11;22)(q23;q11. 2) disrupting MLL. Known 5' sequence from MLL but unknown 3' sequence from chromosome band 22q11.2 formed the breakpoint junction on the der(11) chromosome. We used panhandle variant PCR to clone the translocation breakpoint. By ligating a single-stranded oligonucleotide that was homologous to known 5' MLL genomic sequence to the 5' ends of BamHI-digested DNA through a bridging oligonucleotide, we formed the stem-loop template for panhandle variant PCR which yielded products of 3.9 kb. The MLL genomic breakpoint was in intron 7. The sequence of the partner DNA from band 22q11.2 was identical to the hCDCrel (human cell division cycle related) gene that maps to the region commonly deleted in DiGeorge and velocardiofacial syndromes. Both MLL and hCDCrel contained homologous CT, TTTGTG, and GAA sequences within a few base pairs of their respective breakpoints, which may have been important in uniting these two genes by translocation.

To investigate more fully the mechanistic basis for displacement synthesis and to characterize the activity with natural viral templates, displacement and non-displacement synthesis were compared under a variety of conditions using the viral long terminal repeat plus strand as the template. Although the rates of both displacement and non-displacement synthesis varied regionally over the template, on the average, displacement synthesis was slower by a factor of approximately 3 to 4. Surprisingly, with one particular primer situated downstream of the tRNA primer binding site, displacement synthesis was found to be at least tenfold more processive than non-displacement synthesis, approaching a value of 500 nucleotides. The sequence features associated with pausing during the two modes of synthesis are different in both nucleotide preference and position relative to the enzyme, suggesting that the enzyme contacts the DNA differently under the two modes of synthesis. It was found that pausing during displacement synthesis did not reflect those local regions of DNA with a predicted high degree of thermal stability. Moreover, the very similar effects of temperature on the rates of displacement and non-displacement synthesis make unlikely a strictly passive mechanism of displacement synthesis whereby breathing of the downstream duplex is sufficient for advancement of the polymerase. Together, these results suggest a mechanism of displacement synthesis in which reverse transcriptase actively participates in the process of strand separation in front of the translocating polymerase.","['Whiting, S H', 'Champoux, J J']","['Whiting SH', 'Champoux JJ']","['School of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195-7242, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,IM,,"['Base Composition', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers', '*DNA Replication', 'DNA, Viral/*biosynthesis/*chemistry', 'Drug Stability', 'Kinetics', 'Models, Genetic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*enzymology/genetics', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Templates, Genetic', 'Thermodynamics']",1998/06/20 00:00,1998/06/20 00:01,['1998/06/20 00:00'],"['1998/06/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/20 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-2836(98)91720-X [pii]', '10.1006/jmbi.1998.1720 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Biol. 1998 May 8;278(3):559-77. doi: 10.1006/jmbi.1998.1720.,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",,,"['5T32GM07266/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA51605/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Copyright 1998 Academic Press Limited.'],,,,,,,,,,

This has largely been due to the inconsistent results of epidemiology studies that have reported alternatively no or weak associations between exposure to BD and hematopoietic neoplasms. Moreover, the specificity of association of BD exposure with individual leukemia types remains unclear. In addition, a distinct difference in the pattern of leukemia risk has been observed between workers employed in BD monomer production and those involved in styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) production: with no increase in leukemia risk observed for exposure to BD monomer alone. These observations are consistent with an increase in leukemia risk associated with the SBR process but not BD monomer and suggest the possibility that the increase may be the result of exposure to confounding factors previously not considered. In this regard, evidence is accumulating to suggest that SBR studies may be confounded by the presence of an important class of biologically active chemicals employed in the rubber industry, dithiocarbamates. The hematotoxicity and immunotoxicity of dithiocarbamates have been implicated in a wide range of clinical, animal and molecular studies, and an extremely high concordance exists between the risk of developing leukemia in SBR production and opportunity for exposure to this class of agents. Based on these findings additional studies on the epidemiology, carcinogenesis and molecular biology of dithiocarbamates are clearly warranted.","['Irons, R D', 'Pyatt, D W']","['Irons RD', 'Pyatt DW']","['Molecular Toxicology and Environmental Health Sciences Program, School of Pharmacy, Department of Pathology, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver 80262, USA. richard.irons@ushcs.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,IM,,"['Butadienes/*toxicity', 'Confounding Factors, Epidemiologic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Risk Factors', 'Thiocarbamates/*toxicity']",1998/05/26 00:00,1998/05/26 00:01,['1998/05/26 00:00'],"['1998/05/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/26 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/carcin/19.4.539 [doi]'],ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 1998 Apr;19(4):539-42. doi: 10.1093/carcin/19.4.539.,"['0 (Butadienes)', '0 (Thiocarbamates)', 'JSD5FGP5VD (1,3-butadiene)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there has been only a little information about the mechanism of CD30 expression. In this study, modulation of the CD30 molecule was investigated by the treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA). When cultures were supplemented with TPA, CD30 transcript was downregulated in a dose- and time-dependent manner in the erythroleukemia cell line K562. Half reduction of CD30 transcript, precursor protein and surface protein was at 3 h, 6 h, and 40 h, respectively, by Northern blot and Western blot analyses. This consecutive reduction of both the transcript and proteins suggests that TPA directly inhibits the transcriptional step of CD30, and subsequently CD30 molecules would decrease on the cell surface. To determine whether the protein kinase C (PKC) pathway is involved in this reduction, a PKC inhibitor, 10 microM H-7, was added to the K562 culture. The addition of H-7 recovered the inhibitory effect of TPA, indicating that PKC is involved in the transcription of CD30.

The 48 boys and 25 girls ranged in age from 0.4 to 14.2 years (median: 4.3 years). Bone and joint pain was a relatively common presenting feature besides fever, hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy. Immunophenotyping of blast cells showed: 51 B-cell precursor ALL, one B-ALL, 10 T-ALL and three myeloid-antigen positive ALL. Eight cases were unclassified since immunophenotyping had not been performed. Out of the 73 patients, treatment outcome was analysed in 20 cases treated with UKALL-VIII regimen and 28 cases treated with either the UKALL-XI regimen or the Hong Kong Children Cancer Study Group (HKCCSG) protocol which was modelled upon UKALL-XI. Although complete remission rates were similar between the two groups, patients treated with the former regimen that was less intensified suffered more relapses than the latter (56 per cent versus 21 per cent, P = 0.04). There were, however, no significant differences both in event-free survival (38.2 +/- 11.2 per cent versus 71.3 +/- 9.3 per cent, P = 0.12) and overall survival (70.0 +/- 10.2 per cent versus 79.6 +/- 8.3 per cent, P = 0.41) between the two groups at 3 years by long-rank test.

Therefore, new approaches are necessary. Immunotherapy has become again a major interest as a new treatment modality for B cell lymphoma since the discovery that the lymphoma specific Id can be presented to antigen-specific T cells. Vaccination of the tumour-bearing host is one of the major strategies to induce a T cell mediated anti-tumour immunity in vivo. For B cell lymphomas the lymphoma specific Id can be used as a tumour-specific antigen to stimulate T cells. Alternatively, the malignant B cells can be modified to become efficient antigen presenting cells (APCs) and present peptides from their own tumour-specific antigens to the autologous T cells. Currently explored and future vaccination strategies for B cell lymphoma will be discussed here.","['Schultze, J L']",['Schultze JL'],"['Department of Adult Oncology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA. schultze@mbcrr.harvard.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/genetics/*immunology', 'Cancer Vaccines/*therapeutic use', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Idiotypes/genetics/*immunology', '*Immunotherapy, Active', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/therapy', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/immunology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Models, Immunological', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/genetics/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology', 'Transfection', 'Vaccination/*methods', 'Vaccines, DNA/therapeutic use', 'Vaccines, Synthetic/therapeutic use']",1997/08/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1099-1069(199708)15:3<129::AID-HON607>3.0.CO;2-N [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1099-1069(199708)15:3<129::aid-hon607>3.0.co;2-n [doi]']",ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 1997 Aug;15(3):129-39. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1099-1069(199708)15:3<129::aid-hon607>3.0.co;2-n.,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Idiotypes)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Vaccines, DNA)', '0 (Vaccines, Synthetic)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,91,,,,,,,,,,,,

To gain insight into the molecular basis of hemopoietic activities shared by TPO and GM-CSF/IL3 in TF-1/TPO cells, we studied the cross-talk between signal transduction pathways elicited by these cytokines. Stimulation of TF-1/TPO cells with TPO resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of the TPO receptor (c-Mpl) as well as the common beta subunit (beta c) of GM-CSF/IL3 receptor complex. GM-CSF, however, induced tyrosine phosphorylation of beta c but not c-Mpl. TPO-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of beta c was time- and dose-dependent. We next examined whether or not TPO-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of beta c led to recruitment of SH2-containing molecules such as Stat5 and Shc. While GM-CSF caused association of Stat5 and Shc with beta c, TPO caused association of Stat5, but not Shc, with beta c, suggesting that TPO and GM-CSF may not induce phosphorylation of the same sets of tyrosine residues in beta c. These results suggest that activation of c-Mpl affects the signaling pathway of GM-CSF/IL3 but not vice versa.","['Ooi, J', 'Tojo, A', 'Asano, S', 'Sato, Y', 'Oka, Y']","['Ooi J', 'Tojo A', 'Asano S', 'Sato Y', 'Oka Y']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Yamaguchi University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', '*Milk Proteins', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction', 'Thrombopoietin/*pharmacology', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/metabolism', 'src Homology Domains']",1998/05/26 00:00,1998/05/26 00:01,['1998/05/26 00:00'],"['1998/05/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/26 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/26 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(98)98588-6 [pii]', '10.1006/bbrc.1998.8588 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1998 May 8;246(1):132-6. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.1998.8588.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We sequenced partial fragments of long terminal repeats (LTR) of the new HTLV-Is, and then the sequences were subjected to a phylogenetic analysis for comparison with other HTLV-Is of various geographical origins. Our results indicated that all the isolates were members of the Cosmopolitan group. Furthermore, most (four out of five isolates) of the new HTLV-Is belonged to the Transcontinental (A) subgroup, the most widespread subgroup of the four subgroups in the Cosmopolitan group. In this subgroup, they were closely related to HTLV-Is found in other South American countries including those of Amerindians, and were different from those found in Africa. In contrast, the remaining one HTLV-I (ARGMF) did not show any clear similarity to known HTLV-I isolates belonging to the Cosmopolitan group. The close similarity of South American HTLV-Is strongly suggests a common origin of the virus in this continent.

The AUC of CdATP in leukemic cells is lower than the AUC of CdAMP (median ratio 0.60). There was no correlation between cellular CdATP and plasma CdA concentrations or dCK activity.

We have now investigated the capability of didox and amidox to interfere with the iron metabolism. We show by photometric and polarographic methods, that didox and amidox are capable of forming an iron complex. However, their cytotoxic action cannot be circumvented by addition of Fe-ammoniumcitrate, indicating the iron complexing capacity not to be responsible for the mechanism of action of these compounds. When L1210 leukemia cells were incubated with the didox-iron or amidox-iron complex itself, only slight changes of the 50% growth inhibitory capacity of the complex in comparison with didox or amidox alone could be shown. We conclude, that didox and amidox are capable of forming an iron complex, but in contrast to other agents, the anticancer activity cannot be contributed to this effect alone.

Duration of HCC before PBSCT was identical between the two groups (six to eight days). Average total calorie and protein intake during HCC was significantly higher for group B than for group A. The %REE, the percentage of REE to the predicted basal energy expenditure (BEE), in group A showed 133 +/- 19%, 129 +/- 14% and 146 +/- 11% during three periods of HCC (days -8 to -1 of PBSCT), bone marrow suppression (days 0 to 11 of PBSCT) and bone marrow recovery (days 12 to 22 of PBSCT), respectively. In contrast, those in group B were 10% to 20% lower than those in group A at all periods. Carbohydrate oxidation rates during HCC in group A were significantly lower than those in group B, and those were not different between both groups during post-PBSCT periods. Fat oxidation rates in both groups were similar at all stages of periods. In contrast, protein degradation rates in group A were significantly higher than those in group B at all stages of the period. From these results, we concluded that commencement of TPN administration prior to HCC in the patients undergoing PBSCT provides beneficial effects to maintain better energy metabolic and nutritional status.","['Yamanaka, H', 'Takeda, E', 'Takata, K', 'Syutou, E', 'Miyamoto, K', 'Watanabe, T', 'Kawano, Y', 'Takaue, Y', 'Kuroda, Y']","['Yamanaka H', 'Takeda E', 'Takata K', 'Syutou E', 'Miyamoto K', 'Watanabe T', 'Kawano Y', 'Takaue Y', 'Kuroda Y']","['Department of Clinical Nutrition, University of Tokushima School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,J Med Invest,The journal of medical investigation : JMI,9716841,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Energy Metabolism', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Parenteral Nutrition/*adverse effects', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1998/05/23 00:00,1998/05/23 00:01,['1998/05/23 00:00'],"['1998/05/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/23 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/23 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Med Invest. 1998 Feb;44(3-4):199-203.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Coinjection of 5 x 10(6) transduced cells and 10(2) or 10(3) 32Dp210 leukemia (BCR/ABL+) cells resulted in inhibition of leukemia development by 10(2) but not 10(3) 32Dp210 cells. An equal dose of nontransduced 32Dcl3 cells was ineffective in inhibiting leukemia progression by 10(2) 32Dp210 cells. Mice that rejected leukemia were BCR/ABL oncogene negative 8 weeks after leukemia cell injection. These data demonstrate the potential for TNF-alpha gene therapy for destroying residual leukemia, without the toxicity of systemic TNF-alpha therapy, following cytoreductive therapy and bone marrow transplant.","['Gautam, S C', 'Pindolia, K R', 'Xu, Y X', 'Janakiraman, N', 'Chapman, R A', 'Freytag, S O']","['Gautam SC', 'Pindolia KR', 'Xu YX', 'Janakiraman N', 'Chapman RA', 'Freytag SO']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit, MI 48202, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Hematother,Journal of hematotherapy,9306048,IM,,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*genetics']",1998/05/23 00:00,1998/05/23 00:01,['1998/05/23 00:00'],"['1998/05/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/23 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/scd.1.1998.7.115 [doi]'],ppublish,J Hematother. 1998 Apr;7(2):115-25. doi: 10.1089/scd.1.1998.7.115.,['0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ages of the affected cats were relatively old, ranging from 4 to 13 years of age. Gastrointestinal signs were commonly observed in these cases. Only one of the six GL tumor cases was positive for feline leukemia virus (FeLV) antigen. Phenotypic analysis revealed that the GL tumor cells from all of the six cases lacked the T- or B-cell markers. These GL tumor cells were examined by Southern blot analysis using feline immunoglobulin (Ig) and T-cell receptor (TCR) gene probes. GL tumor cells obtained from two cases were identified as cells of T-cell lineage by the presence of a rearranged TCR beta gene, whereas those from the other four cases were considered to be derived from non-T- non-B-cell lineage because of the absence of rearrangement of these genes. These findings indicated that feline GL tumors can be considered as a specific disease entity in feline lymphomas because the cases examined in this study showed onset at an older age, a low incidence of FeLV infection and frequent involvement of gastrointestinal lesions, which are not found in typical FeLV-associated lymphomas. Although no specific phenotypes was observed by phenotypic analysis, the feline GL tumor cells were divided into two consistent genotypes of T-cell or non-T- non-B-cell lineages.","['Endo, Y', 'Cho, K W', 'Nishigaki, K', 'Momoi, Y', 'Nishimura, Y', 'Mizuno, T', 'Goto, Y', 'Watari, T', 'Tsujimoto, H', 'Hasegawa, A']","['Endo Y', 'Cho KW', 'Nishigaki K', 'Momoi Y', 'Nishimura Y', 'Mizuno T', 'Goto Y', 'Watari T', 'Tsujimoto H', 'Hasegawa A']","['Department of Veterinary Internal Medicine, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, University of Tokyo, Japan. aa47108@ecc-mail.hongo.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Comp Immunol Microbiol Infect Dis,"Comparative immunology, microbiology and infectious diseases",7808924,IM,,"['Abdominal Neoplasms/diagnosis/pathology/*veterinary', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Cat Diseases/*diagnosis', 'Cats', 'Cell Lineage', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Hodgkin Disease/diagnosis/pathology/*veterinary', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/genetics', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen/genetics']",1998/05/23 00:00,1998/05/23 00:01,['1998/05/23 00:00'],"['1998/05/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/23 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/23 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0147-9571(97)00019-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0147-9571(97)00019-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Comp Immunol Microbiol Infect Dis. 1998 Jan;21(1):27-42. doi: 10.1016/s0147-9571(97)00019-2.,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Initiation of cell death was observed by 1 day after MTA treatment, and it was induced in a dose- and time-dependent manner. However, cell viability measured by trypan blue exclusion was not consistent with the actual percentage of cell death. These results indirectly indicated that the type of cell death is apoptosis rather than necrosis. Nuclear fragmentation and DNA condensation of MTA-treated U937 cells were analyzed by both fluorescent and electron microscopy. MTA-treated cells first began to arrest in the M phase of the cell cycle, and they then exhibited a mitotic-like nuclear fragmentation process with partially membraneless chromatin. Furthermore, agarose gel electrophoresis of DNA extracted from cells treated with MTA showed DNA laddering with production of fragments of approximately 200 bp multiples. These studies indicated that cell death induced by MTA has the characteristics of apoptosis, although nuclear fragmentation is atypical. It seems likely that the process of apoptosis in U937 cells induced by MTA correlates with incomplete assembly of the nuclear envelope, since MTA itself could inhibit the carboxylmethylation of nuclear lamin B and delayed incorporation of lamin B into the nuclear envelope.","['Lee, S H', 'Cho, Y D']","['Lee SH', 'Cho YD']","['Department of Biochemistry, College of Science, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,IM,,"['*Apoptosis', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Deoxyadenosines/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Lamin Type B', 'Lamins', 'Leukemia', 'Nuclear Envelope/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Protein O-Methyltransferase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Thionucleosides/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/05/23 00:00,1998/05/23 00:01,['1998/05/23 00:00'],"['1998/05/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/23 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/23 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(98)94000-9 [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1998.4000 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1998 May 1;240(2):282-92. doi: 10.1006/excr.1998.4000.,"['0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Lamin Type B)', '0 (Lamins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Thionucleosides)', ""634Z2VK3UQ (5'-methylthioadenosine)"", 'EC 2.1.1.- (Protein O-Methyltransferase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine the localization of TAF-I, we raised both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies against TAF-I. The proteins that react to the antibodies are present not only in human cells but also in mouse, frog, insect, and yeast cells. The mouse TAF-I homologue is ubiquitous in a variety of tissue cells, including liver, kidney, spleen, lung, heart, and brain. It is of interest that the amounts of TAF-I alpha and beta vary among hemopoietic cells and some specific cell types do not contain TAF-I alpha. The level of the TAF-I proteins does not change significantly during the cell cycle progression in either HeLa cells synchronized with an excess concentration of thymidine or NIH 3T3 cells released from the serum-depleted state. TAF-I is predominantly located in nuclei, while TAF-I that is devoid of its acidic region, the region which is essential for the TAF-I activity, shows both nuclear and cytoplasmic localization.

However, attempts to detect apoptotic cells in clinical samples are rarely successful. A hypothesis is that apoptotic cells are cleared from the circulation by phagocytosis before they become detectable by conventional morphological or cytometric methods. Using LR73 adhering cells as phagocytes in a model of in vitro phagocytosis, we found that phagocytosis of daunorubicin (DNR)-treated U937, HL60, or K562 leukemia cell lines occurred prior to phosphatidylserine externalization, DNA hydrolysis, chromatin condensation, nuclear fragmentation, or mitochondrial potential alteration. Moreover DNR-treated K562 cells were eliminated by phagocytes while apoptosis was never observed by any of the above methods. By contrast, using a fluorometric batch analysis assay to detect caspase activity in ceramide- or DNR-treated cells (fluorogenic substrate for caspase), we found that caspase activity increased in apoptosis-committed cells before they were detected by flow cytometry or recognized by phagocytes. Similarly a caspase activity increase was detected in circulating mononuclear cells of luekemic patients 15 h after the beginning of anthracyclin treatment. We suggest that recent findings on enzymatic events (caspase activation) occurring in the early events of apoptosis must now allow the development of new markers for apoptosis, irrespective of the morphological features or internucleosomal fragmentation which are late events in apoptosis.","['Durrieu, F', 'Belloc, F', 'Lacoste, L', 'Dumain, P', 'Chabrol, J', 'Dachary-Prigent, J', 'Morjani, H', 'Boisseau, M R', 'Reiffers, J', 'Bernard, P', 'Lacombe, F']","['Durrieu F', 'Belloc F', 'Lacoste L', 'Dumain P', 'Chabrol J', 'Dachary-Prigent J', 'Morjani H', 'Boisseau MR', 'Reiffers J', 'Bernard P', 'Lacombe F']","[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Hopital Haut Leveque, Pessac, France.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,IM,,"['Animals', 'Annexin A5', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'CD36 Antigens/metabolism', 'CHO Cells', 'Caspase 3', '*Caspases', 'Coumarins/metabolism', 'Cricetinae', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Daunorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Fluorescent Dyes/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Oligopeptides/metabolism', 'Phagocytes/*physiology', 'Phagocytosis', 'Sphingosine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/05/23 00:00,1998/05/23 00:01,['1998/05/23 00:00'],"['1998/05/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/23 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/23 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(97)93918-5 [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1997.3918 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1998 May 1;240(2):165-75. doi: 10.1006/excr.1997.3918.,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (CD36 Antigens)', '0 (Coumarins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (N-acetylsphingosine)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (acetyl-aspartyl-glutamyl-valyl-aspartyl-amino-4-methylcoumarin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because of the importance of TS as a chemotherapy target, we are studying the mechanism of TS inhibition-induced cell death by GW1843.

The role of the ceramide in apoptotic signaling was studied in Molt-4 human T-cell leukemia cells undergoing cell death after treatment with GW1843. In response to GW1843, Molt-4 cells undergo apoptosis with both acidic pH, Mg2+-independent sphingomyelinase (ASMase) and neutral pH, Mg2+-dependent sphingomyelinase (NSMase) activities elevated as early steps in the initiation of apoptosis before Molt-4 commitment to death. These activities lead to ceramide production with kinetics consistent with a role as an effector molecule signaling the initiation of apoptosis in Molt-4 cells. These changes were found to be independent of caspase 3-like (CPP32/apopain) activity and DNA degradation, but were not separable from membrane blebbing or cell lysis in this cell line.

A significantly shorter treatment-free interval from diagnosis (P = .003) and a poorer response to therapy (P = .007) was observed in p53-positive compared with p53-negative patients. Overall survival from the time of diagnosis, as well as from the time of p53 protein analysis, was significantly shorter in patients with p53 protein expression (P = .03 and .0001, respectively). Moreover, in multivariate analysis, p53 expression and stage C were independently associated with a short survival. The results of this study indicate that in CLL the expression of the p53 protein, analyzed by a simple and reliable immunocytochemical method, is strongly associated with p53 gene mutations, a morphological variant (CLL with >10% prolymphocytes), advanced clinical stage, progressive disease, poor response to therapy, and short survival.","['Cordone, I', 'Masi, S', 'Mauro, F R', 'Soddu, S', 'Morsilli, O', 'Valentini, T', 'Vegna, M L', 'Guglielmi, C', 'Mancini, F', 'Giuliacci, S', 'Sacchi, A', 'Mandelli, F', 'Foa, R']","['Cordone I', 'Masi S', 'Mauro FR', 'Soddu S', 'Morsilli O', 'Valentini T', 'Vegna ML', 'Guglielmi C', 'Mancini F', 'Giuliacci S', 'Sacchi A', 'Mandelli F', 'Foa R']","['Dipartimento di Biotecnologie Cellulari ed Ematologia, Universita ""La Sapienza,"" Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Ki-67 Antigen/immunology/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Point Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism']",1998/05/30 00:00,1998/05/30 00:01,['1998/05/30 00:00'],"['1998/05/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/30 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/30 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)55485-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Jun 1;91(11):4342-9.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Ki-67 Antigen)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have isolated an arsenic-resistant NB4 subline (NB4-AsR), which fails to undergo apoptosis, but maintains the partial differentiation response to this drug. When grown in the presence of As2O3, NB4-AsR cells degrade PML/RARalpha, slightly differentiate, and become more sensitive to serum deprivation-induced apoptosis. Similarly, in RA-resistant NB4-R1 cells, RA induced a significant PML/RARalpha degradation and yet failed to induce cell maturation. Thus, As2O3- or retinoic acid (RA)-induced PML/RARalpha degradation may be a prerequisite, but is not sufficient for the full differentiative/apoptotic response to these drugs. Strikingly, RA-triggered differentiation and apoptosis were greatly accelerated in As2O3-treated NB4-AsR cells. The synergism between these two agents in this setting could provide an experimental basis for combined or sequential RA/As2O3 therapies.","['Gianni, M', 'Koken, M H', 'Chelbi-Alix, M K', 'Benoit, G', 'Lanotte, M', 'Chen, Z', 'de The, H']","['Gianni M', 'Koken MH', 'Chelbi-Alix MK', 'Benoit G', 'Lanotte M', 'Chen Z', 'de The H']","['Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique Unite Propre de Recherche 9051, Laboratoire associe au Comite de Paris de la Ligue Contre le Cancer, UIH, Universite Paris VII, Service de Biochimie B, Hopital St Louis, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/05/30 00:00,1998/05/30 00:01,['1998/05/30 00:00'],"['1998/05/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/30 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/30 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)55481-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Jun 1;91(11):4300-10.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found increased Fas receptor (FasR) expression in peripheral blood CD4+ and CD8+ cells of B-CLL patients compared with the equivalent cells of healthy donors. Although increased Fas receptor expression was significant in both T-lymphocytic subsets, only CD4+ cells from B-CLL patients underwent apoptosis after treatment with the agonistic Fas antibody CH11. In CD4+ cells of B-CLL patients, the Fas-sensitivity also correlated with a CD4+/CD8+ ratio below the lower threshold of healthy individuals (<1.0). By contrast, FasR expression in the CD19(+) fraction of B-CLL patients was downregulated compared with normal controls, and this was associated with an insensitivity to CH11-induced apoptosis. The B-CLL cell line EHEB as well as CD19(+) cells from B-CLL patients constitutively expressed Fas ligand (FasL). The FasL was functionally active, as the B-CLL cell line as well as T-cell-depleted CD19+ B-CLL fractions were able to kill target T-acute lymphatic leukemia (T-ALL) cells in vitro. This effect was inhibited by the antagonistic FasR-antibody ZB4, the neutralizing anti-FasL monoclonal antibody (MoAb) NOK-2 or by transfection of the caspase inhibitor crmA. These data point to the fact that expression of FasL on CD19(+) B-CLL cells, together with enhanced susceptibility of CD4+ T cells toward FasL-bearing effector cells, are causally linked to the relative reduction of CD4+ cells occurring during B-CLL progression. These findings could explain the inversion of the ratio of CD4+/CD8+ cell numbers, which may be causally linked to the immune deficiency observed in these patients and to the expansion of the neoplastic clone in B-CLL.","['Tinhofer, I', 'Marschitz, I', 'Kos, M', 'Henn, T', 'Egle, A', 'Villunger, A', 'Greil, R']","['Tinhofer I', 'Marschitz I', 'Kos M', 'Henn T', 'Egle A', 'Villunger A', 'Greil R']","['Laboratory of Molecular Cytology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Aged', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Down-Regulation', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology', 'fas Receptor/*immunology']",1998/05/30 00:00,1998/05/30 00:01,['1998/05/30 00:00'],"['1998/05/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/30 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/30 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)55478-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Jun 1;91(11):4273-81.,"['0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we examined four IL-2-dependent adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) cell lines for their IL-15R expression. All cell lines bound IL-15, which was not inhibited by a 100-fold excess amount of IL-2, proliferated in response to IL-15 to the same degree as to the stimulation with IL-2, and were maintained without IL-2. The responses to 1L-15 were inhibited by the antibodies against IL-2R beta or gamma chains but was not by the IL-2R alpha chain antibody. [125I]-IL-15 exhibited a single high-affinity binding with an apparent kd of 0.17 nmol/L. Reverse transcription-coupled polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed that the cell lines had the mRNA of IL-15R alpha. The cell lines also had IL-15 mRNA. Despite the presence of IL-15 mRNA, the cell lines did not secrete IL-15, and the culture supernatants of fresh ATL cells and plasma from the patients did not contain a detectable amount of IL-15 with a few exceptional cases, although fresh ATL cells also responded to IL-15. These results suggest that ATL cells have the complete form of IL-15R and respond to IL-15.

To evaluate whether interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) therapy would not only restore normal hematopoiesis, but also the abnormal T-cell repertoire, we studied T lymphocytes from a cohort of HCL patients treated by IFN-alpha in the past, at initiation, and at several intervals up to 6 years of IFN-alpha treatment. The junctional regions from 22 TCRBV gene families were analyzed after polymerase chain reaction amplification of cDNA (RT-PCR) using family specific primers. In all seven patients improvement of the skewed T-cell repertoire was not seen until 2 years of treatment. It consisted of disappearance of oligoclonal subpopulations and (polyclonal) reappearance of absent TCRBV gene families. The RT-PCR results were correlated with the TCRBV protein expression using TCRBV-specific monoclonal antibodies. T lymphocytes from four patients with active HCL contained large expansions of particular TCRBV-expressing cells (up to 25% of the CD3+ cells; 600 to 700/microL whole blood), which decreased during IFN-alpha therapy in both patients tested. Finally, restoration of the TCR repertoire matched normalization of the functional immune repertoire as measured by proliferative, helper, and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte precursor frequencies against major histocompatibility complex-unrelated individuals. In conclusion, oligoclonal bands of TCRBV gene families found by RT-PCR correspond with a dramatic increase in circulating T lymphocytes expressing the same TCRBV family. Moreover, IFN-alpha can restore the skewed T-cell repertoire and suppress persistent T-cell clones upon treatment of the accompanying malignancy.","['Kluin-Nelemans, H C', 'Kester, M G', 'van deCorput, L', 'Boor, P P', 'Landegent, J E', 'van Dongen, J J', 'Willemze, R', 'Falkenburg, J H']","['Kluin-Nelemans HC', 'Kester MG', 'van deCorput L', 'Boor PP', 'Landegent JE', 'van Dongen JJ', 'Willemze R', 'Falkenburg JH']","['Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'CD3 Complex/analysis', 'Cell Separation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics/*metabolism', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*blood/*drug therapy', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/genetics/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology']",1998/05/30 00:00,1998/05/30 00:01,['1998/05/30 00:00'],"['1998/05/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/30 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/30 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)55472-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Jun 1;91(11):4224-31.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined here the effects of thrombopoietin (TPO) on the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors in JCML. In serum-deprived single-cell cultures of normal bone marrow (BM) CD34+CD38high cells, the addition of TPO to the culture containing SCF + GM-CSF resulted in an increase in the number and size of GM colonies. In the JCML cultures, in contrast, the number of SCF + GM-CSF-dependent GM colonies was not increased by the addition of TPO. However, the TPO addition caused an enlargement of GM colonies in cultures from the JCML patients to a significantly greater extent compared with the normal controls. There was no difference in the type of the constituent cells of GM colonies with or without TPO grown by JCML BM cells. A flow cytometric analysis showed that the c-Mpl expression was found on CD13+ myeloid cells generated by CD34+CD38high BM cells from JCML patients, but was at an undetectable level in normal controls. The addition of TPO to the culture containing SCF or SCF + GM-CSF caused a significant increase in the production of GM colony-forming cells by JCML CD34+CD38neg/low population, indicating the stimulatory effects of TPO on JCML primitive hematopoietic progenitors. Normal BM cells yielded a significant number of megakaryocytes as well as myeloid cells in response to a combination of SCF, GM-CSF, and/or TPO. In contrast, megakaryocytic cells were barely produced by the JCML progenitors.

We cloned cDNAs from the leukemic cells of a patient carrying t(16;21) by the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction using an AML1-specific primer. The structural analysis of the cDNAs showed that AML1 was fused to a novel gene named MTG16 (Myeloid Translocation Gene on chromosome 16) which shows high homology to MTG8 (ETO/CDR) and MTGR1. Northern blot analysis using MTG16 probes mainly detected 4.5 kb and 4.2 kb RNAs, along with several other minor RNAs in various human tissues. As in t(8;21), the t(16;21) breakpoints occurred between the exons 5 and 6 of AML1, and between the exons 1 and 2 or the exons 3 and 4 of MTG16. The two genes are fused in-frame, resulting in the characteristic chimeric transcripts of this translocation. Although the reciprocal chimeric product, MTG16-AML1, was also detected in one of the t(16;21) patients, its protein product was predicted to be truncated.

Depending on the nature of the target cells, these effects can be growth-stimulatory or growth-inhibitory. Receptors for leukemia inhibitory factor (LIFR) have been identified on a variety of hematopoietic and epithelial cells. We have recently demonstrated in vitro growth stimulation of human breast cancer cells, both primary tumors and cultured cell lines, by LIF. To begin to understand the in vivo relevance of these observations, we investigated the expression of LIF and LIFR in human breast cancer specimens. Specimens from 50 cases were immunostained with mouse monoclonal antibodies D62.3 and M1 (to stain for LIF and LIFR, respectively). LIF expression was observed in 78% of the specimens and correlated with favorable biological features, i.e. low S-phase fraction (SPF) (P = 0.001) and diploidy (P = 0.08). LIFR expression was observed in 80% of the tumors and correlated with the presence of estrogen receptor (ER) (P = 0.04) and diploidy (P = 0.07). Coexpression of LIF and LIFR was associated with diploidy (P = 0.02) and low SPF (P = 0.05). LIF staining was primarily cytoplasmic whereas LIFR staining was cytoplasmic in the majority of cases and membranous in a minority of cases.

Following BMT, particularly during the first 3 months, patients have a number of neurologic complications. We evaluated the early neurologic complications following BMT and their influence on survival. METHODS: We prospectively followed 115 consecutive patients having BMT for leukemia, for a median period of 90 days after transplantation. RESULTS: Sixty-four patients (56%) had neurologic complications. Sixteen developed more than one complication. Twenty-seven patients (25%) had major neurologic complications: metabolic encephalopathy (8), seizures (8), psychiatric symptoms (3), cerebral hemorrhage (1), cerebral abscess (1), leukemic meningitis (1), peripheral neuropathies (5), and myopathies (2). Forty patients (35%) had minor complications, including headache (16) and tremor (31). Major neurologic complications occurred after engraftment in most patients. Metabolic encephalopathy correlated with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (p < 0.03). Seven percent of patients had generalized seizures that occurred without signs of structural cerebral lesions. Probability of survival at day 90 was lower in patients with than in those without major central nervous system complications (63% versus 87.5%, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Neurologic complications are frequent during the first 3 months following BMT and affect patient survival. Drug neurotoxicity and acute GVHD are the main factors influencing their occurrence.","['Antonini, G', 'Ceschin, V', 'Morino, S', 'Fiorelli, M', 'Gragnani, F', 'Mengarelli, A', 'Iori, A P', 'Arcese, W']","['Antonini G', 'Ceschin V', 'Morino S', 'Fiorelli M', 'Gragnani F', 'Mengarelli A', 'Iori AP', 'Arcese W']","['Department of Neurosciences, University of Rome La Sapienza, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Neurology,Neurology,0401060,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Central Nervous System Diseases/*etiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases/*etiology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",1998/05/22 00:00,1998/05/22 00:01,['1998/05/22 00:00'],"['1998/05/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/22 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/22 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1212/wnl.50.5.1441 [doi]'],ppublish,Neurology. 1998 May;50(5):1441-5. doi: 10.1212/wnl.50.5.1441.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two years later a hyperfibrotic form of MDS was detected in the patient, that soon after terminated in acute megakaryoblastic leukemia.

A prospective study was performed in the Tertiary Health Care Institution, Hemocentro, Campinas State University, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil. Thirty-five patients, diagnosed as ANLL between 1988 and 1991, were considered for participation. Eleven patients were not eligible, according to the exclusion criteria: infection/septicemia, previous treatment or blood transfusion. The study was performed with 24 ANLL patients, average age 34 years (16-69 years), 14 men and 10 women. Nineteen healthy volunteers, workers from the Hematology Center, average age 32 years (21-59 years), 11 men and 8 women, were the control group. Plasmatic prekallikrein, C1-inhibitor, alpha 2-macroglobulin, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, factor XII, factor XI, factor V and prealbumin were measured. Plasmatic prekallikrein (p = 0.02) and prealbumin (p = 0.03) were significantly decreased, and prothrombin time increased (p = 0.003) in the patient group when compared to the control. Significant correlation (r = 0.49, critical value = 0.43, p < 0.05) between prekallikrein and prealbumin, and between prothrombin time and factor V (r = 0.54, critical value = 0.44, p < 0.05) was demonstrated in the patient group. No correlation was found between parameters analysed and circulant blast count or leukemia subgroups. Statistical analysis was performed by the Wilcoxon test. Correlation between the parameters was also verified. These results suggest activation of the contact system or impaired liver synthesis in patients with ANLL, and could contribute to disease complications.","['Annichino-Bizzacchi, J M', 'Arruda, V R', 'Machado, T F', 'Gallizoni, A M', 'Ribeiro, C C']","['Annichino-Bizzacchi JM', 'Arruda VR', 'Machado TF', 'Gallizoni AM', 'Ribeiro CC']","['Department of Clinical Medicine, Medicine Faculty, UNICAMP, Cidade Universitaria Zeferino Vaz, Campinas, Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Brazil,Sao Paulo Med J,Sao Paulo medical journal = Revista paulista de medicina,100897261,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Blood Proteins/analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prothrombin Time']",1997/07/01 00:00,1998/05/22 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/22 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1590/s1516-31801997000400007 [doi]'],ppublish,Sao Paulo Med J. 1997 Jul-Aug;115(4):1490-4. doi: 10.1590/s1516-31801997000400007.,['0 (Blood Proteins)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The two tests to detect antibodies to gp51 correlated well in sera clearly positive or clearly negative by either one, but correlation was poor in the intermediate groups. All sera positive by AGID were also positive by ELISA, but results did not agree in sera negative by AGID, ELISA proving to be more sensitive. Western blot was a good technique for detecting antibodies against Gag-related proteins. However, no band was identified to clearly correspond to anti-Env-related proteins.

The diagnosis was made according to the French-American-British (FAB) criteria. We considered a diagnosis of B-PLL when a predominance (> 50%) of lymphoid cells with coarse chromatin but prominent central nucleoli and more abundant cytoplasm than typical chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells were present. B-PLL express strong SIg, B-cell antigens, and reactivity with the monoclonal antibody FMC7. Chromosome analysis was carried out on lymphoid cells from peripheral blood and, in one patient, from lymph node. The phytohemagglutinin (PHA) mitogen was used. ISH was performed with two types of probes: the biotin-labeled chromosome 12-specific alpha satellite DNA probe to detect trisomy 12, and biotin-labeled libraries of whole chromosomes 1, 7, and 14.

In this study, we describe the application of comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) to investigate the genomic abnormalities in 14 patients with ALL, all of whom had cytogenetically identified numerical aberrations or gross chromosomal structural alteration. With the use of CGH, regional or whole chromosome overrepresentation or both were found to be more frequent than underrepresentation (52 gains vs. 6 losses), the most common gains being chromosomes 21 and X. The results of the comparison between CGH and conventional R-banding analysis could be classified into three categories: (1) in three cases, including two with trisomy, CGH and banding analysis gave identical results; (2) in six cases with hyperdiploidy and two cases presenting chromosome structural abnormalities, the results were consistent but with minor discrepancies; (3) in three cases, including two with triploidy and tetraploidy and one with chimeric karyotype together with +22, the data from CGH and cytogenetical analysis were discrepant. CGH could not find the triploidy and tetraploidy. Our results suggest that CGH has certain value in the detection of gains or losses of chromosome materials in hyperdiploid ALL. Nevertheless, the combination of CGH and conventional karyotyping provides more precise information on the genomic imbalance in ALL.","['Wong, N', 'Chen, S J', 'Cao, Q', 'Su, X Y', 'Niu, C', 'Wu, Q W', 'Leung, T W', 'Wickham, N', 'Johnson, P J', 'Chen, Z']","['Wong N', 'Chen SJ', 'Cao Q', 'Su XY', 'Niu C', 'Wu QW', 'Leung TW', 'Wickham N', 'Johnson PJ', 'Chen Z']","[""Department of Clinical Oncology, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Prince of Wales Hospital, Shatin, N.

With the exception of M3, t(3;5) has been reported in every other subtype of AML, being most frequently associated with AML M6. Although a variety of breakpoints have been described, it has been suggested that the breakpoints in t(3;5) of all the reported cases should be assigned to 3q25.1 and 5q34. Recently, the breakpoints in three pediatric cases of AML M2 with t(3;5) were cloned and shown to involve the myelodysplasia/myeloid leukemia factor I (MLF1) gene on 3q25.1 and the nucleophosmin (NPM) gene on 5q34, generating a chimeric NPM/MLF1 transcript. An adult case of indolent erythroleukemia was found on karyotypic analysis to have t(3;5)(q21;q34). In about 60% of cells, the translocation was unbalanced, resulting in loss of the der(3) chromosome, implying that the critical leukemogenic sequence might reside on the der(5) chromosome. Molecular analysis of this case, however, failed to show rearrangement of the NPM gene and an MLF1/NPM transcript. A review of other reported cases of AML M6 with t(3;5) showed that the commonest breakpoint on chromosome 3 was also assigned to 3q21, as in our case. The considerable clinical, pathologic, cytogenetic and molecular differences observed in AML with t(3;5) suggest that these cases might be heterogeneous.","['Kwong, Y L']",['Kwong YL'],"[""University Department of Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,IM,,"['Aged', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics']",1998/05/22 00:00,1998/05/22 00:01,['1998/05/22 00:00'],"['1998/05/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/22 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/22 00:00 [entrez]']","['S016546089700366X [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-4608(97)00366-x [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1998 May;103(1):15-9. doi: 10.1016/s0165-4608(97)00366-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Within group I, the dibromo nitrogen mustard (3) and the half-mustard (4) are more cytotoxic (IC50 = 0.6 and 40 ng/ml respectively) than tallimustine (IC50 = 50.3 ng/ml) against L1210 cells with high reactivity against the region 5'-TTTTGA. The diol derivative (6) and the difluoro nitrogen mustard (5) were not cytotoxic against L1210 cells and did not show any detectable DNA alkylation. The two compounds modified in the propionamidine terminus (7 and 8, group II), showed lower cytotoxic potency (IC50 = 130 and 94 ng/ml respectively) against L1210 cells than tallimustine (IC50 = 50.3 ng/ml) and a loss of in vitro sequence specificity for DNA alkylation. Considering the compounds in which the pyrrole rings were replaced by one (9) or two (10) pyrazole rings, compound 9 was not significantly cytotoxic against L1210 cell line and was apparently unable to produce alkylation on the DNA fragments tested, while compound 10 showed decreased cytotoxicity (IC50 = 114 ng/ml) and no modification in the pattern and intensity of DNA alkylation. The data obtained in this work suggest that it is possible to increase tallimustine potency by modifying the nitrogen mustard moiety. Moreover, the sequence specificity of DNA alkylation appears to be affected by the modification of the propionamidino moiety but not by the isosteric modification of the pyrrole rings. The correlation between cytotoxicity and alkylation pattern suggests that tallimustine exerts its cytotoxicity through DNA sequence-specific alkylation of the adenine located in the sequence 5'-TTTTGA.","['Marchini, S', 'Cozzi, P', 'Beria, I', 'Geroni, C', 'Capolongo, L', ""D'Incalci, M"", 'Broggini, M']","['Marchini S', 'Cozzi P', 'Beria I', 'Geroni C', 'Capolongo L', ""D'Incalci M"", 'Broggini M']","['Department of Oncology, Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Anticancer Drug Des,Anti-cancer drug design,8603523,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*chemistry', 'Autoradiography', 'DNA/*chemistry', 'DNA Footprinting', 'Distamycins/*chemistry', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/pathology', 'Nitrogen Mustard Compounds/*chemistry', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/05/22 00:00,1998/05/22 00:01,['1998/05/22 00:00'],"['1998/05/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/22 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/22 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Drug Des. 1998 Apr;13(3):193-205.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Distamycins)', '0 (Nitrogen Mustard Compounds)', '71193OXG6S (tallimustine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To quantify the expression of the gene encoding P-gp (multidrug resistance 1; MDR1) and assess P-gp function, we developed competitive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay using heterologous competitor RNA and flow cytometric analysis using rhodamine 123 (Rh123; an artificial substrate for P-gp), respectively. First, we adjusted the assays by analyzing leukemia sublines showing various levels of MDR1 expression. The MDR1 expression in leukemia sublines quantified by competitive RT-PCR assay showed linearity over a wide range, and the results were parallel with those of MDR1 expression measured by Northern blot analysis, the P-gp antigen expression measured by flow cytometric analysis using MRK16, P-gp function analysis by Rh123 dye-efflux assay, and MDR phenotype. Then, we applied these assays to leukemic cells from patients with hematological malignancies. All 69 samples from 64 patients were successfully assayed, and the range of MDR1 expression was from 1.6 to 100 amol/microgram RNA. Since subpopulations of normal lymphocytes show a low degree of P-gp function, strict gating of leukemia cells was mandatory for dye-efflux assay of clinical samples. MDR1 expression in normal lymphocytes was below 8 amol/microgram RNA. By comparison to MDR1 expression quantified by competitive RT-PCR assay with P-gp function assessed by Rh123 dye-efflux assay in gated leukemic cells, more than 8 amol/microgram RNA was regarded as positive MDR1 expression in the leukemic cells themselves. These data suggest that these assays are suitable for evaluating P-gp expression and function in clinical samples when the proper cut-off value is used and may provide insights into the contribution of P-gp to drug resistance in hematological malignancies.","['Kobayashi, H', 'Takemura, Y']","['Kobayashi H', 'Takemura Y']","['Department of Pharmacology, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara.']",['jpn'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Japan,Rinsho Byori,Rinsho byori.

The origins of these cells are generally thought to be a common precursor for T- and B-lymphocytes. However, cytoplasmic staining of CD3 which is a more specific marker for T-lineage and cytoplasmic staining of mb-1 (CD79a) which is more specific for B-lineage were not performed in previous reports and the determination of the cell lineages of these cells was unclear. We had two cases of ALL whose blasts were CD2/CD19 double positive. The first case was assessed as B-lineage because the cells expressed cytoplasmic CD79a and lacked cytoplasmic CD3. The immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain gene was rearranged. The other cell surface markers including CD22 and HLA-DR also suggested that these cells were B-lineage. The CD2 expression may be a coincidence and should not be taken as a T-cell marker in this case. It was difficult to determine the lineage in the second case because both cytoplasmic CD79a and cytoplasmic CD3 were expressed and neither TCR beta chain nor Ig heavy chain genes were rearranged. The other surface markers were not useful to determine the lineage. We concluded that this case was really an unclassified ALL. Accordingly, cytoplasmic staining of CD3 and CD79a should be carried out in the diagnosis of leukemia when it is difficult to determine the cell lineage.","['Manabe, A', 'Mori, T', 'Ebihara, Y', 'Koyama, T', 'Okuyama, I', 'Hosoya, R', 'Kaneko, M', 'Ishimoto, K', 'Nakahata, T', 'Nakazawa, S']","['Manabe A', 'Mori T', 'Ebihara Y', 'Koyama T', 'Okuyama I', 'Hosoya R', 'Kaneko M', 'Ishimoto K', 'Nakahata T', 'Nakazawa S']","[""Department of Pediatrics, St. Luke's International Hospital, Japan.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Antigens, CD19/*blood', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'CD2 Antigens/*blood', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology/pathology']",1998/05/22 00:00,1998/05/22 00:01,['1998/05/22 00:00'],"['1998/05/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/22 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/22 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0925571097000601 [pii]', '10.1016/s0925-5710(97)00060-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 1998 Jan;67(1):45-52. doi: 10.1016/s0925-5710(97)00060-1.,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (CD2 Antigens)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A total of 89 cases (39 spouses of male patients and 50 female patients) who had babies during their first remission were analyzed, including 43 patients from the first survey in 1991. Median age at the birth of first baby was 30.7 years for male patients and 28.6 years for female patients. A total of 109 of the 117 pregnancies resulted in live births and eight resulted in abortions. A total of 58 cases had single children and 23 cases had two or more, generally from separate pregnancies, but including two pairs of twins. The infant was male in 59 cases, female in 37 and gender was not reported in 13 cases. Ages of children ranged from 2 months to 20 years at the time of this study and all children were in good health. There were two minor anomalies, both of which were surgically corrected.

Transduction efficiencies of the NeoR gene into K-562, MEG-O1, Raji, MOLT-3, HL-60, U937 and NKM-1 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 were 0.27, 0.25, 0.015, 0.009, < 0.0025 and < 0.0025%, respectively. After purification and concentration of rAAV, 27% efficiency was observed in K562 at an MOI of 7 and a linear relationship between MOI and efficiency was confirmed, suggesting that this system may be useful for gene transduction into leukemia cells. Integration of the NeoR gene into the host genome was detected by Southern blotting analysis, which showed various sizes of digested fragments. A fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) study was carried out on 11 clones, in all of which the NeoR gene was integrated out of chromosome 19q13.3.

To assess this hypothesis, Namalwa, Raji, and Daudi cell lines (Burkitt's lymphoma), LIK and SB cell lines (B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia), CEM and Jurkat cell lines (T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia), and U266 cell line (multiple myeloma) were evaluated for their capacity to produce matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9, and urokinase-type plasminogen activator. These cell lines were also assessed for their ability: (1) to produce the angiogenic basic fibroblast growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor; (2) to induce an angiogenic phenotype in cultured endothelial cells, represented by cell proliferation, chemotaxis, and morphogenesis; (3) to stimulate angiogenesis in different in vivo experimental models. All cell lines expressed the mRNA for one or both metalloproteinases. Namalwa, Raji, LIK, SB, and U266 cells secreted the active form of both metalloproteinases, while Daudi, CEM, and Jurkat cells produced metalloproteinase-2 but not-9. In contrast, urokinase-type plasminogen activator was secreted only by SB cells. While Raji, LIK, SB, CEM, and Jurkat cells secreted both basic fibroblast growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor, Daudi and U266 cells produced only the former, and Namalwa cells only the latter. Accordingly, the conditioned medium of all cell lines stimulated cell proliferation and/or chemotaxis in cultured endothelial cells, with the exception of that of Namalwa cells which was ineffective. The conditioned medium of CEM and Jurkat cells induced morphogenesis in cultured endothelial cells grown on a reconstituted basement membrane (Matrigel). Lastly, Namalwa, Raji, LIK, SB, U266, CEM, and Jurkat cells induced angiogenesis and mononuclear cell recruitment in the murine Matrigel sponge model and in a chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane assay. The extent of angiogenesis in both models was strictly correlated with the density of the mononuclear cell infiltrate. The results indicate that human lymphoproliferative disease cells possess both local and remote invasive ability via the secretion of matrix-degrading enzymes and the induction of angiogenesis which is fostered by host inflammatory cells and by an intervening ensemble of angiogenic factors.","['Vacca, A', 'Ribatti, D', 'Iurlaro, M', 'Albini, A', 'Minischetti, M', 'Bussolino, F', 'Pellegrino, A', 'Ria, R', 'Rusnati, M', 'Presta, M', 'Vincenti, V', 'Persico, M G', 'Dammacco, F']","['Vacca A', 'Ribatti D', 'Iurlaro M', 'Albini A', 'Minischetti M', 'Bussolino F', 'Pellegrino A', 'Ria R', 'Rusnati M', 'Presta M', 'Vincenti V', 'Persico MG', 'Dammacco F']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences and Human Oncology, Policlinico, Bari, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Int J Clin Lab Res,International journal of clinical & laboratory research,9206491,IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Movement', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chick Embryo', 'Collagen', 'Collagenases/*metabolism', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/pharmacology', 'Drug Combinations', 'Endothelial Growth Factors/metabolism', 'Endothelium, Vascular/*cytology', 'Female', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/metabolism', 'Gelatinases/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Laminin', 'Lymphocytes/enzymology/*physiology', 'Lymphokines/metabolism', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*pathology', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 2', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9', 'Metalloendopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Morphogenesis', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/*etiology', 'Proteoglycans', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator/*metabolism', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors']",1998/05/22 00:00,1998/05/22 00:01,['1998/05/22 00:00'],"['1998/05/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/22 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/22 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s005990050018 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Clin Lab Res. 1998;28(1):55-68. doi: 10.1007/s005990050018.,"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (Endothelial Growth Factors)', '0 (Laminin)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', '119978-18-6 (matrigel)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)', 'EC 3.4.21.73 (Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Collagenases)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Gelatinases)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Metalloendopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.24.24 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 2)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The TCR gamma gene characteristics of 73 cases of lymphocytic leukemia and lymphoma and other diseases that had presented 1 or 2 prominent bands of amplified TCR gamma VI subgroups-J1/2 gene rearrangement (GR) were detected by polymerase chain reaction-restriction enzymes (PCR-RE), heteroduplex formation (HDF), DNA sequencing and single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP). RESULTS: Thirty-four percent patients had 2 of TCR gamma GR (biallelic rearrangement); twenty-six percent had 1 of TCR gamma GR; fifty-four percent of acute lymphocytic leukemia's and nineteen percent of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) had 2 of TCR gamma GR. HDF could rapidly confirm more than 1 of alleles while more alleles were difficult to be recognized by restriction analysis.

By combining HDF method, oligoclonalities in three patients (2 acute lympholytic leukemia and 1 myelodysplastil syndrome and clone evolution in one NHL were found. CONCLUSIONS: The fact that many patients had 2 of TCR GR means that complications of two neoplastic clones can be affirmed only if more than 2 of TCR GR are found.

French Cooperative Group on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.,1506-14,"BACKGROUND: To determine whether chlorambucil treatment benefits patients with indolent chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), we conducted two randomized trials in 1535 patients with previously untreated stage A CLL. METHODS: In the first trial, 609 patients were randomly assigned to receive either daily chlorambucil or no treatment; in the second trial, 926 patients were randomly assigned to receive either intermittent chlorambucil plus prednisone or no treatment. Median follow-up for the first and second trials exceeded 11 and 6 years, respectively. The end points were overall survival, response to treatment, and disease progression. RESULTS: Treatment of indolent CLL did not increase survival in either trial. In the treated group, as compared with the untreated group, the relative risk of death was 1.14 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.92 to 1.41; P=0.23) in the first trial and 0.96 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.75 to 1.23; P=0.74) in the second trial, with 76 percent and 69 percent of patients, respectively, having a response to therapy. Although chlorambucil slowed disease progression, there was no effect on overall survival. In the untreated group in the first trial, 49 percent of patients did not have progression to more advanced disease and did not need therapy after follow-up of more than 11 years; however, 27 percent of patients with stage A CLL died of causes related to the disease. CONCLUSIONS: Chlorambucil does not prolong survival in patients with stage A CLL. Since deferring therapy until the disease progresses to stage B or C does not compromise survival, treatment of indolent CLL is unnecessary.","['Dighiero, G', 'Maloum, K', 'Desablens, B', 'Cazin, B', 'Navarro, M', 'Leblay, R', 'Leporrier, M', 'Jaubert, J', 'Lepeu, G', 'Dreyfus, B', 'Binet, J L', 'Travade, P']","['Dighiero G', 'Maloum K', 'Desablens B', 'Cazin B', 'Navarro M', 'Leblay R', 'Leporrier M', 'Jaubert J', 'Lepeu G', 'Dreyfus B', 'Binet JL', 'Travade P']","[""Unite d'Immuno-Hematologie et d'Immunopathologie, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,IM,,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Chlorambucil/*therapeutic use', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prednisone/therapeutic use', 'Survival Analysis']",1998/05/21 00:00,1998/05/21 00:01,['1998/05/21 00:00'],"['1998/05/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1056/NEJM199805213382104 [doi]'],ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1998 May 21;338(21):1506-14. doi: 10.1056/NEJM199805213382104.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",,,,,,['N Engl J Med. 1998 Sep 24;339(13):924.

In fact, we identified a junctional nonapeptide (SSKALQRPV) which binds to HLA-A2.1 molecules. This peptide, as well as those binding to HLA-A3, -A11, and -B8 molecules (previously identified by others), elicits primary CTL responses in vitro from PBLs of both healthy donors and CML patients. Such CTL recognize HLA-matched, BCR-ABL-positive leukemic cells, implying efficient natural processing and presentation of these junctional peptides. Specific CTL were found at high frequency in 5 of 21 CML patients, suggesting that these epitopes are, to some extent, immunogenic in vivo during the course of the disease.

The U937 leukemia cell line was transduced with PML/RARalpha cDNA. PML/RARalpha expression caused a markedly reduced sensitivity to TNF-alpha, even if apoptosis was triggered by agonistic antibodies to TNF-alpha receptors I and II (TNF-alphaRI, II). PML/RARalpha induced a 10-20-fold decrease of the TNF-alpha-binding capacity via downmodulation of both TNF-alphaRI and TNF-alphaRII: this may mediate at least in part the reduced sensitivity to TNF-alpha. Furthermore, the fusion protein did not modify Fas expression (CD95) or sensitivity to Fas-mediated apoptosis. The pathophysiological significance of these findings is supported by two series of observations. (a) Fresh APL blasts exhibit no TNF-alpha binding and are resistant to TNF-alpha-mediated apoptosis. Conversely, normal myeloblasts-promyelocytes show marked TNF-alphaR expression and are moderately sensitive to TNF-alpha-mediated cytotoxicity. Similarly, blasts from other types of acute myeloid leukemia (AML M1, M2, and M4 FAB types) show an elevated TNF-alpha binding. (b) The NB4 APL cell line, which is PML/RARalpha+, shows low TNF-alphaR expression capacity and is resistant to TNF-alpha-triggered apoptosis; conversely a PML/RARalpha- NB4 subclone (NB4.306) exhibits detectable TNF-alpha-binding capacity and is sensitive to TNF-alpha-mediated cytotoxicity. These studies indicate that the PML/RARalpha fusion protein protects against TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis, at least in part via downmodulation of TNF-alphaRI/II: this phenomenon may play a significant role in APL, which is characterized by prolonged survival of leukemic blasts.","['Testa, U', 'Grignani, F', 'Samoggia, P', 'Zanetti, C', 'Riccioni, R', 'Lo Coco, F', 'Diverio, D', 'Felli, N', 'Passerini, C G', 'Grell, M', 'Pelicci, P G', 'Peschle, C']","['Testa U', 'Grignani F', 'Samoggia P', 'Zanetti C', 'Riccioni R', 'Lo Coco F', 'Diverio D', 'Felli N', 'Passerini CG', 'Grell M', 'Pelicci PG', 'Peschle C']","['Department of Hematology-Oncology, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, 00161 Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,IM,,"['Antigens, CD/analysis/immunology', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Cell Division/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*genetics', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/agonists/immunology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*physiology', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*toxicity', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'fas Receptor/metabolism']",1998/05/29 00:00,1998/05/29 00:01,['1998/05/29 00:00'],"['1998/05/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI1332 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1998 May 15;101(10):2278-89. doi: 10.1172/JCI1332.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",,,,,PMC508816,,,,,,,,,

An understanding of the precise geometry of this complex has been elusive. We have used photocross-linking to investigate Tax-DNA contacts. Our data show that Tax contacts the DNA at two symmetric positions 14 nucleotides apart on either side of the Tax responsive element. The presence of symmetric, widely separated regions of contact suggests that at least two molecules of Tax are present in the complex. Mapping the contacts onto a three-dimensional model of the CREB-DNA binary complex shows that they lie on the same face of the DNA near the regions where the N termini of the CREB bZIP domains enter the major groove. This location correlates well with previous evidence that CREB amino acid residues immediately N-terminal to the bZIP domain are crucial for the formation of the ternary complex. The limited number of cross-links observed suggests that contacts are primarily with the phosphate backbone and does not support the idea that a major structural element of the Tax protein inserts into the major or minor grooves of the DNA.","['Kimzey, A L', 'Dynan, W S']","['Kimzey AL', 'Dynan WS']","['Gene Regulation Program, Institute of Molecular Medicine and Genetics, Medical College of Georgia, Augusta, Georgia 30912, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Azides/chemistry', 'Base Sequence', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/metabolism', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Photochemistry', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Pyrimidines/chemistry']",1998/06/05 00:00,1998/06/05 00:01,['1998/06/05 00:00'],"['1998/06/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/05 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/05 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.273.22.13768 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)57821-8 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1998 May 29;273(22):13768-75. doi: 10.1074/jbc.273.22.13768.,"['0 (Azides)', '0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The protein contains four alpha-helices, the relative orientations of which are well defined on the basis of long-range interhelical nuclear Overhauser effects. The helices are arranged in an up-up-down-down orientation, as found in other four-helix bundle cytokines, and the overall topology of the chimera is similar to that of the crystal structure of murine LIF (Robinson, R.

Differences between the structures are evident in the N-terminal region, where the peptide bond preceding Pro17 has a trans-conformation in solution but a cis-conformation in the crystal, and in the small antiparallel beta-sheet encompassing residues in the N terminus and the CD loop in the crystal structure, which is not apparent in solution. There are also minor differences in the extent of the helices. Other than at the N terminus, the main difference between the two structures occurs at the C-terminal end of the CD loop. As this loop is close to a receptor-binding site on LIF that makes a major contribution to high affinity binding to the LIF receptor alpha-chain, these differences between the solution and crystal structures should be taken into account in structural models of LIF receptor interactions.","['Hinds, M G', 'Maurer, T', 'Zhang, J G', 'Nicola, N A', 'Norton, R S']","['Hinds MG', 'Maurer T', 'Zhang JG', 'Nicola NA', 'Norton RS']","['Biomolecular Research Institute, 343 Royal Parade, Parkville 3052, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Growth Inhibitors/*chemistry', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*chemistry', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Conformation', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Solutions']",1998/06/05 00:00,1998/06/05 00:01,['1998/06/05 00:00'],"['1998/06/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/05 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/05 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.273.22.13738 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)57817-6 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1998 May 29;273(22):13738-45. doi: 10.1074/jbc.273.22.13738.,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Solutions)']",,,,,,,,,,,"['PDB/1A7M', 'PDB/1A7MMR']",,,

We further showed that exponentially growing cells of promyelocytic leukemia line HL-60 contained the same amounts of UBF1 and UBF2 mRNAs as phytohaemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated lymphocytes for 6 hrs. Growth arrest of HL-60 cells, caused by 10 nM phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced monocytic/macrophage-like differentiation for 72 hrs., has been accompanied by a 50% decrease in UBF1/2 mRNAs expression.

Abnormal peripheral blood cells (45% of white blood cells) (Fig. 1a), hypercalcemia, and systemic lymphadenopathy were observed. Flow cytometric analysis (FCM) using peripheral mononuclear cells (PMNC) revealed that the immunophenotype of tumor cells was CD4+ CD8- CD25+ CD45RA- CD45RO+. Nevertheless, he developed a spontaneous remission 6 months later. At remission, the number of CD4-, CD25-, and CD45RO-positive cells decreased, while CD8- and CD45RA-positive cells increased to normal levels as previously reported by Suzuki et al. [1]. He was then referred to the outpatient clinic where he was periodically evaluated and received no therapy. Because of a serious sense of fullness he was re-admitted 30 months after diagnosis. Physical examination revealed ascites and small lymphadenopathy in the right axilla. Atypical lymphoid cells were not observed on microscopic examination of the blood smear. FCM using PMNC revealed that CD4+ CD25+ cells (3%) were within the normal range. Serum calcium was also within the normal range. Abdominal ultrasound examination showed massive ascites. Paracentesis demonstrated that the ascitic fluid had a high white blood cell count (3.15 x 10(9)/l) with a marked increase in abnormal large cells (Fig. 1b). FCM using mononuclear cells in the fluid revealed that 87.3% of the cells were double-positive for CD4 and CD25. Southern blot analysis of the cells confirmed monoclonal integration of human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) proviral DNA. The integrated genome was considered to be identical with that detected at initial presentation (Fig. 2).

The reshaped humanized IgG1 anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody (Campath-1H) has been used in the treatment of hemopoietic and non-hemopoietic diseases for its ability to induce lymphocyte depletion both in vitro and in vivo. Good activity has been shown in patients with chronic T and B cell leukemias, in particular T-prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL). However, the response to treatment is not uniform and this variability may depend on differences in the level of antigen expression on the leukemic cells. To test this hypothesis, we used quantitative flow cytometry to investigate the intensity of the expression of CD52 in 45 cases of lymphoid leukemia, 24 with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), 21 with T-PLL and 12 normal controls. Normal T lymphocytes expressed higher CD52 antigen than B lymphocytes (p < 0.005) and the antigen was also significantly higher in T-PLL compared to CLL (p < 0.001). Moreover, the differences in CD52 expression were somewhat higher in Campath-1H treated patients who responded than in non responders. Although other factors may play a role in the response to Campath-1H in vivo, the quantitative estimation of CD52 expression may provide a rationale for the greater response in T-PLL and help select those patients with a higher probability of responding to this therapy.","['Ginaldi, L', 'De Martinis, M', 'Matutes, E', 'Farahat, N', 'Morilla, R', 'Dyer, M J', 'Catovsky, D']","['Ginaldi L', 'De Martinis M', 'Matutes E', 'Farahat N', 'Morilla R', 'Dyer MJ', 'Catovsky D']","['Academic Department of Haematology and Cytogenetics, The Royal Marsden Hospital and Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,,"['Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antigens, CD/*biosynthesis/immunology', '*Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'CD52 Antigen', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Glycoproteins/*biosynthesis/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*immunology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*drug therapy/*immunology']",1998/05/21 00:00,1998/05/21 00:01,['1998/05/21 00:00'],"['1998/05/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/21 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212697001586 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(97)00158-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1998 Feb;22(2):185-91. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(97)00158-6.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD52 Antigen)', '0 (CD52 protein, human)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)']",,,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,

These include an antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotide to the Rel A subunit of NF-kB, vitamin E and other antioxidants, and curcumin. Acetylsalicylic acid and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents represent another group of agents that have been reported to inhibit NF-kB at serum levels approximating those obtained during long-term therapy of chronic inflammatory states. To determine whether nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents also were capable of enhancing the differentiation of HL-60 leukemia cells produced by vitamin D3, we measured the effects of a variety of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents on the maturation of HL-60 cells produced by low levels of vitamin D3. Acetylsalicylic acid by itself had no significant effect on the differentiation of HL-60 cells; however, this agent markedly increased the degree of differentiation produced by low levels of vitamin D3. Furthermore, a variety of other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents of different chemical classes exhibited similar enhancements of the maturation of HL-60 cells when combined with vitamin D3. An analogous increase in the differentiation of HL-60 cells was also obtained by combination of several nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents with the granulocytic inducing agent, retinoic acid, but not with dimethylsulfoxide. The nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents also enhanced the differentiation of HL-60 cells when combined with vitamin D analogs which share the receptor binding properties of vitamin D3; however, a vitamin D analog which caused significant calcium mobilization, but was less effective in receptor binding than vitamin D3, did not induce the differentiation of HL-60 cells in the presence or absence of anti-inflammatory agents. The findings suggest that the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents may have utility in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia when used with the D vitamins or retinoic acid.","['Sokoloski, J A', 'Sartorelli, A C']","['Sokoloski JA', 'Sartorelli AC']","['Department of Pharmacology, Cancer Center, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/*pharmacology', 'Aspirin/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cholecalciferol/*pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', 'HL-60 Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/pathology']",1998/05/21 00:00,1998/05/21 00:01,['1998/05/21 00:00'],"['1998/05/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/21 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212697001562 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(97)00156-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1998 Feb;22(2):153-61. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(97)00156-2.,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)', 'R16CO5Y76E (Aspirin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, 125I-Epo binding and Scatchard analyses, indicated that TF-1 cells, maintained in standard conditions with IL-3, and those stimulated with c-kit ligand, bear a single class of EpoR. On the other hand, cells cultured in the presence of rHEpo had a higher number of receptors than IL-3 or c-kit ligand-stimulated cells, and had two binding sites with different affinities for the ligand. EpoR mRNA expression was higher in cells exposed to rHEpo than in IL-3 or c-kit-stimulated cells. This difference may have been dependent on either a higher level of transcription or an increased stability of mRNA. The observed changes of EpoR in rHEpo-stimulated TF-1 cell line could cooperate, together with the alteration of the gene (3' end deletion), in the occurrence of the erythroleukemic process. Changes induced in EpoR by rHEpo were not accompanied by an increase in the expression of glycophorin A or globin chain mRNAs. This may suggest that rHEpo is unable to induce erythroid differentiation in TF-1 cells. The results also indicate that this cell line could be a model for the investigation of the role of transcription factor(s) in the expression of EpoR, and for the study of the mechanism(s) underlying the changes in the number and affinity of the cell receptors.","['Grossi, A', 'Vannucchi, A M', 'Bacci, P', 'Caporale, R', 'Cappelli, G', 'Visconti, G', 'Pagliai, G', 'Ferrini, P R']","['Grossi A', 'Vannucchi AM', 'Bacci P', 'Caporale R', 'Cappelli G', 'Visconti G', 'Pagliai G', 'Ferrini PR']","['Division of Hematology, Policlinico Careggi, Florence, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,,"['Erythropoietin/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/*biosynthesis', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Stem Cell Factor/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation']",1998/05/21 00:00,1998/05/21 00:01,['1998/05/21 00:00'],"['1998/05/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/21 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212697001343 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(97)00134-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1998 Feb;22(2):145-51. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(97)00134-3.,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cellular proto-oncogenes encode proteins that propagate growth, differentiation or apoptosis signals from cell membrane to nucleus. The proliferation and differentiation of normal eukaryotic cells are precisely controlled. Tumor cells usually are characterized both by the continuous growth signal and by the block of cell differentiation. We have previously reported that along with spontaneous proliferation, bovine CLL lymphocytes continuously differentiate and enter apoptosis in vitro. CLL cells with an autocrine growth mechanism and at the same time undergoing spontaneous differentiation and apoptosis in vitro provide a new model system to investigate the possible involvement of various proto-oncogenes in the regulation of cellular proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Northern blot analysis revealed simultaneous expression of a number of proto-oncogenes in CLL cells. Transcripts of c-fos, c-myc, c-myb, A-raf, c-raf1, hck, IL-2 receptor alpha-chain (IL-2R alpha) were found in lymphocytes at the peak of their proliferative activity in culture. Kinetics studies demonstrated that CLL cells constitutively express transcripts of so-called immediate response nuclear proto-oncogenes c-myc, c-fos as well as cytoplasmic proto-oncogenes hck and c-raf1, i.e., genes coding for tyrosine and serine-threonine protein kinases, respectively. Expression level did not change significantly during all stages of CLL cells in culture. The results show that continuous expression of c-myc mRNA does not prevent CLL cell differentiation and may be associated with apoptotic cell death.","['Kalvelyte, A V', 'Pabrezaite, L C']","['Kalvelyte AV', 'Pabrezaite LC']","['Institute of Biochemistry, Vilnius, Lithuania. kazimk@ktl.mii.lt']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Cattle', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Division/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/05/21 00:00,1998/05/21 00:01,['1998/05/21 00:00'],"['1998/05/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/21 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212697001288 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(97)00128-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1998 Feb;22(2):135-43. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(97)00128-8.,['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The frequency of ras activation was studied in these 50 patients with MDS. Samples of bone marrow were screened for oncogenic point mutations by DNA amplification followed by oligonucleotide hybridization analysis (PCR-ASO) at codon 12 of N-ras proto-oncogene. We detected N-ras point mutations in 21 patients (42%). Progression from MDS to AML was observed in 9 patients (18%). The correlation analysis between N-ras point mutations and specific chromosomal abnormalities indicated that although mutated N-ras was found in cells with del(5q) and monosomy 7, cells with those abnormalities and normal N-ras were also identified. Otherwise trisomy of chromosome 8 showed a correlation with N-ras point mutations and in all cases, patients showed progression of MDS to AML during the follow-up study. MDS comprises a heterogeneous group of hematopoietic disorders and probably several steps are implicated in the evolution to AML.

Cells were obtained from popliteal lymph nodes from 18 FeLV-antigen-positive cats without complications; a mean of 6.2 x 10(7) cells were obtained. Lymph node cells were cultured with 600 IU/ml interleukin-2 (IL-2) for 7 days. Cells expanded 0.8- to 11-fold (mean, 2.7; median, 2.4); were 80% +/- 8.0% CD3+, 29% +/- 8.1% CD4+, and 41% +/- 7.0% CD8+, and exhibited cytolytic activity against FeLV-transformed FL74 cells. Sixteen cats received a single intravenous infusion of 0.13 to 3.9 x 10(8) cells. Cell infusion was well tolerated; fever developed approximately 1 hour postinfusion. Clinical activity, antiviral activity, or both was observed in 10 cats. Nine cats had clinical responses with improvement in weight, activity, appearance, or a combination of these that began 2 to 4 weeks after cell infusion and that lasted for up to 13 or more months. FeLV antigen became undetectable in 4 cats. These results indicate that adoptive immunotherapy using autologous lymph node cells, activated and expanded ex vivo in short-term cultures with low concentrations of IL-2, can modulate the course of a retroviral infection.","['Blakeslee, J', 'Noll, G', 'Olsen, R', 'Triozzi, P L']","['Blakeslee J', 'Noll G', 'Olsen R', 'Triozzi PL']","['College of Veterinary Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr Hum Retrovirol,Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes and human retrovirology : official publication of the International Retrovirology Association,9501482,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Viral/analysis/blood', 'Cat Diseases/*therapy', 'Cats', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/veterinary', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect/veterinary', 'Immunophenotyping/veterinary', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*veterinary', 'Interleukin-2/immunology/pharmacology', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/complications/veterinary', '*Leukemia Virus, Feline/immunology', 'Leukemia, Feline/therapy', 'Lymph Nodes/*cytology', 'Male', 'Retroviridae Infections/therapy/*veterinary', 'Saliva/virology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/cytology/*immunology', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Virus Infections/therapy/*veterinary', 'Viremia/therapy/veterinary/virology']",1998/05/21 00:00,1998/05/21 00:01,['1998/05/21 00:00'],"['1998/05/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00042560-199805010-00001 [doi]'],ppublish,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr Hum Retrovirol. 1998 May 1;18(1):1-6. doi: 10.1097/00042560-199805010-00001.,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Interleukin-2)']",,,['2P30CA16508/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

European 11q23 Workshop participants.,834-9,"Most hematological neoplasms associated with 11q23 chromosomal rearrangement have been cases of acute lymphoblastic or acute myeloid leukemia. Although cases of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) are a minority, these syndromes should also be recognized as part of the spectrum of hematological disorders associated with 11q23 rearrangement. In this series of 550 patients with such rearrangement there were 28 (5.1%) who presented with MDS. A further five patients had a history of MDS but had evolved to AML by the time cytogenetic analysis was first undertaken. There were thus a total of 33 patients (6.0%) with an 11q23 abnormality whose initial presentation was as MDS. Of these 33 patients, a quarter (seven patients) were cases of secondary (therapy-related) MDS. Complex karyotypes and other poor prognosis chromosomal abnormalities such as -7 and 7q- were common and were not confined to secondary cases. The likelihood of presentation as MDS differed between different cytogenetic categories. The 28 patients in whom cytogenetic analysis was performed at presentation as MDS showed a wide age distribution, from 1 to 82 years; there were four children, two of 1 year of age. All FAB types of MDS were represented. Median survival was only 19.1 months.

European 11q23 Workshop participants.,828-33,"Cytogenetic and molecular analyses of 11q23/MLL positive hematologic malignancies show that der(11) encodes the critical 5'MLL/3'partner gene transcript. The role of der(non-11) bearing the 5'partner/3'MLL fusion is less certain. The cytogenetic evidence for der(11) as the critical partner was investigated. Among 1680 cases (550 workshop and 1130 published) 31 cases displayed a three-way (29 cases) or four-way (two cases) translocation and 26 had only one of the derivatives. The critical junction created by t(11;n)(q23;n) was seen in all six cases of t(1;11)(q21;q23), in both cases of t(6;11)(q27;q23), in all six cases of t(11;19)(q23;p13), in nine of 11 cases with t(4;11)(q21;q23) and in 17 of 20 cases with t(9;11)(p21-22;q23). These findings support the evidence for der(11) encoding the critical leukemogenic fusion transcript. In contrast, additional change involving duplication of one of the derivatives resulted in duplication only of the non-critical der(non-11) as follows: +der(4)t(4;11)(q21;q23) [9/553], +der(6)t(6;11)(q27;q23) [3/61], +der(9)t(9;11)(p21-22;q23) [5/291] and +der(19)t(11;19)(q23;p13) [6/164]. A literature search of other neoplastic disorders showed that either derivative may be duplicated. Duplication of the non-critical derivative is the norm in AML patients with t(8;21)(q22;q22) or t(15;17)(q22;q12-21). We suggest that the genomic imbalance, rather than over-expression of the noncritical 5'partner/3'MLL, is likely to be the important outcome.","['Johansson, B', 'Moorman, A V', 'Secker-Walker, L M']","['Johansson B', 'Moorman AV', 'Secker-Walker LM']","['Department of Clinical Genetics, Lund University Hospital, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', '*Proto-Oncogenes', '*Transcription Factors', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1998/05/21 00:00,1998/05/21 00:01,['1998/05/21 00:00'],"['1998/05/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401019 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 May;12(5):828-33. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401019.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This chromosome abnormality is known to occur predominantly in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) FAB type M5a and less often in AML M4; in this series it was also found to occur, uncommonly, in other AML FAB types, in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (nine cases), in relatively young patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (five cases), acute biphenotypic leukemia (two cases), and acute undifferentiated leukemia (one case). All age groups were represented but 50% of the patients were aged less than 15 years. The t(9;11) was the sole abnormality in 57 cases with AML; trisomy 8 was the most common additional abnormality (23 cases, including seven with further abnormalities), and 28 cases had other additional abnormalities. Among the t(9;11)+ve patients with AML, the white cell count (WBC) and age group were significant predictors of event-free survival; central nervous system (CNS) involvement or karyotype class (sole, with trisomy 8, or with other), also contributed to prognosis although our data could not show these to be independent factors. The best outcome was for patients aged 1-9 years, with low WBC, and with absence of CNS disease or presence of trisomy 8. For patients aged less than 15 years, the event-free survival for ALL patients was not significantly worse than that of AML patients.","['Swansbury, G J', 'Slater, R', 'Bain, B J', 'Moorman, A V', 'Secker-Walker, L M']","['Swansbury GJ', 'Slater R', 'Bain BJ', 'Moorman AV', 'Secker-Walker LM']","['Academic Haematology and Cytogenetics, The Royal Marsden NHS Trust, Sutton, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1998/05/21 00:00,1998/05/21 00:01,['1998/05/21 00:00'],"['1998/05/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401014 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 May;12(5):792-800. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401014.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

European 11q23 Workshop participants.",779-87,"A total of 183 hematologic malignancies with t(4;11)(q21;q23), including five variant translocations, were collected by the Workshop. Clinical, morphologic and immunophenotypic features were compiled, and karyotypes with variant t(4;11) or secondary chromosomal aberrations were reviewed. All cases were acute leukemias (AL): 173 acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL), six acute myeloid leukemias (AML), three unclassifiable AL, and one biphenotypic AL. Ten patients had treatment-associated AL. Females were overrepresented (104 vs 79) and the age distribution was clearly nonrandom; 34% of the cases occurred in infants below the age of 12 months. The remaining AL were evenly distributed among the other age groups, with the oldest patient being 79 years old. An increased white blood cell count (WBC) was reported in more than 90% of the cases, with hyperleukocytosis (> or =100 x 10(9)/l) in 64%. Additional chromosomal changes were detected in 55 (30%) cases, most often gain of the X chromosome, i(7)(q10), and trisomy 8, with frequent breakpoints in 1p36, 1q21, 7q10, 11p15, 12p13, 17p11, and 17p10. All recurrent secondary changes resulted in genomic imbalances, in particular gains of 1q, 7q, 8, and X and losses of 7p and 17p. Event-free and overall survival (EFS and OS) could be ascertained in 170 and 171 patients, respectively. Kaplan-Meier estimates of EFS and OS showed no differences with regard to gender, WBC, or presence of secondary chromosomal abnormalities, and there was no increase of EFS or OS among the 55 cases that had undergone bone marrow transplantation. However, age had an important prognostic impact, with significantly (P < 0.0001) longer EFS and OS in children 2-9 years old than among infants and younger children, patients aged between 10 and 39 years and older adults.","['Johansson, B', 'Moorman, A V', 'Haas, O A', 'Watmore, A E', 'Cheung, K L', 'Swanton, S', 'Secker-Walker, L M']","['Johansson B', 'Moorman AV', 'Haas OA', 'Watmore AE', 'Cheung KL', 'Swanton S', 'Secker-Walker LM']","['Department of Clinical Genetics, Lund University Hospital, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*pathology', 'Prognosis', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1998/05/21 00:00,1998/05/21 00:01,['1998/05/21 00:00'],"['1998/05/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401012 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 May;12(5):779-87. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401012.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patients were classified by cytogenetic subgroup as t(4;11) (183 cases), t(6;11) (30) cases), t(9;11) (125 cases), t(10;11) (20 cases), t(11;19) (53 cases), 'other' abnormalities of 11q23 (82 cases) and del(11)(q23) (57 cases). Manuscripts were prepared on each cytogenetic subgroup, on MDS, on secondary hematological malignancies (40 cases) and on 11q23-translocation derivatives. For each subgroup the following aspects were investigated: associated clinical features, additional karyotypic change, distribution between hematological subtypes and between different age groups, prognosis at different age groups, and the impact of bone marrow transplantation on survival. The Workshop confirmed some previous findings from smaller studies, challenged others, identified new chromosomal partners and threw new light on less well documented aspects of 11q23 malignancies. The large number of cases investigated in a coordinated manner gives authoritative support to the findings. The Workshop thus demonstrates the value of collaborative European studies in the cytogenetics of malignancy.","['Secker-Walker, L M']",['Secker-Walker LM'],"['Department of Haematology, The Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosome Disorders', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Cytogenetics/methods', 'Europe', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'International Cooperation', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics']",1998/05/21 00:00,1998/05/21 00:01,['1998/05/21 00:00'],"['1998/05/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401011 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 May;12(5):776-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401011.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, a significant proportion (<45%) of the cells expressed surface IgM (sIgM) after 5 weeks of co-culture. CD34+CD19- cells also showed a similar development of CD19+ cells and CD19+sigM+ cells. Filter separation of MS-5 cells and CD34+ cells did not inhibit the growth of CD19+ cells. However, when further purified CD34+CD19-CD13- CD33- cells were cultured in the presence of MS-5 cells with or without a separation filter, CD19+ cells did not appear in the non-contact setting. This result suggested that the highly purified CD34+CD19-CD13-CD33- progenitors require the cell-cell contact for the development of CD19+ cells, whereas other CD34+ fractions contain progenitors that do not require the contact.

Nucleotide patterns in the immediate vicinity of the break point may provide important information about the underlying causalities, eg illegitimate recombination events mediated by topoisomerase II, Alu repeats, or VDJ recombinase. In order to facilitate the determination of those DNA patterns, we developed a new fingerprint approach. In a first step, two DNA fragments were independently amplified by long distance PCR: the genomic region carrying the break point and the normal nonrearranged counterpart. Subsequently, both PCR products were digested with restriction enzymes, end-labelled with a fluorescent dye, and subjected to high resolution polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. By comparing the restriction patterns of the rearranged and the nonrearranged PCR fragments, the break points could be easily localized within a size range coverable by a single sequencing reaction. Finally, the exact DNA sequence across the break point was directly determined. The 'fingerprint' technique is fast, reliable and enables the assay of multiple samples in parallel.","['Leis, T', 'Repp, R', 'Borkhardt, A', 'Metzler, M', 'Schlager, F', 'Harbott, J', 'Lampert, F']","['Leis T', 'Repp R', 'Borkhardt A', 'Metzler M', 'Schlager F', 'Harbott J', 'Lampert F']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Hematology, and Oncology, Children's Hospital, Justus-Liebig University, Giessen, Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Base Sequence', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'DNA/*genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Fingerprinting/*methods', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Genome, Human', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Proto-Oncogenes', '*Transcription Factors', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1998/05/21 00:00,1998/05/21 00:01,['1998/05/21 00:00'],"['1998/05/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401006 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 May;12(5):758-63. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401006.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Northern Regional Haematology Group.,746-52,"Thirty unselected patients with chronic granulocytic leukaemia (CGL), age range 22-59 years, were treated with intensive chemotherapy and G-CSF to mobilize peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC). Chemotherapy was well tolerated and PBPC were collected by leukapheresis early during white cell recovery. PBPC collections considered adequate for engraftment were collected in 21 patients. Cytogenetic analysis of all collections in these patients showed >75% Ph negativity (range 79-100%) in 10. Successful collections, ie those >75% Ph negative and with total cell count of >1 x 10(6) CD34+ve cells/kg or >20 x 10(4) CFU-GM/kg were further analysed by Southern blot or RT-PCR. All samples were positive for the bcr/abl transcript. Patients with a low Sokal score (<0.8) were more likely to achieve a successful collection. In contrast, there was no association between transcript expression and likelihood of successful collection. We have confirmed that it is possible to mobilize and collect Ph-negative enriched PBPC in unselected patients with CGL. This procedure is more likely to be successful earlier rather than later in the course of the disease. Whether such collections will give an advantage over unmanipulated autologous bone marrow transplantation in CGL requires further study, but our experience suggests that suitable material for autologous rescue can be obtained from approximately one third of eligible, unselected young patients.","['Lennard, A', 'Storey, N', 'Dickinson, A M', 'Irving, J A', 'Rowe, D', 'Conn, J S', 'Proctor, S J']","['Lennard A', 'Storey N', 'Dickinson AM', 'Irving JA', 'Rowe D', 'Conn JS', 'Proctor SJ']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/biosynthesis', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization/*methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/administration & dosage', 'Interferon-alpha/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Pilot Projects', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1998/05/21 00:00,1998/05/21 00:01,['1998/05/21 00:00'],"['1998/05/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400993 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 May;12(5):746-52. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400993.,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the specific expansion requirements of this subpopulation compared to the more mature CD34+ and CD34+DR+ populations. The role of stromal factors was assessed by comparing the expansion obtained when the cells were cultured in (1) long-term bone marrow culture (LTBMC) medium conditioned by an irradiated human BM stroma (CM), (2) medium supplemented with 15% FBS (FBSM) and (3) non-conditioned LTBMC medium (LTM) for 21 days. The effect of the addition of G-CSF (G) and/or of MIP-1alpha (M) to a combination of IL-3, SCF, IL-6 and IL-11 (3, S, 6, 11) was analyzed. Compared to CD34+DR- cells, CD34+ and CD34+DR+ cells gave rise to a similar number of viable cells and to a lower progenitor expansion. The expansion potential of CD34+ and CD34+DR+ cells was equivalent in CM and in FBSM except for both the emergence of CD61 + megakaryocytic cells and LTC-IC maintenance which were improved by culture in CM. In contrast, expansion from CD34+DR- cells was enhanced by CM for all the parameters tested. Compared to FBSM, CM induced a higher level of CFU-GM and BFU-E expansion and allowed the emergence of CD61+ cells. HPP-CFC were maintained or expanded in CM but decreased in FBSM. Compared to input, the number of LTC-IC remaining after 21 days of CD34+DR- expansion culture was strongly decreased in FBSM and variably maintained or expanded in CM. Comparison with LTM indicated that stroma conditioning is responsible for this effect. G-CSF significantly improved CFU-GM and HPP-CFC expansion from CD34+DR- cells without being detrimental to the LTC-IC pool. The growth of CD61+ cells was significantly enhanced by G-CSF in CM. Addition of MIP-1alpha had no significant effect either on progenitor expansion or on LTC-IC, regardless of culture medium. We conclude that factors present in stroma- conditioned medium are necessary to support the expansion of the whole spectrum of hematopoietic cells from CD34+DR- cells and to support the expansion of cell subsets from CD34+ and CD34+DR+.","['Herman, P', 'Ferrant, A', 'De Bruyere, M', 'Straetmans, N']","['Herman P', 'Ferrant A', 'De Bruyere M', 'Straetmans N']","['Hematology Department, Universite Catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Antigens, CD/biosynthesis/physiology', 'Antigens, CD34/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemokine CCL3', 'Chemokine CCL4', 'Clone Cells', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Growth Substances/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Integrin beta3', 'Interleukin-11/pharmacology', 'Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins/pharmacology', 'Megakaryocytes/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis/physiology', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology', 'Stromal Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Time Factors']",1998/05/21 00:00,1998/05/21 00:01,['1998/05/21 00:00'],"['1998/05/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400924 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 May;12(5):735-45. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400924.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Chemokine CCL3)', '0 (Chemokine CCL4)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Integrin beta3)', '0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the capacity for replication, proliferation, and differentiation of each subpopulation of CD34+ cells, we also studied the correlation between LTC-IC and telomerase activity. After 5 weeks of coculture, LTC-IC accounted for one out of 32 CD34+CD38- cells and one out of 33 CD34+c-kit- cells. In contrast, the frequency of LTC-IC was low in their antigen-positive counterparts (one per 84 CD34+CD38+ cells, one per 90 CD34+c-kit(low) cells, and very low among CD34+c-kit(high) cells). It was noteworthy that some LTC-IC derived from CD34+CD38- as well as CD34+c-kit- cells generated colony-forming cells (CFCs) after up to 9 weeks of coculture. Telomerase activity was consistently low in CD34+CD38- and CD34+c-kit- cells compared to CD38+ or c-kit(high or low) cells, suggesting that CD34+CD38- or c-kit- cells are likely to be more quiescent.

However, because of the reduced volume, the stem cell content is limited; therefore its use as a graft for adult patients might require ex vivo manipulations. Two systems have been described that identify these stem cell populations in vitro in both mice and humans: (1) the long-term culture-initiating cells (LTC-IC), thus named because of their ability to support the growth of hematopoietic colonies (colony-forming cell (CFC)) for 5-6 weeks when co-cultured on stromal layers; (2) the generation of hematopoietic progenitors (CFC) from stroma-free liquid cultures for extended periods of time, which provides further indirect evidence of the presence of primitive stem cells. Both systems detect largely overlapping but not identical populations of stem cells. Thus the identification of the growth factor requirements for the maintenance and amplification of both systems is relevant. On this basis, analysis of the effects of 18 cytokine combinations on stroma-free liquid cultures of CB CD34+ cells, showed that: (1) after 7- and 14 day-incubation periods, several growth factor combinations expanded the LTC-IC pool to a similar extent; as compared to the LTC-IC, the generation of CFC was not impressive; (2) time-course analysis of the LTC-IC expansion demonstrated that, by extending the incubation period, only a few growth factor combinations, containing FL, TPO, KL and IL6, could support a further, increasingly greater LTC-IC expansion (up to 270000-fold of the initial value). In similar culture conditions, CFC production underwent continuous expansion, which persisted for over 7 months and reached values of one million-fold of the initial value. The simultaneous presence of FL and TPO was both necessary and sufficient to support this phenomenon. The addition of KL+/-IL6 did not appear to substantially modify the extent of LTC-IC expansion; nevertheless, it played an important role in sustaining an even more massive and prolonged output of CFU-GM, CFU-Mk and BFU/CFU-GEMM (up to 100 million-fold); (3) the presence of IL3 was found to be negative, in that it inhibited both the extent of LTC-IC expansion and the long-term generation of CFC. Thus, FL and TPO appear as two unique growth factors that preferentially support the self-renewal of primitive stem cells; the additional presence of KL and IL6 seems to enhance the proliferative potential of at least one subpopulation of daughter stem cells, which may follow three differentiation pathways. Far from being definitive, our data demonstrated that massive stem cell expansion, in cord blood, can be obtained in reasonably well-defined culture conditions. This could represent an initial step towards larger scale cultures for transplantation and gene therapy protocols.","['Piacibello, W', 'Sanavio, F', 'Garetto, L', 'Severino, A', 'Dane, A', 'Gammaitoni, L', 'Aglietta, M']","['Piacibello W', 'Sanavio F', 'Garetto L', 'Severino A', 'Dane A', 'Gammaitoni L', 'Aglietta M']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences and Human Oncology, University of Turin Medical School, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fetal Blood/*cytology/*drug effects', 'Growth Substances/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Stimulation, Chemical', 'Stromal Cells/cytology', 'Time Factors']",1998/05/21 00:00,1998/05/21 00:01,['1998/05/21 00:00'],"['1998/05/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401003 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 May;12(5):718-27. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401003.,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Growth Substances)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, because huGM-CSF does not react with the murine GM-CSF receptor possible side-effects to nonleukemic tissues could not be analyzed in the AML/SCID model. To overcome this problem, we used murine GM-CSF fused to DT and studied the therapeutic index in the rat leukemia model BNML/LT12. In DT-mGM-CSF dose escalation experiments, severe dose-dependent toxicity to organs such as liver, kidney and lung was observed. Therefore, the antileukemic effects were evaluated with the lower doses. Daily intraperitoneal bolus injections of 75 microg/kg/day for 7 days induced a 3 log leukemic cell kill. The dose of 75 microg/kg/day had no effect on the hemopoietic progenitor cell subsets.

Studies with Southern blot hybridisation have revealed deletions in the region located telomeric of the retinoblastoma gene in more than 40% of cases.

We have analysed deletions in the D13S319 region in 20 selected CLL patients using conventional cytogenetic analysis, fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) and Southern blot hybridisation. FISH and Southern hybridisation are equally efficient in detecting deleted clones in our study. However, FISH analysis indicate that subclones with different numbers of alleles in the D13S319 region can exist simultaneously. The cytogenetic analyses confirm that clones with different chromosomal abnormalities can occur in patients with CLL and that 13q14 deletions can be limited to one of these subclones. Furthermore, the FISH analyses show that trisomy 12 and deletion of 13q14 can occur in the same cell clone.

We also detected major differences in Shc phosphorylation between factor-dependent and -independent cells.

HL-60 cells respond to retinoic acid (RA) with growth inhibition, granulocytic differentiation and apoptosis. However, HL-60-MZF-1 cells exposed to RA continue to proliferate in response to RA as evidenced by a higher percentage of cells in S phase, higher peak cell counts, and later peak cell counts. Morphologic differentiation of the RA-induced HL-60-MZF-1 cells is delayed with half as many of the HL-60-MZF-1 cells compared to the wild-type HL-60 cells that are differentiated after 3 days of RA, although both cells types responded with 80-95% mature granulocytes after 6 days of RA. Apoptosis was delayed in the MZF-1 transduced cells as measured by internucleosomal DNA fragmentation patterns, the terminal transferase end labeling reaction (TUNEL), and quantitation of fragmented DNA by the diphenylamine reaction. Several markers of differentiation were identical in both HL-60 and HL-60-MZF-1 cells including CD11b, CD33, CD34, CD13, CD16 and CD14. However, following 6 days of RA, only half as many HL-60-MZF-1 cells expressed CD18 compared to the wild-type HL-60 cells. Expression of the bcl-2 proto-oncogene transcript and protein was higher in the HL-60-MZF-1 cells compared to wild-type HL-60s and expression persisted for 5 days following RA in the HL-60-MZF-1 cells compared to only 3 days in the parental HL-60 cells suggesting that bcl-2 may contribute to the inhibition of apoptosis. Overexpression of MZF-1 had no effect on PMA-induced monocyte/macrophage differentiation of HL-60 cells. Together these findings indicate that MZF-1 can stimulate cell proliferation and delay RA-induced differentiation and apoptosis in HL-60 cells. MZF-1 may function in a similar role in myelopoiesis allowing myeloid precursors to expand their numbers before going on to terminally differentiate.","['Robertson, K A', 'Hill, D P', 'Kelley, M R', 'Tritt, R', 'Crum, B', 'Van Epps, S', 'Srour, E', 'Rice, S', 'Hromas, R']","['Robertson KA', 'Hill DP', 'Kelley MR', 'Tritt R', 'Crum B', 'Van Epps S', 'Srour E', 'Rice S', 'Hromas R']","['Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research, Indiana University Medical Center, Indianapolis 46202-5225, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'HL-60 Cells/*drug effects/*pathology/physiology', 'Hematopoiesis/physiology', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Zinc Fingers/*genetics']",1998/05/21 00:00,1998/05/21 00:01,['1998/05/21 00:00'],"['1998/05/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401005 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 May;12(5):690-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401005.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (MZF1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,,['R0148914/PHS HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

To determine whether IL-3 withdrawal leads to the activation of caspase proteases, known mediators of apoptosis, we studied proteolytic cleavage of the caspase substrate protein poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in two IL3-dependent myeloid progenitor cell lines, 32D and FDCP-1. We observed that IL-3 withdrawal leads to PARP cleavage in both cell lines, with complete cleavage occurring by 24 h after cytokine removal. The induced PARP cleavage activities were blocked by the caspase inhibitors z-DEVD-fluoromethyl ketone (z-DEVD-FMK) and z-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone (z-VAD-FMK), or by overexpression in 32D cells of Bcl-2 or BCR/ABL. By contrast, overexpression in 32D cells of cowpox virus CrmA protein, an inhibitor of Fas-mediated PARP cleavage, failed to inhibit PARP cleavage following IL-3 withdrawal. CrmA also failed to block DNA fragmentation and loss of cell viability. We propose that a CrmA-insensitive caspase protease is activated in the IL-3-deprived myeloid precursors, and that activation of this protease may direct the cells on a path towards commitment to death.","['Antoku, K', 'Liu, Z', 'Johnson, D E']","['Antoku K', 'Liu Z', 'Johnson DE']","['Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, and the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, PA 15213-2582, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA/drug effects/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*enzymology', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/*metabolism', 'Protease Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serpins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Substance Withdrawal Syndrome/*enzymology/etiology', 'Transfection', '*Viral Proteins']",1998/05/21 00:00,1998/05/21 00:01,['1998/05/21 00:00'],"['1998/05/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400992 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 May;12(5):682-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400992.,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Serpins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '96282-35-8 (interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme inhibitor)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)']",,,['CA66044/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

A quantitative semi-nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detecting the clone-specific rearranged immunoglobulin heavy chain genes was developed to improve sensitivity and specificity of amplification. In all patients, one leukemic cell could be detected in a background of 10(5) normal blood mononuclear cells. All patients investigated were in complete remission at the end of induction therapy as evaluated by morphologic criteria. Nineteen patients (73%) had no detectable residual leukemic cells using the sensitive semi-nested PCR. Seven patients (27%) were PCR positive. Three had a low level (<2 x 10(-5) leukemic cells per bone marrow cell), while four patients had a high level (>2 x 10(5)) of detectable residual leukemic cells. All patients with low or undetectable levels of residual leukemia remained in complete remission at a median of 63 months from diagnosis (range 40-80 months), while all four patients with a high level of residual leukemia subsequently relapsed at a median of 21 months from diagnosis (range 13-37 months). The patient groups with undetectable or low, and high level of MRD did not differ significantly in other clinical or genetic features with prognostic significance. We conclude that the level of MRD at the end of the intensive induction therapy period is predictive of outcome in childhood B lineage ALL. If confirmed by large prospective studies, the level of MRD might be useful in stratifying patients into high and low risk categories.","['Gruhn, B', 'Hongeng, S', 'Yi, H', 'Hancock, M L', 'Rubnitz, J E', 'Neale, G A', 'Kitchingman, G R']","['Gruhn B', 'Hongeng S', 'Yi H', 'Hancock ML', 'Rubnitz JE', 'Neale GA', 'Kitchingman GR']","[""Department of Virology and Molecular Biology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Treatment Outcome']",1998/05/21 00:00,1998/05/21 00:01,['1998/05/21 00:00'],"['1998/05/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400985 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 May;12(5):675-81. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400985.,,,,"['CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-52259/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Granulocytes from nine patients diagnosed with BCR-ABL + ALL (eight Ph+, one Ph-) were purified using two layer density gradient separation.

The impact of hypersensitivity reactions on the duration of leukemia-free survival (LFS) was assessed in adults with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) receiving intensive multi-agent chemotherapy. In CALGB study 8811 (Blood 1995; 85: 2025-2037), 197 adults were scheduled to receive 14 doses of Escherichia coil L-asparaginase (6000 U/m2 SC) during 7 of the first 12 weeks of chemotherapy. No further L-asparaginase was given. Chemotherapy was given for 24 months. The median follow-up time has been 5.7 years. Of the 141 patients who remained on study after 12 weeks, 82 (58%) had received all 14 planned doses; 38 (27%) had 12-13 L-asparaginase doses documented in their treatment record; 21 (15%) patients had received < or =11 doses due to a variety of toxic effects. The mean number of doses received prior to experiencing any hypersensitivity reaction was seven (range 1-11). Seven patients had mild hypersensitivity reactions, but all seven eventually received 12-14 doses of E. coil L-asparaginase. Twenty-one other patients had severe hypersensitivity reactions that required discontinuation of E. coil L-asparaginase; 20 of these patients were switched to Erwinia L-asparaginase to complete their treatment. Ultimately, 12 of these 20 patients received 14 doses of L-asparaginase in total, and six received 12-13 doses. Thus, only three of the 21 patients who had severe hypersensitivity reactions received < or =11 total L-asparaginase doses. Other L-asparaginase-related complications included pancreatitis (15 patients), hypofibrinogenemia <100mg/dl (29 patients), and deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism (eight patients); some of these patients had L-asparaginase discontinued after these complications. The estimates for LFS at 3 years were 55% (95% confidence interval, 44-65%) for the patients who received all 14 L-asparaginase doses (median LFS, 5.1 years), 47% (95% CI, 33-62%) for those who received 12-13 doses, and 48% (95% CI, 29-67%) for those who received < or =11 doses. There were no significant differences between these three groups in the length of LFS (P=0.68). LFS did not correlate with a history of severe hypersensitivity reaction (P=0.67). In general, E. coil L-asparaginase was well tolerated in these adult patients, and most patients received all of the planned therapy. Patients who had mild L-asparaginase hypersensitivity reactions and patients who switched to Erwinia L-asparaginase because of more severe allergic reactions did not have significantly shorter LFS than the remaining adults treated on this ALL protocol. The possibility that E. coli L-asparaginase is inactivated or destroyed in those individuals who have become hypersensitive to it becomes less important when allergic patients are secondarily treated with Erwinia L-asparaginase.","['Larson, R A', 'Fretzin, M H', 'Dodge, R K', 'Schiffer, C A']","['Larson RA', 'Fretzin MH', 'Dodge RK', 'Schiffer CA']","['University of Chicago, IL, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Hypersensitivity/*etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies']",1998/05/21 00:00,1998/05/21 00:01,['1998/05/21 00:00'],"['1998/05/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401007 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 May;12(5):660-5. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401007.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",,,"['CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31983/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA41287/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

Seven patients were treated less intensively with the 6-week consolidation phase as induction (group 2). Allogeneic BMT was performed in 10 children of group 1 and 2 after, and in eight (group 3) without prior chemotherapy. Eight children received minimal or no chemotherapy (group 4). Of 21 children (groups 1 and 2) 17 (81%) achieved complete or partial remission after chemotherapy, 12 of them (10 of group 1) remained in remission, eight after BMT. Five-year survival in 29 children treated intensively (groups 1-3) was 46%, SE 12%. Two of the other eight children (group 4) remained alive, one after spontaneous remission. Outcome after BMT was related to the blast count in the bone marrow prior to BMT. None of 10 children (including two with minimal or no chemotherapy) with < or = 12% blasts before BMT relapsed, in contrast to five of eight patients with a higher blast count (P log rank 0.02).

Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster Group.,645-51,"Clinical characteristics, treatment response and outcome were evaluated in children with Down's syndrome (DS) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) as compared to other children with ALL (NDS). Sixty-one DS and 4049 NDS patients, receiving intensive antileukemic treatment during four consecutive trials (ALL-BFM 81, 83, 86 and 90) of the Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster Group (BFM), were retrospectively analyzed. DS and NDS children did not differ with respect to sex, leukocyte count, CNS leukemia and cytogenetic translocations. The DS cohort was slightly older (P=0.04), presented predominantly with the common while lacking the T immunophenotype (P=0.005), had a lower frequency of hyperdiploidy (P=0.004) and tended to have a better initial steroid response (P=0.057). Therapy-associated morbidity especially during high-dose methotrexate and a subsequent need for treatment modification occurred in 43% of all DS patients. Event-free survival (EFS) was slightly worse in children with DS (58+/-8% vs 70+/-1%, P=0.14), mainly due to rather late bone marrow recurrences. However, EFS in DS patients was comparable to the NDS group once they either received treatment with no major modifications (65+9% vs 70+/-1%, P=0.66) or were <6 years of age, irrespectively of therapy modifications (73+/-9% vs 74+/-1%, P=0.7). Cox regression analysis revealed that DS was an adverse prognostic factor for patients having completed therapy (P=0.0107), but was not prognostic at diagnosis (P=0.103). Age > or = 6 years, suboptimal treatment and infectious problems contributed to the slight inferior EFS in children with ALL and Down's syndrome. Therefore, most of these patients can be successfully treated if receiving intensive antileukemic treatment with no major modifications, but they require more sophisticated management of toxicity.","['Dordelmann, M', 'Schrappe, M', 'Reiter, A', 'Zimmermann, M', 'Graf, N', 'Schott, G', 'Lampert, F', 'Harbott, J', 'Niemeyer, C', 'Ritter, J', 'Dorffel, W', 'Nessler, G', 'Kuhl, J', 'Riehm, H']","['Dordelmann M', 'Schrappe M', 'Reiter A', 'Zimmermann M', 'Graf N', 'Schott G', 'Lampert F', 'Harbott J', 'Niemeyer C', 'Ritter J', 'Dorffel W', 'Nessler G', 'Kuhl J', 'Riehm H']","[""Department Pediatric Hematology, University-Children's Hospitals, Hannover, Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Down Syndrome/*complications/*drug therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/*drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",1998/05/21 00:00,1998/05/21 00:01,['1998/05/21 00:00'],"['1998/05/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400989 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 May;12(5):645-51. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400989.,,,,,,,['Leukemia. 2000 May;14(5):943-4.

CRKL has one SH2 and two SH3 domains, with 60% homology to CRK II. CRKL is a prominent substrate of the BCR/ABL oncoprotein in chronic myelogenous leukemia and binds to both BCR/ABL and c-ABL. CRKL has been shown to be tryosine phosphorylated in response to normal hematopoietic growth factor receptor signaling with ligands such as thrombopoietin, erythropoietin or steel factor. Additionally, CRKL is involved in signaling initiated by crosslinking of beta integrins, and B cell or T cell receptors. Structurally, the amino-terminal SH3 domain of CRKL has been shown to bind proteins such as C3G, SOS, PI3-K, c-ABL or BCR/ABL. The SH2 domain of CRKL can bind to tyrosine phosphorylated proteins such as CBL, HEF1, CAS or paxillin.

In a recent review of the literature, Giagounidis et al. Identified 136 cases of pathologic rupture of the spleen since 1861. This number gives an idea of how seldom it occurs. In this review, 34% of the cases had occurred in acute leukemias, and 13% in acute lymphoblastic leukemias. In most cases, PRS occurs on the course of the disease. PRS as initial manifestation of ALL is a very rare feature: only six cases have been reported in the literature. Before now, in our hospital, we had only seen one case of a patient suffering from chronic myelomonocytic leukemia who presented splenic rupture as the initial manifestation of this disease. We now describe the seventh case, to our knowledge, of acute lymphoblastic leukemia presenting as pathologic splenic rupture.","['Rodriguez-Luaces, M', 'Jimenez Herrainz, C', 'Lafuente Guijosa, A', 'Mateos Rubio, P', 'Hernandez-Bayo, J M', 'Hernandez-Navarro, F']","['Rodriguez-Luaces M', 'Jimenez Herrainz C', 'Lafuente Guijosa A', 'Mateos Rubio P', 'Hernandez-Bayo JM', 'Hernandez-Navarro F']",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Letter']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,,"['Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications', 'Splenic Rupture/*etiology']",1998/05/21 00:00,1998/05/21 00:01,['1998/05/21 00:00'],"['1998/05/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/21 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1998 Apr;83(4):383-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Alterations in this gene are reported in approximately 5-10% of acute leukemias (AL) and characterize different leukemic subtypes such as infant (< 12 months of age) AL, topoisomerase II inhibitors-related (TR) AL and a small subset of de novo AML and ALL. Distinguishing features of ALL1 alterations include the striking heterogeneity of its recombinations, i.e., more than 30 chromosome partners have been described in ALL1 rearrangements, and the lack of association with a definite lineage. The objective of this article is to review the biological and structural properties of ALL1 gene and its various fusion proteins, and to discuss the clinical relevance of these lesions with special emphasis on their role in molecular diagnosis and monitoring of minimal residual disease. EVIDENCE AND INFORMATION SOURCES: The material examined in the present review includes data published by the authors in this field, articles and abstracts published in journals covered by the Science Citation Index and Medline, as well as some more recent personal unpublished observations. STATE OF THE ART: The ALL1 gene spans approximately 90 kb of DNA in length, and consists of 36 exons, ranging in size from 65 bp to 4249 bp. ALL1 codifies for a major transcript of approximately or equal to 15 kb. It encodes a protein of more than 3910 amino acids, containing three regions sharing sequence homology with the Drosophila trithorax gene. These homologies suggest that ALL1 is a transcription factor controlling development and/or differentiation of human cells. To date, twelve ALL1 partner genes have been characterized which are involved in the following translocations: t(4;11), t(9;11), t(6;11), t(11;19), t(1;11) t(10;11), t(11;16), t(11;17) and t(X;11). Since all these genes do not share relevant homologies among each other, their putative role in ALL1 activation still remains to be clarified. The analysis of ALL1 breakpoint cluster region (bcr) shows that several DNA motifs implicated in illegitimate recombination events are located within the bcr. Thus, mapping of breakpoints in the different subtypes of ALL1 +ve leukemia may help in understanding the events leading to translocations in human ALs. In this respect, data on ALL1 breakpoint localization suggest that similar pathogenetic mechanisms may underlie infant and TR AL and that these events might differ from those occurring in de novo AL. The availability of this molecular marker provides a new tool for diagnostic purposes and characterization of ALs and for monitoring of minimal residual disease. To date, the prognostic value of ALL1 rearrangements has been clearly demonstrated for infant ALs only, whereas the clinical relevance of ALL1 rearrangements in the other leukemic subtypes needs further evaluation by future prospective studies on a larger number of patients homogeneously treated. As concerning studies on minimal residual disease, data on PCR monitoring of the ALL1/AF4 fusion transcript, resulting from the t(4;11) translocation, show the clinical relevance of this molecular test in predicting outcome and, as a consequence, in designing individual post-remission therapies. PERSPECTIVES: It is expected that future studies will provide more detailed information regarding either the normal ALL1 function and/or the leukemogenic effect of ALL1 alterations, together with a better definition of the prognostic relevance of the hybrid proteins formed by this gene at diagnosis and during remission of disease.","['Cimino, G', 'Rapanotti, M C', 'Sprovieri, T', 'Elia, L']","['Cimino G', 'Rapanotti MC', 'Sprovieri T', 'Elia L']","['Dipartimento di Biotecnologie Cellulari ed Ematologia, Universita degli Studi La Sapienza di Roma, Italy. cimino@dbu.uniroma1.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', '*Proto-Oncogenes', '*Transcription Factors', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Zinc Fingers']",1998/05/21 00:00,1998/05/21 00:01,['1998/05/21 00:00'],"['1998/05/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/21 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1998 Apr;83(4):350-7.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",,65,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency and the role of a PGP and an LRP overexpression in affecting the intracellular daunorubicin accumulation (IDA) and in predicting the therapy outcome on a subset of overt secondary acute non lymphocytic leukemias (ANLL). An adjunctive point was to evaluate the efficacy of the reversal agent SDZ PSC 833 (PSC) in counteracting impaired IDA. DESIGN AND METHODS: By flow cytometry, PGP and LRP expression and the IDA were evaluated on 54 overt secondary ANLL PGP and LRP overexpressions were respectively defined by an MRK-16 mean fluorescence index (MFI) > or = 6 (PGP+) and by an LRP-56 MFI > or = 5 i.e. by MRK-16 and LRP-56 MFIs higher than the one observed in normal leukocytes. The blasts' IDA was studied after a two-hour incubation in 1000 ng/mL daunorubicin in the presence or in the absence of the MDR reversal agent SDZ PSC 833 (PSC) 1.6 mumol. RESULTS: A PGP overexpression was detected in 40/54 (74%) cases while an LRP overexpression was observed on 33/54 (61%) cases. No differences were found in terms of PGP and LRP expressions between ANLL developing after chemo/radiotherapy (therapy-related ANLL) or evolving from a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS-related ANLL). Compared to the PGP-, the PGP+ cases showed a significantly lower mean IDA (DNR NMFI 196 +/- 46 vs. 267 +/- 53, p < 0.001). The co-incubation of DNR with the PSC significantly increased only the mean IDA of the PGP+ cases, that grew from a DNR NMFI of 196 +/- 46 to a DNR NMFI of 284 +/- 67 (p < 0.0001). With respect to normal leukocytes, even the PGP- cases had an impaired IDA suggesting that other mechanisms, including an LRP overexpression, could affect the IDA. A strongly negative correlation was observed between PGP overexpression and therapy outcome, in fact, 8/10 (80%) PGP- but only 2/27 (7%) PGP+ patients obtained complete remission (p = 0.0002). Moreover, 7/33 (21%) cases showing an impaired IDA (NMFI < 280) but 4/4 (100%) with NMFI > 280 had complete remission (p = 0.006). No correlation was found between therapy response and LRP or CD34 expression. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: This data suggests that an important role in determining therapy outcome is played by PGP in secondary leukemias. Even if the LRP is frequently overexpressed in secondary leukemias and is likely to contribute to the reduction of the intracellular drug accumulation, the role played by LRP in determining the therapy-outcome has still to be cleared.","['Damiani, D', 'Michieli, M', 'Ermacora, A', 'Candoni, A', 'Raspadori, D', 'Geromin, A', 'Stocchi, R', 'Grimaz, S', 'Masolini, P', 'Michelutti, A', 'Scheper, R J', 'Baccarani, M']","['Damiani D', 'Michieli M', 'Ermacora A', 'Candoni A', 'Raspadori D', 'Geromin A', 'Stocchi R', 'Grimaz S', 'Masolini P', 'Michelutti A', 'Scheper RJ', 'Baccarani M']","['Department of Medical and Morphological Research and Udine University Hospital, Udine, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/biosynthesis/*blood', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD34/biosynthesis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/chemistry/cytology/metabolism', 'Cell Line/metabolism', 'Daunorubicin/analysis/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Fluid/chemistry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Leukocytes/chemistry/immunology/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/*blood', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*diagnosis', 'Prognosis', 'Treatment Outcome', '*Vault Ribonucleoprotein Particles']",1998/05/21 00:00,1998/05/21 00:01,['1998/05/21 00:00'],"['1998/05/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/21 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1998 Apr;83(4):290-7.,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Vault Ribonucleoprotein Particles)', '0 (major vault protein)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
