Adhesion is enhanced in mesangial cells proliferating in response to fetal bovine serum, and in the presence of several cytokines and vasoactive agents. In the present study, co-culture with U-937 followed by removal of non-adherent cells time-dependently decreased viability of mesangial cells, measured either by fluorometry after dual labeling with calcein acetoxymethylester and ethidium homodimer, or by the release of lactate dehydrogenase. The cytotoxic effects of co-culture with U-937 cells were significantly reduced by a combination of free radical scavengers, indicating involvement of reactive oxygen species. U-937 cells also stimulated subsequent proliferation of mesangial cells, assessed by [3H]-TdR incorporation and direct cell counts 24 hours later (from 1,034 +/- 83 to 14,611 +/- 959 and from 2,931 +/- 201 to 19,400 +/- 2,124 cpm/well, quiescent/cycling mesangial cells, respectively, P < 0.01). Controls to rule out TdR incorporation by adherent U-937 cells included selective [3H]-TdR labeling and demecolcine pretreatment. Cell counts at 24 hours confirmed U-937-induced proliferation of quiescent HMC, from 50,575 +/- 3,596 to 143,012 +/- 10,039 cells/cm2 (P < 0.01). Agents that promote U-937 cell adhesion, such as the TxA2 mimetic, U-46619, or angiotensin II, enhanced cytotoxicity while inhibiting the proliferation of both quiescent and cycling mesangial cells, when added during co-culture and the subsequent 24 hours (+1 microM U-46619, 1,875 +/- 131 and 2,546 +/- 125 cpm/well, respectively, 79,793 +/- 5,744 cells/cm2, P < 0.01 vs. U-937 only; +1 microM Ang II, 5066 +/- 560 and 5,784 +/- 306 cpm/well, respectively, 81,068 +/- 4,671 cells/cm2, P < 0.05). Blocking antibodies against the adhesion molecule ICAM-1 and leukocyte counterreceptors (LFA-1, VLA-4) prevented the proliferative response, which could not be duplicated with the conditioned media of U-937 alone or co-cultured with mesangial cells.

Immunized mice develop autoantibodies, leukopenia, proteinuria, and immune complex deposits in renal glomeruli. Case reports have described clinical improvement in SLE in individuals becoming infected with HIV-1. Because 129/J mice are susceptible to experimental SLE and to infection with the BM5def murine leukemia virus (MuLV) mixture but do not develop the lymphoproliferative/ immunodeficiency disorder known as murine AIDS (MAIDS), we superimposed this infection on immunization with the 16/6 Id. Multiple effects were observed. First, we noted an amelioration in the course of experimental SLE. Second, both in experimental SLE and in BM5def MuLV infection, immunoreactivity to HIV-1 gp120 was demonstrated, although gp120 is not present in the BM5def MuLV viruses. Third, production of autoantibodies characteristically found in SLE, e.g., anti-DNA, anti-RNP, and anti-SSA, was seen in BM5def MuLV-infected mice, demonstrating that an immune response as a consequence of infection had occurred despite the absence of MAIDS induction. We conclude that (1) retrovirus inoculation may ameliorate the course of experimental SLE; and (2) retrovirus inoculation, even in the absence of MAIDS induction, induces an immunologic response which promotes the production of potentially pathogenic autoantibodies.","['Mittleman, B B', 'Morse, H C 3rd', 'Payne, S M', 'Shearer, G M', 'Mozes, E']","['Mittleman BB', 'Morse HC 3rd', 'Payne SM', 'Shearer GM', 'Mozes E']","['National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20893, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,J Clin Immunol,Journal of clinical immunology,8102137,"['0 (Antigen-Antibody Complex)', '0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (HIV Envelope Protein gp120)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex/analysis', 'Autoantibodies/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Female', 'HIV Envelope Protein gp120/blood', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Kidney/immunology', 'Leukopenia/etiology', 'Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic/*complications/etiology/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/complications/immunology', 'Retroviridae Infections/*complications/immunology']",1996/07/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01541229 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Immunol. 1996 Jul;16(4):230-6. doi: 10.1007/BF01541229.,['N01-AI-45203/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mouse GARP deduced amino-acid sequence is highly similar to that of the human protein. The Garp gene is expressed in various areas in the mid-gestation developing embryo, including skin, lens fibre cells, nasal cavity, smooth and skeletal muscles, lung, and megakaryocytes of the fetal liver. In the adult it is expressed in the megakaryocytes of the spleen and in endothelial cells of the placenta.

The uptake of THP, DNR and ADR by K562 or K562/ADM cells was time-, temperature- and concentration-dependent. The THP and ADR uptake by the parental cells was not affected by treatment with 4 mM 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) alone or DNP plus a P-gp specific inhibitor, cyclosporin A (CyA, 10 microM), while the DNR uptake in the DNP treatment group was significantly greater than that in the control group. There was no difference in the uptake of THP between DNP-pretreated K562 cells and DNP plus CyA-pretreated K562/ADM cells. The uptake of DNR or ADR was almost equal in both types of cell treated with DNP alone. Every kinetic constant for THP, DNR and ADR uptake by the sensitive cells was approximately equal to that in the resistant cells, respectively, under the above conditions. THP uptake was noncompetitively inhibited and stimulated on simultaneous treatment and preloading, respectively, of DNR or ADR in each type of cell. ADR showed noncompetitive inhibition of DNR uptake by either type of cell. Therefore, it was suggested that a common carrier-mediated transport system was involved in the uptake of THP, DNR and ADR, and that their binding sites in the carrier might be different from one another in both K562 and K562/ADM cells.","['Nagasawa, K', 'Takara, K', 'Nomiyama, M', 'Ohnishi, N', 'Yokoyama, T']","['Nagasawa K', 'Takara K', 'Nomiyama M', 'Ohnishi N', 'Yokoyama T']","['Department of Hospital Pharmacy, Kyoto Pharmaceutical University, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Biol Pharm Bull,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,9311984,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antimetabolites)', '0 (Uncoupling Agents)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'D58G680W0G (pirarubicin)', 'Q13SKS21MN (2,4-Dinitrophenol)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['2,4-Dinitrophenol/pharmacology', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*metabolism', 'Antimetabolites/pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/metabolism/pharmacokinetics', 'Doxorubicin/analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Uncoupling Agents/pharmacology']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1248/bpb.19.971 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Pharm Bull. 1996 Jul;19(7):971-6. doi: 10.1248/bpb.19.971.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we studied the receptor expression in human hematopoietic cells in order to determine whether they play a role in cell growth. The CCK-B/gastrin receptor mRNA was detectable in the polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells but not in the mononuclear cells of normal peripheral white blood cells by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The receptor transcript was, however, expressed in human leukemia cell lines (14 of 18 cell lines tested) derived from not only myeloid, but also T- and B- lymphoid lineages. The CCK-B/gastrin receptors on several leukemia cell lines were shown to be biologically active by demonstrating ligand-dependent cell proliferation in serum-deprived medium. Interestingly, a human CCK-B/gastrin receptor specific antagonist, YM022, but not its stereotype isoform, selectively inhibited the DNA synthesis of THP-1, MOLT-16, MOLT-14, and CCRF-CEM in the absence of exogenous peptide ligands. Further investigation revealed that these leukemia cell lines and normal PMN cells also expressed gastrin mRNA.

This differentiation effect can also be seen in vitro in both fresh leukemic cells and in the unique permanent APL cell line, NB4. However, APL cells become resistant to RA-induced differentiation both in vitro and in patients. Although pharmacodynamic mechanisms of resistance have been reported, there is growing evidence that resistance both in patients, as well as in vitro, can be mediated by changes in the sensitivity of leukemic cells to retinoids. To investigate possible mechanisms of retinoid resistance, we established subclones of NB4 that are stably resistant to both tRA and 9-cisRA. Unlike the previously reported NB4.306 retinoid-resistant cells, these subclones expressed PML/RAR-alpha RNA and protein, but demonstrated altered ligand binding patterns of PML/RAR-alpha and differed in retinoid-induced gene expression. They were significantly less able to stimulate transcription of an RARE driven CAT-reporter gene on induction by tRA and showed altered DNA binding activity on a RARE.

These deletions center at band 5q31, which has thus been proposed as the location of a tumor suppressor gene; this site is to be distinguished from that observed in 5q- syndrome, centering at 5q32. To define the molecular extent and the clinical prevalence of 5q31 deletions, we collected a series of AML and MDS cases of mixed karyotype, taking care to exclude MDS cases with 5q- syndrome. The samples were analyzed for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) using a panel polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based microsatellite markers from 5q, comparing malignant cells with normal tissue derived from lymphoblastoid cell lines or buccal mucosa scrapings. Losses were detected in seven of 29 matched samples, including four of 17 with MDS, and three of 12 with AML; six of these seven also had a cytogenetically-visible del(5q) or -5. The one case without a cytogenetic deletion showed molecular loss of three contiguous markers, with retention of flanking markers interleukin-9 (IL-9) and D5S414, and thus contained a small deletion that is below cytogenetic resolution. PCR failed to detect 5q loss in two cases with large cytogenetic deletions, but both had been treated and contained low percentages of malignant cells in the samples. This study thus led to the identification of a case with a minimal deletion for the 5q31 tumor suppressor gene, specified by IL-9-D5S414, that is approximately 1 Mb (2 cM) in extent. Additionally, we demonstrate that PCR-based allelotyping is a reliable method for the detection of chromosomal deletion in myeloid malignancy, providing the specimens contain a high proportion of malignant cells. These studies will help to identify the tumor-suppressor gene at 5q31, and will help to develop molecular methods for diagnosis and monitoring of these disorders.","['Horrigan, S K', 'Westbrook, C A', 'Kim, A H', 'Banerjee, M', 'Stock, W', 'Larson, R A']","['Horrigan SK', 'Westbrook CA', 'Kim AH', 'Banerjee M', 'Stock W', 'Larson RA']","['Department of Medicine, University of Illinois at Chicago 60607-7173, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Base Sequence', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5/*ultrastructure', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Male', '*Microsatellite Repeats', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/mortality/pathology', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prognosis']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)62363-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Oct 1;88(7):2665-70.,['CA40046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clonogenic JCML progenitors cannot be maintained in culture because they differentiate, and within a few weeks the leukemic clone is lost. This makes it difficult to identify the cell that initiates and maintains the disease in patients. To determine the proliferative capacity of JCML cells in vivo, bone marrow (BM), peripheral blood, or spleen cells from eight patients with JCML either at diagnosis or during treatment were transplanted into sublethally irradiated severe combined immune deficient (SCID) mice. JCML cells from all patients homed to the murine BM and proliferated extensively in response to exogenous stimulation with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Within a few weeks, highly engrafted mice became ill and cachectic due to infiltration of leukemic cells and secretion of tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Murine BM, spleen, and liver were infiltrated with leukemic blasts, and typical JCML colony-forming progenitors could be recovered. Kinetic experiments demonstrated that only a small minority of transplanted cells homed to the murine BM, and that these cells initiated and maintained the disease in vivo by extensive proliferation and differentiation. To characterize the cell-surface phenotype of the JCML initiating cell (JCML-IC), JCML blood or spleen cells were fractionated on the basis of CD34/CD38 marker expression and transplanted into SCID mice. Only immature CD34+ cells could initiate the disease, while mature CD34- cells did not engraft. Within the CD34+ compartment, there was enrichment for JCML-ICs by immature cells with a CD34+/CD38- stem-cell-like phenotype. Mice transplanted with more mature CD34+/CD38+ populations that also contained clonogenic JCML progenitors were poorly engrafted. These results indicate that the JCML-IC is an earlier stage of development than clonogenic JCML progenitors. Additional evidence that the JCML-IC has stem-cell properties comes from secondary transplant experiments that test the self-renewal capacity. The JCML-IC from all three patients tested could successfully reinitiate the disease in secondary murine recipients. Thus, we have developed a functional in vivo model that replicates many aspects of human JCML, and have used this model to identify and characterize JCML-ICs and their stem-cell properties.","['Lapidot, T', 'Grunberger, T', 'Vormoor, J', 'Estrov, Z', 'Kollet, O', 'Bunin, N', 'Zaizov, R', 'Williams, D E', 'Freedman, M H']","['Lapidot T', 'Grunberger T', 'Vormoor J', 'Estrov Z', 'Kollet O', 'Bunin N', 'Zaizov R', 'Williams DE', 'Freedman MH']","['Department of Immunology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Cell Lineage', 'Clone Cells/*pathology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Graft Survival', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Lymphoid Tissue/*pathology', 'Mice', '*Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Radiation Chimera', 'Transplantation, Heterologous/*pathology', 'Transplantation, Homologous/*pathology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)62362-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Oct 1;88(7):2655-64.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chemotherapy has given disappointing results and a substantial number of patients relapse after bone marrow transplantation. A salient feature of this disease is that the JMML cells produce granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) spontaneously and survive and proliferate without exogeneous GM-CSF. Furthermore, JMML cells are hypersensitive to GM-CSF with addition of this cytokine leading to enhanced proliferation. We have recently generated a human GM-CSF analogue, E21R, that acts as a complete and selective GM-CSF receptor antagonist. We have now tested this molecule as a potential new agent to control the leukemic cell load in JMML with particular emphasis on its role in JMML cell survival. We found that E21R inhibited the spontaneous growth of JMML cells in vitro and caused their apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner in seven of seven cases. In contrast, neither a neutralizing anti-GM-CSF monoclonal antibody (MoAb) nor a selective interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor antagonist affected JMML cell survival. Furthermore, the apoptotic effect of E21R was seen even in the presence of interleukin-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, which have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of JMML. The inhibitory effects of E21R on JMML cell growth and viability offer a novel approach to therapy in this lethal childhood leukemia.","['Iversen, P O', 'Rodwell, R L', 'Pitcher, L', 'Taylor, K M', 'Lopez, A F']","['Iversen PO', 'Rodwell RL', 'Pitcher L', 'Taylor KM', 'Lopez AF']","['Division of Human Immunology, Hanson Centre for Cancer Research, IMVS, Adelaide, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-1)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, Arg(21)-)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/immunology/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Interleukin-1/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Receptors, Interleukin-1/antagonists & inhibitors', '*Recombinant Proteins', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)62359-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Oct 1;88(7):2634-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we have investigated the effect of M-CSF on the formation of human osteoclasts in vitro. M-CSF was found to induce substantial bone resorption and osteoclast formation in a dose-responsive and time-dependent manner above that induced by 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25 vitamin D3) in cultures of human bone marrow (BM) stromal cells sedimented onto devitalized bone. By day 14 there was a mean of approximately 50% of the surfaces of the bone slices resorbed compared with only 6% in cultures treated with 1,25 vitamin D3 alone. Osteoclasts were identified as 23c6+ cells (an antibody that recognizes the vitronectin receptor), 87.5% of which coexpressed the calcitonin receptor. The number of 23c6+ cells correlated strongly with bone resorption spatially, and in a dose-responsive and time-dependent manner; the correlation coefficient in cultures treated with 1,25 vitamin D3 alone was 0.856 and those treated with both M-CSF and 1,25 vitamin D3 was 0.880. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, IL-1 beta, IL-3, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, transforming growth factor-beta, leukemia inhibitory factor, and IL-11 did not increase bone resorption above that in 1,25 vitamin D3-treated cultures. We also found that 1,25 vitamin D3 increased, to a minor but significant degree, both bone resorption and the concentration of M-CSF in the culture supernatants above that in vehicle-treated cultures, indicating that M-CSF is present in our BM cultures, but that there is insufficient to induce substantial osteoclast formation. These results define a critical role for M-CSF in the formation of human osteoclasts.","['Sarma, U', 'Flanagan, A M']","['Sarma U', 'Flanagan AM']","[""Department of Histopathology, Imperial College School of Medicine at St. Mary's, London, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Receptors, Calcitonin)', '0 (Receptors, Vitronectin)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Bone Resorption/*chemically induced', 'Calcitriol/pharmacology', 'Cell Nucleus/ultrastructure', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Osteoclasts/cytology/*drug effects', 'Receptors, Calcitonin/analysis', 'Receptors, Vitronectin/analysis', 'Stimulation, Chemical']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)62347-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Oct 1;88(7):2531-40.,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have used differential hybridization analysis of a cDNA library constructed from the murine RA-inducible MPRO promyelocyte cell line to identify immediate-early genes induced by RA during granulocytic differentiation. E3, one of nine sequences identified, was upregulated in an immediate-early manner, with transcript levels peaking after 60 minutes exposure to RA. E3 transcripts were RA-inducible in HL60 cells, but not in an RA-resistant subclone, HL60R, that harbors a mutated RAR alpha gene. However, when HL60R cells were transduced with a functional copy of the RAR alpha gene, RA induced a 10-fold increase in E3 mRNA levels. E3 transcripts are present in the myeloid, B-lymphoid, and erythroid lineages, absent in nonhematopoietic cells, and encode a highly hydrophobic, potentially phosphorylated polypeptide of unknown function with significant homology to a putative protein expressed in myeloid cells. The murine E3 promoter harbors a single bipartite retinoic acid response element which in transient transfection assays conferred RA sensitivity.

Groupe Francais des Myelodysplasies and European CMML Group.,2480-7,"We performed a randomized study of hydroxyurea (HY) versus VP16 in advanced chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) patients with CMML (according to French-American-British group criteria) and either documented visceral involvement (excluding liver and spleen infiltration) or at least 2 of the following: (1) neutrophils > 16 x 10(9)/I (2) Hemoglobin < 10 g/dL (3) platelets < 100 x 10(9)/L (4) marrow blasts > 5% (5) spleen > 5 cm below costal margin were eligible for this trial. Initial dosage was 1 g/d for HY and 150 mg/week for VP16, orally (doubled in case of visceral involvement). Doses were scheduled to be escalated up to HY 4 g/d and VP16 600 mg/week in the absence of response, and finally adjusted to maintain white blood cells (WBCs) between 5 and 10 x 10(9)/L. Crossing over was scheduled only in case of life threatening visceral involvement or major progression. The major endpoint of the study was survival. The study was closed on first interim analysis that showed a superiority of HY over VP16, after inclusion of 105 pts (HY arm: 53, VP16 arm: 52). Results of the second interim analysis, performed 7 months later, are presented here. Median age was 71 (range 38 to 91), median WBC count 20.10(9)/L (range 10 to 187). Thirteen pts had visceral involvement (3 serous effusions, 8 cutaneous infiltrations, 1 kidney, 1 bone infiltrations). Initial characteristics were similar in the HY and VP16 groups. Median follow up was 11 months in both groups (range 1 to 43+). Response to treatment was seen in 60% of the pts in the HY group, versus 36%, respectively, in the VP16 group (P = .02). Time to response was significantly shorter in the HY group (2.1 v 3.5 months, in the VP16 group, P = .003) and response duration was significantly longer in the HY group (median 24 v 9 months, in the VP16 group, P = .0004). The response rate of patients with visceral involvement was 3 out of 7 in the VP16 arm versus 5 out of 6 in the HY group. Three of the 10 pts crossed over from HY to VP16 responded as compared to 6 pts of the 11 pts crossed over from VP16 to HY. HY yielded better response on leukocytosis (P = .002). The effect on splenomegaly platelets, on hemoglobin level and transfusion requirement was similar in the 2 treatment groups. A significantly higher incidence of alopecia was noted in the VP16 arm (20% v 3%, P = .03). Fourteen (27%) and 20 (38%) patients in the HY and the VP16 group respectively, progressed to acute myeloid leukemia (difference NS). Twenty five (53%) and 44 (83%) patients in the HY and the VP16 group, respectively, had died (P = .002). Median actuarial survival was 20 months in the HY arm, versus 9 months in the VP16 arm (P < 10(-4)). Main factors associated with poor survival were allocation to the VP16 arm, ""unfavorable"" karyotype (ie, monosomy 7 or complex abnormalities) and anemia. In the HY group, unfavorable karyotype (P = .006), and low hemoglobin level (P = .004) were significantly associated with low response rates. Prognostic factors for poor survival in the HY group were also unfavorable karyotype (P = .001), and low hemoglobin level (P < 10(-4). In conclusion, we found that HY gave higher response rates and better survival than VP16 in advanced CMML. However, even with HY responses were only partial and survival was generally poor. This stresses the need for new agents in the treatment of CMML, that will have to be compared with HY in future randomized studies.","['Wattel, E', 'Guerci, A', 'Hecquet, B', 'Economopoulos, T', 'Copplestone, A', 'Mahe, B', 'Couteaux, M E', 'Resegotti, L', 'Voglova, V', 'Foussard, C', 'Pegourie, B', 'Michaux, J L', 'Deconinck, E', 'Stoppa, A M', 'Mufti, G', 'Oscier, D', 'Fenaux, P']","['Wattel E', 'Guerci A', 'Hecquet B', 'Economopoulos T', 'Copplestone A', 'Mahe B', 'Couteaux ME', 'Resegotti L', 'Voglova V', 'Foussard C', 'Pegourie B', 'Michaux JL', 'Deconinck E', 'Stoppa AM', 'Mufti G', 'Oscier D', 'Fenaux P']","['Groupe Francais des Myelodysplasies, Lille, France.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Alopecia/chemically induced', 'Blood Cell Count/drug effects', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Etoposide/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Splenomegaly/drug therapy/etiology', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)62341-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Oct 1;88(7):2480-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Forty-seven patients with a diagnosis of MDS (n = 22) or CMML (n = 25) were treated. The median age was 66 years. Chromosomal abnormalities were present in 70% and thrombocytopenia less than 50 x 10(3)/microL in 51%. Evaluation of outcome and of differences among subgroups was performed according to standard methods; the criteria for response were those used for acute leukemia. Topotecan was administered as 2 mg/ m2 by continuous infusion over 24 hours daily for 5 days (10 mg/m2 per course) every 3 to 4 weeks until remission, then once every month for a maximum of 12 courses. Thirteen patients (28%) achieved a complete response (CR) and six (13%) had hematologic improvement. A CR was achieved in six of 22 patients with MDS (27%) and in seven of 25 with CMML (28%). All eight patients who presented with cytogenetic abnormalities (five chromosome 5 or 7 abnormalities) who achieved CR were cytogenetically normal in CR. Characteristics for which there was evidence of association with a higher response rate were lack of prior chemotherapy, less than 10% marrow monocytes, and absence of RAS oncogene mutations. In contrast, CR rates were similar in patients with or without abnormal karyotypes. Mucositis occurred in 64% of patients (severe in 19%) and diarrhea in 32% (severe in 13%). Febrile episodes occurred in 85% of patients and documented infections in 47%.

Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cells, which frequently arise from this lineage, respond aberrantly to G-CSF by proliferating without differentiating. The basis for this abnormal responses is unknown. In the present study, we investigated whether G-CSF signaling in immature normal and leukemic human myeloid cells diverges at the level of activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) proteins. We compared the profile of STAT proteins activated in G-CSF-stimulated immature normal and leukemic human myeloid cells. G-CSF activated Stat3 alpha in all AML cell lines examined except HL60 and in three of six uncultured AML patient samples. In normal human CD34+ bone marrow cells and HL60 cells, both reported to differentiate in response to G-CSF, G-CSF did not activate Stat3 alpha; rather, it activated only an 83 kD form of Stat3 that proved to be the human homologue of a short form of Stat3, Stat3 beta. Because the transcriptional activity of Stat3 beta is distinct from Stat3 alpha, these results suggest that the balance of the two Stat3 isoforms in myeloid cells may influence the cellular pattern of gene activation and consequently the ability of these cells to differentiate in response to G-CSF.","['Chakraborty, A', 'White, S M', 'Schaefer, T S', 'Ball, E D', 'Dyer, K F', 'Tweardy, D J']","['Chakraborty A', 'White SM', 'Schaefer TS', 'Ball ED', 'Dyer KF', 'Tweardy DJ']","['Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, PA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)62336-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Oct 1;88(7):2442-9.,"['AI07333/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31888/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

These transcripts were transcribed from the intronic region just upstream of the exon coding for the transmembrane domain of the CD30 protein. The shorter cDNA had a deletion of 54 nucleotides corresponding to the 3' region of the transmembrane domain of the CD30 and which was probably caused by alternative splicing. Translation of these transcripts appeared to start from the internal methionine codon at nucleotide position 289 that corresponds to that of 1612 in the CD30 cDNA, and encode a protein of 132 amino acid residues which corresponds exactly to the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of CD30 protein. The calculated molecular mass of this variant CD30 (CD30v) protein was 14,087. Thus, the predicted CD30v protein retains most of the cytoplasmic region, but lacks the extracellular and transmembrane domains. Northern blots detected the expression of CD30v transcripts only in the lung and the TPA-stimulated HL-60 cell line. Translation of this mRNA in vitro produced a protein of 25 kD. Immunoblotting analysis with HCD30C1, a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the cytoplasmic domain of CD30 protein, detected proteins with an apparent Mr 25 kD expressed in TPA-stimulated HL-60 and COS-7 cells that were transfected with both types of CD30v cDNAs. Constitutive phosphorylation of the CD30v protein was demonstrated by in vitro labeling with [32P]. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated CD30v protein was in alveolar macrophages. Cotransfection experiments using a kappa B-site-dependent reporter construct showed that CD30v can transactivate gene expression through activation of NF kappa B, as was noted on the authentic CD30 protein. Overexpression of the CD30v induced differentiation of HL-60 cells as evidenced by an increased NBT reduction activity. These observations provided new insights into the molecular heterogeneity and biological function of CD30 in myeloid cells.","['Horie, R', 'Ito, K', 'Tatewaki, M', 'Nagai, M', 'Aizawa, S', 'Higashihara, M', 'Ishida, T', 'Inoue, J', 'Takizawa, H', 'Watanabe, T']","['Horie R', 'Ito K', 'Tatewaki M', 'Nagai M', 'Aizawa S', 'Higashihara M', 'Ishida T', 'Inoue J', 'Takizawa H', 'Watanabe T']","['Department of Pathology, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Ki-1 Antigen)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid/cytology', 'COS Cells', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immune Sera', 'Ki-1 Antigen/biosynthesis/chemistry/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/pathology', 'Macrophages, Alveolar/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multigene Family', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Rabbits', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/immunology', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', ""Sjogren's Syndrome/pathology"", 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)62334-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Oct 1;88(7):2422-32.,,,['GENBANK/D86042'],,,,,,,,,,,

We have analyzed the genomic DNA by Southern blotting and the BCR/ABL hybrid gene transcripts by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in three patients with clinical findings of CML-N, who did have a t(9;22) chromosomal translocation. In all patients we have found a rare type of BCR/ABL rearrangement, with a breakpoint between exons c3 and c4 of the BCR gene (corresponding to BCR exons 19 and 20). This was confirmed by hybridization with an oligonucleotide probe spanning the c3/a2 region. This type of junction causes almost the entire BCR gene to fuse with ABL. The junction is in frame and it gives rise to a fusion protein of predicted 230 kD. Our data now provide a molecular diagnostic marker for CML-N, and they are consistent with the notion that the inclusion or exclusion of BCR exons in the fusion protein affects dramatically its capacity to derange myeloid proliferation and differentiation, leading to the appearance of different disease phenotypes.","['Pane, F', 'Frigeri, F', 'Sindona, M', 'Luciano, L', 'Ferrara, F', 'Cimino, R', 'Meloni, G', 'Saglio, G', 'Salvatore, F', 'Rotoli, B']","['Pane F', 'Frigeri F', 'Sindona M', 'Luciano L', 'Ferrara F', 'Cimino R', 'Meloni G', 'Saglio G', 'Salvatore F', 'Rotoli B']","['CEINGE-Biotecnologie Avanzate, Dipartimento di Biochimica e Biotecnologie Mediche, Universita di Napoli Federico II, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Chromosome Breakage', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22/genetics/*ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9/genetics/*ultrastructure', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/chemistry/*genetics', 'Genes, abl', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Neutrophilic, Chronic/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Weight', 'Phenotype', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prognosis']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)62332-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Oct 1;88(7):2410-4.,,,,"['Blood. 1996 Oct 1;88(7):2375-84.

These methods cannot be applied for the study of apoptosis in peripheral blood (PB) samples, because of the disappearance of circulating apoptotic cells and the heterogeneity of cell populations. In the present study we describe a nuclear chromatin staining method using ethidium bromide (EtBr), by which we were able to identify and quantify morphologically apoptotic cells in an early stage of the apoptotic process, before their disappearance. The application of the EtBr nuclear stain in CCRF-CEM cells incubated with epirubicin, provides a reliable and reproducible estimation of apoptosis compared with other assays. The main advantage of this method is that it permits the study of four cellular subpopulations by their morphological characteristics (normal cells, early apoptotic, late apoptotic and cells which died from necrosis). Furthermore, we utilized the EtBr nuclear stain to identify and quantify the circulating apoptotic cells directly in the PB of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia during multidrug chemotherapy. Circulating apoptotic cells were detectable after 24 hours treatment followed by the decrease of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Thus staining of nuclei with EtBr provides a rapid and useful method for the quantitative study of apoptotic cells in somatic fluids during clinical trials.","['Tsangaris, G T', 'Tzortzatou-Stathopoulou, F']","['Tsangaris GT', 'Tzortzatou-Stathopoulou F']","[""University Research Institute for the Study and Treatment of Childhood Genetic and Malignant Diseases, University of Athens, Aghia Sophia Children's Hospital, Greece.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,In Vivo,"In vivo (Athens, Greece)",8806809,"['0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '3Z8479ZZ5X (Epirubicin)', 'EN464416SI (Ethidium)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Epirubicin/pharmacology', 'Ethidium/*chemistry', 'Fluorescent Dyes/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Reproducibility of Results']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,In Vivo. 1996 Jul-Aug;10(4):435-43.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Coall Study Group.,640-8,"UNLABELLED: A frequent change of drug combinations may circumvent drug resistance in the treatment of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). In study COALL 85/89 201 children with high-risk ALL were randomized to receive over a period of 8 months rotational chemotherapy with six drug combinations given either in slow rotation (SR) (each combination given twice in succession) or in rapid rotation (RR) (each combination given once with a repetition of the drug combinations). Treatment of central nervous system leukaemia consisted of cranial irradiation and intrathecal methotrexate. Both SR and RR treatment groups were then given continuation chemotherapy of oral 6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate until 2 years after the date of diagnosis. The 9-year event-free survival (EFS) rate for the whole group is 69% +/- 3%, and the survival rate 75% +/- 3% at a median follow up of 5.8 years. Failure to achieve remission at day 28 was the most important prognostic factor (EFS 12% +/- 7% vs. 75% +/- 3% in the remission group). In the RR group, 11/100 patients were not in remission at day 28 opposed to 7/101 patients in the SR group. Children aged < 1 year (6/6 relapses) or aged > or = 10 years had a worse prognosis (EFS 64% +/- 5% vs. 77% +/- 4% in patients 1-10 years old). After 5 years EFS was inferior in the RR group attributable to a significantly higher relapse rate in children with a WBC > or = 100/nl. The EFS at 9 years for all patients, however, is similar in both groups (SR 72% +/- 5% vs. RR 67 +/- 5%). CONCLUSION: The COALL 85/89 treatment protocol with early intensive therapy and rotation of different drug combinations offers longterm disease-free survival for children with high-risk ALL. a continuous 4-week exposure to one drug combination may be necessary to achieve optimal results, especially in children with a high leukaemic cell burden.","['Janka-Schaub, G E', 'Harms, D', 'Goebel, U', 'Graubner, U', 'Gutjahr, P', 'Haas, R J', 'Juergens, H', 'Spaar, H J', 'Winkler, K']","['Janka-Schaub GE', 'Harms D', 'Goebel U', 'Graubner U', 'Gutjahr P', 'Haas RJ', 'Juergens H', 'Spaar HJ', 'Winkler K']","[""Children's University Hospital, Department of Haematology and Oncology, Hamburg, Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",Germany,Eur J Pediatr,European journal of pediatrics,7603873,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01957144 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Pediatr. 1996 Aug;155(8):640-8. doi: 10.1007/BF01957144.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It allows the characterization of additional leukemia associated parameters, like over- or under- expression as compared to normal counterparts, that is suitable for the diagnosis of malignancy or for residual disease evaluation. It improves scoring systems for the differential diagnosis between the different chronic malignancies. It allows to find original pronostic parameters and improves the comparison of different series due to a better definition of positivity. It helps to the monitoring of immune based therapeutic regimens. It provides new relevant pathophysiological informations, for instance in the study of apoptosis, as a tool for quantitative evaluation of the apoptotic process itself and for the study of its mechanism. Since its first description by Minot and Isaacs in 1924, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) has been extensively studied, due in part as it has been demonstrated as the more frequent leukemia in the Western world (Gale and Foon 1987). In addition, clinical features, cell morphology, immunological markers, histopathology and molecular genetics have been used progressively to define and characterize a wide spectrum of chronic lymphoproliferative disorders which had been previously gathered in the same entity than CLL (Benett et al., 1989, Catovsky and Matutes 1991, Harris et al., 194). Immunologic techniques are now routinely used for diagnosis in this context. Since there is no marker specific for each of these entities, scoring systems have been proposed to help diagnosis (Matutes and Catovsky 1994), which are currently investigated in multicentric studies. Flow cytometry is now widely used for immunophenotyping purposes. It allows, in addition to the determination of the percentage of positive cells, to determine the intensity of fluorescent staining, that can be converted into antigen density provided that reagents are used under saturating concentrations and correct standards of fluorescence are tested in parallel. The concept of antigen density evaluation appears to improve the efficiency of immune techniques in the monitoring of hemopoietic malignancies (Lavabre-Bertrand et al., 1994c). The present review will focus on the specific interest of immune quantitation in the study of chronic lymphoid malignancies, with a successive emphasis on diagnosis of malignancy, distinction between the different chronic lymphopathies, prognostic and therapeutic relevance, then on pathophysiological interest.","['Lavabre-Bertrand, T']",['Lavabre-Bertrand T'],"['Service des Maladies du Sang, Hopital Lapeyronie, Montpellier, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Italy,Eur J Histochem,European journal of histochemistry : EJH,9207930,,IM,"['Chronic Disease', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/methods', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/*immunology/pathology']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Eur J Histochem. 1996;40 Suppl 1:33-8.,,56,,,,,,,,,,,,

The experience of American Samoans.,1553-7,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about the cancer control needs of American Samoans. This report provides some of the first data on cancer incidence among American Samoans in Hawaii. METHODS: The Hawaii Tumor Registry, a Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results population-based, active cancer surveillance program, provided archival data on American Samoans residing in Hawaii and on those referred to Hawaii for diagnosis and treatment from the U.S. Territory of American Samoa. RESULTS: In American Samoan males, the more commonly encountered cancers included cancer of the lung, prostate, stomach and liver, and leukemia. In American Samoans females, breast carcinoma was most frequent, followed by cancer of the corpus uteri, cervix uteri and thyroid, and leukemia. Females were more likely than males to receive a diagnosis of cancer at an early age: 34.5% of females and 19.9% of males with cancer were diagnosed when they were between the ages of 0 and 44 years. Males were more likely than females to be diagnosed with cancer after metastasis had occurred (45% vs. 33.9%). Compared with other Polynesians (i.e., Western Samoans and Hawaiians), American Samoan males have a relatively higher frequency of lung, prostate, thyroid, and liver cancers and a lower frequency of colon and rectum cancers. American Samoan females, compared with other Polynesians, have a higher frequency of leukemia and corpus uteri, thyroid, and pancreatic cancers and a lower frequency of colon and rectum cancers. CONCLUSIONS: The data provide baseline information that has important public health and research implications for cancer control programs for this population.","['Mishra, S I', 'Luce-Aoelua, P H', 'Wilkens, L R']","['Mishra SI', 'Luce-Aoelua PH', 'Wilkens LR']","['Department of Medicine, University of California, Irvine 92697-5800, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'American Samoa/ethnology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Ethnicity', 'Female', 'Hawaii/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/*ethnology']",1996/10/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19961001)78:7<1553::AID-CNCR31>3.0.CO;2-X [pii]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1996 Oct 1;78(7 Suppl):1553-7.,['1 RO1 CA 64434-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The impression that African American patients had more frequent and severe GVHD prompted this retrospective survey. METHODS: The records of 75 consecutive patients treated with a human leukocyte antigen-identical sibling bone marrow transplant from 1985 to 1993 were reviewed. GVHD prophylaxis uniformly employed cyclosporine and steroids. Treatment of GVHD included cyclosporine and high dose steroids in all cases. Antithymocyte globulin and other immunosuppressants were used in severe cases. RESULTS: Of 75 patients, 56 (75%) were white, 11 (15%) were listed as ""Hispanic"", 7 (9%) were African Americans, and 1 was of Far-Eastern origin. Four of the African American patients had chronic myelogenous leukemia and 2 had acute leukemia, whereas 21 of the other 68 patients (31%) had chronic myelogenous leukemia, 31 (46%) had acute leukemia, and the remainder (33%) had miscellaneous hematologic malignancies. Transplants from a female donor to a male recipient were performed in 2 of 7 African Americans and 19 of 68 patients (28%) of other origins. Five of the 6 evaluable African American patients (83%; 95% confidence interval, 36-100%) had Grade 4 GVHD, as opposed to 5 of 61 patients of other racial origins (8%; 95% confidence interval, 3-18%). All African American patients died within 90 days of transplant.

Magnetic resonance imaging of the patient's brain showed no abnormalities of the hypothalamus or pituitary gland. Lumbar puncture revealed no leukocytes in the cerebrospinal fluid. The authors believe that the cause of diabetes insipidus can be explained in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia by checking for monosomy 7 during karyotyping.

DESIGN AND METHODS: An HIV-1 env gene-containing expression vector was transfected into NK-sensitive K562 cells, and cell clones expressing gp120/41 were selected and used as targets in natural cytotoxicity assays using PBMC from both HIV-seropositive and seronegative individuals. A 16h 51Cr-release assay was used to determine the susceptibility of the gp120/41-expressing K562 as well as control vector-transfected cells. To identify the cell types involved in the killing of the transfected cells, PBMC depleted for a specific cell type as well as enriched or purified cell types were used as effector cells. RESULTS: Endogenous expression of gp120/41 by target cells increased their susceptibility to lysis by PBMC of HIV-seronegative individuals. The two cell types responsible for this enhanced killing, NK cells and monocytes, were found severely compromised in HIV-seropositive individuals in their ability to kill both env gene-transfected and control cells; killing by monocytes occurred via CD4. CONCLUSIONS: The present results illustrate for the first time that the transfected gp120/41 serves as target for both NK and monocyte-mediated killing and that cytocidal activity of these two effector cell types is defective in HIV-infected subjects. Strengthening this innate cytotoxic activity in these individuals may represent a valuable approach in controlling HIV infection.","['Ahmad, A', 'Menezes, J']","['Ahmad A', 'Menezes J']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Montreal/Ste-Justine Hospital, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,AIDS,"AIDS (London, England)",8710219,"['0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (HIV Envelope Protein gp120)', '0 (HIV Envelope Protein gp41)']",IM,"['CD4 Antigens/immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Fusion/immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*immunology', 'Genes, env/genetics', 'HIV Envelope Protein gp120/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'HIV Envelope Protein gp41/biosynthesis/immunology', 'HIV Infections/*immunology', 'HIV-1/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Subsets', 'Monocytes/*immunology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00002030-199602000-00003 [doi]'],ppublish,AIDS. 1996 Feb;10(2):143-9. doi: 10.1097/00002030-199602000-00003.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The reactive cases showed pan-cadherin membrane associated staining of endothelium and epithelioid granulomas. No staining of lymphoid cells was seen. Pan-cadherin immunostaining was present in three of six T-cell lymphomas, two of six high-grade B-cell lymphomas, 12 of 13 anaplastic large cell lymphomas and three of eight cases of Hodgkin's disease. No staining of low-grade B-cell lymphomas was identified with the pan-cadherin antibody. E-cadherin was not detected in any of the lymphomas that showed pan-cadherin expression. The frequent and strongest cadherin expression in anaplastic large cell is noteworthy. The tumour cells of this lymphoma subtype are characterized by copious cytoplasma and a cohesive appearance, features which impart a superficial resemblance to carcinoma cells.

Pharmacological efforts to reverse this MDR phenotype and sensitize resistant tumor cells have utilized verapamil (VER) to inhibit p-glycoprotein function and buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) to inhibit glutathione synthesis. Our previous results indicate that restriction of two amino acids, tyrosine (Tyr) and phenylalanine (Phe), may potentially suppress the MDR phenotype. These results show that in vivo Tyr and Phe restriction improves the therapeutic response of a metastatic variant of B16-BL6 (BL6) murine melanoma to adriamycin (ADR) and B16 melanoma to levodopa methyl ester. We examine whether in vitro limitation of Tyr and Phe suppresses ADR resistance of BL6 cells and whether Tyr-Phe modulation of the MDR phenotype is applicable to other tumor types, particularly P388 murine leukemia. Mechanisms underlying Tyr-Phe modulation of ADR resistance are examined in the presence of VER and BSO, singly and in combination. Our results indicate that in vitro Tyr and Phe restriction has no effect on BL6 resistance to ADR. However, Tyr and Phe restriction does increase the sensitivity of ADR-resistant P388 cells to ADR without affecting drug efflux, ADR uptake, or glutathione levels. In addition, this enhanced ADR sensitivity of P388 cells is even more pronounced in the presence of BSO. Suppression of ADR resistance in P388-resistant cells by Tyr and Phe restriction indicates that Tyr- and Phe-mediated modulation of the MDR phenotype is possible and that Tyr and Phe restriction may be useful as a potential adjuvant to effective cancer chemotherapy.","['Elstad, C A', 'Thrall, B D', 'Raha, G', 'Meadows, G G']","['Elstad CA', 'Thrall BD', 'Raha G', 'Meadows GG']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Washington State University, Pullman 99164-6510, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Nutr Cancer,Nutrition and cancer,7905040,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '47E5O17Y3R (Phenylalanine)', '5072-26-4 (Buthionine Sulfoximine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Buthionine Sulfoximine/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/metabolism/*therapeutic use', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Melanoma, Experimental/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Phenylalanine/*administration & dosage', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/*administration & dosage', 'Verapamil/pharmacology']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/01635589609514427 [doi]'],ppublish,Nutr Cancer. 1996;25(1):47-60. doi: 10.1080/01635589609514427.,['CA-42465/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Oral mucositis was evaluated according to the criteria of the World Health Organization. Mucositis was observed in 52% of the infusions. In 28 infusions with no delayed elimination of MTX 39% developed mucositis, which was found to correlate significantly with low systemic clearance of MTX during the infusion and a low p-7-OHMTX/p-MTX ratio at 66 hours after the start of infusion. The MTX concentration in saliva did not show any correlation with the development of mucositis.

In all children the ADA enzyme activity was also determined in the plasma by spectrophotometry at the onset of the disease, during remission, at the end of the therapy, and during relapse. The phenotype in all children was ADA1-1. There was a difference in enzyme activity between the mean values of children with ALI and those with solid tumors. There were also differences among the subtypes of ALL and also among the stages of ALL and the stages of solid tumors. In 23 children with ALL the mean value (MV) and the corresponding standard error (SEM) of enzyme activity at the onset of the disease were MV +/- SEM = 60.2 +/- 6.2 IU/L. This was higher than that of the control group (control group: MV +/- SEM = 27.8 +/- 3.3 IU/L). During remission the enzyme activity was lower than that of the control group (MV +/- SEM = 19.6 +/- 1.7 IU/L); at the end of the therapy it was MV +/- SEM = 24.0 +/- 1.3 IU/L, which is close to that of the control group; and during relapse it was much higher compared with the control group (MV +/- SEM = 73.1 +/- 4.6 IU/L). These values are discussed in connection to the leukaemic subtypes. In 10 children with solid tumors the mean value of enzyme activity at the onset of the disease was MV +/- SEM = 48.8 +/- 2.4 IU/L.

Projection of the data indicates that by the turn of the century, 1 of every 900 individuals between the ages of 16 and 44 years will be a cancer survivor. In the adult population, carcinogens and irradiation play a major role in oncogenesis. In the pediatric population other factors are probably dominant. Children of low socioeconomic groups, with nutritional deficiencies, are more exposed to viral infections at a very early age and have a greater chance of developing tumors such as Burkitt lymphoma or mixed cellularity Hodgkin disease. Other factors such as hormone-assisted conception or in vitro fertilization may have carcinogenic potential, although this has yet to be determined. Maternal diet during pregnancy, especially low folic acid consumption periconception, may have bearing on the fetus's risk of developing malignancy. The hazards of exposure to electric and magnetic fields from high-voltage transmission lines, home electric appliances, video display terminals, or residence near nuclear plants, although very doubtful, are included in the list of cancer promoters in children. Activated oncogenes, mutated suppressor genes, mismatch repair genes, nucleotide excision genes, and loss of imprinting genes are beginning to evolve as important factors in carcinogenesis.

TNF levels and MxA expression were determined at diagnosis in 21 CLL patients. A statistically significant correlation was found between low TNF levels and MxA expression and between high TNF levels and no measurable MxA expression. The patients were then randomized to receive IFN-alpha or no therapy and were evaluated for response and evolution. When response to IFN-alpha therapy was considered, it became apparent that early-stage CLL patients with higher TNF levels and no measurable MxA expression were more likely to benefit from IFN therapy, whereas those patients with lower TNF levels and MxA expression could be considered CLL candidates for longer survival without therapy.

DDT1 MF-2 cells possess a high density (370,000 sites/cell) of high affinity (Kd value of 0.26 nM) binding sites for [3H]nitrobenzylthioinosine, a marker for the equilibrative and inhibitor-sensitive subtype of nucleoside transporters. Transport of [3H]adenosine was insensitive to Na+ and was inhibited by the nucleoside transport inhibitors nitrobenzylthioinosine, dilazep and dipyridamole with IC50 values of 1, 13 and 270 nM, respectively. Propentofylline, a neuroprotective compound that can inhibit nucleoside transporters, is rapidly metabolized in vivo to the racemate (+/-)-A720287. Based on recent findings that some transport inhibitors exhibit marked stereoselectivity, we tested the degree to which individual stereoisomers of (+/-)-A720287 affect adenosine transport.

These molecules share the signal transducing receptor component, gp130. IL-6 triggers homodimerization of gp130, whereas CNTF and LIF induce heterodimerization of gp130 and LIF receptor. Although CNTF or LIF treatment attenuates motor deficits in wobbler mouse motor neuron disease (MND), neuroprotective effects of IL-6 on this animal have not yet been clarified. Here we studied whether simultaneous treatment with IL-6 and soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) can ameliorate symptomatic and neuropathological changes in wobbler mouse MND. After clinical diagnosis at postnatal age 3-4 weeks, wobbler mice received subcutaneous injection with human recombinant IL-6 (1.0 mg/kg), human sIL-6R (0.5 mg/kg), IL-6 + sIL-6R or vehicle, daily for 4 weeks in a blind fashion. Compared to vehicle, coadministration with IL-6 and sIL-6R potentiated grip strength, attenuated muscle contractures in the forelimbs, reduced denervation muscle atrophy and prevented degeneration of spinal motor neurons. Single administration with IL-6 or sIL-6R did not retard the symptomatic and neuropathological progression, although IL-6-treated mice did not raise anti-IL-6 antibodies. Treatment with IL-6 + sIL-6R, but not with IL-6 or sIL-6R alone delayed progression of wobbler mouse MND. Our results indicate that the neuroprotective mechanism for IL-6/sIL-6R on wobbler mouse MND differs from that of CNTF or LIF alone. We hypothesize that IL-6/sIL-6R complex may function on motor neurons through activation and homodimerization of gp130.","['Ikeda, K', 'Kinoshita, M', 'Tagaya, N', 'Shiojima, T', 'Taga, T', 'Yasukawa, K', 'Suzuki, H', 'Okano, A']","['Ikeda K', 'Kinoshita M', 'Tagaya N', 'Shiojima T', 'Taga T', 'Yasukawa K', 'Suzuki H', 'Okano A']","['Fourth Department of Internal Medicine, Toho University Ohashi Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Brain Res,Brain research,0045503,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Neuroprotective Agents)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Cell Count', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Neurologic Mutants', 'Motor Neuron Disease/*drug therapy', 'Motor Neurons/drug effects/pathology', 'Muscle, Skeletal/pathology', 'Neuroprotective Agents/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Interleukin/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Solubility', 'Spinal Cord/pathology']",1996/07/08 00:00,1996/07/08 00:01,['1996/07/08 00:00'],"['1996/07/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/08 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/08 00:00 [entrez]']",['0006-8993(96)00316-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Brain Res. 1996 Jul 8;726(1-2):91-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All phospholipid-araC conjugates which were condensed via a phosphotriester linkage were shown to be ineffective in the in vivo treatment of L1210 murine leukemia. The transformation of the triesters into phosphodiester-linked conjugates by cleavage of the 2-chlorophenyl protecting group resulted in conjugates which were highly active against L1210 leukemia. These conjugates form stable liposomes with matrix lipids which exert antileukemic effects depending on the number and characteristics of the lipophilic residues of the conjugates. By treatment of L1210 leukemic mice with 100 mumol/kg body wt as total dose given by i.p. injection on days 2 and 6 after tumor inoculation with liposomal hxd4araC or 1-O-octadecyl-rac-glycero-3-phosphoryl-(3-->5')-1- beta-D-arabino-furanosylcytosine (Ocd1GroP-araC) the fraction of 60-day survivors was 100%.

In the bone marrow transplantation (BMT) setting, VOD is caused by dose-intensive chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy used to prepare patients for transplant. VOD occurs in up to 50% of the patients who undergo BMT and is usually associated with a high mortality rate. Until recently, there was no proven effective medical therapy for this condition once it was clinically apparent. We report here on the frequency and treatment result of VOD with rt-PA in our allogeneic BMT patients. Eight patients (median age 28.5 years) underwent allogeneic BMT from December, 1993 to June, 1995 in Asan Medical Center. Six leukemia patients were prepared for BMT with busulfan and cyclophosphmide, while two aplastic anemia patients received cyclophosphamide and antithymocyte globulin. VOD was defined as having two of the following features before day 20 posttransplant: jaundice (bilirubin > or = 2 mg/dL), tender hepatomegaly and/or right upper quadrant pain, ascites and/or unexplained weight gain (> 2% from baseline). All patients who were diagnosed with VOD received rt-PA (10-20 mg/day) and heparin (10,000 U/day). Three (37.5%) of the eight patients developed VOD that occurred between 6 and 10 days posttransplant. All three patients developed jaundice, weight gain, and tender hepatomegaly. Ascites and renal insufficiency occurred in two patients and pleural effusion in one patient. rt-PA and heparin were begun 6 to 26 days posttransplant and rt-PA was administered for 7 to 14 days. All three patients responded to the therapy; bilirubin levels began to decrease at 4 to 13 days from the start of therapy. They are all alive at day 111, 316, and 548 days posttransplant. None of the patients had significant hemorrhagic complications after rt-PA treatment. Prolonged administration of rt-PA was feasible without bleeding episode and it seems that rt-PA may alter the natural course of VOD.","['Lee, J H', 'Lee, K H', 'Choi, J S', 'Zang, D Y', 'Kim, S B', 'Kim, S W', 'Suh, C', 'Lee, J S', 'Kim, W K', 'Lee, Y S', 'Kim, S H']","['Lee JH', 'Lee KH', 'Choi JS', 'Zang DY', 'Kim SB', 'Kim SW', 'Suh C', 'Lee JS', 'Kim WK', 'Lee YS', 'Kim SH']","['Department of Medicine, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Korea (South),J Korean Med Sci,Journal of Korean medical science,8703518,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '9005-49-6 (Heparin)', 'EC 3.4.21.68 (Tissue Plasminogen Activator)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Heparin/therapeutic use', 'Hepatic Veno-Occlusive Disease/*drug therapy/etiology/physiopathology/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*adverse effects', 'Male', 'Preoperative Care/adverse effects', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Risk Factors', 'Tissue Plasminogen Activator/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3346/jkms.1996.11.2.118 [doi]'],ppublish,J Korean Med Sci. 1996 Apr;11(2):118-26. doi: 10.3346/jkms.1996.11.2.118.,,,,,,,PMC3053940,,,,,,,

Exposure of chloroma cells to calphostin C (a specific PKC inhibitor) led to inhibition of cell proliferation, caused by (i) partial and transient arrest of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle and (ii) induction of apoptosis in part of the cell population. The calphostin-C-induced inhibition of PKC activity was accompanied by changes in the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)--a protein known to participate in regulation of DNA replication and repair. Flow cytometry and western blot analyses of the PCNA expression showed that, following the calphostin C treatment, expression of PCNA declined and attained the lowest value on day 2, followed by recovery to the control level. The decline of the PCNA expression was accompanied by changes in the molecular weight of the protein suggesting either its degradation or release of unfinished protein. The decline/recovery of the PCNA expression followed the same time-pattern as the cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Cell apoptosis is often accompanied by cell cycle arrest, therefore, we further examined whether G1 arrest would, by itself, cause apoptosis. Exposure of the chloroma cells to various doses of hydroxyurea, a G1 arrest inducing agent, caused cell apoptosis within 24-48 h after treatment. This suggests that PKC might indirectly be responsible for the chloroma cell apoptosis induced by calphostin C. In conclusion, it appears that PKC regulates cell cycle progression by modulating the G1 to S phase transition. One of the possible targets of the PKC effects observed here might be, among others (?), PCNA--a protein involved in regulation of both cell proliferation and apoptosis.","['Leszczynski, D']",['Leszczynski D'],"['Department of Research, Finnish Centre for Radiation and Nuclear Safety, Helsinki.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Oncol Res,Oncology research,9208097,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Naphthalenes)', '0 (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen)', '0 (calphostin complex)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle/*physiology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA/chemistry', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hydroxyurea/pharmacology', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Interphase/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Naphthalenes/pharmacology', 'Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen/biosynthesis', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'S Phase/drug effects', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncol Res. 1995;7(9):471-80.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Owing to overexpression of IDS in that percentage of PBLMPS successfully transduced, IDS activity was increased above the deficiency found in patients with Hunter syndrome (< 20 U/mg per hr) to a level comparable with that of normal individuals (mean activity of uncultured normal leukocytes 807 U/mg per hr; SD 252). Reduced 35SO4-glucosaminoglycan (GAG) accumulation was observed in PBLMPS that had been transduced with L2SN, or when PBLMPS were grown in medium that had been ""conditioned"" by growth of L2SN-transduced cells. This latter result indicated that metabolic cross-correction occurred by means of intercellular enzyme transfer. These studies of retrovirus-mediated expression and metabolic correction, finding near-normal levels of IDS in cultured PBLMPS and metabolic correction, demonstrate the potential for treatment of mild, nonneuropathic Hunter syndrome by means of ex vivo lymphocyte gene therapy.","['Braun, S E', 'Pan, D', 'Aronovich, E L', 'Jonsson, J J', 'McIvor, R S', 'Whitley, C B']","['Braun SE', 'Pan D', 'Aronovich EL', 'Jonsson JJ', 'McIvor RS', 'Whitley CB']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Muromonab-CD3)', 'EC 3.1.6.13 (Iduronate Sulfatase)']",IM,"['Cytomegalovirus/genetics', 'Genes, Synthetic', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Humans', 'Iduronate Sulfatase/*genetics', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Mucopolysaccharidosis II/enzymology/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Muromonab-CD3/pharmacology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*transplantation', 'Transfection']",1996/02/10 00:00,1996/02/10 00:01,['1996/02/10 00:00'],"['1996/02/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/10 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/hum.1996.7.3-283 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 1996 Feb 10;7(3):283-90. doi: 10.1089/hum.1996.7.3-283.,['P01-HD32652/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that at-home personal dosimetry levels were highly correlated with total personal dosimetry levels in children under 9 years (Spearman correlation coefficient, R = 0.94), whereas the correlation was lower in older children (R = 0.59). For all children combined, bedroom 24-hour measurements correlated well with at-home personal dosimetry levels (R = 0.76). The 24-hour bedroom measurement was a useful predictor of both at-home and total personal dosimetry measurements. Particularly for younger children, our data suggest that in-home area measurements predict both current residential and current total magnetic field exposures.

E2F oncogenic signals are released when the pRb tumor suppressor is inactivated, and E2F activation may necessitate the coordinate inactivation of a second tumor suppressor, p53.

The t(8;21) creates a fusion protein between AML-1 and a gene of unknown function, mtg8 (ETO), whereas the t(12;21) fuses the TEL (translocation-ets-leukemia) transcription factor to the N-terminus of AML-1. The inv(16), which is the most frequent anomaly found in AML, also targets AML-1, by fusing the gene that encodes AML-1's heterodimeric partner CBF beta to the smooth muscle myosin heavy chain gene MYHll.

Heme and the protoporphyrin complexes of cadmium, magnesium, and tin significantly inhibited HIV-1 RT, whereas other metalloporphyrins had a lesser or no effect on the enzyme. The mechanism of inhibition was examined with respect to heme and tin protoporphyrin (SnPP), as both compounds have been utilized clinically as treatment for noninfectious disorders. Heme and SnPP inhibited HIV-1 RT in a noncompetitive manner with respect to deoxythymidine triphosphate. Inhibition depended in part on the protoporphyrin structure, because the mesoderivatives of the heme analogs essentially were without effect. Heme also markedly enhanced the inhibitory effect of azidothymidine (zidovudine, AZT) on HIV-1 RT, and the combination of the two compounds showed synergy in inhibiting HIV-1 RT. HIV-1 RT was used to reverse transcribe the glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene from human kidney. Subsequently, GAPDH cDNA was amplified with Taq polymerase, and electrophoresis showed that HIV-1 RT catalyzed the reverse transcription of human mRNA at a rate comparable to that of Moloney murine leukemia virus. Heme and SnPP prevented cDNA synthesis by HIV-1 RT in this RT-polymerase chain reaction assay. We also examined the effects of these compounds on normal human bone marrow function. Heme stimulated both erythroid and myeloid progenitor colony formation, whereas SnPP was essentially without effect. In contrast, ZnPP had a suppressive effect on hematopoiesis. Finally, we show that heme has a sparing effect against the myelotoxicity of AZT. The results of these studies raise the possibility that combination therapy with AZT and heme, or heme plus an inhibitor of heme catabolism, might have therapeutic potential in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.","['Staudinger, R', 'Abraham, N G', 'Levere, R D', 'Kappas, A']","['Staudinger R', 'Abraham NG', 'Levere RD', 'Kappas A']","['Rockefeller University Hospital, New York, NY 10021-6399, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Assoc Am Physicians,Proceedings of the Association of American Physicians,9514310,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Metalloporphyrins)', '0 (Protoporphyrins)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)', '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)', 'DIO3JT9G2P (tin protoporphyrin IX)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (HIV Reverse Transcriptase)']",IM,"['Antiviral Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Drug Synergism', 'HIV Reverse Transcriptase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'HIV-1/*drug effects/enzymology/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Heme/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Metalloporphyrins/pharmacology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protoporphyrins/pharmacology', 'Zidovudine/*pharmacology']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Proc Assoc Am Physicians. 1996 Jan;108(1):47-54.,['R01-HL54138/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unregulated or excess influences of these molecules are thought to play a part in the pathophysiology of many joint diseases. However, the role of cytokines in osteoarthritis (OA) is not well established. Our aims are twofold: firstly to consider the evidence for the contribution of cytokines to the pathophysiology of OA and secondly to evaluate their potential as markers of disease activity in OA. METHODS: Cytokine homeostasis, the role of catabolic and anabolic cytokines in maintaining cartilage integrity, and the contribution of such cytokines to destructive processes in OA were examined. Consideration was given to the interrelationship between cartilage, bone, and synovium in OA; metabolites produced by such structures were compared with cytokines as indicators of disease activity. RESULTS: The evidence reviewed suggests that interleukin-1 (IL-1) and the less potent tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) are mediators of joint damage in OA. The cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) were implicted in both destructive and protective mechanisms, suggesting a dual role. Metabolites of the different components of the joint provided a better measure of disease activity than cytokines. CONCLUSIONS: Experimental evidence is emerging that catabolic cytokines are mediators of joint damage in OA, although their usefulness as markers of disease activity is limited because of the need to monitor a wide range of ligands and their inhibitors simultaneously. In contrast, metabolites released from cells within bone, synovium, and cartilage related to disease activity and provided prognostic information.","['Westacott, C I', 'Sharif, M']","['Westacott CI', 'Sharif M']","['Department of Pathology and Microbiology, University of Bristol, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Arthritis Rheum,Seminars in arthritis and rheumatism,1306053,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Cytokines)']",IM,"['Biomarkers/analysis', 'Cartilage, Articular/chemistry/metabolism', 'Cytokines/analysis/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Osteoarthritis/*physiopathology']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0049-0172(96)80036-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0049-0172(96)80036-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Arthritis Rheum. 1996 Feb;25(4):254-72. doi: 10.1016/s0049-0172(96)80036-9.,,140,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of flow cytometric analysis in malignant pleural effusions. 26 patients (13 females, 13 males; mean age 52 +/- 19 years; range 16-82) were included in the study. 15 had malignant pleural effusions (7 adenocarcinoma, 2 lymphoma, 2 chronic myeloid leukemia, 1 ovarian carcinoma, 1 small cell lung carcinoma, 1 squamous cell lung carcinoma and empyema, and 1 malignant mesothelioma) with positive cytology. 2 had benign effusions associated with malignancy (1 squamous cell lung carcinoma and congestive heart failure, and 1 neuroblastoma and hypoproteinemia). 9 had benign effusions (3 tuberculosis, 1 congestive heart failure, 3 parapneumonic pleural effusion, 1 benign mesothelioma, and 1 pulmonary embolism). Flow cytometric analysis of pleural effusions revealed an increased DNA index in malignant effusions: 1.32 +/- 0.44 versus 0.88 +/- 0.23 in benign effusions (p < 0.04). The cell cycle distribution of cells such as G1/G0 and S in malignant effusions did not differ from that of benign pleural effusions; however G2+M increased significantly in malignant effusions (p < 0.03). Using analysis of mononuclear immunophenotyping, CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ cells did not show any significant difference between the two groups. The lymphocyte activation marker CD38 was positive in 57.6 +/- 11.5% of malignant fluid cells and 38.5 +/- 6.2% of benign fluid cells (p < 0.04). The mean carcinoembryonic antigen levels in malignant and benign pleural effusions were 98.7 +/- 157.3 and 0.9 +/- 1.2 ng/ml, respectively (p < 0.03). In conclusion, the results of our study indicate that finding cells with an abnormal DNA content strongly supports the diagnosis of malignant pleural effusions. Additionally, mononuclear cell phenotypes have to be taken into consideration for malignant pleural effusions, particularly activated T cells. We recommend that flow cytometry should be performed if the cytology is equivocal.","['Ceyhan, B B', 'Demiralp, E', 'Celikel, T']","['Ceyhan BB', 'Demiralp E', 'Celikel T']","['Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Marmara University, Istanbul, Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Respiration,Respiration; international review of thoracic diseases,0137356,['9007-49-2 (DNA)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'DNA/*analysis', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pleural Effusion/genetics/*pathology']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000196510 [doi]'],ppublish,Respiration. 1996;63(1):17-24. doi: 10.1159/000196510.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These B cells appear to be blocked at the antigen receptor-expressing stage of B cell differentiation and are thought not to undergo an isotype class switch to IgG or IgA production. In vivo and in vitro studies suggest, however, that in some instances terminal differentiation and isotype switching can occur. To test the hypothesis that in vivo isotype class switching occurs in IgM+ B-type CLL cells, we analyzed the PBMC of 19 CLL patients for the presence of transcripts encoding the rearranged CLL V(H)DJ(H) associated with either gamma or alpha H chains. The molecular data indicate that approximately 50% of B-CLL patients have amplifications of IgM+ B cells that undergo an isotype class switch. Switching to IgA appears to occur more often than to IgG; also, switching can involve different IgG subclasses in individual patients. In many instances, these CLL-related gamma and alpha transcripts are much more plentiful than those of normal B cells that produce the same isotype. These switched transcripts do not reveal evidence for the accumulation of significant numbers of new V(H) gene mutations. The cellular data indicate that B cells with lesser amounts of surface membrane IgD and higher IgM/IgD ratios are more likely to undergo this switching process. Furthermore, B cells expressing IgG and IgA of the same idiotype or V(H) family and the same CDR3 length as those of the CLL IgM+ clone can be identified in the blood of patients studied using multiparameter immunofluorescence analyses. Collectively, these data suggest that not all members of a B-CLL clone are frozen at the surface membrane Ig-expressing stage of B cell maturation, and that some members can switch to the production of non-IgM isotypes. The occurrence of switching without the accumulation of V gene mutations indicates that the processes of differentiation and diversification are not linked.","['Fais, F', 'Sellars, B', 'Ghiotto, F', 'Yan, X J', 'Dono, M', 'Allen, S L', 'Budman, D', 'Dittmar, K', 'Kolitz, J', 'Lichtman, S M', 'Schulman, P', 'Schuster, M', 'Vinciguerra, V P', 'Rai, K', 'Stevenson, F K', 'Gregersen, P K', 'Ferrarini, M', 'Chiorazzi, N']","['Fais F', 'Sellars B', 'Ghiotto F', 'Yan XJ', 'Dono M', 'Allen SL', 'Budman D', 'Dittmar K', 'Kolitz J', 'Lichtman SM', 'Schulman P', 'Schuster M', 'Vinciguerra VP', 'Rai K', 'Stevenson FK', 'Gregersen PK', 'Ferrarini M', 'Chiorazzi N']","['Department of Medicine, North Shore University Hospital and Cornell University Medical College, Manhasset, New York 11030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fragments)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Isotypes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Immunoglobulin alpha-Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin gamma-Chains)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Membrane/immunology', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunoglobulin Class Switching', 'Immunoglobulin Fragments/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Isotypes/biosynthesis', 'Immunoglobulin M/*biosynthesis', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin alpha-Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin gamma-Chains/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Genetic', 'Models, Immunological', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phenotype', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI118961 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1996 Oct 1;98(7):1659-66. doi: 10.1172/JCI118961.,['AI 10811/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,PMC507600,,,,,,,

Hematologic screening data were available for 657 of 1,037 (63.3%) individuals employed at the plant from 1939 through 1976. There was a total of 21. 710 blood test records (range per individual 1-354). The study utilized a case-control design and estimated benzene exposures using the job exposure matrix developed by Rinsky et al. (1987): NEJM 316:1044-1050]. The effects of benzene exposure in the 30, 90, and 180 days before the blood test date, as well as cumulative exposure up until the blood test date, were examined using conditional logistic regression. For WBCs there was a strong exposure response and all of the exposure metrics selected showed a significant relationship with low blood count. For RBCs there was a weak positive exposure-response, which was significant (p = 0.03) for one of the dose metrics. The finding of an exposure-response relationship in the range of exposures represented in this study, where the maximum daily benzene exposure estimate was 34 ppm, is consistent with findings of several animal studies demonstrating a decrease in peripheral lymphocyte counts at benzene exposures as low as 10 ppm, and a stronger effect of benzene exposure on lymphocytes (as reflected in total WBC count) than on red cells. There was no evidence for a threshold for the hematologic effects of benzene exposure, suggesting that even exposure to relatively low levels of benzene (e.g., <5 ppm) may result in hematologic suppression.","['Ward, E', 'Hornung, R', 'Morris, J', 'Rinsky, R', 'Wild, D', 'Halperin, W', 'Guthrie, W']","['Ward E', 'Hornung R', 'Morris J', 'Rinsky R', 'Wild D', 'Halperin W', 'Guthrie W']","['National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Division of Surveillance, Hazard Evaluations and Field Studies, Cincinnati, OH 45226, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Ind Med,American journal of industrial medicine,8101110,"['9006-04-6 (Rubber)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Benzene/*adverse effects', 'Case-Control Studies', '*Chemical Industry', 'Cohort Studies', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Environmental Monitoring/*methods', 'Erythrocyte Count/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Hematologic Diseases/blood/*chemically induced/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Count/*drug effects', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Mass Screening/methods', 'Occupational Diseases/prevention & control', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Reference Values', 'Risk Factors', 'Rubber']",1996/03/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0274(199603)29:3<247::AID-AJIM4>3.0.CO;2-N [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1097-0274(199603)29:3<247::AID-AJIM4>3.0.CO;2-N [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Ind Med. 1996 Mar;29(3):247-57. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0274(199603)29:3<247::AID-AJIM4>3.0.CO;2-N.,,,,['Am J Ind Med. 1996 Mar;29(3):225-6.

Dex is known to cause apoptosis of lymphoid cells in general and of sensitive human lymphoid CEM cell clones in particular. This study finds that Dex induces c-jun mRNA and cJun protein in cells of the sensitive clone CEM-C7 and of the lysis-sensitive OEM hybrid clone H10. CEM-O7 cells were screened for several other Jun/Fos family proteins. Both cFos and JunD were expressed but were unaffected by the steroid, and JunB was not detected. In the continual presence of Dex the induction of cJun began about 6 h after addition of Dex, reached a maximum by 24 h, and plateaued for 72 h, while cell death did not begin until 24-48 h. In clone OEM-Cl cells, which contain glucocorticoid receptor (GR) but are resistant to lysis by Dex, the basal, and even the fully induced, cJun levels are below the basal levels in OEM-07 and H10 cells. To test the hypothesis that cJun plays an important role in steroid-evoked apoptosis, stable transfectants expressing Dex-regulable antisense c-jun RNA were established. Mass cultures of these cells showed reduced sensitivity to Dex, and in three of three clones tested, complete resistance to Dex was obtained. This occurred even though endogenous genes (GR, c-jun) normally responsive to Dex were still inducible, indicating that the GR and basic glucocorticoid response apparatus were intact. It is concluded that Dex induces cJun levels in sensitive OEM cells before cell death and that this induction plays a role in the apoptotic process.","['Zhou, F', 'Thompson, E B']","['Zhou F', 'Thompson EB']","['Department of Human Biological Chemistry and Genetics, The University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Endocrinol,"Molecular endocrinology (Baltimore, Md.)",8801431,"['0 (DNA, Antisense)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'DNA, Antisense/genetics', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Genes, fos', '*Genes, jun', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos/biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/*biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/*metabolism', 'Transfection']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/mend.10.3.8833659 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Endocrinol. 1996 Mar;10(3):306-16. doi: 10.1210/mend.10.3.8833659.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A weak, nonsignificant association was present between AML, acute lymphocytic leukemia, RAEB, and antibody to HCV. These preliminary results suggest a possible association (elevated odds ratios) between hepatitis B virus, AML, RAEB, and CML. However, because all confidence intervals overlapped the null value, these findings need to be confirmed in larger case-control studies.","['Gentile, G', 'Mele, A', 'Monarco, B', 'Vitale, A', 'Pulsoni, A', 'Visani, G', 'Castelli, G', 'Rapicetta, M', 'Verani, P', 'Martino, P', 'Mandelli, F']","['Gentile G', 'Mele A', 'Monarco B', 'Vitale A', 'Pulsoni A', 'Visani G', 'Castelli G', 'Rapicetta M', 'Verani P', 'Martino P', 'Mandelli F']","['Cattedra di Ematologia, Universita di Roma, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,"['0 (HTLV-I Antibodies)', '0 (HTLV-II Antibodies)', '0 (Hepatitis B Antibodies)', '0 (Hepatitis B Core Antigens)', '0 (Hepatitis B Surface Antigens)', '0 (Hepatitis C Antibodies)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/virology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Antibodies/*analysis', 'HTLV-II Antibodies/*analysis', 'Hepatitis B Antibodies/*analysis', 'Hepatitis B Core Antigens/analysis', 'Hepatitis B Surface Antigens/analysis', 'Hepatitis C Antibodies/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*virology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/virology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Odds Ratio', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/virology', 'Risk Factors']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 1996 Mar;5(3):227-30.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since this finding suggested that ND2 gene expression was related to myeloid differentiation, we here investigated the effects of rotenone, a specific NADH dehydrogenase inhibitor, on HL-60 cell growth, differentiation and death. Fifty nM rotenone inhibited the growth of HL-60 cells and caused an increase in the cell population in the G(2) +M phase. In the quantitative comparison of myeloid antigen, the expression of CD13 and CD38 were relatively increased in the rotenone-treated cells. These findings suggest that the inhibition of NADH dehydrogenase changes the cell cycle and induces some specific surface antigens of HL-60 cells. On the other hand, the expression of ND2 gene remained unchanged after the rotenone treatment, suggesting the rotenone-mediated mitochondrial inhibition did not affect the mitochondrial gene expression. Five mu M rotenone strongly inhibited the cellular proliferation. Electron microscopy and an electrophoretic analysis of DNA showed that the majority of the HL-60 cells were induced into typical apoptosis within 24-48 hours. On the basis of this and other studies, we believe that mitochondrial function is directly involved in both cellular differentiation and apoptotic cell death.","['Matsunaga, T', 'Kudo, J', 'Takahashi, K', 'Dohmen, K', 'Hayashida, K', 'Okamura, S', 'Ishibashi, H', 'Niho, Y']","['Matsunaga T', 'Kudo J', 'Takahashi K', 'Dohmen K', 'Hayashida K', 'Okamura S', 'Ishibashi H', 'Niho Y']","['The First Department of Internal Medicine, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '03L9OT429T (Rotenone)', 'EC 1.6.99.3 (NADH Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 3.2.2.- (N-Glycosyl Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)', 'EC 3.4.11.2 (CD13 Antigens)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', '*Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'CD13 Antigens/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'G2 Phase/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells/*drug effects/enzymology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/enzymology', 'N-Glycosyl Hydrolases/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'NADH Dehydrogenase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Rotenone/*pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199609052434 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1996 Feb;20(5-6):487-94. doi: 10.3109/10428199609052434.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Given that MPO is a lysosomal enzyme that can be released into the circulation by both normal activated and leukemic myeloid cells, we investigated the possibility that sera from patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) might exhibit an increased capacity to degrade VCR. 31 serum samples (23 from patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia and 8 from patients with other conditions) were analyzed after incubation with ((3)H)VCR by using HPLC. Sera from patients with AML demonstrated an increased ability to breakdown VCR when compared to either normal sera or to sera from patients with lymphoid leukemias. VCR degradation was significantly increased by adding hydrogen peroxide, an electron donor for MPO, to the sera and was almost completely inhibited by adding 1 mM acetaminophen, an inhibitor of MPO. VCR peroxidation in the presence of hydrogen peroxide correlated both with the number of leukemic blasts in the circulation at the time the sera were obtained and with serum MPO concentrations determined by an immunoassay. These data suggest that the inactivity of VCR in AML may be due in part to its rapid peroxidation to inactive species by the MPO of leukemic myeloblasts.","['Schlaifer, D', 'Duchayne, E', 'Demur, C', 'Alvinerie, P', 'Muller, C', 'Attal, M', 'Cooper, M R', 'Payen, C', 'Monsarrat, B', 'Myers, C E', 'Pris, J', 'Laurent, G']","['Schlaifer D', 'Duchayne E', 'Demur C', 'Alvinerie P', 'Muller C', 'Attal M', 'Cooper MR', 'Payen C', 'Monsarrat B', 'Myers CE', 'Pris J', 'Laurent G']","[""Service d'Hematologie, Clinique Dieulafoy, Hopital de Purpan, Toulouse, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '362O9ITL9D (Acetaminophen)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)']",IM,"['Acetaminophen/pharmacology', 'Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'Inactivation, Metabolic', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/*enzymology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*blood', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/enzymology', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Peroxidase/antagonists & inhibitors/*blood', 'Vincristine/*pharmacokinetics']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199609052426 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1996 Feb;20(5-6):441-6. doi: 10.3109/10428199609052426.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thrombotic complications were noted in 3 of 31 patients during induction. Two died from thrombotic events during therapy with multiple thromboses documented at autopsy. ATRA syndrome was suspected in 2 of the patients with thromboses and only 1 of the patients without thrombosis. In previous studies, 1 of 25 APL patients treated with chemotherapy alone had thrombotic events during therapy. In conclusion, treatment of APL with ATRA may decrease the incidence of hemorrhagic complications, but does not eliminate thrombosis. While thrombotic events were not significantly increased in patients treated with ATRA, they were more common in patients suspected of having ATRA syndrome.","['Escudier, S M', 'Kantarjian, H M', 'Estey, E H']","['Escudier SM', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Estey EH']","['Department of Hematology, Leukemia Section, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Amsacrine/administration & dosage', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cerebral Hemorrhage/etiology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation/etiology/prevention & control', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Germinoma', 'Hemorrhage/epidemiology/etiology/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/*therapeutic use', 'Incidence', 'Infarction/etiology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*complications/drug therapy', 'Leukocytosis/chemically induced', 'Male', 'Melanoma', 'Middle Aged', 'Myocardial Infarction/etiology', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/complications/drug therapy/therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Spleen/blood supply', 'Thrombosis/epidemiology/*etiology/prevention & control', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/adverse effects/*therapeutic use']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199609052425 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1996 Feb;20(5-6):435-9. doi: 10.3109/10428199609052425.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Herbimycin A markedly reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of p34cdc2 in irradiated leukemic B-cell precursors, thereby preventing radiation-induced cell cycle arrest at the G2-M transition checkpoint. Thus, tyrosine phosphorylation is directly responsible for the inactivation of p34cdc2 in irradiated human leukemic B-cell precursors and activation of protein tyrosine kinases is a proximal and mandatory step in radiation-induced G2-arrest arrest at the G2-M checkpoint. Human WEE1 kinase isolated from unirradiated or irradiated leukemic B-cell precursors had minimal tyrosine kinase activity towards p34cdc2. We detected no increase of human WEE1 kinase activity after radiation of leukemic B-cell precursors, as measured by (a) autophosphorylation, (b) tyrosine phosphorylation of a synthetic peptide derived from the p34cdc2 amino-terminal region or (c) recombinant human p34cdc2-cyclin B complex. Thus the signaling pathway leading to inhibitory tyrosine phosphorylation of p34cdc2 and G2-arrest in irradiated human leukemic B-cell precursors functions independent of p49 WEE1 HU and enzymes which augment the tyrosine kinase activity of p49 WEE 1HU.","['Tuel-Ahlgren, L', 'Jun, X', 'Waddick, K G', 'Jin, J', 'Bolen, J', 'Uckun, F M']","['Tuel-Ahlgren L', 'Jun X', 'Waddick KG', 'Jin J', 'Bolen J', 'Uckun FM']","['Department of Therapeutic Radiology-Radiation Oncology, University of Minnesota Health Sciences Center, Minneapolis, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Quinones)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '1W306TDA6S (Rifabutin)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '70563-58-5 (herbimycin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (WEE1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2 Protein Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Maturation-Promoting Factor)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology/*radiation effects', 'Benzoquinones', 'CDC2 Protein Kinase/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Enzyme Activation/radiation effects', 'G2 Phase/*radiation effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology/*radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Maturation-Promoting Factor/physiology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology/*radiation effects', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Peptide Fragments/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/radiation effects', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/enzymology/*pathology', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/*radiation effects', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/physiology', 'Quinones/pharmacology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Rifabutin/analogs & derivatives', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199609052423 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1996 Feb;20(5-6):417-26. doi: 10.3109/10428199609052423.,['R01-CA-42633/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although expression of the Mr 170,000 P-glycoprotein drug pump is likely to play a role in multidrug resistance (MDR) in haematological malignancies, it is now evident that other MDR mechanisms may be operational as well in leukaemias, lymphomas, and multiple myeloma. We determined the expression of a newly recognised drug resistance gene, the Multidrug Resistance-associated Protein (MRP) gene, in peripheral blood cells from healthy volunteers and from patients with haematological malignancies. Expression of MRP mRNA and its Mr 190,000 glycoprotein were estimated by RNase protection assay and immunocytochemistry, respectively. MRP appeared to be ubiquitously expressed at low levels in all nonmalignant haemopoietic cell types. However, some leukaemias showed elevated levels of MRP, probably due to transcriptional activation or increased mRNA stability. High to very high MRP expression levels were frequently found in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and prolymphocytic leukaemia. Acute myelocytic leukemia often exhibited low but occasionally high MRP expression levels, while in the other acute and chronic leukaemias, lymphomas, and multiple myeloma, predominantly low, basal levels of MRP were found. We conclude that hyperexpression of MRP is observed in leukaemias, and that further studies are needed to assess the clinical relevance of MRP.","['Nooter, K', 'Burger, H', 'Stoter, G']","['Nooter K', 'Burger H', 'Stoter G']","['Department of Medical Oncology, University Hospital Rotterdam and Rotterdam Cancer Institute, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/biosynthesis/genetics', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199609052419 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1996 Feb;20(5-6):381-7. doi: 10.3109/10428199609052419.,,34,,,,,,,,,,,,

Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) associated with the inversion chromosome 16: inv(16)(p13q22) has a favourable prognosis and is known to be chemosensitive. The inversion chromosome is seen in a number of FAB subclasses but is most commonly associated with acute myelomonocytic leukaemia with abnormal eosinophils, M4Eo. It results in the creation of a fusion between the myosin heavy chain gene (MYH11) on the short arm and the gene for a transcription factor, core binding factor beta (CBFB) on the long arm. In a subset of these inv(16) AML patients, inversion also results in loss of the gene for the multidrug resistance protein (MRP) at the short arm breakpoint. This gene maps to 16p13.13, centromeric to the primary short arm breakpoint, separated from MYH11 by a distance of approximately 150kb. Deletion of the MRP gene has been demonstrated by in situ hybridisation, gene dosage studies and by loss of heterozygosity of a flanking microsatellite marker (D16S405). Twenty two patients with inv(16) leukaemia were analysed for deletion of the MRP gene. Deletion of the gene was detected in seven patients, fourteen patients showed retention of the gene and in one case the findings were indeterminate. Clinical data from 13 of these patients were analysed revealing deletion of the MRP gene to be significantly associated with longer time from diagnosis until failure (death or relapse from complete remission) in these patients (p = 0.007). From this work and the growing literature concerning MRP, it appears likely that the deletion of an MRP allele, may favourably affect the biology of inv(16) AML and may have important prognostic implications.","['Kuss, B J', 'Deeley, R G', 'Cole, S P', 'Willman, C L', 'Kopecky, K J', 'Wolman, S R', 'Eyre, H J', 'Callen, D F']","['Kuss BJ', 'Deeley RG', 'Cole SP', 'Willman CL', 'Kopecky KJ', 'Wolman SR', 'Eyre HJ', 'Callen DF']","['Centre for Medical Genetics, Dept of Cytogentics & Molecular Genetics, Womens & Childrens Hospital, North Adelaide, South Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (CBFbeta-MYH11 fusion protein)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)']",IM,"['ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*genetics/physiology', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', '*Chromosome Inversion', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16/genetics/*ultrastructure', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Eosinophils/pathology', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*deficiency/genetics/physiology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199609052416 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1996 Feb;20(5-6):357-64. doi: 10.3109/10428199609052416.,,34,,,,,,,,,,,,

The elution fraction resulting from cell lysis before the application of the alkaline elution buffer provides an estimate of DNA DSBs, while the fraction eluted by the alkaline buffer (pH 12.3) measures the extent of DNA SSBs. Data show that, in addition to its good detection sensitivity for SSBs, this method provides a sensitive measure of DNA DSBs. As an illustration of its specificity, this method unambiguously distinguished DNA SSBs induced by X-irradiation of mouse leukemia L1210 cells from DNA DSBs occurring in cells undergoing nucleosomal DNA fragmentation and apoptosis. The neutral elution fraction is a good predictor of loss of cell viability induced either by selenite at pharmacological levels or by growth factor depletion.

Each of these analogs (pI.MPC) contained a partially thiolated polycytidylate (MPC) strand containing either 1.2%, 4.6%, or 17% 5-mercaptocytosine (%SH) randomly introduced throughout the polynucleotide. The ability of these double stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) to activate murine peritoneal macrophages in vitro and augment natural killer (NK) cell activity in mice following intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration was determined. Macrophages were treated in vitro for 24 hours with pI.pC, or pI.MPC, washed, and then overlayed with exponentially growing L1210 leukemia cells at an effector to target (E:T) ratio of 25:1. The cytostatic effect of the macrophages on the L1210 cells was determined by 3H.thymidine pulse labelling. The rank order of potency for macrophage activation was determined to be: pI.pC>pI.MPC(1.2% SH)>pI.MPC(4.6% SH)pI.MPC(17% SH). Twenty hours following i.p. administration of 5 mg/kg of each pI.MPC analog, splenic NK cell activity was assessed in a standard 51Cr release assay using the murine tumor target cell line YAC- 1. The rank order of potency observed for NK cell activation was determined to be; pI.pCpI MPC(1.2% SH)>pI.MPC(4.6% SH)>pI.MPC(17% SH). These dsRNAs activated NK cells in a dose dependent manner. The efficacy and time course for NK cell activation following i.p. administration of pI.MPC (1.2% SH) at a dose of 10 mg/kg was directly compared to an equivalent 10 mg/kg i.p. dose of pI.pC. NK cell activation took place within three hours following treatment with pI-pC whereas the onset of NK cell activation by pI.MPC (1.2%) occurred between 8 and 20 hours post treatment. NK cell activity steadily declined from 24 to 50 hours post treatment at which time the NK activity in both treatment groups was similar. There was a significant correlation between the immunostimulatory potency of these dsRNAs and their experimentally determined melting temperatures (r2 = 0.88) and percent hyperchromicity upon thermal denaturation (r2 = 0.99).

The earlier study investigated refinery workers employed for a minimum of 1 year between 1 January 1946 and 1 January 1979. The vital status of these workers was ascertained through 1979. The update extended enrollment in the study and vital status follow-up for an additional 8 years (1980-1987). As in the previous study, mortality from all causes [standardized mortality ratio (SMR) = 87; 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 83-91] was significantly lower than expected compared with the general population. Total cancer mortality was also lower than expected (SMR = 96; 95% CI: 86-106). A borderline significant mortality increase in prostatic cancer was found (SMR = 144; 95% CI: 106-190). This increase was similar to the nonsignificant increase reported in the original study (SMR = 135; 95% CI: 90-196). The excess was of comparable magnitude among white males and nonwhite males, although it was not significant for the latter. Detailed analysis indicated that the prostatic cancer was not likely to be related to employment at the refinery. Mortality from lymphatic and hematopoietic cancers was similar to the expected mortality. Mortality from overall leukemia was as expected and detailed analyses by specific cell type showed no increase. An increase in mortality occurred from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma among male workers (SMR = 132; 95% CI: 74-217). The increase was not statistically significant and unlikely to be associated with refinery employment. Mortality from multiple myeloma among male employees was lower than expected (SMR = 74; 95% CI: 20-190). Mortality from asbestos-related diseases (pulmonary fibrosis, lung cancer, malignant mesothelioma) was also lower than expected among male workers. No cause-specific mortality was found to be associated with duration of employment at the refinery, including several causes which have been reported to be elevated in previous studies. The findings of this updated study indicate, as in the previous report, the generally favorable mortality experience of Paulsboro refinery workers.","['Collingwood, K W', 'Raabe, G K', 'Wong, O']","['Collingwood KW', 'Raabe GK', 'Wong O']","['Mobil Oil Corporation, Medical Department, Princeton, NJ 08543-1038, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Int Arch Occup Environ Health,International archives of occupational and environmental health,7512134,['0 (Petroleum)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Chemical Industry', 'Cohort Studies', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Occupational Diseases/etiology/*mortality/pathology', 'Petroleum/*adverse effects', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'United States']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00409412 [doi]'],ppublish,Int Arch Occup Environ Health. 1996;68(5):277-88. doi: 10.1007/BF00409412.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Possible recovery of irradiation-induced growth hormone insufficiency.",163-70,"The aim of the present study was to assess growth, final height, growth hormone (GH) secretion and growth factors after BMT including TBI in childhood. The median age of the 25 participants was 11.3 years at BMT, and a median of 7.5 years had elapsed since BMT. The median height standard deviation score (SDS) declined significantly from diagnosis until 4 years after BMT (n = 25, P = 0.015), and decreased 1.08 SDS from diagnosis until final height (n = 14, P = 0.030). Sitting height to standing height ratio was impaired, -0.64 SDS, P < 0.05. GH insufficiency was found in 32% at follow-up. Repeated assessments of GH production over the years indicated improvement in GH secretion in nine individuals. Evaluation of spontaneous 24-h GH secretion indicated a secretory pattern similar to controls, although the total amount of GH secreted was lower. Neither insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) nor IGF binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) alone could be used as a marker of GH insufficiency. IGF-1 was low: -1.18 SDS; (P < 0.001). In conclusion, our study demonstrated the impact on growth, final height, body proportions, GH secretion and growth factors after BMT including TBI. We hypothesize that children who receive BMT at a younger age are more at risk of loss of final height and abnormal body proportions. Our data indicate that some improvement in GH production may occur over the years.","['Holm, K', 'Nysom, K', 'Rasmussen, M H', 'Hertz, H', 'Jacobsen, N', 'Skakkebaek, N E', 'Krabbe, S', 'Muller, J']","['Holm K', 'Nysom K', 'Rasmussen MH', 'Hertz H', 'Jacobsen N', 'Skakkebaek NE', 'Krabbe S', 'Muller J']","['Department of Growth and Reproduction, Rigshospitalet, State University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3)', '12629-01-5 (Human Growth Hormone)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Anthropometry', 'Body Height/drug effects/radiation effects', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dwarfism, Pituitary/drug therapy/etiology/physiopathology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/complications', 'Growth Disorders/*etiology/physiopathology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/complications/therapy', 'Human Growth Hormone/*deficiency/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/adverse effects', 'Infant', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3/blood', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/metabolism', 'Male', 'Pituitary Gland, Anterior/metabolism/*radiation effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*therapy', 'Radiation Injuries/*etiology/physiopathology', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*adverse effects', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/*adverse effects']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1996 Jul;18(1):163-70.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On multivariate analysis, diagnosis other than acute leukemia, conditioning regimen other than cyclophosphamide-TBI, cyclosporine-methotrexate GVHD prophylaxis, and occurrence of acute GVHD increased platelet requirements significantly in the first month. Diagnosis other than acute leukemia, donor-recipient ABO incompatibility, conditioning regimen other than cyclophosphamide-TBI, and age over 18 years increased red cell requirements significantly in the first month. Platelet requirements in the second month and red cell requirements in the second and third months were increased significantly by the occurrence of acute GVHD, a diagnosis other than acute leukemia, and a conditioning regimen other than cyclophosphamide-TBI. Platelet requirements in the third month were influenced only by acute GVHD. We conclude that ABO incompatibility does not influence platelet requirements after allogeneic BMT.

A study of the European Cooperative Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT).,111-7,"We analyzed retrospectively data from 1696 patients with AML transplanted in Europe from January 1987 to December 1992 and reported to the acute leukemia EBMT registry. Groups of patients were analyzed according to age (adults and children) and status at transplant (first remission = CR1; second remission = CR2). (1) 1114 adult patients were transplanted in CR1; 516 received an allograft; 598 received an autograft. Following alloBMT, the transplant-related mortality (TRM) was significantly higher (27 vs 13%, P < 10(-4)), the relapse incidence (RI) lower (25 vs 52%, P < 10(-4)) and the leukemia-free survival (LFS) better (55 vs 42%, P = 0.006). Favorable prognostic factors for alloBMT were a FAB type other than M4-M5, a donor-recipient combination excluding a female donor to a male recipient, and a younger age. Favorable prognostic factors for ABMT were a younger age of the patients at time of transplant, the AML3 FAB type, and a longer interval from CR1 to ABMT. (2) 288 adult patients were transplanted in CR2: 98 received an allograft; 190 received an autograft. The TRM was higher following allogeneic BMT (32 vs 20%, P = 0.02) and the RI lower (42 vs 63%, P = 0.001). The LFS was not significantly different (alloBMT: 39%; ABMT: 30%, P = 0.22). (3) 242 children were transplanted in CR1; 129 received an allograft; 113 received an autograft. Following alloBMT, the RI was lower (25 + 5 vs 48 + 6%, P < 10(-4)), and the LFS better (68 vs 47%, P = 0.002). The use of TBI was a favorable prognostic factor in allografted patients with a lower RI and a better LFS. (4) The number of children transplanted in CR2 was too small for a comparative analysis. These results confirm that both allogeneic and autologous BMT are suitable curative approaches for AML. They favor the use of an HLA identical related allogeneic transplant when available, especially in younger patients, over ABMT with unpurged marrow.

Treatment with at least two cycles of chemotherapy and a standard conditioning regimen of busulfan and cyclophosphamide preceded the marrow infusion. Twelve patients who underwent transplants between 1992 and 1994 received 5.5 micrograms/kg/day rhGM-CSF as part of their transplant protocol. They were compared with 10 patients who underwent transplants between 1989 and 1991 but did not receive rhGM-CSF. Despite containing a significantly higher proportion of patients in first clinical remission at the time of the transplant, the rhGM-CSF-treated group had a significantly higher relapse and poorer overall survival rate after ABMT than the untreated group (36 vs 90%). The rhGM-CSF-treated group tended to have more rapid neutrophil engraftment and shorter hospital stays; however, neither of these trends was statistically significant. To properly determine the role of rhGM-CSF in the survival of pediatric patients undergoing ABMT for treatment of AML, a prospective randomized trial is desirable.

Nonetheless, anti-host CTLs can be observed in the peripheral blood of patients both with and without clinical signs of GVHD following HLA genotypically identical bone marrow transplantation. Thus we questioned whether a qualitative difference, such as a differential in vitro sensitivity to cyclosporin A (CsA), may exist between the anti-host CTLs, generated from these groups of patients post-bone marrow transplantation (BMT). We analyzed anti-host CTL precursors (CTLp) of patients without clinical signs of GVHD, of patients suffering from acute GVHD (grade II-IV) and of patients suffering from acute GVHD followed by chronic GVHD for their in vitro sensitivity to the inhibitory effects of CsA. The results obtained in a total of 20 patients revealed anti-host CTLp frequencies (CTLpf) post-BMT in all three groups of patients and addition of CsA in the tests resulted in approximately 60% inhibition of the CTLpf independent of the GVHD status of the patients. Thus, in view of the in vitro CsA sensitivity, no difference exists between the anti-host CTLs in patients with or without GVHD.","['Liem, L M', 'van Noort, J T', 'Goulmy, E']","['Liem LM', 'van Noort JT', 'Goulmy E']","['Department of Immunohematology and Blood Bank, Leiden University Hospital, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/immunology/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/*immunology', 'Cyclosporine/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Drug Resistance', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/drug therapy/immunology/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*drug effects/immunology']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1996 Jul;18(1):73-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate ways of improving this approach,we have compared the ability of two other immunomodulating cytokines, IL-7 and IL-12, either alone or in combination with IL-2, to stimulate human bone marrow cells (BMC) or peripheral blood cells (PBC) to acquire the potential to lyse K562 or Daudi cells. For these studies, we measured the cytotoxic activity of BMC or PBC both before and at the end of their incubation with various cytokine(s) using a standard 51-chromium release assay. Results suggest that IL-2 at optimal concentration induces cytotoxicity significantly higher than IL-7 or IL-12 when tested alone. At optimal concentration, the combination of IL-2 and IL-12 showed a synergistic effect for BMC. Such a synergistic effect could be observed for PBC only when suboptimal concentrations of IL-2 were used. In addition, the ability of the hematopoietic cells to reduce the number of K562 cells remaining at the end of various culture periods in the presence of the cytokines was measured. This was made possible by the use of a G418-resistant K562 cell line which could, in contrast to normal human BMC or PBC, form colonies that wer detectable after 1 week in methylcellulose cultures containing the neomycin analog G418. Normal human PBC, stimulated by either IL-7 or IL-12 alone effectively suppressed K562 proliferation in both of these assays, whereas no activity could be detected when BMC were incubated under the same conditions. On the other hand, cells from both sources displayed anti-leukemic activity when incubated with IL-2 and IL-12 together, although IL-2/IL-12-activated PBC suppressed the growth of co-cultivated K562-neor cells about eight-fold more efficiently than IL-2/IL-12-activated BMC. Cryopreservation and subsequent stimulation of BMC and PBC with cytokines did not cause a significant decrease in cytotoxicity or their ability to inhibit the growth of co-cultivated K562 cells compared to fresh cells. However, the synergistic effect observed with the combination of IL-2/IL-12 was no longer detectable for BMC. These results suggest that (1) PBC are superior to BMC with respect to developing effective natural killer (NK) activity after culture in cytokines and that, (2) the combination of IL-2 and IL-12 may be more effective than IL-2 alone to inhibit proliferation/growth of K562 cells.","['Wong, E K', 'Eaves, C', 'Klingemann, H G']","['Wong EK', 'Eaves C', 'Klingemann HG']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, Vancouver, BC, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-7)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)']",IM,"['Blood Cells/*drug effects', 'Blood Preservation', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cryopreservation', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-12/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-7/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*drug effects', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1996 Jul;18(1):63-71.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PBSC were collected during recovery from consolidation chemotherapy in AML patients and after cyclophosphamide or cytokine administration in the other patient groups. Mononuclear cell numbers collected were similar but CFU-GM numbers were greater from the AML patients. A significant secondary fall occurred only in the platelet count and only in AML patients. Long-term recovery of the platelet count was the same in AML as in the other patients. In AML patients, the fall was the same in the long term remitters as in those who eventually relapsed. Previous studies have not, demonstrated a difference in type of precursors mobilized by differing methods, but have not included AML patients.

Evidence for a post-transcriptional mechanism.,1065-72,"Tumor-promoting phorbol esters such as phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) are reported to induce megakaryocyte terminal differentiation of the erythroleukemia cell line K562. This differentiation is accompanied by the regulation of various gene products such as gamma-globin (Lumelsky and Forget, Mol Cell Biol 11: 3528-3536, 1991) and platelet-derived growth factor-beta (PDGF-beta) (Makela et al., Mol Cell Biol 7: 3656-3662, 1987). PMA has also been found to regulate topoisomerase (topo) II alpha in other myeloid leukemia lines. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether PMA regulates topo II alpha in K562 cells and, if so, to identify the mechanisms responsible for this regulation. Northern blot analysis revealed that topo II alpha mRNA is down-regulated as is gamma-globin. This activity was not due to a generalized decrease in mRNA, as PDGF-beta message actually increased in response to PMA treatment. RNase protection assays confirmed the decline in the topo II alpha message. Transfection experiments with various topo II promoter CAT constructs extending to 2200 bp upstream of the ATG start site revealed regions that enhance and regions that inhibit CAT expression in the absence of PMA However, PMA did not affect this CAT expression. Run-on experiments using 5' and 3' human topo II cDNA probes confirmed that transcriptional initiation of the topo II gene was not affected by PMA, whereas that of c-myc did decrease. Therefore, the apparent decrease in topo II alpha mRNA in K562 cells upon their treatment with PMA appeared to be the result of a post-transcriptional mechanism.","['Loflin, P T', 'Altschuler, E', 'Hochhauser, D', 'Hickson, I D', 'Zwelling, L A']","['Loflin PT', 'Altschuler E', 'Hochhauser D', 'Hickson ID', 'Zwelling LA']","['Department of Clinical Investigation, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cats', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I/*drug effects', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Down-Regulation/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Phorbol Esters/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/10/11 00:00,1996/10/11 00:01,['1996/10/11 00:00'],"['1996/10/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/11 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/11 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(96)00446-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(96)00446-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1996 Oct 11;52(7):1065-72. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(96)00446-7.,['R01CA40090/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have evaluated the role of CD45, the major PTP of hematopoietic cells, in apoptosis induced by extracellular ATP (ATPe) and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). We observed that two CD45- clones obtained by mutagenesis of the Fas- cell line L1210, exhibit a higher susceptibility to apoptosis induced by ATPe, which was also evident in Ca(2+)-free conditions, when compared to the parental cell line or CD45+ variants. The CD45- cells were also more susceptible to death mediated by an alloreactive CTL clone. When the cytotoxic assay was performed in the presence of EGTA, a Ca2+ chelator, which prevents cytotoxic granule exocytosis and perforin polymerization on target cell membranes, only the CD45- target cells were killed by the CTL clone.

DNA sensitivity to denaturation, in these studies, was analyzed by exposing cells to heat or acid and using acridine orange (AO), the metachromatic fluorochrome which can differentially stain double-stranded (ds) vs single-stranded (ss) nucleic acids, as a marker of the degree of DNA denaturation. However, without prior cell treatment with heat or acid no presence of single-stranded DNA in either mitotic or interphase cells was detected by this assay. In the present experiments we demonstrate that DNA in situ in mitotic cells, without any prior treatment that can induce DNA denaturation, is sensitive to ss-specific S1 and mung bean nucleases. Incubation of permeabilized human T cell leukemic MOLT-4, promyelocytic HL-60, histiomonocytic lymphoma U937 cells, or normal PHA-stimulated lymphocytes with S1 or mung bean nucleases generated extensive DNA breakage in mitotic cells. DNA strand breaks were detected using fluorochrome-labeled triphosphonucleotides in the reaction catalyzed by exogenous terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. Under identical conditions of the cells' exposure to ss-specific nucleases, DNA breakage in interphase cells was of an order of magnitude less extensive compared to mitotic cells. The data indicate that segments of DNA in mitotic chromosomes, in contrast to interphase cells, may be in a conformation which is sensitive to ss nucleases. This may be a reflection of the differences in the torsional stress of DNA loops between interphase and mitotic chromatin. Namely, greater stress in mitotic loops may lead to formation of the hairpin-loop structures by inverted repeats; such structures are sensitive to ss nucleases. The present method of detection of such segments appears to be more sensitive than the use of AO. The identification of mitotic cells based on sensitivity of their DNA to ss nucleases provides an additional method for their quantification by flow cytometry.","['Juan, G', 'Pan, W', 'Darzynkiewicz, Z']","['Juan G', 'Pan W', 'Darzynkiewicz Z']","['Cancer Research Institute, New York Medical College, Valhalla 10595, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA, Single-Stranded)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', 'EC 3.1.30.1 (Single-Strand Specific DNA and RNA Endonucleases)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)', 'UT0S826Z60 (Uridine Triphosphate)']",IM,"['Bromodeoxyuridine', 'Chromatin/*enzymology', 'DNA Fragmentation/physiology', 'DNA, Single-Stranded/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Humans', 'Interphase/physiology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Lymphocytes/enzymology', 'Mitosis/*physiology', 'Nucleic Acid Denaturation', 'Single-Strand Specific DNA and RNA Endonucleases/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/enzymology', 'Uridine Triphosphate/metabolism']",1996/09/15 00:00,1996/09/15 00:01,['1996/09/15 00:00'],"['1996/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(96)90267-0 [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1996.0267 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1996 Sep 15;227(2):197-202. doi: 10.1006/excr.1996.0267.,['R0 28704/PHS HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We observed that a wide range of cancer cells could undergo DNA fragmentation associated with apoptosis after BFA treatment. This DNA fragmentation was induced within 15 h in HL60 leukemia cells and after 48 h in K562 leukemia and HT-29 colon carcinoma cells with BFA concentrations as low as 0.1 microM. The DNA fragmentation had the typical internucleosomal pattern in HL60 and HT-29 cells. Apoptotic cells were also detected by microscopy. BFA-induced apoptosis is p53-independent as HL60 and K562 cells are p53 null and HT-29 are p53 mutant cells. BFA could potentiate UCN-01 and staurosporine-induced DNA fragmentation in HL60 cells. Cyclin B1/Cdc2 kinase activity decreased after BFA treatment in HL60 cells, indicating that BFA-induced DNA fragmentation was independent of a cyclin B1/Cdc2 kinase upregulation pathway. Cycloheximide could not prevent BFA-induced DNA fragmentation in HL60 cells, suggesting that protein synthesis is not needed for HL60 cells to undergo apoptosis. On the contrary, cycloheximide blocked BFA-induced DNA fragmentation in HT-29 cells, indicating that apoptosis in HT-29 cells requires macromolecular synthesis. Cell-free system experiments suggested that cytosolic proteins play an important role in triggering DNA fragmentation during apoptosis induced by BFA. Our results show that transduction signaling pathways play central roles in apoptotic regulation.","['Shao, R G', 'Shimizu, T', 'Pommier, Y']","['Shao RG', 'Shimizu T', 'Pommier Y']","['DNA Topology Section, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (CCNB1 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin B)', '0 (Cyclin B1)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Cyclopentanes)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '20350-15-6 (Brefeldin A)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '7BU5H4V94A (7-hydroxystaurosporine)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['Alkaloids/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Brefeldin A', 'Camptothecin/pharmacology', 'Cell-Free System', '*Cyclin B', 'Cyclin B1', 'Cyclins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Cyclopentanes/*pharmacology', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells/chemistry/cytology/enzymology', 'HT29 Cells/chemistry/cytology/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Mutation/physiology', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Staurosporine/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics/metabolism']",1996/09/15 00:00,1996/09/15 00:01,['1996/09/15 00:00'],"['1996/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(96)90266-9 [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1996.0266 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1996 Sep 15;227(2):190-6. doi: 10.1006/excr.1996.0266.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We provide evidence that this balance between cell adhesion and cell detachment is governed by PA inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). First, we demonstrate that uPAR and PAI-1 bind to the same site in VN (i.e., the amino-terminal somatomedin B domain; SMB), and that PAI-1 competes with uPAR for binding to SMB. Domain swapping and mutagenesis studies indicate that the uPAR-binding sequence is located within the central region of the SMB domain, a region previously shown to contain the PAI-1-binding motif. Second, we show that PAI-1 dissociates bound VN from uPAR and detaches U937 cells from their VN substratum. This PAI-1 mediated release of cells from VN appears to occur independently of its ability to function as a protease inhibitor, and may help to explain why high PAI-1 levels indicate a poor prognosis for many cancers. Finally, we show that uPA can rapidly reverse this effect of PAI-1. Taken together, these results suggest a dynamic regulatory role for PAI-1 and uPA in uPAR-mediated cell adhesion and release.","['Deng, G', 'Curriden, S A', 'Wang, S', 'Rosenberg, S', 'Loskutoff, D J']","['Deng G', 'Curriden SA', 'Wang S', 'Rosenberg S', 'Loskutoff DJ']","['Department of Vascular Biology, Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (PLAUR protein, human)', '0 (Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 1)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Urokinase Plasminogen Activator)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Vitronectin)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Plasminogen Activators)']",IM,"['Amino Acids/analysis', 'Binding Sites/physiology', 'Cell Adhesion/physiology', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 1/*physiology', 'Plasminogen Activators/*physiology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Urokinase Plasminogen Activator', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/chemistry/cytology', 'Vitronectin/chemistry/metabolism']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1083/jcb.134.6.1563 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biol. 1996 Sep;134(6):1563-71. doi: 10.1083/jcb.134.6.1563.,"['HL07195-19/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL09400-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL31950/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,PMC2120994,,,,,,,

This cellular degranulation process requires sustained elevation of cytoplasmic Ca2+. In this study, we investigated the response of RBL-2H3 cells to 6-micron beads coated with IgE-specific ligands. These ligand-coated beads cause only small, transient Ca2+ responses, even though the same ligands added in soluble form cause larger, more sustained Ca2+ responses. The ligand-coated 6-micron beads also fail to stimulate significant degranulation of RBL-2H3 cells, whereas much larger ligand-coated Sepharose beads stimulate ample degranulation. Confocal fluorescence microscopy shows that the 6-micron beads (but not the Sepharose beads) are phagocytosed by RBL-2H3 cells and that, beginning with the initial stages of bead engulfment, there is exclusion of many plasma membrane components from the 6-micron bead/cell interface, including p53/56lyn and several other markers for detergent-resistant membrane domains, as well as an integrin and unliganded IgE-Fc epsilon RI. The fluorescent lipid probe DiIC16 is a marker for the membrane domains that is excluded from the cell/bead interface, whereas a structural analogue, fast DiI, which differs from DiIC16 by the presence of unsaturated acyl chains, is not substantially excluded from the interface. None of these components are excluded from the interface of RBL-2H3 cells and the large Sepharose beads. Additional confocal microscopy analysis indicates that microfilaments are involved in the exclusion of plasma membrane components from the cell/bead interface.

A case report studied with fluorescence in situ hybridization.,166-70,"Previous reports suggested a correlation between the deletion of the terminal region of the short arm of a chromosome 17 and the appearance of dysgranulopoiesis in myeloproliferative disorders. Using the dual-color fluorescence in situ hybridization technique we analyzed the bone marrow and peripheral blood cells of a Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patient showing at the onset of transformation into blastic crisis both metaphases with the i(17q) as well as granulocytes without nuclear segmentation. This phenomenon is defined as pseudo-Pelger-Huet anomaly. Using two probes, one specific for 17p and one for 17q, we determined the presence or absence of the i(17q) in both metaphase and interphase cells. Moreover, we observed that all cells with a polysegmented nucleus typical of mature granulocytes did not have i(17q) but had two normal chromosomes 17. This observation confirmed the correlation between 17p deletion and the appearance of pseudo-Pelger anomaly. This finding may also be useful from a clinical point of view: the appearance of pseudo-Pelger cells in CML indicates that 17p deletion actually occurred. This event implies a negative prognosis.","['Fugazza, G', 'Bruzzone, R', 'Puppo, L', 'Sessarego, M']","['Fugazza G', 'Bruzzone R', 'Puppo L', 'Sessarego M']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Genoa, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,,IM,"['Blast Crisis', 'Cell Nucleus/*pathology', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Granulocytes/*pathology', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pelger-Huet Anomaly/blood/*genetics/pathology', '*Philadelphia Chromosome']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S016546089600088X [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-4608(96)00088-x [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1996 Sep;90(2):166-70. doi: 10.1016/s0165-4608(96)00088-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Trisomy 12 was detected in eight of 50 patients (16%) and p53 deletion in six of 38 cases analyzed (15.8%). A statistically significant difference was observed between the incidence of trisomy 12 in patients with typical and atypical morphology (3.03% versus 41.18%). No correlation was found between this alteration and the rest of the clinical and biological parameters studied (adenopathies, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, lymphocyte count, staging, CD11c expression, and resistance to chemotherapy). The p53 deletion was correlated with the presence of hepatomegaly and splenomegaly, advanced stage of disease, and resistance to conventional chemotherapy. The application of FISH to whole blood cell nuclei, without prior manipulation or culture, showed a higher percentage of cells with trisomy 12 than when the method was used following culture. We conclude that 1) FISH is a simple and sensitive technique for the detection of numerical and structural chromosome abnormalities; 2) Its application to uncultured samples obviates the alteration of results originated by the probable growth advantage of the normal or neoplastic cell population in vitro; 3) Trisomy 12 appears to define a B-CLL subgroup of atypical morphology; and 4) The p53 deletion is correlated with advanced stage of disease and resistance to treatment.","['Cano, I', 'Martinez, J', 'Quevedo, E', 'Pinilla, J', 'Martin-Recio, A', 'Rodriguez, A', 'Castaneda, A', 'Lopez, R', 'Perez-Pino, T', 'Hernandez-Navarro, F']","['Cano I', 'Martinez J', 'Quevedo E', 'Pinilla J', 'Martin-Recio A', 'Rodriguez A', 'Castaneda A', 'Lopez R', 'Perez-Pino T', 'Hernandez-Navarro F']","['Department of Hematology and Hemotherapy, Hospital La Paz, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'COP protocol 2']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', 'Cosmids', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Deletion', '*Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Interphase', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/cytology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Reference Values', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Trisomy', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0165460896000635 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-4608(96)00063-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1996 Sep;90(2):118-24. doi: 10.1016/s0165-4608(96)00063-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A decrease in bcl-2 levels has been implicated in the induction of apoptosis during the terminal differentiation of HL60 myeloid leukaemia cells. We show here that bax protein also declined with a time course similar to the downregulation of bcl-2 following treatment of HL60 with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) or retinoic acid (RA). Decreased bcl-2 protein expression in induced cells was associated with down-regulation of its mRNA. By contrast, the decrease in bax occurred by a post-transcriptional mechanism.

Furthermore, not much is known about therapeutic strategies in such diseases. OBJECTIVE: We describe a 56-year-old male patient with a 5-year history of chronic and relapsing pruritic skin lesions as well as recurrent Staphylococcus aureus infections of the skin. RESULTS: Histologically, a lymphocytic and eosinophilic skin infiltrate was seen. Laboratory analysis revealed lymphocytosis (46.5%), eosinophilia (11.9%) as well as markedly elevated serum IgE levels (140,000 IU/ml). Immunohistology showed dermal B cells with intracytoplasmic IgE. Bone marrow biopsy showed a diffuse infiltrate of small lymphoplasmacytic lymphocytes. Over 80% of blood and bone marrow lymphocytes were CD5 +, CD19 +, CD20 +, CD23 + and CD38 +. Based on these findings, the diagnosis of B-CLL was made. The strong pruritus was resistant to antihistamines and steroids. Therefore, a trial with interferon (IFN) gamma 50 micrograms s.c. daily was started in order to suppress elevated serum IgE but failed. After 1.5 million units s.c. of IFN-alpha 2b every second day for 2 weeks, pruritus and serum IgE levels diminished markedly (48,000 IU/ml). Skin lesions, pruritus as well as skin infection and serum IgE level improved under continuing IFN-alpha 2b therapy for 2 years. CONCLUSION: In cases with suspected hyper-IgE syndrome, hematological neoplasias have to be excluded.

RESULTS: In 22 chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients and 4 multiple myeloma patients, the monthly infusion of 0.4 gr/ kg Octagam proved safe and effective in increasing IgG levels and potentially reducing the rate of serious bacterial infections. In 20 patients with ITP, infusion of 2 gr/kg of Octagam was safe and effective in increasing the platelet count and in arresting spontaneous bleeding or preventing bleeding prior to surgical procedures. In 8 patients with the antiphospholipid syndrome monthly infusions of Octagam were found to be safe. Adverse reactions following Octagam infusion were uncommon, generally mild and all were transient.

All eight cell lines had a modal chromosome number of 46; seven cell lines were XX and one was XY. Two cell lines (Cj11 and Cj62) were cultured continuously for over a year and remained undifferentiated and euploid. In the absence of fibroblast feeder layers, these cell lines differentiated to multiple cell types, even in the presence of leukemia inhibiting factor. Differentiated cells secreted bioactive CG into the culture medium and expressed alpha-CG, beta-CG, and alpha-fetoprotein mRNA, indicating trophoblast and endoderm differentiation. Bioactive CG secretion in differentiating cells was increased substantially in the presence of GnRH agonist D-Trp6-Pro9-NHEt. When grown at high densities, these cells formed embryoid bodies with a close resemblance to early postimplantation embryos, including the formation of a yolk sac, amnion, and an embryonic disc with an early primitive streak.

The most appropriate laboratory tests can then be ordered. Routine screening tests include a complete blood cell count, platelet count, and evaluation of a peripheral blood sample, a prothrombin time, and an activated partial thromboplastin time. Thrombocytopenia may result from idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, disseminated intravascular coagulation, or, less commonly, acute leukemia, aplastic anemia, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, or a particular drug that a patient is taking. Again, the patient's history, physical findings, and evaluation of a well-prepared peripheral blood smear will be helpful in determining the cause of the patient's thrombocytopenia. An isolated prolongation of the activated partial thromboplastin time may result from low levels of factors VIII, IX, or XI. A slightly prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time and a moderate decrease in factor VIII may reflect von Willebrand disease or the ""carrier"" state for hemophilia A. In women a greatly prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time and very low levels of factor VIII (< 3%) most often result from an acquired factor VIII inhibitor (autoantibody against factor VIII) or from severe (type III) von Willebrand disease. If von Willebrand disease is suspected (because of menorrhagia with or without other mucous membrane bleeding, a positive family history, and a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time), more specific laboratory tests for this disease should be done. These include assays of factor VIII, von Willebrand factor antigen, von Willebrand factor activity (measured by the ristocetin cofactor assay), and template bleeding time. In von Willebrand disease the defect is in von Willebrand factor. The affected individual may have subnormal levels of structurally and functionally normal von Willebrand factor (this is called ""classic"" or type I von Willebrand disease) or may produce von Willebrand factor that is structurally and functionally abnormal (von Willebrand disease type 2). Individuals who inherit a gene for von Willebrand disease from both parents have severe (type 3) von Willebrand disease and will have extremely low levels (< 3%) of von Willebrand factor and factor VIII and will have a very prolonged bleeding time. In most populations type I disease is the most common form, whereas type 3 is the least commonly encountered form. It should be noted that levels of von Willebrand factor can be influenced by the patient's blood type (persons who have blood type AB have 60% to 70% higher levels than do persons who have blood type O) and can be elevated during pregnancy, stress, and hyperthyroidism. The two major functions of von Willebrand factor are to serve as a ""bridge"" between platelets and injury sites in blood vessel walls and to protect circulating factor VIII from rapid proteolytic degradation. Thus, if a patient has either too little or functionally abnormal von Willebrand factor, the bleeding time will be prolonged and factor VIII will be decreased (because it is not being protected by von Willebrand factor). It should be determined which type of von Willebrand disease a particular patient has because treatment depends on type. Multimeric analysis of von Willebrand factor can be done with use of sodium dodecyl sulfate gels, radiolabeled antibody to von Willebrand's factor, and autoradiography. This will allow visualization of the multimeric structure of von Willebrand factor. In type I disease all bands are present, whereas in the type 2 variants 2A and 2B no high-molecular-weight multimers are seen. Desmopressin acetate (which is available in parenteral form for intravenous use and in a highly concentrated intranasal spray formulation) is the treatment of choice for classic type I disease.

This process involves changes in transcription of genes such as c-myc. We investigated the effects of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on nuclear protein binding to the c-myc intron element (MIE), a region of DNA within the c-myc gene. A mutation in this MIE sequence has been shown to be associated with uncontrolled expression of the c-myc gene in various cell lines. In this report, we demonstrate for the first time that 1,25-(OH)2D3 induces increased binding of nuclear proteins to this MIE in HL-60 cells. The major MIE-binding proteins were approximately 32 kDa in size. Interestingly, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate induced a similar increase in binding of the 32-kDa doublet protein to the MIE. In addition, we showed that the level of 138-kDa MIE-binding protein was increased by 1,25-(OH)2D3 and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. However, the extent of MIE binding by the 138-kDa protein is significantly less than that of the 32-kDa doublet binding species. MIE binding by the 32-kDa doublet protein was significantly increased within 12 h of 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment. The time course of this increase was similar to that of 1,25-(OH)2D3-induced inhibition of c-myc gene transcription. We also demonstrated that dephosphorylation of the 32-kDa doublet protein inhibited its binding to the MIE. Thus, this study shows that the mechanism employed by 1,25-(OH)2D3 for regulation of c-myc expression may involve an increase in protein binding to the MIE, which has been shown to be the site for control of c-myc gene expression.","['Pan, Q', 'Martell, R E', ""O'Connell, T D"", 'Simpson, R U']","['Pan Q', 'Martell RE', ""O'Connell TD"", 'Simpson RU']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor 48109-0632, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Alkaline Phosphatase/pharmacology', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Electrophoresis', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', '*Introns', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/endo.137.10.8828471 [doi]'],ppublish,Endocrinology. 1996 Oct;137(10):4154-60. doi: 10.1210/endo.137.10.8828471.,"['CA-43859/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DE-10337/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'GM-07767/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are capable of inducing either acute antiproliferative disease or, after prolonged latency, lymphoid malignancies in this animal population. Current knowledge of the recombinational events between infectious FeLV and noninfectious endogenously inherited FeLV-like elements is reviewed, and the potential role of the derived recombinant viruses in pathogenesis is discussed. Major observations made are as follows: (1) Up to three fourths of the exogenous FeLV envelope glycoprotein (SU), beginning from the N-terminal end, can be replaced by sequences from an endogenous FeLV to produce biologically active chimeric FeLVs. The in vitro replication efficiency or cell tropism of the recombinants appears to be influenced by the amount of SU sequences replaced by the endogenous partner, as well as by the locus of origin of the endogenous sequences. (2) Generation of FeLV recombinants in tissue culture cells corresponds closely to the findings from natural tumors. There is direct evidence, based on molecular genetic analysis, for the prevalence of recombinant proviruses in naturally arising FeLV-induced lymphomas. (3) Certain recombinants harboring an altered primary neutralizing epitope in the middle of SU corresponding to the endogenous FeLV sequence can evade immunity developed against common FeLV infection. In several other recombinants, the epitope sequence is found to be frequently mutated during the process of recombination. (4) FeLV variants with altered epitope, although they may not be efficient in replication in vivo, apparently are capable of causing focal infection in target organs. Evidence is also presented that when coinfected with an exogenous FeLV, the epitope sequence in the variants is reverted to the exogenous type, providing an explanation why this sequence is found to be conserved in all natural isolates of FeLV. (5) A prototype chimeric polyprotein containing most of the SU from the endogenous source is abnormally processed and becomes trapped in the endoplasmic reticulum. A functional consequence of such trapping is interference with specific FeLV infection. (6) Some recombinants, while only poorly replicating in the host, may have the ability to infect target erythroid progenitor cells for the induction of strong cytopathic effect. (7) Some other recombinants appear to potentiate lymphomagenesis by exogenous FeLV and others to acquire properties to infect CNS endothelial cells, an event that could potentially be related to FeLV-induced neuropathogenicity. (8) Of multiple recombinant viruses, a specific recombinant species was found to occur in each of the three cats examined in which lymphoma was experimentally induced, and it was exclusively seen in one of these cats. This recombinant FeLV may potentially be a candidate for strong leukemogenic function. In addition to commonly encountered virus envelope changes, another prominent viral factor involved in tumorigenesis is mutated FeLV transcription regulatory sequences, most frequently with enhancer duplication or triplication. Although only a limited amount of information is available in the area of insertional mutagenesis in FeLV neoplastic disease, activation of certain key nuclear transcription factor genes has been documented.","['Roy-Burman, P']",['Roy-Burman P'],"['Department of Pathology, University of Southern California School of Medicine, Los Angeles 90033, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Virus Genes,Virus genes,8803967,['0 (Epitopes)'],IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cats', 'Epitopes/chemistry', '*Genes, env', 'Genome, Viral', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'Lymphoma', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Recombination, Genetic']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01728655 [doi]'],ppublish,Virus Genes. 1995;11(2-3):147-61. doi: 10.1007/BF01728655.,['CA51485/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],107,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mouse NIH3T3 cells expressing these mutant RT genes were highly resistant to Mo-MuLV proliferation. The mutant RT expressed in E. coli exhibited no polymerization activity, but it retained its binding activity to the template RNA and inhibited in vitro poly(dG) synthesis occurring with the wild-type RT. These results suggest that the competition for binding of the two types of enzymes to the template is responsible for the resistance to Mo-MuLV proliferation and that the YVDD sequence of Mo-MuLV may be a good target for dominant-negative inhibition of retroviral proliferation.","['Shirasawa, Y', 'Sato, S', 'Osawa, T', 'Hirashima, A']","['Shirasawa Y', 'Sato S', 'Osawa T', 'Hirashima A']","['Yakult Central Institute for Microbiological Research, Kunitachi, Tokyo.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Biochem,Journal of biochemistry,0376600,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '24937-83-5 (Poly A)', '25191-14-4 (Poly G)', '25656-92-2 (poly(dG))', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells/metabolism/virology', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Conserved Sequence', 'DNA, Complementary/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis', 'Escherichia coli/genetics/metabolism', 'Genes, Viral/genetics', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*enzymology/genetics/physiology', 'Mutation', 'Plasmids/genetics', 'Poly A/metabolism', 'Poly G/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Viral Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Virus Replication']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a021349 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biochem. 1996 Jun;119(6):1070-5. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a021349.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The vast majority of these second primaries are SCC and occur in the upper aerodigestive tract; however, head and neck SCC patients are also at higher risk for nonepidermoid neoplasms at any site. Reticuloendothelial malignancies (REM) have been reported in many patients that have SCC of the head and neck as well. METHODS: Retrospective case series of 5 advanced cases of SCC of the head and neck with synchronous REM. RESULTS: There was 40% mortality with 19.4 months mean follow-up. Fifty percent of the case had simultaneous cervical involvement with both processes. CONCLUSION: REM can occur simultaneously with SCC of the head and neck and confound staging of nodal status. Head and neck SCC patients are at increased risk for REM secondary to age and treatment factors.","['Stack, B C Jr', 'Ridley, M B', 'Endicott, J N']","['Stack BC Jr', 'Ridley MB', 'Endicott JN']","['Division of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, University of South Florida College of Medicine, Tampa, FL 33612, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Otolaryngol,American journal of otolaryngology,8000029,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*complications/pathology/surgery', 'Cervical Vertebrae/pathology/surgery', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*complications/pathology/surgery', 'Male', 'Mandible/pathology/surgery', 'Mandibular Neoplasms/*complications/pathology/surgery', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Parotid Gland/pathology/surgery', 'Parotid Neoplasms/*complications/pathology/surgery', 'Retrospective Studies']",1996/05/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0196-0709(96)90057-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s0196-0709(96)90057-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Otolaryngol. 1996 May-Jun;17(3):178-83. doi: 10.1016/s0196-0709(96)90057-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A rapid and easily performed method, compared to the time consuming equilibrium dialysis, to obtain the free fraction is needed. The aim of this study was to evaluate ultrafiltration and subsequent high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for the determination of protein binding of etoposide. Spiked plasma from healthy, drug-free volunteers was used to compare ultrafiltration, using Amicon Centrifree filters, with equilibrium dialysis at 37 degrees C. The variability (CV) of the ultrafiltration method was 6.1 and 13.5% (n = 6) at 37 degrees C and room temperature (RT), respectively.

The chromatographic separation of metabolites from the mother compound when free etoposide is analyzed is crucial. It is shown that a hydroxy-acid metabolite of etoposide is quite dominant in a protein-free plasma fraction. The free concentrations were determined throughout a dose interval of 24 h in a patient receiving etoposide 100 mg/m2 daily.

We then studied the presence of MDR cells in lymphocytes isolated from patients with hematological malignancies.","['Canitrot, Y', 'Lahmy, S', 'Buquen, J J', 'Canitrot, D', 'Lautier, D']","['Canitrot Y', 'Lahmy S', 'Buquen JJ', 'Canitrot D', 'Lautier D']","['Laboratoire de Pharmacologie et Toxicologie Fondamentales, Toulouse, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Rhodamines)', '1N3CZ14C5O (Rhodamine 123)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', 'P976261J69 (bisbenzimide ethoxide trihydrochloride)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anthracyclines', 'Benzimidazoles', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Clone Cells', 'Daunorubicin/toxicity', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Mice', 'Phenotype', 'Quantum Theory', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Rhodamine 123', 'Rhodamines', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vinblastine/toxicity']",1996/08/23 00:00,1996/08/23 00:01,['1996/08/23 00:00'],"['1996/08/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/23 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/23 00:00 [entrez]']","['0304383596043017 [pii]', '10.1016/0304-3835(96)04301-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 1996 Aug 23;106(1):59-68. doi: 10.1016/0304-3835(96)04301-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The L0 parental cells contained a round nucleus and the microtubules were evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm. In contrast, the microtubules of the L100 and L1000 cells were localized between the lobular structures of a multilobulated nucleus. Disassembly of microtubules in L100 and L1000 cells by colchicine resulted in the loss of the multilobulated morphology of the nucleus. While the total cellular content of tubulin of L0 and L100 cells was similar, the content of microtubules of L100 cells was only 55% of that observed in L0 cells. Two, 28 kDa (pI 6.9) and 31 kDa (pI 4.4), microtubule-associated proteins were found to be overexpressed in L100 and L1000 cells. The results indicate that the multilobulated nuclear morphology of L100 and L1000 cells is dependent upon the unique and intact organization of the microtubules; the distinct organization of the microtubules and the multilobular nuclear morphology of the two resistant cell lines may be due to the differential expression of specific microtubule-associated proteins.","['Huang, J', 'Sweet, P', 'Slater, L M', 'Sartorelli, A C', 'Leung, M F']","['Huang J', 'Sweet P', 'Slater LM', 'Sartorelli AC', 'Leung MF']","['Department of Biology, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Hong Kong.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Tubulin)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle', 'Cell Nucleus/*pathology/ultrastructure', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Humans', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/analysis', 'Microtubules/*pathology/ultrastructure', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Tubulin/analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/08/23 00:00,1996/08/23 00:01,['1996/08/23 00:00'],"['1996/08/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/23 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/23 00:00 [entrez]']","['0304383596042930 [pii]', '10.1016/0304-3835(96)04293-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 1996 Aug 23;106(1):29-41. doi: 10.1016/0304-3835(96)04293-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some of the proteins produced by the body's immune system, i.e., cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) and interleukin 2 (IL-2), have been shown to modulate multidrug resistance. However, cytokines administered by the conventional intravenous method can cause severe side effects. Transduction of cytokine genes into tumor cells constitutes an alternative approach for production and release of the cytokine proteins in the local tumor microenvironment, which may reduce problems of toxicity associated with systemic administration. PURPOSE: In this study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of a combination of gene therapy and chemotherapy on the basis of cytokine-mediated modulation of multidrug resistance in human colon carcinoma cells. METHODS: Human colon carcinoma cell lines HCT15 and HCT116 were transduced with TNF or IL-2 carrying murine leukemia virus (MLV)-based retroviral vectors. Tumor cell clones were analyzed for cytokine expression by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and by cytokine-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (TNF-ELISA or IL-2-ELISA). Expression of mdr1 messenger RNA (mRNA) was investigated using RT-PCR, and P-glycoprotein (Pgp) expression was determined by immunoflow cytometry with the monoclonal antibodies MRK16 and C219. The function of Pgp was analyzed by measuring accumulation of the fluorescent drug doxorubicin by flow cytometry. The XTT-(i.e., [2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)]-5-[(phenylamino)-carbon yl-2H- tetrazolium hydroxide]-colorimetric cytotoxicity assay was used to determine chemosensitivity of cytokine gene-transfected tumor cells to doxorubicin and vincristine. Statistical significance was determined by the nonparametric Mann-Whitney rank sum test for the flow cytometry experiments (Pgp detection as well as drug uptake assays) and the parametric Student's t test for the chemosensitivity assay (XTT cytotoxicity assay). All P values reported were derived from two-sided statistical tests. RESULTS: Transduction and expression of human TNF and IL-2 in HCT15 and HCT116 human colon carcinoma cell lines were found to reverse multidrug resistance. Both TNF and IL-2 secretion reduced mdr1 expression on the mRNA and Pgp levels (P < .0243). This result was associated with enhancement of doxorubicin accumulation within the cells (P < .0001). The cytokine-mediated effects on mdr1 expression resulted in increased chemosensitivity of the transduced cells to doxorubicin and vincristine (P < .0460). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: We show that endogenous expression of cytokine genes in tumor cells and after transduction secretion of the related proteins, such as TNF and IL-2, can modulate multidrug resistance in vitro. This modulation enhances the susceptibility of the cells to the cytotoxic drugs. Our findings suggest the potential value of combined treatment of resistant tumors with gene therapy and chemotherapy.","['Stein, U', 'Walther, W', 'Shoemaker, R H']","['Stein U', 'Walther W', 'Shoemaker RH']","['Max-Delbruck-Center for Molecular Medicine, Berlin, Federal Republic of Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/biosynthesis', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Clone Cells', 'Colonic Neoplasms/drug therapy/*physiopathology/*therapy', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'RNA, Messenger', 'RNA, Neoplasm', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Vincristine/pharmacology']",1996/10/02 00:00,1996/10/02 00:01,['1996/10/02 00:00'],"['1996/10/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/02 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/02 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/88.19.1383 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1996 Oct 2;88(19):1383-92. doi: 10.1093/jnci/88.19.1383.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A report from the Childrens Cancer Group.,1718-27,"BACKGROUND: Maternal reproductive history of fetal loss previously has been reported to be associated with an increased risk of leukemia in subsequent offspring. Data from a Childrens Cancer Group (CCG) case-control study were analyzed to test the hypothesis that this association was dependent on the number of previous fetal losses and age at leukemia diagnosis. METHODS: A case-control study using a large Childrens Cancer Group database examined maternal history of fetal loss as a risk factor for childhood leukemia in subsequent offspring. One thousand seven hundred fifty-three patients with childhood acute leukemia were compared with 839 community control subjects s and 2081 nonleukemia cancer control subjects. RESULTS: A modest increase in risk was found to be associated with a history of fetal loss. Stratification by age at diagnosis of leukemia showed that this association was significant only for those patients diagnosed before 4 years of age and most significant in those patients diagnosed before 2 years of age. When comparing community controls with patients acute lymphocytic leukemia diagnosed before 2 years of age, one previous fetal loss was associated with a five-fold increased risk (P < 0.001) whereas two or more fetal losses were associated with a relative risk of 24.8 (P < 0.001). Similarly, patients with acute myelocytic leukemia diagnosed before 2 years of age demonstrated 5-fold and 12-fold increased risks associated with the previous fetal loss and 2 or more previous fetal losses, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Childhood acute leukemia occurring at younger ages may be associated with an underlying genetic abnormality or chronic environmental exposure, which can be either lethal to the developing fetus or mutagenic and result in the development of acute leukemia.","['Yeazel, M W', 'Buckley, J D', 'Woods, W G', 'Ruccione, K', 'Robison, L L']","['Yeazel MW', 'Buckley JD', 'Woods WG', 'Ruccione K', 'Robison LL']","['University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Abortion, Spontaneous/*etiology', 'Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*etiology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*etiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Risk Factors', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19950401)75:7<1718::aid-cncr2820750725>3.0.co;2-g [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1995 Apr 1;75(7):1718-27. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19950401)75:7<1718::aid-cncr2820750725>3.0.co;2-g.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The incidence of viral infections commonly occurring in children with ALL receiving chemotherapy was compared with viral infections in control children and the spread of infections in families was traced. METHODS: Fifteen families of children with ALL receiving chemotherapy (62 members) and 26 matched control families (106 members) were monitored for a total of 36,197 and 36,583 days, respectively, from November/ 1987 to December/1989 for the occurrence of infections. RESULTS: The children with ALL had more infections than their control counterparts (P < 0.01) with respiratory infections the most common in both groups. Viral etiology was verified for 47 episodes [5.2/1000 days at risk, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.9-7.0] in the children with ALL and 22 (2.4/1000 days at risk, 95% CI 1.5-3.7) in the control subjects (P < 0.01 for the difference). Parainfluenza viruses, enteroviruses, and adenoviruses were the most common agents in both groups. The infections of the other members of the patients' families were similar to those of their controls. The children most commonly fell ill first, and although children with ALL had more infections, they did not appear to spread the infections to their family members. CONCLUSIONS: The children with ALL had more infections than their controls, but they managed to recover well from viral infections caused by common respiratory viruses.

METHODS: Serum and urine beta-2M levels were measured in six children with HPS during active and convalescent phase and in other diseases. RESULTS: Serum and urine beta-2M levels during active phase HPS were significantly high not only in serum (median, 7.5 mg/l; range, 2.3-16.0 mg/l; P < 0.01), but also in urine (median, > 31,650 micrograms/gram Creatinine (gCr); range, 8179-236,333 micrograms/gCr; P < 0.01), compared with levels during convalescent phase HPS (median, 2.0 mg/l; range, 0.9-2.5 mg/l in serum and median, 338 micrograms/gCr; range, 223-585 micrograms/gCr in urine) and in control subjects with diseases such as acute lymphocytic leukemia (median, 2.3 mg/l; range, 1.0-2.8 mg/l in serum and median, 327 micrograms/gCr; range, 48-2684 micrograms/gCr in urine), infectious mononucleosis (median, 2.9 mg/l; range, 2.5-5.5 mg/l in serum and median, 348 micrograms/gCr; range, 80-1325 micrograms/gCr in urine), and Kawasaki disease (median, 2.8 mg/l; range, 1.5-3.3 mg/l in serum and median, 1016 micrograms/gCr; range, 214-4500 micrograms/gCr in urine).

The Associazione Italiana Ematologia Oncologia Pediatrica (AIEOP).,1684-93,"BACKGROUND: Improved outcome of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who received intensive chemotherapy was observed by the Italian Association for Pediatric Hematology Oncology (AIEOP). To verify if this improved outcome was also extended to T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) patients after introduction of intensive chemotherapy, treatment responses of 2011 patients, including 184 with T-ALL treated over the decade 1982-1991, were analyzed. Further, the potential use of the association of presenting clinical and biologic features with treatment outcome to determine risk factors that might be useful for planning risk-directed therapeutic studies was analyzed. METHODS: Of the 2011 children consecutively entered on the three sequential AIEOP trials ('82, '87, and '88), 1528 (76%) had successful immunologic studies of the bone marrow blasts. One hundred eighty-four (12%) had T-ALL. During these studies, four consecutive high-risk ALL treatment protocols (i.e., 8303, 8503, 8703, and 8803) were used. Because the treatment schedule in protocols 8503 and 8703 were almost identical, those patients were grouped together for the purpose of survival analysis. The 137 boys and 47 girls ranged in age from 16 months to 15.5 years (median, 7.8 years) at diagnosis, and 38% had a mediastinal mass. The rates of treatment response [i.e. complete remission (CR) and event free survival (EFS) rates] were compared for patients with T-ALL or B-cell progenitor ALL, overall and by individual study. Presenting features and early response to steroid monotherapy were also tested as possible prognostic factors. RESULTS: Overall, the CR rate was 94%, and the 7-year survival (SE) was 51.9% (4.2). T-ALL patients had a significantly worse outcome than B-lineage ALL patients [7-year EFS 40.4% (5.2) vs. 61.7% (1.7), P < 0.001]. Progressive improvement in EFS for T-ALL patients treated during 1 decade was observed, with 7-year EFS (SE) of 23.2% (8.3) for protocol 8303, 5-year EFS of 39.5% (7.1) for combined protocols 8503-8703, and 54.6% (7.1) for study '88, respectively. The analysis of prognostic factors for T-ALL patients showed that poor in vivo steroid response was the most unfavorable prognostic factor, followed by leukocyte level count > 50 x 10(9)/l (P = 0.04). The EFS for patients with T-ALL and good steroid response [63% (3.0)] was comparable with that of the unselected B-lineage ALL patients. CONCLUSIONS: EFS for patient with T-ALL has steadily increased in consecutive AIEOP ALL trials. However T-ALL patients still have a significantly worse EFS compared with patients with B-lineage ALL. Patients with T-ALL and a poor in vivo response to steroid monotherapy represent a particularly high risk treatment group.","['Arico, M', 'Basso, G', 'Mandelli, F', 'Rizzari, C', 'Colella, R', 'Barisone, E', 'Zanesco, L', 'Rondelli, R', 'Pession, A', 'Masera, G']","['Arico M', 'Basso G', 'Mandelli F', 'Rizzari C', 'Colella R', 'Barisone E', 'Zanesco L', 'Rondelli R', 'Pession A', 'Masera G']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Pavia, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate']",1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19950401)75:7<1684::aid-cncr2820750720>3.0.co;2-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1995 Apr 1;75(7):1684-93. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19950401)75:7<1684::aid-cncr2820750720>3.0.co;2-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These patients frequently develop a variety of infections throughout their disease course. METHODS: Charts and autopsy reports were reviewed for 41 patients with ATL with follow-up varying from 2 to 120 months. Infectious episodes were identified and documented. Analyses of humoral and cell-mediated immunity were performed. Cell-mediated immunity was assessed in vivo with the Merieux multitest skin test panel. Humoral immunity was assessed by quantitative immunoglobulin levels, by determining human antimouse antibody after murine monoclonal antibody infusion and by an in vitro immunoglobulin biosynthesis coculture system. RESULTS: A total of 112 infectious episodes were documented. Fifty-seven serious infections were identified. The incidence of total infections was 1.40/patient-year and for serious infections was 0.71/patient-year. The mean serum IgG and IgA levels were within normal range, the mean IgM level was at the lower limit of normal. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from all patients studied failed to make meaningful amounts of IgG, M, or A when activated. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells of all of the 13 patients studied suppressed production of immunoglobulin by cocultured normal PBMC. Twenty-three of the 27 patients tested were anergic. CONCLUSIONS: ATL is a profoundly immunosuppressing malignancy. This is manifested by an extremely high incidence of infectious episodes/patient-year. The incidence of infection appears to be greater than for mycosis fungoides, Hodgkin's lymphoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.","['White, J D', 'Zaknoen, S L', 'Kasten-Sportes, C', 'Top, L E', 'Navarro-Roman, L', 'Nelson, D L', 'Waldmann, T A']","['White JD', 'Zaknoen SL', 'Kasten-Sportes C', 'Top LE', 'Navarro-Roman L', 'Nelson DL', 'Waldmann TA']","['Metabolism Branch, National Cancer Institute 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/*etiology', 'Infections/*etiology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*complications/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19950401)75:7<1598::aid-cncr2820750708>3.0.co;2-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1995 Apr 1;75(7):1598-607. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19950401)75:7<1598::aid-cncr2820750708>3.0.co;2-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Phenotypic evolution associated with strong expression of the IL-2 receptor alpha chain.,1594-7,"BACKGROUND: Interleukin-2 (IL-2) has produced remissions in patients with solid tumors, predominantly malignant melanoma and renal cell carcinoma. Recently, clinical trials have assessed the therapeutic benefit of this cytokine in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). However, little is known about the potential of IL-2 to promote the growth of leukemic cells in vivo. METHODS: A patient with acute myelocytic leukemia whose leukemic blasts displayed lymphoid (TdT+ and CD4+) and myeloid features (myeloperoxidase [MPO]+ and CD13+) is reported. The IL-2 receptor alpha chain (CD25 antigen) was present on 28.9% of his blasts. After entering complete remission with chemotherapy, he was treated on a protocol using IL-2 maintenance. RESULTS: Six weeks after beginning low-dose IL-2, his leukocyte count increased to 448,000/microliters with 86% blasts. The phenotype of these blasts was different from that at diagnosis with expression of the CD25 antigen and the CD33 antigen on 75.9% and 74.8 of the blasts, respectively. Furthermore, 30% of the cells were TdT+, whereas MPO was not detectable. CONCLUSION: The rapid course of relapse, phenotypic evolution, and the high expression of CD25 antigen on the blasts after IL-2 therapy raise the possibility that the cytokine therapy may have promoted the growth of leukemic cells.","['Spiekermann, K', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Estey, E']","['Spiekermann K', ""O'Brien S"", 'Estey E']","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*analysis', 'Recurrence']",1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19950401)75:7<1594::aid-cncr2820750707>3.0.co;2-m [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1995 Apr 1;75(7):1594-7. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19950401)75:7<1594::aid-cncr2820750707>3.0.co;2-m.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The sensitivity of AML blasts to drugs such as Ara-C can be increased by the down-regulation of bcl-2 expression by antisense oligonucleotides. All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) has been reported to increase the sensitivity of AML cell lines to Ara-C and to induce differentiation in the HL60 promyelocytic cell line, with both effects being accompanied by a decrease in bcl-2 expression. Using flow cytometry and a monoclonal antibody to bcl-2, we have investigated the effects of ATRA (1 microM) on bcl-2 expression in the blast cells of 25 AML patients and the K562 cell line after incubation for 72 or 24 h, respectively. Using Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistical analysis where a D value of > 0.12 was statistically significant, we found that in 8/25 AML samples and the K562 cells there was a significant decrease in bcl-2 protein expression after incubation with ATRA (D value range 0.14-0.44). The mean peak fluorescence (MPF) values for the bcl-2 levels of the ATRA responders (n = 8) was reduced to 35.5 +/- 6.9 following incubation with ATRA compared to 47.6 +/- 8.2 (mean +/- SEM) for control samples incubated in the absence of ATRA (P = 0.014). There was no significant difference between the baseline bcl-2 molecules of equivalent soluble fluorochrome (MESF) levels in the ATRA responders (48.9 +/- 5.7, n = 8) and the non-responders (41.3 +/- 3.9, n = 17) (mean +/- SEM) (P = 0.28). The down-regulation of bcl-2 expression by ATRA was particularly associated with CD34-negative AML and of the eight AML patients' cells that responded to ATRA by down-regulating bcl-2, seven were CD34 negative (P < 0.05). Our data suggest that the addition of ATRA to combination chemotherapy would increase the chemosensitivity of some patients with AML, particularly CD34-negative AML, due to down-regulation of bcl-2 expression.","['Bradbury, D A', 'Aldington, S', 'Zhu, Y M', 'Russell, N H']","['Bradbury DA', 'Aldington S', 'Zhu YM', 'Russell NH']","['Department of Haematology, Nottingham City Hospital.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/*metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Genes, bcl-2/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.d01-1838.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1996 Sep;94(4):671-5. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.d01-1838.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Southern blot analysis detected a homozygous deletion of the CDKN2 gene in 5/44 patients (11.4%).

Therefore we found changes in the CDKN2 gene, including point mutations, in 18.2% of the patients with ATL. Interestingly, most of these patients had acute type ATL.

When a chromosome containing an active human fetal gamma gene is transferred to mouse erythroleukaemia (MEL) cells by cell fusion, there is persistent expression of this gene through multiple hybrid-cell divisions despite the 'adult' trans-acting factor environment of the MEL cell. We analysed hybrids formed between embryonic erythroblasts and MEL cells to determine whether the embryonic globin genes would be similarly regulated. Surprisingly, there was no detectable expression of either the endogenous (epsilon, beta h 1) or the transgenic (human epsilon) embryonic beta-like genes in a large number of hybrid pools and clones, even though these genes were expressed in the donor cells at the time of fusion. In contrast, the human gamma gene, which is also expressed as an embryonic gene in transgenic mice, continued to be expressed in these hybrids. This lack of embryonic gene expression in hybrids also applied to the alpha gene cluster; no mouse or human zeta mRNA was detectable in embryonic cell hybrids from mice transgenic for the human alphaglobin genes. Hybrids generated from embryonic non-erythroid cells resulted in expression that was largely restricted to the adult beta gene. It has previously been suggested that epigenetic modifications to the beta-globin gene cluster during normal development are responsible for the perpetuation of gamma and beta gene expression in this hybrid cell system. The results presented here suggest that no such stable modifications occur around the embryonic genes and therefore that the regulatory mechanisms determining embryonic globin gene transcription differ from those responsible for the expression of gamma and beta genes in this system.","['Stanworth, S J', 'Roberts, N A', 'Sharpe, J A', 'Wood, W G']","['Stanworth SJ', 'Roberts NA', 'Sharpe JA', 'Wood WG']","['MRC Molecular Haematology Unit, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Fusion', 'Erythroblasts/*pathology', 'Gene Expression', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/embryology/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.d01-1850.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1996 Sep;94(4):631-8. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.d01-1850.x.,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cells from 34 patients with chronic lymphoid leukaemia of B-cell type (23 B-chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL) and 11 mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) in leukaemic phase) were investigated. High levels of Bcl-2 mRNA were observed by Northern blot and high levels of Bcl-2 protein were detected by cytofluorograph analysis with a specific monoclonal antibody (MAb) in all cases. Strong Bax expression was detected by RT-PCR in 20/23 B-CLL cases; Bax was also observed in 8/11 MCL in leukaemic phase with variable degree of intensity.

The cells were immunophenotyped by flow cytometry with a series of monoclonal antibodies reactive with different CD34 epitopes. Class III epitopes (resistant to enzymatic cleavage with neuraminidase, chymopapain and a glycoprotease from Pasteurella haemolytica) showed a broader distribution on normal haemopoietic progenitor cells and leukaemic blast cells than class I epitopes (sensitive to cleavage with all three enzymes) and class II epitopes (sensitive to degradation with glycoprotease and chymopapain, and resistant to neuraminidase). The subpopulation of normal progenitor cells which exclusively expressed class III epitopes had flow cytometric characteristics compatible with mature myeloid progenitor cells whereas class I, II and III epitopes were equally expressed on cells enriched for immature subsets. No discordant epitope expression could be observed for the more immature leukaemias (AML-M0/1) and a higher percentage of the more mature leukaemic blast cells (AML-M3 and AML-M4/5) expressed class III epitopes compared to the percentage expressing class I and II epitopes. These data indicate that CD34 class III epitopes are more broadly distributed on normal haemopoietic progenitor cells and leukaemic blast cells than class I and II epitopes, and that class I and II epitopes may be down-regulated prior to class III epitopes during normal haemopoietic progenitor cell differentiation.

In vivo, schedule of administration studies in P388 leukemia and mammary adenocarcinoma 16/C (MA16/C) showed that CPT-11 was not markedly schedule dependent. In order to determine its spectrum of anticancer activity, CPT-11 was evaluated against a variety of mouse and human tumors. The end points used were total log cell kill (Lck) for solid tumors and increase in life span (% ILS) for leukemia. Intravenous CPT-11 was found highly active against both early and advanced stage pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma 03 (P03), with 60% long-term survivors and 100% complete regressions, respectively. Other responsive tumors included: colon adenocarcinomas 38 and 51 (both 1.0 Lck); MA16/C (3.4 Lck); MA13/C (1.0 Lck); human Calc18 breast adenocarcinoma (2.8 Lck); Glasgow osteogenic sarcoma (1.8 Lck); Lewis lung carcinoma (1.4 Lck); B16 melanoma (1.4 Lck); P388 leukemia (170% ILS) and L1210 leukemia (64% ILS).

CPT-11 was also found highly active after oral administration in mice bearing P03 and MA16/C tumors. Pharmacokinetic evaluations performed i.v. at the highest non-toxic dosage in mice bearing P03 tumors revealed CPT-11 peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) of 8.9 micrograms/ml and a terminal half-life of 0.6 h. The metabolite SN-38 plasma concentrations presented a Cmax of 1.6 micrograms/ml and a terminal half-life of 7.4 h. Although the CPT-11 tumor levels were similar to the plasma concentrations for early time points, drug levels decreased more slowly in the tumor compared to plasma (half-life, 5.0 h). SN-38 tumor levels reached concentrations in the range of 0.32-0.34 micrograms/g and decayed with a half-life of 6.9 h. No significant difference in plasma or tumor pharmacokinetics of either CPT-11 or SN-38 were noted after one or five daily i.v. injections. Overall, these data show that CPT-11 has good activity in experimental models, when administered both by the i.v. and the oral routes.

Ro 44-5911 and Ro 44-5912 were not intrinsically more toxic than DL-verapamil and exhibited a significantly higher reversing effect. Ro 44-5912 was shown slightly more efficient than Ro 44-5911 for reversing daunorubicin cytotoxicity.

The best results were obtained employing the human T cell leukemia line Jurkat and human dermal fibroblasts as feeder cells in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated human serum. This culture system allowed the cultivation of B. malayi for more than 7 weeks with an average growth of the larvae by factor 6.4 (0.77 +/- 0.035 cm) and a maximum growth by factor 10 (1.2 cm). 69% of the initially cultivated larvae (which corresponded to 100% larvae alive at that time) reached the fourth larval stage after 14 days, and 2.6% of the initially cultivated larvae (which corresponded to 17% of the parasites alive at that day) had reached the young adult stage by day 37 of culture.

Since transcriptionally active genes are prone to recombination events, the recurrent nature of this lesion suggests that the SIL gene product is transcriptionally active in the cell type that undergoes this interstitial deletion and that the SIL gene product may play a role in normal lymphoid development. To facilitate studies of SIL gene function, we have cloned and characterized a murine SIL gene. The predicted murine SIL protein is 75% identical to the human gene, with good homology throughout the open reading frame. An in vitro translated SIL cDNA generated a protein slightly larger than the predicted 139-kDa protein. Although a prior report detected SIL mRNA expression exclusively in hematopoietic tissues, a sensitive RT-PCR assay demonstrated SIL expression to be ubiquitous, detectable in all tissues examined. Since the RT-PCR assay suggested that SIL mRNA expression was higher in rapidly proliferating tissues, we assayed SIL mRNA expression using a murine erythroleukemia model of terminal differentiation and found it to be dramatically decreased in conjunction with terminal differentiation. These studies demonstrate that the human SIL gene product is quite well conserved in rodents and suggest that the SIL gene product may play a role in cell proliferation.","['Collazo-Garcia, N', 'Scherer, P', 'Aplan, P D']","['Collazo-Garcia N', 'Scherer P', 'Aplan PD']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York 14263, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genomics,Genomics,8800135,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (STIL protein, human)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Conserved Sequence', 'DNA/genetics', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', 'Proteins/chemistry/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/12/10 00:00,1995/12/10 00:01,['1995/12/10 00:00'],"['1995/12/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/10 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/10 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0888-7543(85)71271-2 [pii]', '10.1006/geno.1995.1271 [doi]']",ppublish,Genomics. 1995 Dec 10;30(3):506-13. doi: 10.1006/geno.1995.1271.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Deletions are the most common cytogenetic abnormality and always involve 13q14, but when translocations are seen, the consistent breakpoint is always in 13q14. It is now established that deletions, distal to the RB1 gene in 13q14, are invariably associated with these translocations. We have recently described the smallest such deletion from a series of rearrangements from these tumors isolated in somatic cell hybrids, which spans approximately 1 Mb. In this report, we present the results of a series of a chromosome walking experiments using YACs and have been able to span this small deletion, which must contain the gene that is frequently deleted in BCLL. Four probes from 13q14 (RB1-mgg15-D13S25-D13S31) were used to isolate corresponding YACs for each of the markers. The chromosomal location of these YACs was verified using FISH, which also demonstrated their nonchimeric nature. Vectorette end rescue was then used to demonstrate the overlap of the YACs and to isolate new clones to complete the contig.

Using a variety of in vivo and in vitro cancer models, we present experimental data that 9-cis RA has activity as a potential chemotherapeutic agent. Treatment of the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 with 9-cis RA decreases cell proliferation, increases cell differentiation, and increases apoptosis. Induction of apoptosis correlates with an increase in tissue transglutaminase (type II) activity. In vivo, 9-cis RA induces complete tumor regression of an early passage human lip squamous cell carcinoma xenograft. Finally, 9-cis RA inhibits the anchorage-independent growth of the human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and LY2 (an antiestrogen-resistant MCF-7 variant). Transient co-transfection assays indicate that 9-cis RA inhibits estrogen receptor transcription of an ERE-tk-LUC reporter through RAR or RXR receptors. These data suggest that retinoid receptors can antagonize estrogen-dependent transcription and provides one possible mechanism for the inhibition of cell growth by 9-cis RA in breast cancer cell lines. In summary, these findings present evidence that 9-cis RA has a wide range of activities in human cancer models.","['Gottardis, M M', 'Lamph, W W', 'Shalinsky, D R', 'Wellstein, A', 'Heyman, R A']","['Gottardis MM', 'Lamph WW', 'Shalinsky DR', 'Wellstein A', 'Heyman RA']","['Department of Pharmacology, Ligand Pharmaceuticals, San Diego CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Breast Cancer Res Treat,Breast cancer research and treatment,8111104,['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/drug therapy', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Tretinoin/metabolism/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01803787 [doi]'],ppublish,Breast Cancer Res Treat. 1996;38(1):85-96. doi: 10.1007/BF01803787.,,57,,,,,,,,,,,,

SAMPLE: Incident leukaemia cases aged 0-19 from the cancer registry holdings of the province of Saskatchewan for the 60-year period 1932-1991 are the subject of this descriptive report. METHODS: Age-adjusted, age-specific, histologic-type specific, sex-specific, and cohort-specific incidence trends were reviewed. Univariate and multivariate survival analyses explored the effects of time period, age at diagnosis, gender, and histologic type. RESULTS: Acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL) occurred more commonly in males and before the age of five; the 1982-1991 age-adjusted incidence is 3.1/100,000. Increasing incidence has been consistently noted, but has attenuated since 1971. The relative risk of developing ALL in the first 9 years of life, using children born from 1944 to 1948 as baseline, increased with each successive 5-year birth cohort until 1969-1973; since then the risk has been stable. Other histologic types were rare; over 60 years there were only 85 cases that could be grouped as acute non-lymphocytic leukaemias (ANLL); the 1982-1991 age-adjusted ANLL incidence is 0.6/100,000. A dramatic improvement in survival was seen over the last six decades, primarily for ALL. In ALL, children under five have better survival than older children and adolescents; the reverse is true for ANLL.

None of them exerted any inhibitory effects on the activity of protein phosphatase types 1 and 2A. However, one derivative, named TM2a, induced a significant morphological change (bleb-formation) of human myeloid leukemia K562 cells. TM2b, the trimethyl ester of TM2, did not induce bleb-formation. Thus, the maleic anhydride structure played an important role in the biological activity. The biological properties of TM2a toward K562 cells resembled those of a phorbol ester, rather than of tautomycin. The phorbol ester-induced bleb formation was abrogated by a non-specific inhibitor of protein kinases, staurosporine, and by an inhibitor of protein kinase C (PKC), H-7, but TM2a-induced bleb formation was abrogated only by staurosporine. Enhanced phosphorylation of the two proteins was observed after their exposure to TM2a. This suggest that the effect was not due to any inhibition of protein phosphatase 1 or 2A, but rather to the activation of an unidentified kinase, possibly of the PKC family, or to inhibition of a protein phosphatase other than type 1 or 2A.","['Nishiyama, U', 'Ubukata, M', 'Magae, J', 'Kataoka, T', 'Erdodi, F', 'Hartshorne, D J', 'Isono, K', 'Nagai, K', 'Osada, H']","['Nishiyama U', 'Ubukata M', 'Magae J', 'Kataoka T', 'Erdodi F', 'Hartshorne DJ', 'Isono K', 'Nagai K', 'Osada H']","['Department of Bioengineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biosci Biotechnol Biochem,"Bioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry",9205717,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrans)', '0 (Spiro Compounds)', '109946-35-2 (tautomycin)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 1)']",,"['Antifungal Agents/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Biodegradation, Environmental', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Phorbol Esters/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Phosphorylation', 'Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Protein Phosphatase 1', '*Pyrans', '*Spiro Compounds', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1271/bbb.60.103 [doi]'],ppublish,Biosci Biotechnol Biochem. 1996 Jan;60(1):103-7. doi: 10.1271/bbb.60.103.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A mortality study included 3765 people who worked at the Pasteur Institute between 1971 and 1986 and were followed until the end of 1987. Within this cohort a nested case-referent study included 23 cases of cancer [non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (6), multiple myeloma (1), leukemia (3), pancreatic cancer (7), bone cancer (3), brain tumor (3)], and four referents per case, matched for gender and year of birth. RESULTS: Total mortality from cancer was less than expected, the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) being 72 for the men and 82 for the women. Among the women the proportion of pancreatic cancer cases was larger than expected [SMR 490, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 158-1144], as was the number of brain cancer cases (SMR 239, 95% CI 48-696). Among the men, mortality from bone cancer was greater than expected (SMR 553, 95% CI 62-2006). In the nested case-referent study, more cases than referents had worked in the areas of molecular biology [odds ratio (OR) 7.1, 95% CI 1.5-33] and microbial genetics (OR 6.7, 95% CI 1.3-35). These cases especially included non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and bone cancer. Associated with this finding was the fact that more cases had used certain chemicals, including ethidium bromide, acrylamide, methylnitronitrosoguanidine and ethylmethanesulfonate, and radioactive compounds (essentially 32phosphorus). CONCLUSIONS: As the products used are potent genotoxicants, the present findings suggest that work in biomedical research might well involve an increased risk of certain types of cancer; this conclusion should be balanced by the fact that two of the five index cases were included in the mortality study and four in the nested case-referent study.","['Cordier, S', 'Mousel, M L', 'Le Goaster, C', 'Gachelin, G', 'Le Moual, N', 'Mandereau, L', 'Carrat, F', 'Michaud, G', 'Hemon, D']","['Cordier S', 'Mousel ML', 'Le Goaster C', 'Gachelin G', 'Le Moual N', 'Mandereau L', 'Carrat F', 'Michaud G', 'Hemon D']","['INSERM, Institute for Health and Medical Research, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Finland,Scand J Work Environ Health,"Scandinavian journal of work, environment & health",7511540,,IM,"['Academies and Institutes', 'Adult', 'Female', 'France/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Occupational Diseases/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Research/*statistics & numerical data', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['61 [pii]', '10.5271/sjweh.61 [doi]']",ppublish,Scand J Work Environ Health. 1995 Dec;21(6):450-9. doi: 10.5271/sjweh.61.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, it was shown that inactivation of the TP53 tumor suppressor gene occurs frequently in cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia carrying MLL rearrangements. In order to assess the extent of TP53 inactivation throughout the immunophenotypic and clinical spectrum of MLL+ acute leukemias, we tested for TP53 mutations 29 cases of MLL+ acute leukemias displaying lymphoid (13 cases) or myeloid/monoblastic (16 cases) features and belonging to different age groups. Mutations were detected in 6/16 myeloid/monoblastic cases and in 3/13 lymphoid cases. Among myeloid/monoblastic leukemias, the TP53 mutations occurred in 3/4 infants, but only in 3/16 cases in other age groups. Overall, our data suggest that (1) TP53 inactivation is a relatively common event in leukemias with MLL rearrangements irrespective of the leukemic phenotype and of the patients' age; (2) at least two genetic lesions (i.e., MLL rearrangement and TP53 mutation) have accumulated in the short time (few weeks after the birth or conception of the child) corresponding to the development of acute leukemias of infancy.","['Lanza, C', 'Gaidano, G', 'Cimino, G', 'Pastore, C', 'Nomdedeu, J', 'Volpe, G', 'Vivenza, C', 'Parvis, G', 'Mazza, U', 'Basso, G', 'Madon, E', 'Lo Coco, F', 'Saglio, G']","['Lanza C', 'Gaidano G', 'Cimino G', 'Pastore C', 'Nomdedeu J', 'Volpe G', 'Vivenza C', 'Parvis G', 'Mazza U', 'Basso G', 'Madon E', 'Lo Coco F', 'Saglio G']","['Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche e Oncologia Umana, Universita di Torino, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Base Sequence', 'Child', 'DNA', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', '*Proto-Oncogenes', '*Transcription Factors', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics']",1996/01/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1098-2264(199601)15:1<48::AID-GCC7>3.0.CO;2-4 [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1098-2264(199601)15:1<48::AID-GCC7>3.0.CO;2-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1996 Jan;15(1):48-53. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1098-2264(199601)15:1<48::AID-GCC7>3.0.CO;2-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been associated with rearrangements of the BCL3 gene, which is located at the breakpoint on chromosome 19 and is juxtaposed to the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus on chromosome 14 as a result of the translocation. This results in transcriptional up-regulation of the BCL3 gene, which encodes a transcription coactivator, an I-kappa B protein, probably contributing to disease progression.

The types and distribution of these lesions are different from epizootic lymphomas in SGH. We also report a higher percentage (12 versus 4.6%) and the earlier appearance (< or = 40 versus 80-112 weeks) compared with aging-associated spontaneous SGH lymphoma. The features of these hematologic malignancies have not been previously reported in epizootic or aging-associated spontaneous lymphomas and therefore suggest a new class of hematologic lesions in SGH. Benign and atypical hyperplasia correlated with STZ administration (r = 0.97, P = 0.03). The malignant lesions correlated with areas of lymphoid hyperplasia (r = 0.78, P= 0.004). Only one of the 21 untreated SGH spontaneously developed a low grade lymphoma. The unusual types, distribution and occurrence of these lesions may suggest a role for these carcinogens in their induction.","['Cualing, H D', 'Povoski, S P', 'Yassin, R S', 'Fenoglio-Preiser, C M', 'Bell, R H Jr']","['Cualing HD', 'Povoski SP', 'Yassin RS', 'Fenoglio-Preiser CM', 'Bell RH Jr']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, OH 45267-0529, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Nitrosamines)', '5W494URQ81 (Streptozocin)', '60599-38-4 (nitrosobis(2-oxopropyl)amine)']",IM,"['Aging', 'Animals', 'Carcinogens', 'Cricetinae', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental/pathology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/chemically induced/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Hyperplasia', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/chemically induced/*pathology', 'Lymphoid Tissue/drug effects/*pathology', 'Lymphoma/chemically induced/classification/*pathology', 'Mesocricetus', 'Nitrosamines', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/chemically induced/*pathology', 'Streptozocin', 'Time Factors']",1996/09/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/carcin/17.9.1983 [doi]'],ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 1996 Sep;17(9):1983-8. doi: 10.1093/carcin/17.9.1983.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A short term LF 08--0299 treatment at optimal dosage protected more than 75% of recipient mice from lethal GVHD induced either across minor antigens alone or the full H2 barrier. Furthermore, LF 08--0299 still prevented lethal GVHD when treatment was delayed to 10 days post-BMT. Long-term LF 08--0299-treated survivors were free of clinical signs of GVHD, and histopathologic examination of liver, skin, and intestines was normal, demonstrating that recipient mice did not develop chronic GVHD. We assessed the immunocompetence of long-term surviving recipient mice. Results from MLR and CTL assays were weak whereas responses against unrelated H2 antigens were reduced but still preserved. Moreover, in vivo transfer experiments demonstrated that spleen cells from long-term survivors were unable to induce lethal GVHD in irradiated recipients of host origin, while spleen cells injected in irradiated recipients of a host-unrelated H2 were fully competent to induce a lethal GVHD. Together these results indicate that stable chimeric recipient mice were specifically tolerant to host antigens. We further showed that while LF 08--0299 can protect recipient mice from lethal GVHD, it also preserved a graft-versus-leukemia effect when mice were inoculated with P815 tumor cells. These data suggest that LF 08--0299 may be a novel pharmaceutical agent that would prevent GVHD in human unrelated bone marrow transplantation.","['Annat, J', 'Churaqui, E', 'Dutartre, P', 'Bruley-Rosset, M']","['Annat J', 'Churaqui E', 'Dutartre P', 'Bruley-Rosset M']","['Laboratoires Fournier S.C.A., Daix, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,"['0 (Carbamates)', '0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '286F595V8H (tresperimus)']",IM,"['Adoptive Transfer', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects/immunology', '*Carbamates', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Female', 'Graft Rejection/immunology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/pathology/*prevention & control', 'H-2 Antigens/immunology', 'Immunocompetence/drug effects', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Male', 'Mast-Cell Sarcoma/immunology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/immunology', 'Neoplasm Transplantation/immunology', 'Radiation Chimera', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/transplantation', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1996/09/27 00:00,1996/09/27 00:01,['1996/09/27 00:00'],"['1996/09/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/27 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00007890-199609270-00004 [doi]'],ppublish,Transplantation. 1996 Sep 27;62(6):721-9. doi: 10.1097/00007890-199609270-00004.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A previous report from our institution revealed several such associations; the purpose of the current study was to determine whether previous findings were present in a new group of patients. Subjects included 84 newly diagnosed AML patients (French-American-British M1 and M2); exposure data were gathered using self-report questionnaires at the time of registration. Two sets of comparisons were made: (a) patients with all (AA) or some (AN) cytogenetically abnormal cells versus those with normal karyotypes (NN) and (b) patients with specific abnormalities [-5/5q-, -7/7q-, +8, t(8;21)] versus all others. Odds ratios (ORs) were 4.64 for the association between prior cytotoxic therapy and -5/5q- and 6.38 for the association with -7/7q-, but were <1.00 for +8 and t(8;21). There were no ORs > 2.0 for specific abnormalities in any of the other exposures evaluated (cigarette smoking, alcohol use, occupational exposure to organic chemicals, paints, or pesticides/herbicides), with the exception of exposure to paints and -7/7q- (OR, 7.50). The ORs for AA/AN versus NN patients were 1.43 and 3.81 for smoking and alcohol use, and weak dose-response trends were present. The most consistent positive associations between the two series were for prior cytotoxic therapy (-5/5q-; -7/7q-), cigarette smoking (AA/AN versus NN) and alcohol use (AA/AN versus NN). Reasoning from the known association between prior cytotoxic therapy and -7/7q-, we would have predicted relatively high ORs (> 4.0) if specific abnormalities acted as markers for the exposures assessed, but none were present. However, in both series, AA/AN patients were more likely to smoke and use alcohol than were NN patients, and weak dose-response patterns were present for both. This finding suggests that both smoking and alcohol use may play a role in the pathogenesis of cytogenetic abnormalities in AML-M1/M2; however, the mechanism by which they work and whether they are involved in the etiology of these diseases remain unclear.","['Crane, M M', 'Strom, S S', 'Halabi, S', 'Berman, E L', 'Fueger, J J', 'Spitz, M R', 'Keating, M J']","['Crane MM', 'Strom SS', 'Halabi S', 'Berman EL', 'Fueger JJ', 'Spitz MR', 'Keating MJ']","['Division of Medical Education and Research, Greenville Hospital System, South Carolina 29605, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,['0 (Environmental Pollutants)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Alcohol Drinking', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', '*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosome Disorders', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', '*Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Pollutants', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*etiology/genetics/*pathology', 'Logistic Models', 'Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Risk Factors', 'Smoking']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 1996 Aug;5(8):639-44.,['KO7 CA 63183/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

For technical reasons, microcapillary culture may be ideally suited for new drug screening by therapeutic index. To achieve the high output required by screening programs, automated quantitation of CFUs is required. Toward this end, this paper reports the development of a prototype CapScan, an image analysis system that uses a novel axial laser illumination system to detect tumor cell colonies and, with technical modifications, CFU-granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) colonies in microcapillary cultures. As currently configured, the CapScan can quantify colonies grown in a rack of 18 microcapillary cultures in 30 minutes or less. The sensitivity and detection specificity of tumor cell colonies is >90% with a coefficient of variance of 5-40%, dependent upon colony number. Over a range of colony numbers, CapScan and manual colony counts showed a linear correlation > -0.9, and yielded identical results in assays of doxorubicin inhibition of clonogenic P388 cells. As an additional advantage, the growth kinetics of individual colonies can also be monitored with the CapScan, making distinctions between cytotoxic and cytostatic drugs possible; colonies of freshly isolated human tumor cells can also be quantified. Thus, a microcapillary-based human tumor cloning assay that tests for resistance and/or sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents may be useful in drug development programs and may also facilitate the development of chemotherapy for individual patient tumors, especially when tumor availability is limited.","['Murphy, M J Jr', 'Fushimi, F', 'Parchment, R E', 'Barbera-Guillem, E']","['Murphy MJ Jr', 'Fushimi F', 'Parchment RE', 'Barbera-Guillem E']","['Hipple Cancer Research Center, Dayton, Ohio 45439-2092, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cytological Techniques', '*Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Granulocytes/cytology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted/*methods', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy/pathology', 'Macrophages/cytology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Microscopy/methods', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/01/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00873136 [doi]'],ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 1996;13(4):303-14. doi: 10.1007/BF00873136.,['2R44 CA7120-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We recently showed that primaquine, an inhibitor of vesicular transport, blocks the activation of the calcium release-activated calcium current (ICRAC) in rat megakaryocytes (Somasundaram, B., Norman, J. C., and Mahaut-Smith, M. P. (1995) Biochem. J. 309, 725-729). Since it is well established that vesicular transport is temperature-sensitive, we have investigated the effect of temperature on both the activation and maintenance of store-mediated Ca2+ and Mn2+ influx in the human leukemic cell line KU-812 using a combination of whole cell ICRAC recordings and measurements of Mn2+ photoquench of fura-2. Activation of ICRAC was temperature-sensitive, showing a nonlinear reduction when the temperature was lowered from 27 to 17 degrees C with an abrupt change at 21-22 degrees C and complete inhibition at 17 degrees C. Once activated, ICRAC also displayed an abrupt reduction at 21-22 degrees C but was not completely blocked even when the temperature was reduced to 14 degrees C, suggesting that at least one of the temperature-sensitive components is exclusively involved in ICRAC activation. Activation of store-mediated Mn2+ influx also showed similar nonlinear temperature sensitivity and complete inhibition at 19 degrees C. However, in contrast to ICRAC measurements, lowering the temperature following maximal activation of the influx pathway at 37 degrees C did not result in any detectable residual Mn2+ entry below 19 degrees C. We conclude that the mechanism of store-mediated Ca2+ influx involves temperature-dependent steps in both its maintenance and activation, suggesting dependence on a lipid membrane environment.","['Somasundaram, B', 'Mahaut-Smith, M P', 'Floto, R A']","['Somasundaram B', 'Mahaut-Smith MP', 'Floto RA']","['The Physiological Laboratory, University of Cambridge, Downing Street, Cambridge CB2 3EG, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Calcium Channels)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', ""37589-80-3 (Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate))"", '42Z2K6ZL8P (Manganese)', '526U7A2651 (Egtazic Acid)', '67526-95-8 (Thapsigargin)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', ""K22DDW77C0 (1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid)"", 'MVR3634GX1 (Primaquine)', 'RWP5GA015D (Potassium)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'TSN3DL106G (Fura-2)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calcium Channels/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'Egtazic Acid/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Fluorescent Dyes/metabolism', 'Fura-2/metabolism', ""Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate)/pharmacology"", 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Manganese/metabolism', 'Patch-Clamp Techniques', 'Potassium/metabolism', 'Primaquine/pharmacology', 'Sodium/metabolism', '*Temperature', 'Thapsigargin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/10/18 00:00,1996/10/18 00:01,['1996/10/18 00:00'],"['1996/10/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/18 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/18 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.271.42.26096 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)39877-6 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1996 Oct 18;271(42):26096-104. doi: 10.1074/jbc.271.42.26096.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CNTFRalpha is anchored to the membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage; however, a soluble form of the alpha subunit can still bind CNTF to recruit the signal transducing components of the receptor complex. In the present study we show that alanine substitution for residues Thr268 and Asp269 of the CNTFRalpha subunit results in a mutated receptor subunit (R3), which can bind CNTF with an affinity similar to that of the wild type CNTFRalpha but, when expressed as a soluble receptor subunit, lowers the binding of CNTF to its tripartite receptor. In addition, CNTFR3alpha inhibits the proliferation of the TF1 hematopoietic cell line triggered by CNTF plus soluble wild type CNTFRalpha but not by IL-6 or oncostatin M. Similarly, CNTFR3alpha specifically antagonizes the induction of gp130 and LIFRbeta tyrosine phosphorylation observed in response to CNTF and wild type soluble CNTFRalpha in the HepG2 hepatoma cell line, as well as the subsequent events leading to haptoglobin synthesis. Positions 268 and 269 of CNTFRalpha appear to be critical for its interaction with gp130 and LIFRbeta, whereby alanine substitution of the residues at these positions results in antagonism of the CNTF-induced response.","['Auguste, P', 'Robledo, O', 'Olivier, C', 'Froger, J', 'Praloran, V', 'Pouplard-Barthelaix, A', 'Gascan, H']","['Auguste P', 'Robledo O', 'Olivier C', 'Froger J', 'Praloran V', 'Pouplard-Barthelaix A', 'Gascan H']","['Laboratoire de Biologie Cellulaire, 4 rue Larrey, CHU Angers, 49033 Angers Cedex, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Haptoglobins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor)', '2ZD004190S (Threonine)', '30KYC7MIAI (Aspartic Acid)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'OF5P57N2ZX (Alanine)']",IM,"['Alanine/metabolism', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Aspartic Acid/metabolism', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Haptoglobins/metabolism', 'Liver Neoplasms, Experimental/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Rats', 'Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Solubility', 'Threonine/metabolism', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",1996/10/18 00:00,1996/10/18 00:01,['1996/10/18 00:00'],"['1996/10/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/18 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/18 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.271.42.26049 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)39870-3 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1996 Oct 18;271(42):26049-56. doi: 10.1074/jbc.271.42.26049.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent pharmacokinetics investigations have suggested that there is a relationship between its plasma area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC) and the degree of neutropenia posttreatment as well as the therapeutic outcome in hairy-cell leukemia. To enable a simple estimation of the plasma AUC, a limited sampling strategy was developed. Stepwise linear regression was used to determine which were the most important data points for estimation of the plasma AUC after 2-h i.v. infusion, s.c. injection (5 mg/m2), and oral administration (10 mg/m2) in 27 patients. The most important data points after i.v. infusion in 12 patients were 1, 4, and 24 h, in order of importance. The AUC could be estimated as 2.9081 x C1h + 5.1851 x C4h + 20.3265 x C24h. The accuracy and precision (mean value +/- SD for the determined/estimated AUC was 0.99 +/- 0.053) of the model could not be increased by the addition of more data points. A somewhat lower accuracy and precision (0.96 +/- 0.089) was seen with the 2-, 4-, and 24-h data points. These were used to test the regression technique prospectively for the estimation of the AUC after i.v. administration in another set of 10 patients. The accuracy and precision of the estimation of the AUC was similar in this group (1.01 +/- 0.109). In all, 11 patients were treated orally (10 mg/m2) and 10 patients were treated by s.c. injection (5 mg/m2). The most important data points for estimation of the AUC were 2.5, 24, and 0.5 h after oral administration (AUC = 0.8630 x C0.5h + 4.2337 x C2.5h + 45.4364 x C24h) and 9, 1, and 16 h after s.c. injection (AUC = 1.8821 x C1h + 16.4256 x C9h + 25.4518 x C16h). The accuracy and precision were 1.01 +/- 0.064 after oral dosing and 0.99 +/- 0.11 after s.c. injection.

S 16020-2 given i.v. was active against P388 leukemia implanted i.p., s.c., or intracerebrally. The therapeutic effect of an intermittent schedule (administration on days 1, 5, 9) was superior to that of single-dose treatment, allowing the i.v. administration of high total doses of S 16020-2 and resulting in the cure of 60% of mice in the i.p. P388 model. In this model, S 16020-2 was more active than elliptinium acetate and showed a better therapeutic index than Adriamycin: > or = 8 versus 2. A good therapeutic effect of S 16020-2 was also observed in three P388 leukemia sublines displaying the classic multidrug-resistance phenotype, namely, P388/VCR, P388/VCR-20, and P388/MDRC.04, the latter being totally insensitive to vincristine and Adriamycin. However, S 16020-2 was not active against the P388/ADR leukemia, a model highly resistant to adriamycin in vivo. S 16020-2 was both more active than Adriamycin and curative in the M5076 sarcoma and Lewis lung carcinoma implanted s.c. In the B16 melanoma implanted i.p. or s.c., S 16020-2 was less active than Adriamycin. Against the NCI-H460 human tumor xenograft, S 16020-2 demonstrated activity superior to that of Adriamycin (T/C = 20% versus 43% on day 21). Against the MCF7 breast cancer xenograft, S 16020-2 was active, but less so than Adriamycin (T/C = 23% versus 9% on day 21), whereas elliptinium acetate was marginally active (T/C = 49% on day 24). The hematological toxicity of S 16020-2 given to B6D2F1 mice at pharmacological dose appeared to be less severe than that of Adriamycin, particularly in bone-marrow stem cells. These results demonstrate that S 16020-2 is a highly active antitumor drug in various experimental tumor models and is markedly more efficient than elliptinium acetate.

For anticoagulation during cytapheresis, citrate solutions, commonly ACD-A, are used, at a recommended anticoagulant-to-whole blood ratio of 1:11 to 1:12. Although the apheresis procedure is generally well tolerated, the most common patient complaints are attributable to transient hypocalcemia, which is a side effect of the citrate anticoagulant. Patients experiencing discomfort due to hypocalcemia are sometimes managed by a decrease in the flow rate of the anticoagulant. CASE REPORTS: Two cases are reported in which seemingly minor reductions in the anticoagulant: whole blood ratio appeared to cause gelation of freezing solution prepared from plasma that was collected in addition to PBPCs for use in the cryopreservation of cells. In both cases, the final ratio of citrate anticoagulant to whole blood was less than 1:12. Gelation occurred when plasma collected under these conditions was used to prepare freezing solution. CONCLUSION: The addition of heparin to this plasma, or the addition of ACD-A to correct the anticoagulant:whole blood ratio, prevented the gelation of freezing solution, which suggests that coagulation activation in the autologous plasma specimen was implicated in the subsequent gelation. During cytapheresis for PBPC collection, citrate-containing anticoagulants should be used at the recommended ratio of 1:12, or with more anticoagulant than usual. Tolerance for a reduced concentration of citrate may be more limited than is generally appreciated. When plasma is collected in addition to PBPCs, heparin should be added to both the cells and the plasma as soon as possible after the collection.

Data collection included bone marrow response, ferrokinetics, red cell survival as well as the influence on red cell mass and plasma volume. DESIGN: A convenience sample of stable individuals on haemodialysis, with haemoglobin (Hb) levels of less than 80 g/l, was surveyed over a 12-week period while they were receiving the hormone. Blood counts and iron studies were monitored serially, while 51Cr-labelled red cells and 59Fe (III) citrate were used in the radionuclide investigations carried out before and after the course of replacement therapy was completed (pre and post injection). Bone marrow aspiration and trephine biopsy were performed at each of these times. RESULTS: The actual mean trial period was 14 weeks. Eight patients were enrolled but 1 was withdrawn after developing tuberculosis at the start of the study. Haemoglobin levels rose from 59 g/l (SD 8.8) to 96 g/l (SD 13.9) (P < 0.0001); mean red cell mass rose from 675 ml to 954 ml (P < 0.01). Concurrently, the serial studies in 6 patients showed prominent erythroid hyperplasia. Plasma iron turnover increased insignificantly from 42.5 to 118.9 mumol/l/day; erythron turnover increased from 42.5 to 87.3 mumol/l/day (P < 0.01). There was a marked shortening of the marrow transit time from 4.4 to 3.3 days (P < 0.03). Efficacy of erythropoiesis decreased from 1.17 to 0.65 (P < 0.05). Red cell survival was not altered. CONCLUSIONS: The patient with end-stage renal failure remains fully responsive to erythropoietin therapy. This is reflected in improved ferrokinetics, red cell hyperplasia in the marrow and rise in haemoglobin level without alteration in mean erythrocyte lifespan. Simple hormonal replacement is therefore a rational approach to management.","['Swanepoel, C', 'Jacobs, P', 'Byrne, M J', 'Rayner, B', 'Cassidy, M J', 'Meyer, J']","['Swanepoel C', 'Jacobs P', 'Byrne MJ', 'Rayner B', 'Cassidy MJ', 'Meyer J']",['University of Cape Town Leukaemia Centre.'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",South Africa,S Afr Med J,South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde,0404520,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",IM,"['Anemia/blood/drug therapy/etiology', 'Erythrocyte Indices', 'Erythropoietin/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/complications/therapy', '*Peritoneal Dialysis, Continuous Ambulatory', 'Recombinant Proteins/administration & dosage/*pharmacology']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,S Afr Med J. 1996 Aug;86(8):952-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Psoriasis is associated with production of gamma interferon (IFN gamma), which induces the expression of keratin K17 by activating transcription factor STAT1. Our hypothesis states that the induction of K17 is specific for the inflammatory reactions associated with high levels of IFN gamma and activation of STAT1. One of the corollaries of the hypothesis is that the STAT1-activating cytokines should induce the expression of keratin K17, whereas those cytokines that work through other mechanisms should not. Furthermore, because the STAT activation pathway is dependent upon protein phosphorylation events, phosphorylation inhibitors should attenuate the induction of keratin K17, whereas protein phosphatase inhibitors should augment it. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed lesional samples of inflammatory diseases using immunofluorescence, transfected keratinocytes with K17 gene promoter DNAs in the presence of various cytokines, and followed nuclear translocation of STAT1 in keratinocytes using specific antibodies. Confirming the hypothesis, we found that K17 is induced in psoriasis and dermatitis caused by delayed type hypersensitivity, which are associated with high levels of IFN gamma, but not in samples of atopic dermatitis, which is not. Two cytokines, interleukin-6 and leukemia inhibitory factor, which can induce phosphorylation of STAT1, can also induce K17 expression, whereas interleukin-3, interleukin-4, interleukin-10, and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor have no effect on K17 expression. As expected, staurosporine and genistein inhibited, whereas okadaic acid augmented, the induction of K17 by IFN gamma. Our data indicate that in inflammatory skin diseases, lymphocytes, through the cytokines they produce, differently regulate not only each other, but also keratin gene expression in epidermis one of their target tissues.","['Komine, M', 'Freedberg, I M', 'Blumenberg, M']","['Komine M', 'Freedberg IM', 'Blumenberg M']","['Ronald O.

In addition, to determine the pretreatment variables having prognostic significance for treatment outcome in patients with MDS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Nine hundred seven newly diagnosed patients with no history of cytopenias having a local institutional de novo AML successfully karyotyped and treated on Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) protocols for AML from 1984 to 1992. Thirty-three of the 907 patients were reclassified as having MDS on central pathology review using FAB criteria and form the basis of this analysis. RESULTS: The treatment outcomes for patients with MDS and AML were similar; the complete remission (CR) rate was 79% and 68%, respectively (P = .37); median CR duration was 11 and 15 months, respectively (P = .28); and median survival was 13 and 16 months, respectively (P = .72). For the MDS patients, there were no prognostic variables for CR rate identified. For CR duration, only the Sanz classification had prognostic value. The prognostic factors for survival in a univariate analysis included age, WBC count, Sanz classification, and percent blood blasts. In a proportional hazards analysis of survival, age greater than 60 years and WBC less than 2.6 x 10(9)/L were adverse prognostic factors. CONCLUSION: In patients with no known history of cytopenias who are treated intensively at diagnosis, the FAB distinctions between MDS (refractory anemia with excess blasts and refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation) and AML appear to have little therapeutic relevance.","['Bernstein, S H', 'Brunetto, V L', 'Davey, F R', 'Wurster-Hill, D', 'Mayer, R J', 'Stone, R M', 'Schiffer, C A', 'Bloomfield, C D']","['Bernstein SH', 'Brunetto VL', 'Davey FR', 'Wurster-Hill D', 'Mayer RJ', 'Stone RM', 'Schiffer CA', 'Bloomfield CD']","['Department of Hematologic Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1996.14.9.2486 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1996 Sep;14(9):2486-94. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1996.14.9.2486.,['CA37027/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-seven adult patients with newly diagnosed ALL and lymphoblastic lymphoma were treated with a dose-intense induction regimen. This regimen was designed to increase the fraction of patients achieving an early complete remission (CR) in an attempt to increase long-term disease-free survival. The induction regimen was cytarabine (Ara-C) 3 g/m2/d for 5 days and mitoxantrone 80 mg/m2 as a single dose on day 3. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) 200 micrograms/ m2/d beginning on day 7 was used to promote early myeloid recovery. RESULTS: There were 31 CRs (84%). Median time to CR was 34 days, median hospital stay was 28 days, and the median number of days with a neutrophil count less than 500/microL was 18. There were three patients with resistant disease who experienced treatment failure and three early deaths from sepsis. Four patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) ALL achieved hematologic and cytogenetic CRs. CONCLUSION: This dose-intense induction regimen produced a high incidence of CRs with acceptable toxicity without the use of vincristine or corticosteroids. Comparisons with our prior vincristine/prednisone-based induction regimen (the L-20 protocol) suggest that patients treated on the current study were more likely to achieve a CR and that they achieved this remission earlier than patients treated with a traditional four-drug (vincristine, prednisone, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide) induction regimen.","['Weiss, M', 'Maslak, P', 'Feldman, E', 'Berman, E', 'Bertino, J', 'Gee, T', 'Megherian, L', 'Seiter, K', 'Scheinberg, D', 'Golde, D']","['Weiss M', 'Maslak P', 'Feldman E', 'Berman E', 'Bertino J', 'Gee T', 'Megherian L', 'Seiter K', 'Scheinberg D', 'Golde D']","['Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Remission Induction', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1996.14.9.2480 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1996 Sep;14(9):2480-5. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1996.14.9.2480.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To evaluate the efficacy and to determine the best schedule of granisetron (a selective 5-hydroxytryptamine3 serotonin receptor antagonist) administration in the prevention of radiation-induced nausea and vomiting, we conducted a trial involving patients receiving single-dose TBI before bone marrow transplantation (BMT). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirty-six patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 12), multiple myeloma (n = 8), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 7), acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (n = 6), and chronic myeloid leukemia (n = 3) referred to our department between March 1992 and February 1994 were enrolled in this study to assess the efficacy of granisetron during single-dose TBI before autologous BMT (n = 26), allogeneic BMT (n = 8), or syngeneic BMT (n = 2). The male-to-female ratio was 22:14 (1.57), and the mean age was 41 +/- 11 years (range 16-58). Before TBI, conditioning chemotherapy consisted of cyclophosphamide (CY) alone (60 mg/kg per day on 2 successive days) in 24 patients, CY combined with other drugs in 6, and combinations without CY in 6. All patients received single-dose TBI (10 Gy administered to the midplane at L4, and 8 Gy to the lungs). The mean instantaneous and average dose rates were 0.039 +/- 0.012 Gy/min (range 0.031-0.058), and 0.025-0.006 Gy/min (range 2.08-3.96), respectively. Granisetron was administered 30-45 min before TBI according to two different modalities: a total dose of 3 mg as a 5-min intravenous (i.v.) infusion (Treatment A, n = 15; 42%) or the same treatment plus 3 mg of granisetron as a 24-h continuous i.v. infusion (total dose: 6 mg, Treatment B, n = 21; 58%). Depending on the BMT teams, hyperdiuresis was continued (n = 19, 53%) or suspended (n = 17, 47%) during TBI. Nausea and vomiting were assessed during the TBI session and the following 12 h, and were scored as follows: S1 = no nausea or vomiting; S2 = moderate nausea; S3 = severe nausea and/or single episode of vomiting; and S4 = multiple episodes of vomiting. RESULTS: During TBI, 18 (50%) patients were scored as complete responders (S1), 1 (3%) as a major responder (S2), 9 (25%) as minor responders (S3), and 8 (22%) as nonresponders (S4). During the following 12 h, 28 (78%) patients were free of severe nausea and vomiting (S1 or S2), whereas 8 (22%) vomited (S3 or S4). In univariate analyses, the 12-h probability of emesis was significantly higher in patients undergoing hyperdiuresis (63% vs. 30%; p = 0.05), and in patients older than 45 years (65% for age > 45 vs. 33% for age < or = 45; p = 0.05). The probability of S3 or S4 emesis was 50% with Treatment A and 47% with Treatment B (p = 0.86). Sex, body weight, and type of conditioning chemotherapy did not influence the 12-h probability of emesis. Multivariate analysis revealed that hyperdiuresis (p = 0.02) and Treatment A (p = 0.04) were independently associated with radiation-induced emesis, whereas sex (p = 0.85), body weight (p = 0.13), age (p = 0.12), and type of conditioning chemotherapy (p = 0.92) were not. No early toxicity related to granisetron was observed. CONCLUSION: Granisetron is a well-tolerated and effective antiemetic agent that can be used as monotherapy during single-dose TBI. Good control of nausea and vomiting is obtained with this antiemetic drug, and its effect is increased when hyperdiuresis is suspended during TBI.","['Belkacemi, Y', 'Ozsahin, M', 'Pene, F', 'Rio, B', 'Sutton, L', 'Laporte, J P', 'Touboul, E', 'Gorin, N C', 'Laugier, A']","['Belkacemi Y', 'Ozsahin M', 'Pene F', 'Rio B', 'Sutton L', 'Laporte JP', 'Touboul E', 'Gorin NC', 'Laugier A']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Hopital Tenon, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,"['0 (Antiemetics)', 'WZG3J2MCOL (Granisetron)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Antiemetics/*therapeutic use', 'Body Weight', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Diuresis/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Granisetron/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*therapy', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Sex Factors', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/*adverse effects']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0360301696002842 [pii]', '10.1016/s0360-3016(96)00284-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1996 Aug 1;36(1):77-82. doi: 10.1016/s0360-3016(96)00284-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Seventy-eight percent of patients had acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), 69% chronic graft-vs.-host disease (cGVHD), and 63% posttransplant pulmonary infection. Effects of GVHD, TBI, radiation dose to the lungs, dose rate of TBI, posttransplant pulmonary infection, Busulfan use for conditioning, age, and history of smoking were evaluated for their influence on pulmonary function. RESULTS: Posttransplant FEV1, FVC, and TLC were lower than pretransplant values (p < 0.05) at 6 months and 1 year posttransplant with subsequent recovery. DLCO was significantly lower at all posttransplant intervals. FEV1 did not fall significantly in patients without acute or chronic GVHD and recovered earlier than in patients without posttransplant pulmonary infection. Recovery of FVC, TLC, and DLCO was also delayed in patients with acute and chronic GVHD and posttransplant pulmonary infection. Multiple regression analysis revealed an association between a higher radiation dose to the lungs, and decreased FVC at 2 years (p = 0.01). Progressive obstructive pulmonary disease was not observed. CONCLUSION: An initial decline in PFTs with subsequent recovery was observed. Factors associated with delayed recovery and incomplete recovery of PFTs were GVHD, posttransplant pulmonary infection, and higher radiation dose to the lungs. The conditioning regimen used at Medical College of Wisconsin, including relatively high TBI doses with partial transmission pulmonary shielding, appears to be well tolerated by the lungs in long-term survivors. No progressive decline in PFTs or symptomatic decline in pulmonary function was observed during the time interval studied.","['Gore, E M', 'Lawton, C A', 'Ash, R C', 'Lipchik, R J']","['Gore EM', 'Lawton CA', 'Ash RC', 'Lipchik RJ']","['Medical College of Wisconsin Affiliated Hospitals, Department of Radiation Oncology, Milwaukee 53226, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Chronic Disease', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/complications', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Lung Diseases/*etiology', 'Male', 'Respiratory Function Tests', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/*adverse effects']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S036030169600123X [pii]', '10.1016/s0360-3016(96)00123-x [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1996 Aug 1;36(1):67-75. doi: 10.1016/s0360-3016(96)00123-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Previously the Children's Cancer Group (CCG) treated patients with ALL and CNS disease at diagnosis with cranio (24 Gy)-spinal (12 Gy) irradiation, as well as systemic and intrathecal chemotherapy. In a series of CCG trials completed in 1989 the spinal dose was empirically reduced to 6 Gy for patients receiving systemic chemotherapy with an intensive consolidation phase to limit hematopoietic toxicity. The spinal dose was left at 12 Gy for patients treated with a less intensive consolidation phase. RESULTS: With a median follow-up for surviving patients of 74 months, the 5-year event-free survival for 53 patients with CNS disease at diagnosis was 69 +/- 13% (+/- 2 standard deviations), similar to the value obtained for 3364 patients without CNS disease, 67 +/- 2%. Corresponding values for 5-year survival were 77 +/- 12% and 80 +/- 1%, and for freedom from isolated first CNS relapse, were 90 +/- 9% and 94 +/- 1%. Event-free survival, survival, and freedom from isolated first CNS relapse in the 6-Gy group were as good as in the 12-Gy group. CONCLUSION: CNS disease at diagnosis is not a poor prognostic factor for children with ALL who are treated with intensive systemic chemotherapy, craniospinal irradiation, and intrathecal chemotherapy. Six Gy is an adequate dose of spinal irradiation for these patients.","['Cherlow, J M', 'Sather, H', 'Steinherz, P', 'Gaynon, P', 'Tubergen, D', 'Trigg, M', 'Novak, L', 'Bleyer, W A']","['Cherlow JM', 'Sather H', 'Steinherz P', 'Gaynon P', 'Tubergen D', 'Trigg M', 'Novak L', 'Bleyer WA']","['Radiation Oncology, Long Beach Memorial Medical Center, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,,IM,"['Central Nervous System Neoplasms/*radiotherapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Prognosis', 'Spinal Cord Neoplasms/radiotherapy', 'Survival Analysis']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0360301696002726 [pii]', '10.1016/s0360-3016(96)00272-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1996 Aug 1;36(1):19-27. doi: 10.1016/s0360-3016(96)00272-6.,"['CA 02971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 17829/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,['Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1996 Aug 1;36(1):257-9.

However, it is unclear whether increased recruitment of clonogenic NK, increased proliferation on a per cell basis, or a combination of both is responsible for the increased expansion. We show that expansion of both CD56+dim and CD56+bright NK from normal donors is increased in the presence of M2-10B4 accessory cell-soluble factors. In contrast, the addition of M2-10B4 stromal ligands further augments only the expansion of CD56+bright NK. Using single-cell sorting of CD56+bright NK, M2-10B4-soluble and contact factors independently increase both recruitment of clonogenic NK and proliferation on a per cell basis. This well-defined M2-10B4 accessory cell system was used to investigate potential defects in NK from patients with CML. Although we have previously shown diminished interleukin-2 (IL-2)-activated NK outgrowth and function from patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) as their disease progresses, it has been unclear if this is due to a defect in an accessory cell function or an inherent abnormality of CML NK themselves. CD56+/CD3- NK purified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting from 21 patients (7 early chronic phase [ECP] patients, 10 late chronic and accelerated phase [LCP/AP], and 4 blast crisis [BC] patients) were studied. The proliferative capacity, clonogenic frequency, and cytotoxic capacity of CML NK were compared with NK from normal donors. The absolute number of circulating NK per milliliter of peripheral blood is significantly decreased in patients with CML compared with normal donors (normal, 63,700 +/- 6,400; ECP, 40,700 +/- 6,700; LCP/AP, 31,900 +/- 6,000; BC, 10,700 +/- 5,200). Additionally, the unique CD56+bright NK subset, analyzed as a percentage of the total circulating NK pool, is significantly reduced in all patients with CML (normal, 5.7% +/- 0.8% v CML [all stages combined], 2.5% +/- 0.5%, P = .001]. After purification of NK to correct for differences in circulating NK number, resting NK cytotoxicity against K562 tumor targets is significantly reduced in patients with CML on or recently on hydroxyurea therapy. However, this reduced cytotoxicity can be corrected by 18 hours of incubation with 1,000 U/mL recombinant IL-2. When plated in limiting dilution on viable M2-10B4, which maximally stimulates NK from normal donors, we show that both NK clonogenic frequency and proliferative capacity are significantly reduced as CML progresses, demonstrating an inherent defect in their ability to respond to normal NK stimuli. Although NK cloning efficiency between normal donors and ECP CML patients was the same, significant differences were observed in (1) the absolute number of circulating CD56+/CD3- NK, (2) the absolute number of circulating CD56+bright NK, and (3) proliferation on a per cell basis. Unlike resting NK function, prior cytotoxic therapy alone did not account for these observed abnormalities. These data suggest that, although NK are not derived from the malignant clone, they are inherently affected by their malignant microenvironment.","['Pierson, B A', 'Miller, J S']","['Pierson BA', 'Miller JS']","['Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (CD56 Antigen)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/immunology', 'CD56 Antigen/*metabolism', 'Cell Division', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Subsets', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/09/15 00:00,1996/09/15 00:01,['1996/09/15 00:00'],"['1996/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)62429-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Sep 15;88(6):2279-87.,"['P0I-CA-21737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P0I-CA-65493-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R0I-CA-45814/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sixteen of the patients in the CHT group and 3 in the BMT group who had achieved complete remission suffered clinical relapse. In 10 of these patients, WT1 expression that had returned to normal BM levels (< 10(-3); the WT1 expression level of K562 cells was defined as 1.0) after complete remission (CR) either gradually or rapidly increased again to abnormal levels 1 to 18 months (mean, 7 months) before clinical relapse became apparent. In another 9 patients, WT1 expression never returned to normal BM levels even after CR and the subsequent relapse was accompanied by a rapid increase in WT1 expression to levels higher than 10(-2) (10(-3) levels in PB). On the other hand, the remaining 35 patients (15 CHT and 20 BMT) maintained their CR. In 29 of these patients (11 CHT and 18 BMT), WT1 expression either gradually or rapidly decreased to normal BM levels, whereas in the other 6 (4 CHT and 2 BMT), low or very low levels of WT1 mRNAs (10(-3) to 10(-2) in BM and 10(-5) to 10(-3) in PB) remain detectable, but without any clinical signs of relapse. A clear correlation was found to exist between the minimal residual disease (MRD) detected in the paired BM and PB samples for all types of leukemias (AML, ALL, and CML), with MRD in PB being approximately one-tenth of that in BM. WT1 quantitation of 168 paired BM and PB samples showed that PB samples were superior to BM samples for the detection of MRD. We conclude that monitoring of WT1 expression levels in BM and PB makes it possible to rapidly assess the effectiveness of individual treatment and diagnose clinical relapse in the early stage for all leukemia patients regardless of the presence or absence of tumor-specific DNA markers.","['Inoue, K', 'Ogawa, H', 'Yamagami, T', 'Soma, T', 'Tani, Y', 'Tatekawa, T', 'Oji, Y', 'Tamaki, H', 'Kyo, T', 'Dohy, H', 'Hiraoka, A', 'Masaoka, T', 'Kishimoto, T', 'Sugiyama, H']","['Inoue K', 'Ogawa H', 'Yamagami T', 'Soma T', 'Tani Y', 'Tatekawa T', 'Oji Y', 'Tamaki H', 'Kyo T', 'Dohy H', 'Hiraoka A', 'Masaoka T', 'Kishimoto T', 'Sugiyama H']","['Department of Medicine III, Osaka University Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'WT1 Proteins', 'Wilms Tumor/genetics']",1996/09/15 00:00,1996/09/15 00:01,['1996/09/15 00:00'],"['1996/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)62428-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Sep 15;88(6):2267-78.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A critical region of consistent loss at 5q31.1 (in > 90% of cases) has led us and others to postulate the presence of a key negative regulator(s) of leukemogenesis. Although the interstitial deletion limits vary among patients, del(5) (q13q33) and del(5)(q13q35) constitute major subsets. Furthermore, it is not rare to encounter deletions, translocations, or paracentric inversions involving 5q11 to 5q13, which indicates inactivation or disruption of important gene(s) at that locus. In this report, we have localized a novel locus at 5q13.1 to a 2.0-Mb interval between the anonymous markers D5S672 and GATA-P1804. This locus resided within the region of loss in 12 of 27 patients with anomalies of chromosome 5; one of these cases had apparent retention of both alleles of all the telomeric loci. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies demonstrate that the AML cell line ML3 is disrupted at 5q13.1 by a translocation involving chromosome 3, with apparent retention of the entire chromosome 5 sequence. Our results suggest that this novel proximal locus encodes a critical gene that may be deleted or disrupted in a subset of MDS/AML patients with chromosome 5 anomalies.","['Fairman, J', 'Wang, R Y', 'Liang, H', 'Zhao, L', 'Saltman, D', 'Liang, J C', 'Nagarajan, L']","['Fairman J', 'Wang RY', 'Liang H', 'Zhao L', 'Saltman D', 'Liang JC', 'Nagarajan L']","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Genetic Markers)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Chromosome Aberrations/*genetics', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Chromosome Inversion', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Genetic Markers', 'Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1996/09/15 00:00,1996/09/15 00:01,['1996/09/15 00:00'],"['1996/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)62427-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Sep 15;88(6):2259-66.,['P01 CA55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the time of initial presentation, DNA from patients with CLL was polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified using consensus Variable (VH) and Joining (JH) region primers using complementarity determining region III consensus region primers or a panel of VH family-specific framework region 1 (FR1) primers. The clonal product was directly sequenced and patient-specific probes constructed using N region nucleotide sequences. We amplified and sequenced the CDRIII region and designed patient specific oligonucleotide probes for the detection of MRD in 55 of 66 patients (84%, 90% Confidence Intervals (CI): 74% to 90%) with poor prognosis CLL referred for autologous and allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). To determine the clinical utility of this technique, PCR amplification was performed on patient samples at the time of and following autologous (21 patients) and allogeneic (10 patients) BMT in whom serial bone marrow samples obtained after BMT were available for analysis. We show that the persistence of MRD after BMT is associated with increased probability of relapse. In all cases that have relapsed to date, the IgH CDRII region was identical at the time of initial presentation and at relapse suggesting that clonal evolution of the IgH locus is unusual in this disease. The finding that a significant number of patients remain disease free and with no evidence of PCR-detectable MRD after BMT suggests that high-dose therapy may contribute to improved outcome in selected patients with CLL.","['Provan, D', 'Bartlett-Pandite, L', 'Zwicky, C', 'Neuberg, D', 'Maddocks, A', 'Corradini, P', 'Soiffer, R', 'Ritz, J', 'Nadler, L M', 'Gribben, J G']","['Provan D', 'Bartlett-Pandite L', 'Zwicky C', 'Neuberg D', 'Maddocks A', 'Corradini P', 'Soiffer R', 'Ritz J', 'Nadler LM', 'Gribben JG']","['Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02146, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'DNA Probes/chemistry', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Prognosis', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1996/09/15 00:00,1996/09/15 00:01,['1996/09/15 00:00'],"['1996/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)62423-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Sep 15;88(6):2228-35.,"['A129530/PHS HHS/United States', 'CA 66996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA06516/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unfortunately, the same treatment schedules associated with impressive efficacy are associated with an increased risk of secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which has prompted its withdrawal from some treatment regimens, thereby potentially compromising efficacy against the original tumor. Because etoposide-associated AML is characterized by site-specific illegitimate DNA recombination, we studied whether etoposide could directly cause site-specific deletions of exons 2 and 3 in the hprt gene. Human lymphoid CCRF-CEM cells were treated with etoposide for 4 hours, and DNA was isolated after subculturing. The deletion of exons 2 and 3 from hprt was assayed by a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. In the absence of etoposide treatment, the frequency of deletions of exons 2 and 3 was very low (5.05 x 10(-8)). After exposure to 10 mumol/ L etoposide, the frequency of the exon 2 + 3 deletion was increased immediately after and at 24 hours after etoposide treatment (65 to 89 x 10(-8)) and increased to higher levels (128 to 173 x 10(-8)) after 2 and 6 days of subculture (P < .001 overall). The frequency of the exon 2 + 3 deletion assessed at 6 days of subculture after 4 hours of 0, 0.25, 1, 2.5, 5, and 10 mumol/L etoposide treatment increased with etoposide concentration, ie, 5.05 x 10(-8), 89.2 x 10(-8), 108 x 10(-8), 142 x 10(-8), 163 x 10(-8), and 173 x 10(-8), respectively (P < .0001). Sequencing of a subset of amplified products confirmed the presence of DNA sequences at the breakpoints consistent with V(D)J recombination. By contrast, exon 2 + 3 deletions after etoposide treatment in the myeloid cell lines KG-1A and K562 showed no evidence of V(D)J recombinase in their genesis. We conclude that etoposide can induce the illegitimate site-specific action of V(D)J recombinase on an unnatural DNA substrate after a single treatment in human lymphoid cells.","['Chen, C L', 'Fuscoe, J C', 'Liu, Q', 'Relling, M V']","['Chen CL', 'Fuscoe JC', 'Liu Q', 'Relling MV']","[""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38101-0318, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 2.4.2.8 (Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (VDJ Recombinases)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'DNA Nucleotidyltransferases/*metabolism', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'Exons', 'Humans', 'Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/enzymology/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Recombination, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'VDJ Recombinases']",1996/09/15 00:00,1996/09/15 00:01,['1996/09/15 00:00'],"['1996/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)62421-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Sep 15;88(6):2210-8.,"['CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-51001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analogs of 1 alpha, 25(OH)2D3 that have greater potency may have the potential as adjuvant therapy for high-risk patients in remission for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes. A new generation of 11 analogs of 1 alpha, 25(OH)2D3 has been synthesized, and we examined their effects on the human leukemic cell line HL-60. This cell line provides a sensitive monitor of activity of the 1 alpha, 25(OH)2D3 analogs. All the compounds were potent, producing a 50% clonal inhibition (ED50) in the range of 10(-8) to 10(-11) mol/L; nine of the 11 analogs had ED50s at concentrations that were at least 10-fold lower than those for the parental 1,25(OH)2D3. The most active compound [cmpd LA, (22R)-1 alpha, 25-(OH)2-16,22,23-triene-D3] had an ED50 of 2 x 10(-11) mol/L; it was also tested on clonogenic cells from patients with AML, and it achieved an ED50 of approximately 6 x 10(-11) mol/L, while 1 alpha, 25(OH)2D3 produced an ED50 of approximately 10(-8) mol/L on the same population of cells. Five different cell surface markers were examined on HL-60 cells exposed to the 1 alpha, 25(OH)2D3 analogs: HLA-DR and CD11b were induced by all of the compounds; CD13 was induced by six of the 12 compounds, including 1,25(OH)2D3; CD14 was strongly induced by all compounds; and CD38 was induced rather weakly by nine of 12 analogs. WAF1/CIP1/p21, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKI), which is important in blocking the cell cycle, was examined by Western blot and was found to be induced by all of the compounds, suggesting a possible mechanism by which these analogs inhibit leukemic growth. The induction of WAF1 occurred at concentrations of vitamin D analogs as low as 10(-10) mol/L. This structure-function study showed that a new series of 1 alpha, 25(OH)2D3 analogs was active in clonal inhibition, as well as induction of differentiation and WAF1 expression of HL-60 cells. The key structural motifs included C-16 double bond, double and/or triple bonds in the side chain, lengthening of the side chain, 20-epi-conformation of the side chain, replacement of six hydrogens at the end of the side chain with fluorines, and the removal of C-19. Consideration should be given to further in vivo testing of toxicity and efficacy to move toward a clinical trial, especially in a setting of minimal residual disease.","['Munker, R', 'Kobayashi, T', 'Elstner, E', 'Norman, A W', 'Uskokovic, M', 'Zhang, W', 'Andreeff, M', 'Koeffler, H P']","['Munker R', 'Kobayashi T', 'Elstner E', 'Norman AW', 'Uskokovic M', 'Zhang W', 'Andreeff M', 'Koeffler HP']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center/UCLA School of Medicine 90048, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', '0 (Vitamin D-Binding Protein)', '1406-16-2 (Vitamin D)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Surface/metabolism', '*Antineoplastic Agents', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Chickens', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/*metabolism', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/metabolism', 'Receptors, Calcitriol/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Vitamin D/*analogs & derivatives', 'Vitamin D-Binding Protein/metabolism']",1996/09/15 00:00,1996/09/15 00:01,['1996/09/15 00:00'],"['1996/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)62420-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Sep 15;88(6):2201-9.,"['CA42710/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA43277/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA70675-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The fusion transcript can be detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in most of these patients in long-term complete remission (CR) following conventional chemotherapy or autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT). However, AML1/ETO expression has not been analyzed in a series of patients following allogeneic BMT. We examined CR bone marrow (BM) samples and, in some cases, blood samples from 10 patients with t(8;21) leukemia who underwent allogeneic BMT in either first or second remission or first or second relapse. A variety of myeloablative regimens were used. Eight patients received non-T-cell depleted BM from matched sibling donors, one patient received a T-cell depleted haploidentical BM, and one patient received a non-T-cell depleted BM from a matched unrelated donor (MUD). Five patients developed acute and/ or chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD). The furthest time points analyzed for the AML1/ETO transcript in the 10 patients in CR following allogeneic BMT ranged from 7.5 to 83.0 months. Sufficient RNA was extracted from the most recent BM or BM and blood samples from nine patients to assay for presence or absence of the AML1/ETO fusion transcript by RT-PCR. The fusion transcript was detected by RT-PCR in all nine of these patient samples; eight were positive in BM and one was negative in BM, but positive in blood. The fusion transcript could not be detected in a BM sample from the tenth patient obtained 7.5 months after BMT, but the amount of RNA available was suboptimal. Hematopoietic chimerism could be demonstrated in sorted CD34+ BM cells from two of four patient CR BM samples with RT-PCR evidence of the fusion transcript. Additionally, in one of the two cases with chimerism, we demonstrated an abnormal clonal population of recipient cells in the CR BM sample by fluorescence in situ hybridization. One patient died of complications from GVHD, while the other nine patients remain alive without evidence of relapse, with a median follow-up time of 27 (range, 7.5 to 87) months post-BMT. These data suggest that allogeneic BMT, like conventional chemotherapy and autologous BMT, is not sufficient to eradicate cells expressing AML1/ETO, and that a positive RT-PCR for the fusion transcript post allogeneic BMT is compatible with continued CR.","['Jurlander, J', 'Caligiuri, M A', 'Ruutu, T', 'Baer, M R', 'Strout, M P', 'Oberkircher, A R', 'Hoffmann, L', 'Ball, E D', 'Frei-Lahr, D A', 'Christiansen, N P', 'Block, A M', 'Knuutila, S', 'Herzig, G P', 'Bloomfield, C D']","['Jurlander J', 'Caligiuri MA', 'Ruutu T', 'Baer MR', 'Strout MP', 'Oberkircher AR', 'Hoffmann L', 'Ball ED', 'Frei-Lahr DA', 'Christiansen NP', 'Block AM', 'Knuutila S', 'Herzig GP', 'Bloomfield CD']","['Department of Hematologic Oncology, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/pathology', 'Child', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1996/09/15 00:00,1996/09/15 00:01,['1996/09/15 00:00'],"['1996/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)62418-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Sep 15;88(6):2183-91.,,,,['Blood. 1997 Oct 15;90(8):3230-1.

We observed a large increase in apoptotic cell numbers (mean, 90% v 20% in medium alone) in the presence of theophylline (100 micrograms/mL) or chlorambucil (10 mumol/L) after 72 hours of incubation. Maximal apoptosis (90%) was reached after 36 hours when the two drugs were used together at fourfold lower concentrations, indicating a synergistic effect; no effect was observed with normal B cells, suggesting that the combination might have therapeutic interest. Chlorambucil induced intracellular Ca+2 influx, pointing to the involvement of two signaling pathways that might explain its synergy with theophylline through their effects on oncogenes. The expression of bcl-2 protein, a proto-oncogene inhibiting apoptosis, decreased after incubation with the drugs, while c-myc, recently described as having a potent role in apoptosis, was overexpressed. For p53 we observed an overexpression in the presence of chlorambucil or both theophylline-chlorambucil and a decrease after theophylline incubation. Chlorambucil- and theophylline-induced apoptosis was partially inhibited by interleukin-4 (IL-4), which also abrogated the effects on oncogene expression.

In the present study, which focused primarily on an analysis of circulating progenitors present in such patients at diagnosis, we discovered the frequent and occasionally exclusive presence of circulating normal (Ph-) LTC-IC, often at levels above those seen for LTC-IC in the blood of normal individuals. The presence of detectable numbers of circulating Ph- LTC-IC was independent of the fact that the same peripheral blood samples also contained elevated numbers of predominantly or exclusively Ph+ CFC. Interestingly, both the Ph+ and Ph- LTC-IC in these samples were CD34+CD71- and variably CD38- and Thy-1+, as previously documented for LTC-IC in normal marrow. Thus, neither CD38 nor Thy-1 expression was useful for discriminating between Ph+ and Ph- LTC-IC in mixed populations. Nevertheless, an association of these phenotypes with LTC-IC function did allow highly enriched (> 5% pure) suspensions of either Ph+ or Ph- LTC-IC to be obtained from selected samples of CML blood in which the initial LTC-IC population was either predominantly Ph+ or Ph-, respectively. These findings suggest that the mechanisms causing mobilization of leukemic stem cells in untreated CML patients may affect their normal counterparts. They also indicate a possible new source of autologous cells for the support of intensive therapy of CML patients. Finally, they provide a method for obtaining the most highly purified populations of Ph+ LTC-IC described to date. This method should be useful for further analyses of the molecular activities of these very primitive neoplastic cells.","['Petzer, A L', 'Eaves, C J', 'Lansdorp, P M', 'Ponchio, L', 'Barnett, M J', 'Eaves, A C']","['Petzer AL', 'Eaves CJ', 'Lansdorp PM', 'Ponchio L', 'Barnett MJ', 'Eaves AC']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD34/immunology', 'Cell Separation', 'Chronic Disease', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology']",1996/09/15 00:00,1996/09/15 00:01,['1996/09/15 00:00'],"['1996/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)62416-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Sep 15;88(6):2162-71.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment of mice with Tpo raises the platelet count fourfold within a few days. Conversely, c-mpl knock-out mice have platelet counts that are 15% that of normal. The subunit structure of the c-Mpl receptor is not fully understood. Some cytokines that stimulate megakaryopoiesis (IL-6, IL-11, leukemia inhibitory factor, and oncostatin M) bind to receptors that use gp130 as a signal transduction subunit. For these reasons, we determined whether gp130 function was required for Tpo-induced signal transduction. Murine marrow cells were cultured in semi-solid media in the presence of Tpo or IL-3, with or without a neutralizing anti-gp130 monoclonal antibody (RX187) or a soluble form of c-Mpl receptor (soluble Mpl) that blocks Tpo bioactivity, and the numbers of colony-forming unit-megakaryocyte (CFU-Meg) colonies were counted on day 5. Murine marrow cells were also cultured in suspension under serum-free conditions for 5 days, and megakaryocyte DNA content was measured by flow cytometry, as an index of nuclear maturation. The addition of RX187 did not block Tpo-induced CFU-Meg colony growth nor CFU-Meg nuclear maturation in suspension culture. However, IL-3-induced CFU-Meg colony growth and megakaryocyte nuclear maturation decreased in the presence of RX187. Soluble Mpl completely ablated Tpo-induced CFU-Meg growth, and partially blocked IL-3-stimulated CFU-Meg growth. Thus the effects of Tpo on megakaryopoiesis in vitro do not depend on cytokines that signal through gp130. Furthermore, it is unlikely that gp 130 serves as a beta chain for the c-Mpl receptor, as Tpo signalling is unimpaired in the presence of RX187. In contrast, the effects of IL-3 on CFU-Meg growth are mediated in part through Tpo and through gp130-signalling cytokines.","['Broudy, V C', 'Lin, N L', 'Fox, N', 'Taga, T', 'Saito, M', 'Kaushansky, K']","['Broudy VC', 'Lin NL', 'Fox N', 'Taga T', 'Saito M', 'Kaushansky K']","['University of Washington, Division of Hematology, Seattle 98195-7710, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Il6st protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', '143641-95-6 (MPL protein, human)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Heterozygote', 'Immunologic Techniques', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Megakaryocytes/*cytology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*physiology', '*Receptors, Cytokine', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin', 'Signal Transduction', 'Thrombopoietin/*pharmacology']",1996/09/15 00:00,1996/09/15 00:01,['1996/09/15 00:00'],"['1996/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)62401-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Sep 15;88(6):2026-32.,"['CA 31615/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK 44194/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK 49855/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The separation of progenitors is based on the expression of CD34, a marker preferentially expressed on progenitor cells. The dog model has been important for preclinical transplant studies, because it has proven predictive for outcomes in human hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. To identify and isolate canine hematopoietic progenitors, we have cloned a cDNA encoding a CD34 homologue from a canine myelomonocytic leukemia cell line, ML2. The CD34 homologue cDNA predicts an amino acid sequence that is highly conserved with human and murine CD34 in the cytoplasmic domain, transmembrane domain, and C-terminal end of the extracellular domain, but shows considerable divergence from these sequences at the amino-terminal end of the protein. In Western blotting studies, canine CD34 homologue (caCD34) appears to be a heavily and variably glycosylated protein with a molecular weight of approximately 100 kD and shows some tissue-specific differences in protein mass. To evaluate the expression of caCD34 protein, the extracellular domain of caCD34 was expressed as an Ig fusion protein and used as an immunogen to generate a rabbit polyclonal antiserum. The antiserum reacted against the fusion protein, against vascular endothelium, and with three leukemic cell lines. Approximately 1% of canine bone marrow cells stained brightly with antibodies to caCD34 and this population was 25- to 50-fold enriched for colony-forming units-granulocyte-macrophage as compared to unfractionated marrow mononuclear cells. These findings suggest that the canine CD34 homologue is expressed on bone marrow progenitor cells and, thus, that this molecule should be a valuable marker for identifying and isolating canine hematopoietic progenitors for experimental hematopoiesis and stem cell transplantation.","['McSweeney, P A', 'Rouleau, K A', 'Storb, R', 'Bolles, L', 'Wallace, P M', 'Beauchamp, M', 'Krizanac-Bengez, L', 'Moore, P', 'Sale, G', 'Sandmaier, B', 'de Revel, T', 'Appelbaum, F R', 'Nash, R A']","['McSweeney PA', 'Rouleau KA', 'Storb R', 'Bolles L', 'Wallace PM', 'Beauchamp M', 'Krizanac-Bengez L', 'Moore P', 'Sale G', 'Sandmaier B', 'de Revel T', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Nash RA']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/*immunology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Dogs/*genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Recombinant Proteins/immunology', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid']",1996/09/15 00:00,1996/09/15 00:01,['1996/09/15 00:00'],"['1996/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)62398-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Sep 15;88(6):1992-2003.,"['CA31787/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK42716/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,"['GENBANK/U49457', 'GENBANK/U49458']",,,,,,,,,,,

Pretreated severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice implanted with human bone were subsequently given ASGM1 every 7 days for the duration of the experiments. At 12 weeks postimplantation, flow cytometry of cells from pretreated and control animal tissues detected human CD45+ cells in the mouse spleen (mean, 7.8% and 3.4% positive cells, pretreated and control animals, respectively), bone marrow (BM; mean, 16.5% and 4.8% positive cells, respectively), and blood (mean, 5.5% and < 2% positive cells, respectively), and in the implanted human bone (73% and 8.9% positive cells, respectively).

Bone from patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) was also implanted in pretreated SCID mice, and retrieved at 8 weeks for analysis. Comparison of preimplantation and implanted samples showed that the original histology was maintained, and massive infiltration of human CD68+ cells was observed in the mice spleens and BM. Implantation of AML bone in SCID mice facilitates analysis of in situ AML cell interaction with stromal cells in the leukemic state, and therapies against AML can be tested in this system, especially the selective killing of AML cells in the presence of other BM cells. Furthermore, this model requires no exogenous administration of cytokines to maintain human hematopoiesis with both normal or AML bone. Because the structure and function of both normal and diseased human adult bone is maintained, this animal model should facilitate investigation of both normal human hematopoiesis and hematopoietic malignancies.","['Sandhu, J S', 'Clark, B R', 'Boynton, E L', 'Atkins, H', 'Messner, H', 'Keating, A', 'Hozumi, N']","['Sandhu JS', 'Clark BR', 'Boynton EL', 'Atkins H', 'Messner H', 'Keating A', 'Hozumi N']","['Department of Surgery, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Immunoglobulin G)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Bone Transplantation/*pathology', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/immunology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Spleen/cytology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",1996/09/15 00:00,1996/09/15 00:01,['1996/09/15 00:00'],"['1996/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)62396-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Sep 15;88(6):1973-82.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Characterization of these AML progenitor cells may further define growth properties of human leukemia. In vitro incubations with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) have been used for enrichment of normal primitive hematopoietic stem cells. By analogy to normal hematopoiesis, it was hypothesized that primitive leukemic stem cells might be kinetically more inactive than colony-forming cells (colony-forming units-AML [CFU-AML]). To examine this hypothesis, conditions were established for incubation with 5-FU that eliminated all CFU-AML. These conditions selected a 5-FU-resistant AML fraction that was evaluated for its capacity for long-term growth by transplantation into mice with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and long-term culture in the quantitative cobblestone area-forming cell (CAFC) assay. Transplantation of the 5-FU-resistant fraction of four cases of AML into SCID mice resulted in growth of AML. Whereas no CFU-AML survived, 31% to 82% of primitive (week-6) CAFC were recovered from the 5-FU-treated cells. Hematopoietic cells proliferating in the CAFC assay were shown to be leukemic by cytologic, cytogenetic, or molecular analysis. The reduction of AML growth as determined by outgrowth of AML in SCID mice was in the same order of magnitude as the primitive (week-6) CAFC reduction. This indicates that both assays measure closely related cell populations and that the CAFC assay can be used to study long-term growth of AML. These results show a hierarchy of AML cells that includes 5-FU-resistant progenitors. These cells are characterized as primitive (week-6) CAFC and as leukemia-initiating cells in SCID mice.","['Terpstra, W', 'Ploemacher, R E', 'Prins, A', 'van Lom, K', 'Pouwels, K', 'Wognum, A W', 'Wagemaker, G', 'Lowenberg, B', 'Wielenga, J J']","['Terpstra W', 'Ploemacher RE', 'Prins A', 'van Lom K', 'Pouwels K', 'Wognum AW', 'Wagemaker G', 'Lowenberg B', 'Wielenga JJ']","['Institute of Hematology, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'Fluorouracil/*pharmacology', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Point Mutation', 'Time Factors', 'Trisomy', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/09/15 00:00,1996/09/15 00:01,['1996/09/15 00:00'],"['1996/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)62391-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Sep 15;88(6):1944-50.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ara-C induced apoptosis is associated with proteolytic cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and protein kinase C (PKC) delta. However, the signals involved in this response are unknown. The present studies show that ara-C treatment of U-937 cells is associated with induction of a protease activity that cleaves the tetrapeptides Ac-DEVD-pNA and Ac-DMOD-pNA found at the cleavage sites of PARP and PKC delta, respectively. The ara-C-induced protease activity was sensitive to overexpression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL and the baculovirus protein p35. By contrast, overexpression of the cowpox virus protein CrmA blocked apoptosis induced by engagement of the Fas receptor but not that induced by ara-C. CrmA overexpression also had no detectable effect on ara-C-induced cleavage of PKC delta. The results further show that ara-C induces activation of the CPP32 protease by a CrmA-insensitive and p35-sensitive mechanism. Similar results were obtained with cisplatinum, etoposide, and camptothecin. These findings indicate that ara-C and other DNA-damaging agents activate a CrmA-insensitive apoptotic pathway involving CPP32 and that these signals differ from those associated with apoptosis induced by the Fas receptor.","['Datta, R', 'Banach, D', 'Kojima, H', 'Talanian, R V', 'Alnemri, E S', 'Wong, W W', 'Kufe, D W']","['Datta R', 'Banach D', 'Kojima H', 'Talanian RV', 'Alnemri ES', 'Wong WW', 'Kufe DW']","['Division of Cancer Pharmacology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Serpins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (inhibitor of apoptosis, Nucleopolyhedrovirus)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '96282-35-8 (interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme inhibitor)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (PRKCD protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-delta)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Caspase 3', '*Caspases', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', '*DNA Damage', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Isoenzymes/metabolism', 'Protease Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C-delta', 'Serpins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Viral Proteins/pharmacology']",1996/09/15 00:00,1996/09/15 00:01,['1996/09/15 00:00'],"['1996/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)62390-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Sep 15;88(6):1936-43.,['CA29431/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inappropriate apoptosis induction has also been hypothesized to explain the severe thymico-lymphoid atrophy and progressive immune deterioration associated with isolates of FeLV containing variant envelope genes. The influence of envelope hypervariability (variable regions 1 [Vr1] and 5 [Vr5] on virus tropism, viremia induction, neutralizing antibody development and cytopathicity is discussed. Certain potentially cytopathic elements in FeLV SU gp70 Vr5 may derive from replication-defective, poorly expressed, endogenous FeLVs. Other more highly conserved regions in FeLV TM envelope p15E may also influence apoptosis induction.","['Rojko, J L', 'Hartke, J R', 'Cheney, C M', 'Phipps, A J', 'Neil, J C']","['Rojko JL', 'Hartke JR', 'Cheney CM', 'Phipps AJ', 'Neil JC']","['Department of Veterinary Pathobiology, Ohio State University, Columbus 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Prog Mol Subcell Biol,Progress in molecular and subcellular biology,0233223,,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Cats', 'Cytopathogenic Effect, Viral', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*pathogenicity', 'Lymphocytes/pathology/*virology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Retroviridae Infections/*pathology', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*pathology']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/978-3-642-79850-4_2 [doi]'],ppublish,Prog Mol Subcell Biol. 1996;16:13-43. doi: 10.1007/978-3-642-79850-4_2.,"['1 F32 CA60251-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'A1 25722/PHS HHS/United States', 'DK 41066/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",150,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent data on time trends for paediatric cancers are very limited. We report here on trends in the incidence of 15 categories of cancer in children under 15 years of age from 1970 to 1989, using data from the Greater Delaware Valley Pediatric Tumor Registry in the US. Total cancer incidence increased 1% per year (P < 0.001). Neither acute lymphocytic leukaemia, acute myelocytic leukaemia, nor total leukaemia incidence changed significantly. In contrast, the incidence of central nervous system (CNS) tumours rose 2.7% per year (P < 0.001). All three subgroups of this category, glioma, primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET)/medulloblastoma, and other CNS tumours, showed increases. For glioma and PNET/medulloblastoma, trends differed by age, race, and/or gender. Among the other childhood cancers, significant increases were observed for non-Hodgkin lymphoma and neuroblastoma. For osteosarcoma and retinoblastoma, no overall change in incidence was observed, although decreases were observed in some age and race subgroups. The rise in CNS tumour incidence confirms previous reports from the US and Great Britain. The lack of change for acute lymphocytic leukaemia conflicts with other data from the US, but diagnostic changes appear to explain at least part of the discrepancy. The increase in neuroblastoma has also been observed in Great Britain. In contrast to our finding, investigators in the US and Great Britain have reported no rise in non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Analyses for more of the childhood cancers from other registries would aid in detecting and interpreting incidence trends in recent years.","['Bunin, G R', 'Feuer, E J', 'Witman, P A', 'Meadows, A T']","['Bunin GR', 'Feuer EJ', 'Witman PA', 'Meadows AT']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Paediatr Perinat Epidemiol,Paediatric and perinatal epidemiology,8709766,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Distribution', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Delaware/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Maryland/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology', 'New Jersey/epidemiology', 'Pennsylvania/epidemiology', 'Population Surveillance', 'Racial Groups', 'Registries', 'Sex Distribution', 'Time Factors']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-3016.1996.tb00054.x [doi]'],ppublish,Paediatr Perinat Epidemiol. 1996 Jul;10(3):319-38. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-3016.1996.tb00054.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, mice exposed to infectious virus rather than virus-infected cells generate little, if any, antiviral CTL activity. In this report, we show that inoculation of B6 or B6.Fv-1n mice with MuLV prior to priming with H-2-matched AKR/Gross virus antigen-positive tumor cells resulted in a profound inhibition of the virus-specific CTL response. Antiallogeneic major and minor histocompatibility antigen-specific CTL responses were not significantly diminished in MuLV-infected mice. The AKR/Gross MuLV-specific CTL response in B6 mice was inhibited by NB-tropic (SL3-3NB, Friend and Moloney), but not N-tropic (AKR623) MuLV, suggesting that productive infection of host cells was required. We were unable to inhibit the in vitro generation of virus-specific CTL by adding modulator cells from virus-infected mice to mixed lymphocyte-tumor cell cultures (MLTC) of spleen cells from uninfected animals. We also failed to augment CTL generation in MLTC from virus-infected animals by adding exogenous IL-2 or CD4+ lymphocytes from uninfected, tumor-primed mice. Taken together, the data suggested that the inhibition resulted from either a direct or an indirect effect on the in vivo priming of virus-specific CD8+ cells. It is therefore interesting that MuLV such as Friend and Moloney, which do not encode the immunodominant epitope recognized by anti-AKR/Gross MuLV CTL, are nonetheless able to specifically inhibit this response. These results demonstrate a potentially important mechanism by which retroviruses may escape CTL-mediated immunity.","['Coppola, M A', 'Green, W R', 'Rich, R F']","['Coppola MA', 'Green WR', 'Rich RF']","[""Department of Immunology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Viral Immunol,Viral immunology,8801552,,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'AKR murine leukemia virus/*immunology', 'Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/immunology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/vim.1996.9.107 [doi]'],ppublish,Viral Immunol. 1996;9(2):107-19. doi: 10.1089/vim.1996.9.107.,['F32-CA09080/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Skeletal remodeling by osteoclasts and osteoblasts is coordinated by cytokines, which are activated by HTLV-I tax protein via nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B). MC3T3-E1 cells were cocultured with an irradiated HTLV-I-producing lymphocyte cell line, MT-2. After coculture, the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) level in the medium was markedly elevated during the 7 days of culture, and MC3T3-E1 cells underwent apoptotic cell death. Marked apoptosis was also observed in MC3T3-E1 cells treated with MT-2 culture medium and in HTLV-I tax-expressing MC3T3-E1 clones, which both expressed high levels of TNF-alpha. This apoptosis was prevented by treatment with neutralizing anti-TNF-alpha antibody (alpha TNF). HTLV-I tax protein and TNF-alpha induced activation of NF-kappa B in apoptotic MC3T3-E1 cells. Decreased NF-kappa B activation was observed in HTLV-I tax-expressing MC3T3-E1 cells treated with alpha TNF.

Gram-negative organisms are isolated in > 50% of pediatric patients with bacteremia. OBJECTIVES: To analyze clinical and epidemiologic variables associated with Gram-negative bacteremia in a tertiary children's medical center. METHODS: A 6-year prospective study of children with Gram-negative bacteremia in a tertiary care children's medical center in Israel. RESULTS: Three hundred seventy-four episodes of Gram-negative bacteremia were studied during 6 years. The predominant isolates were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli, which accounted for 109, 81 and 79 episodes (26, 20 and 19%), respectively. Of all episodes 43% occurred in neonates and infants younger than 2 years and 47% were hospital-acquired. Underlying conditions mainly acute leukemia and lymphoma, were present in 55% of the patients. Urinary tract infection followed by lower respiratory tract infection were the most common identified sources of bacteremia. Central intravenous catheters were associated with 53% of the episodes. The crude mortality was 11.4%. Increased mortality was significantly associated with acute leukemia, neutropenia, hospital-acquired infections and previous corticosteroid therapy (P = 0.03, 0.003, 0.006 and 0.01, respectively). Increased antibiotic resistance of hospital-acquired vs community-acquired isolates was noted; 44 to 77% resistance of nosocomial Klebsiella and Enterobacter sp. to second and third generation cephalosporins and 18% were resistant to amikacin. CONCLUSIONS: Klebsiella pneumoniae is currently the most common organism causing Gram-negative bacteremia in children. Because of the relatively high resistance of Gram-negative organisms to second and third generation cephalosporins, we suggest that empiric antibiotic therapy for Gram-negative bacteremia include a combination of an aminoglycoside and an anti-Pseudomonas beta-lactam.","['Levy, I', 'Leibovici, L', 'Drucker, M', 'Samra, Z', 'Konisberger, H', 'Ashkenazi, S']","['Levy I', 'Leibovici L', 'Drucker M', 'Samra Z', 'Konisberger H', 'Ashkenazi S']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Schneider Children's Medical Center, Petah Tiqva, Israel.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,Pediatr Infect Dis J,The Pediatric infectious disease journal,8701858,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bacteremia/diagnosis/drug therapy/*epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross Infection/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Female', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections/diagnosis/drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00006454-199602000-00006 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Infect Dis J. 1996 Feb;15(2):117-22. doi: 10.1097/00006454-199602000-00006.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expression of T antigen was driven by the Moloney murine leukemia virus long terminal repeat. Cell lines were selected based on coexpression of neomycin resistance, which provides a selection method believed to be unbiased for transformation state. Astrocyte cell lines derived in this manner express T antigen over a relatively narrow range (approximately 4-fold), are contact inhibited, are able to enter a quiescent state in the presence of growth factors, and do not readily form colonies in soft agar. Compared to mortal astrocytes, the population growth rate is increased 3-fold, saturation densities are 4-fold higher, and the genome is relatively unstable as measured by the presence of DNA-aneuploid stem lines and by changes in DNA ploidy over time. However, changes in transformation phenotype occur at a low rate, making the cell lines amenable to experimentation. Most often, the growth phenotype remained unchanged during months of culture. Transfection of an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene was used to generate a subline that was conditionally transformed (colony formation in soft agar was dependent on transforming growth factor alpha). v-raf transfection was used to generate constitutive transformation. Thus, these cell lines appear to be excellent experimental models for progressive transformation. With them, untested hypotheses of brain tumor progression derived from human genetic studies may be tested experimentally.","['Frisa, P S', 'Walter, E I', 'Ling, L', 'Kung, H J', 'Jacobberger, J W']","['Frisa PS', 'Walter EI', 'Ling L', 'Kung HJ', 'Jacobberger JW']","['Cancer Research Center, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell Growth Differ,Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9100024,"['0 (Antigens, Polyomavirus Transforming)', '0 (DNA, Recombinant)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Antigens, Polyomavirus Transforming/*genetics', 'Astrocytes/physiology/*virology', 'Cell Division/genetics', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cellular Senescence/genetics', 'Clone Cells/physiology', 'Contact Inhibition/genetics', 'DNA, Recombinant/analysis', 'ErbB Receptors/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/physiology', 'Genome', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Phenotype', 'Ploidies', 'Proto-Oncogenes/physiology', 'Simian virus 40/*genetics', 'Time Factors']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Growth Differ. 1996 Feb;7(2):223-33.,"['CA-39207/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-43703/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-41945/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, this study showed that glucocorticoids significantly and preferentially inhibited growth of monocytoid leukemia cells in combination with a low concentration of transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta). Combined 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and TGF beta markedly induced monocytic differentiation of U937 cells, whereas dexamethasone (Dex) and TGF beta essentially did not, although both combinations similarly inhibited the growth of U937 cells. The growth inhibition was accompanied by a block in the cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase (G1 arrest). Expression of glucocorticoid receptors was not affected by TGF beta, although they are induced during the monocytic differentiation of myelogenous leukemia cells and have increased sensitivity to glucocorticoids. The expression of TGF beta receptors also was not enhanced by Dex. TGF beta significantly stimulated glucocorticoid responsive element-mediated transcription activity. Combined Dex and TGF beta stimulated the expression of c-jun and c-fos early responsive genes in U937 cells, although Dex or TGF beta alone did not. The combination synergistically induced expression of c-jun gene, reaching a maximum level at 24 h. On the other hand, expression of c-fos gene was induced by TGF beta alone and increased additively in combination with Dex. Treatment with antisense oligonucleotide complementary to the first exon of c-jun mRNA reduced the growth-inhibitory effect of Dex and TGF beta in a dose-dependent manner. However, exposure of U937 cells to the sense oligomer of c-jun mRNA or an antisense oligomer of c-fos mRNA did not affect the growth inhibition. These results suggested that the preferential expression of c-jun and stimulation of glucocorticoid responsive element-mediated transactivation are closely associated with the growth arrest of U937 cells incubated with Dex and TGF beta.","['Kanatani, Y', 'Kasukabe, T', 'Okabe-Kado, J', 'Hayashi, S', 'Yamamoto-Yamaguchi, Y', 'Motoyoshi, K', 'Nagata, N', 'Honma, Y']","['Kanatani Y', 'Kasukabe T', 'Okabe-Kado J', 'Hayashi S', 'Yamamoto-Yamaguchi Y', 'Motoyoshi K', 'Nagata N', 'Honma Y']","['Department of Chemotherapy, Saitama Cancer Center Research Institute, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell Growth Differ,Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9100024,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/*pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Division/drug effects/genetics', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense', 'Phenotype', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/*drug effects/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogenes/drug effects/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*pharmacology']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Growth Differ. 1996 Feb;7(2):187-96.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For this, we used a previously described variant of an HL-60 cell line (HL-60R) in which retinoid receptor function has been abrogated due to a trans-dominant negative mutation.

In our review of fifty three nodal-based, low and high grade PTCL, MBCs were identified histologically and immunohistochemically in eight of the cases. They included: chronic lymphocytic leukaemia of T-cell type (n = 1) with multiple MBCs clusters, large cell anaplastic lymphoma (n = 1) showing lymphoma cells within multiple MBCs foci, and PTCL of angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy (AILD) type (n = 6) with solitary (n = 4) or multifocal (n = 2) MBCs reaction. Progression from AILD-hyperimmune reaction to PTCL of AILD type could be observed in one case by three consecutive follow-up biopsies. While MBCs proliferation associated with hyperimmune reaction was prominent, in PTCL of AILD type only isolated or small multiple clusters of MBCs were present. In PTCL of AILD type, MBCs seemed to be a residual component of a prior hyperimmune reaction diminishing with progress of the disease. Therefore we assume that the development of PTCL of AILD type from preceding hyperimmune reaction is more common than previously considered. Cytologically, MBCs proliferation associated with PTCL shows two cell types, as described in reactive lymphadenopathies: the common type and the large cell type MBCs.","['Plank, L', 'Hansmann, M L', 'Fischer, R']","['Plank L', 'Hansmann ML', 'Fischer R']","['Department of Pathology, University of Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Pathol Res Pract,"Pathology, research and practice",7806109,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'B-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Peripheral/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/*pathology']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0344-0338(11)80661-8 [pii]', '10.1016/S0344-0338(11)80661-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Pathol Res Pract. 1995 Nov;191(11):1152-8. doi: 10.1016/S0344-0338(11)80661-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While mutant forms of p53 may stimulate cell proliferation and transformation, wild-type p53 may inhibit DNA synthesis and cause leukemic cells to enter apoptosis. Nine bone marrow biopsies of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) with known p53 overexpression were analyzed for evidence of apoptosis of both leukemic blasts and of background hematopoietic cells. This was quantified and compared with that seen in p53- AML and MDS and in normal control marrows. The rate of cell death due to apoptosis was measured by in situ end-labeling of fragmented DNA with the following results: mean values of apoptotic cells/mm2 of BM, p53+ AML and MDS (9 cases), 2.41 +/- 1.7; p53- AML and MDS (10 cases), 0.16 +/- 0.1; control marrows (20 samples), 0.05 +/- 0.0. Our results showed a significant association (P < 0.001) between p53 overexpression and increased apoptosis in all cases studied. The difference was entirely caused by the high rate of cell death observed in the erythroid and myeloid precursor cells of these marrows. These findings suggest that p53+ AML and MDS are a distinct group of marrow disorders characterized by a high rate of intramedullary cell death. This may explain why patients with p53+ leukemic disorders show excessive marrow sensitivity to chemotherapy with prolonged marrow suppression associated with the presence of cytogenetically abnormal blasts that display great drug resistance.","['Orazi, A', 'Kahsai, M', 'John, K', 'Neiman, R S']","['Orazi A', 'Kahsai M', 'John K', 'Neiman RS']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,['0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Apoptosis', 'Bone Marrow/chemistry/*pathology', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/chemistry/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*blood/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*chemistry']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mod Pathol. 1996 Jan;9(1):48-52.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Data for children receiving GH has been collected prospectively on a national database, OZGROW, after informed consent has been given. Adverse events were coded by clinicians and have been analysed in relation to the nature of the event and the underlying diagnosis. There were 2922 subjects analysed, representing 9004 years of GH therapy. 151 subjects reported a total of 210 adverse events giving an overall frequency of 2.3% adverse events/patient treated year. Events that were probably related to GH therapy included peripheral oedema, injection site problems and increased frequency of kyphoscoliosis and slipped epiphysis in some groups. Adverse events were more frequent in growth hormone deficient children who had previously been treated for leukaemia, 8.1%, and in children previously treated for craniopharyngioma, 5.6%. A lower frequency was found for those with a diagnosis of idiopathic short stature, 1.6%, and familial short stature, 0.9%. Kyphoscoliosis was more frequently seen in Turner's syndrome, and slipped epiphyses in adolescent individuals with growth hormone deficiency, especially following treatment for leukaemia. There were no de novo tumours reported but the frequencies of recurrence/patient year for leukaemia, solid cranial tumours and craniopharyngioma were 1.1%, 2.2% and 3.8% respectively. A low frequency of adverse events has been reported on the OZGROW database but subsets of patients may be at increased risk of musculoskeletal abnormalities during GH therapy. The frequency of tumour recurrence during therapy is not different from known rates of recurrence in individuals not treated with GH.","['Cowell, C T', 'Dietsch, S']","['Cowell CT', 'Dietsch S']","[""Robert Vines Growth Research Centre, New Children's Hospital, Westmead NSW, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,J Pediatr Endocrinol Metab,Journal of pediatric endocrinology & metabolism : JPEM,9508900,['9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Australia', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/chemically induced', 'Child', 'Craniopharyngioma/complications/therapy', 'Edema/chemically induced', 'Epiphyses, Slipped/chemically induced', 'Female', 'Growth Disorders/drug therapy', 'Growth Hormone/*adverse effects/deficiency/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Injections/adverse effects', 'Kyphosis/chemically induced', 'Leukemia/complications/therapy', 'Male', 'Nervous System Diseases/chemically induced', 'New Zealand', 'Pituitary Neoplasms/complications/therapy', 'Recurrence']",1995/10/01 00:00,1995/10/01 00:01,['1995/10/01 00:00'],"['1995/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1515/jpem.1995.8.4.243 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Endocrinol Metab. 1995 Oct-Dec;8(4):243-52. doi: 10.1515/jpem.1995.8.4.243.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Workers at Y-12 were exposed to low dose, internal, alpha radiation and external, penetrating radiation, as well as to beryllium, mercury, solvents, and other industrial agents. This paper presents updated results from a long-term mortality study of workers at Y-12 between 1947 and 1974, with follow-up of white men through 1990 and data reported for the first time for women and men of other races. Vital status was determined through searches of the National Death Index and other records, and the workers' mortality was compared to the national population's using standardized mortality ratios (SMRs). Total mortality was low for all Y-12 workers and total cancer mortality was as expected. Among the 6,591 white men, there were 20% more lung cancer deaths than expected (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-1.38). Death rates from brain cancer and several lymphopoietic system cancers were also elevated among white men, with SMRs of 1.28 and 1.46. Mortality from cancer of the pancreas, prostate, and kidney was similarly elevated. There was evidence of excess breast cancer among the 1,073 female workers (SMR 1.21, 95% CI 0.60-2.17). Lung cancer mortality among these workers warrants continued surveillance because of the link between internal alpha radiation exposure and this disease, but other agents, notably beryllium, also merit considerations as potential causes of lung cancer. Other cancers and agents should also be investigated as part of a comprehensive study of the health consequences of the production of nuclear weapons.","['Loomis, D P', 'Wolf, S H']","['Loomis DP', 'Wolf SH']","['Department of Epidemiology, University of North Carolina School of Public Health, Chapel Hill 27599-7400, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Ind Med,American journal of industrial medicine,8101110,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Cause of Death', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/etiology/mortality', 'Lung Neoplasms/etiology/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/etiology/mortality', '*Nuclear Warfare', 'Occupational Diseases/etiology/*mortality', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiation Injuries/etiology/*mortality', 'Risk Factors', 'Tennessee']",1996/02/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0274(199602)29:2<131::AID-AJIM3>3.0.CO;2-V [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1097-0274(199602)29:2<131::AID-AJIM3>3.0.CO;2-V [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Ind Med. 1996 Feb;29(2):131-41. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0274(199602)29:2<131::AID-AJIM3>3.0.CO;2-V.,,,,['Am J Ind Med. 1997 Jan;31(1):121.

Conversion of methotrexate to a high molecular weight polyglutamate metabolite was also demonstrated to occur in human breast cancer cells. Polyglutamates became the predominant form of intracellular drug, both free in the cytosol and bound to dihydrofolate reductase, during a 24 h exposure to clinically achievable methotrexate concentrations. Intracellular retention of polyglutamates led to prolonged suppression of thymidine synthesis and loss of cell viability after removal of extracellular drug. This work identified methotrexate polyglutamates as biologically active enzyme inhibitors in human tumor cells and launched a series of investigations on the interaction of these derivatives with folate-requiring enzymes.","['Schilsky, R L']",['Schilsky RL'],"['Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, IL 60637, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '25513-46-6 (Polyglutamic Acid)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Fluorouracil/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leucovorin/pharmacology', 'Methotrexate/*metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy', '*Polyglutamic Acid']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/stem.140029 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 1996 Jan;14(1):29-32. doi: 10.1002/stem.140029.,['CA 14599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],10,,,,,,,,,,,,

In both lines, it appeared that the uptakes of DNR and ADR were time-, temperature- and concentration-dependent and energy independent, and the transport of DNR consisted of saturable and nonsaturable components. They were pumped out from the cells time-, temperature- and energy-dependently. There were no differences in the accumulation amount of either DNR or ADR between HL60 and HL60/THP cells. Comparing the transport of DNR or ADR with that of THP, the uptake amounts of DNR and THP were approximately equal, and were greater than that of ADR in both types of cell. In cis-inhibition experiments, DNR inhibited the THP uptake noncompetitively in the parent and resistant cells, in contradiction of the previously reported result in which ADR showed competitive inhibition (Nagasawa, K. et al., Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol., in press). The THP accumulation appeared to be increased by preload of DNR and ADR, indicating a counter transport. Thus, DNR and ADR as well as THP might be incorporated via a common carrier-mediated transport system, but DNR uptake in part appeared to follow a nonsaturable transport, and its binding site in the carrier might differ from that of THP and ADR in both HL60 and HL60/THP cells.","['Nagasawa, K', 'Natazuka, T', 'Nomiyama, M', 'Ohnishi, N', 'Yokoyama, T']","['Nagasawa K', 'Natazuka T', 'Nomiyama M', 'Ohnishi N', 'Yokoyama T']","['Department of Hospital Pharmacy, Kyoto Pharmaceutical University, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Biol Pharm Bull,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,9311984,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*metabolism', 'Daunorubicin/*metabolism', 'Doxorubicin/*metabolism', 'Energy Metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Temperature']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1248/bpb.19.100 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Pharm Bull. 1996 Jan;19(1):100-5. doi: 10.1248/bpb.19.100.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of adult acute leukaemias, 80 to 85% are classified as ANLL, with more than half of all patients being aged over 60 years. Although advancing age has been reported to be a poor prognostic factor in ANLL, recent clinical trials have shown good results in patients aged 60 years and over after coadministration of the anthracenedione antineoplastic agent mitoxantrone with cytarabine. In 1 study in particular, which involved patients aged 60 to 81 years, no correlation was found between increasing age and response rate. However results of a major clinical trial showed age greater than 60 years to be associated with poorer outcomes. Mitoxantrone as initial induction treatment is at least as effective as daunorubicin when either drug is given in combination with cytarabine to patients with previously untreated ANLL. Complete response rates in randomised comparative trials were 53 to 67% after mitoxantrone with cytarabine and 37 to 70% after daunorubicin with cytarabine. In a major US study, significantly more patients achieved a complete response after 1 treatment cycle of mitoxantrone and cytarabine than after daunorubicin and cytarabine. Mitoxantrone has also been effective in inducing complete remissions in patients with relapsed or refractory ANLL, mainly in combination with other antineoplastic agents. Overall survival appears similar after treatment with regimens containing either mitoxantrone or daunorubicin in patients with ANLL, although there have been reports of trends towards increased survival rates with mitoxantrone. The incidence of cardiotoxicity appears low in patients with ANLL who have received mitoxantrone. Lower cardiotoxicity of mitoxantrone relative to daunorubicin has not been conclusively demonstrated in patients with ANLL, although trials in patients with breast cancer have shown mitoxantrone to cause fewer cardiac adverse effects than doxorubicin. This is of particular interest in the elderly, as this group of patients is especially susceptible to the effects of anthracycline-induced cardiac toxicity. Thus, mitoxantrone is a suitable first-line agent for the induction of remission in patients with ANLL, with clearly demonstrated efficacy in patients aged 60 years and over.","['Dunn, C J', 'Goa, K L']","['Dunn CJ', 'Goa KL']","['Adis International Limited, Auckland, New Zealand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",New Zealand,Drugs Aging,Drugs & aging,9102074,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Mitoxantrone/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.2165/00002512-199609020-00007 [doi]'],ppublish,Drugs Aging. 1996 Aug;9(2):122-47. doi: 10.2165/00002512-199609020-00007.,,132,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the anti-FeLV effect of IFNalpha was limited by the production of IFNalpha-neutralizing antibodies detected 7 weeks after the start of treatment. AZT without IFNalpha had no effect on circulating virus load. To examine the hypothesis that combination chemoimmunotherapy might induce the clearance of FeLV infection, persistently infected cats were infused with activated lymphocytes, IFNalpha, and AZT 12 weeks after infection with FeLV. Recipient cats received weekly infusions of 1.46 x 10(8) lymphocytes activated in vitro with lectin/IL-2 comprised of 98% T cells and an even distribution of CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes. FeLV infection was cleared in 4 of 9 cats receiving combined therapy after four adoptive cell transfers. These cats remained negative for circulating virus during a 63-day treatment period (17 adoptive cell transfers) despite the production of anti-IFNalpha-neutralizing antibodies. Sequential development of virus-neutralizing and virus envelope antibody titers were detected in those cats which cleared retroviremia, an antiviral response that was absent in untreated control animals or nonresponders. Three of four responder cata remained negative for FeLV 95 days after treatment was discontinued. Treatment of cats with lymphocytes without chemotherapy failed to influence the course of FeLV infection. These results suggest that combined treatment using IFNalpha and adoptive lymphocyte transfer served to reconstitute antiviral humoral immunity, counteract immunosuppression, and induce the reversal of retroviremia.","['Zeidner, N S', 'Mathiason-DuBard, C K', 'Hoover, E A']","['Zeidner NS', 'Mathiason-DuBard CK', 'Hoover EA']","['Department of Pathology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins 80523, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Semin Vet Med Surg Small Anim,Seminars in veterinary medicine and surgery (small animal),8610760,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)']",IM,"['Adoptive Transfer/*veterinary', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Antiviral Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cats', 'Combined Modality Therapy/veterinary', 'Drug Tolerance', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Feline/blood/*therapy', 'Remission Induction', '*T-Lymphocytes', 'Zidovudine/*therapeutic use']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Semin Vet Med Surg Small Anim. 1995 Nov;10(4):256-66.,['N01 AI 72663/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bone marrow transplantation is an alternative to chemotherapy, but there is controversy as to which patients benefit from transplantation. KEY POINTS: Outcome can be predicted by, and therapy tailored to, specific prognostic factors such as age and karyotype. Younger patients with good-risk karyotypes such as t(8;21) and inv16 have a long-term disease-free survival rate of 75% or more with chemotherapy alone. Patients with poor-risk karyotypes have a survival rate less than 10% with chemotherapy alone and may benefit from bone marrow transplantation, which is associated with cures in up to 50% of patients. Most patients do not have a compatible donor for allogeneic transplantation. High-dose chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation is an option for patients with no marrow donor, and has cure rates of as high as 50%. Patients with intermediate-risk karyotypes generally have a survival rate between 20% and 50% with chemotherapy alone. It is uncertain if allogeneic or autologous bone marrow transplantation offers any additional advantage in this group.","['Kalaycioglu, M E']",['Kalaycioglu ME'],"['Department of Hematology and Oncology, The Cleveland Clinic Foundation, OH 44195, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cleve Clin J Med,Cleveland Clinic journal of medicine,8703441,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Patient Selection']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3949/ccjm.63.2.91 [doi]'],ppublish,Cleve Clin J Med. 1996 Mar-Apr;63(2):91-3. doi: 10.3949/ccjm.63.2.91.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AdoMet increased to maximum values 1.5- and 2.3-fold control in cultures treated with c3Ado as single agent and c3Ado plus Hcy, respectively. AdoHcy did not change in cultures treated with c3Ado as single agent, but increased to maximum values 2.0-fold control when Hcy was added. The synthesis of c3AdoHcy was favored by Hcy, and 35- to 70-fold higher levels of c3AdoHcy were found in cultures treated with c3Ado plus Hcy vs. c3Ado as single agent. The amounts of c3AdoHcy in cultures treated with c3Ado at concentrations initiating apoptosis did not exceed c3AdoHcy levels in cultures treated with c3Ado plus Hcy at concentrations not initiating apoptosis. Pretreatment of c3Ado plus Hcy cultures with c3Ari diminished c3AdoHcy and almost completely abrogated apoptosis. Exposure of cells to 100 microM c3Ari as single agent resulted in an increase in AdoHcy to 8.4-fold control but no changes in AdoMet and no initiation of apoptosis. Our findings indicate that c3Ado as single agent exerts its apoptosis-initiating effect through a nontransmethylase-related bio-chemical action. c3AdoHcy seems to be related to biochemical events initiating apoptotic cell death of HL-60 cells when c3Ado and Hcy are combined.","['Endresen, P C', 'Loennechen, T', 'Kildalsen, H', 'Aarbakke, J']","['Endresen PC', 'Loennechen T', 'Kildalsen H', 'Aarbakke J']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Tromso, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors)', '037V4520IY (3-deazaadenosine)', '0LVT1QZ0BA (Homocysteine)', '58316-88-4 (3-deazaaristeromycin)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '7LP2MPO46S (S-Adenosylmethionine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '979-92-0 (S-Adenosylhomocysteine)', 'D5H88XF24X (homocysteine thiolactone)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)', 'M351LCX45Y (Tubercidin)']",IM,"['Adenosine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Homocysteine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Humans', '*Methylation', 'Methyltransferases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'RNA/biosynthesis', 'S-Adenosylhomocysteine/metabolism', 'S-Adenosylmethionine/metabolism', 'Tubercidin/pharmacology']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 1996 Sep;278(3):1318-24.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The recent attention toward apoptosis in virtually all aspects of modern biology indicates that rapid and accurate differentiation between apoptosis and necrotic death is of considerable interest. Apoptosis is distinguishable from necrosis on the basis of several criteria. In this study, we undertook to examine the effects of mild hyperthermia (43 degrees C leading to apoptotic death) and severe hyperthermia (50 degrees C leading to necrotic killing) on associated DNA fragmentation. Using laser scanning and fluorescent microscopic evaluation of DNA ""comets"" in the single cell gel assay, we compared necrotic and apoptotic DNA damage in a variety of human leukemia and lymphoma cell lines at the level of the individual cell. We show that necrotic cells do display detectable DNA damage. We confirm our preliminary report that comet ""tail moment"" is sufficient to distinguish between necrotic and apoptotic DNA damage, while comet tail length may confuse the two forms. We report that a recovery period is necessary for expression of increasing apoptotic but not necrotic DNA damage. We show that apoptosis increases with prolonged hyperthermia and confirm that the mode of death changes from apoptosis to necrosis with higher heat loads, producing a greater fraction of cells showing damage. In addition, we show that for necrotic cells, DNA tail moment reflects sensitivity to prolonged exposure without a concomitant change in tail length.","['Fairbairn, D W', 'Walburger, D K', 'Fairbairn, J J', ""O'Neill, K L""]","['Fairbairn DW', 'Walburger DK', 'Fairbairn JJ', ""O'Neill KL""]","['Department of Microbiology, Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah 84602, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Scanning,Scanning,7903371,,IM,"['*Apoptosis', '*DNA Fragmentation', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/*pathology', 'Lymphoma/genetics/*pathology', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Necrosis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/sca.1996.4950180603 [doi]'],ppublish,Scanning. 1996 Sep;18(6):407-16. doi: 10.1002/sca.1996.4950180603.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The free energy maps are used to determine favorable residue positions that are then combined to form docked peptide conformations. Because the generic backbone structural motif of peptides bound to class I MHC is known, the mapping is restricted to appropriate regions of the site, but allows for the sometimes substantial variations in backbone and side-chain conformations. In a test demonstrating the quality of predictions for a known MHC site using only a rotational and conformational search, we started from the crystal structure of the HIV-1 gp120/HLA-A2 complex, and predicted the HLA-A2 bound structures of peptides from the influenza matrix protein, the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, and the human T cell leukemia virus. The calculated peptides are at 1.6, 1.3, and 1.4 A all-atom RMSDs from their respective crystal structures (Madden DR, Garboczi DN, Wiley DC, 1993). A further test, which also included a local translational search, predicted structures across MHCs. In particular, we obtained the Kb/SEV-9 complex (Fremont DH et al., 1992, Science 257:919-927) starting with the complex between HLA-B27 and a generic peptide (Madden DR, Gorga JC, Strominger JL, Wiley DC, 1991, Nature (Lond) 353:321-325), with an all-atom RMSD of 1.2 A, indicating that the docking procedure is essentially as effective for predictions across MHCs as it is for determinations within the same MHC, although at substantially greater computational cost.

Initial chemotherapy consisted of one 14-day course with single-dose idarubicin plus vincristine-prednisone-L-asparaginase. Idarubicin was preferred to other anthracyclines because of its shorter time to response. Sequential outpatient postremission therapy included single-dose idarubicin plus vincristine-cyclophosphamide-L-asparaginase pulses, cranial irradiation with intrathecal methotrexate-cytarabine, flexible weekly vincristine-cyclophosphamide alternating with cytarabine-teniposide, and two-year standard maintenance with mercaptopurine-methotrexate. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was added to induction and early consolidation courses. Twenty-two patients mainly with high-risk features entered the study: median age was 64 years (60-73), 40% of cases were CD10- B-lineage and T-lineage ALL, 38% of CD10+ B-lineage ALL carried a BCR-ABL rearrangement, while 23% coexpressed myeloid antigen, 86% had L2 morphology, 50% had a blast count greater than 10 x 10(9)/1, 54% had hepato-splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy. The complete remission (CR) rate after induction therapy was 59%. A partial remission was obtained in two cases. There were four early deaths (18%) and three refractory ALL (14%). Median time to response was 21 days. With G-CSF, the median duration of absolute neutropenia was 10.5 days. Flexible postremission therapy was very well tolerated, causing no major toxicity. With a median follow-up of 2.6 years, 3 patients remain alive in first CR (23%), 2 of whom at 21.3 months and 39.6 months, respectively. Median survival of responders was 12 months compared to only 1.2 months for nonresponders (p < 0.001). This moderate-dose idarubicin-containing and G-CSF-supported regimen was associated with a high early remission rate in elderly ALL. Postremission therapy results were modest, though not appreciably different from the general experience in this patient population. Because further escalation of drug intensity appears unjustified, attempts to document and reverse drug resistance patterns and restore a dysregulated apoptosis must be considered.","['Bassan, R', 'Di Bona, E', 'Lerede, T', 'Pogliani, E', 'Rossi, G', ""D'Emilio, A"", 'Buelli, M', 'Rambaldi, A', 'Viero, P', 'Rodeghiero, F', 'Barbui, T']","['Bassan R', 'Di Bona E', 'Lerede T', 'Pogliani E', 'Rossi G', ""D'Emilio A"", 'Buelli M', 'Rambaldi A', 'Viero P', 'Rodeghiero F', 'Barbui T']","['Divisione/Servizio di Ematologia Ospedali Riuniti, Bergamo, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'IVAP protocol']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aging/*physiology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Outpatients', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prednisolone/administration & dosage', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199609051761 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1996 Jul;22(3-4):295-301. doi: 10.3109/10428199609051761.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For this purpose, both methods were applied to 81 bone marrow aspirates and/or peripheral blood specimens comprising 50 CML cases and controls from 31 patients without CML. Independently, core biopsies of these 81 patients were investigated by three histopathologists. Conventional karyotype analysis from unstimulated bone marrow cells was successful in 71/81 cases and demonstrated the Ph-chromosome in 42/46 CML patients. With FISH, results were obtained in all 81 cases investigated, confirming fusion of the ber and abl genes in all cytogenetically Ph-positive patients. Among the five Ph-chromosome-negative specimens bcr/abl fusions were detected in only one patient. The percentage of cells found to be Ph-positive by both methods was correlated, but in individual cases considerable differences in the numbers of Ph-positive cells were observed. Different results may be due to selection of cells after in vitro cultivation predominantly. FISH proved to be a very reliable technique for specimens that do not contain dividing cells. With FISH, large numbers of cells can easily be scored which is an advantage compared to conventional cytogenetics. Therefore, this method is particularly suitable for those whose therapy is being monitored or a relapse is suspected. However, the FISH results should be evaluated critically with respect to the practical limit of sensitivity since non-specific fusion signals can also be observed in a small percentage of cells in non-CML cases. It is suggested that each laboratory define its own threshold of bcr/abl fusion signals for diagnosing Ph-positive CML by FISH.","['Nolte, M', 'Werner, M', 'Ewig, M', 'von Wasielewski, R', 'Wilkens, L', 'Link, H', 'Ganser, A', 'Georgii, A']","['Nolte M', 'Werner M', 'Ewig M', 'von Wasielewski R', 'Wilkens L', 'Link H', 'Ganser A', 'Georgii A']","['Pathologisches Institut, Medizinlschen Hochschule Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic, Atypical, BCR-ABL Negative/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199609051760 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1996 Jul;22(3-4):287-94. doi: 10.3109/10428199609051760.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Between 9/84 and 11/92 we treated 70 patients with etoposide (900-1800 mg/m2), cyclophosphamide (120-180 mg/kg) and TBI (1000-1200 cGy) followed by allogeneic BMT from histocompatible siblings. Forty patients were in untreated first relapse. Median time from diagnosis to transplant was 10 months. Toxicity was similar to that observed with cyclophosphamide/TBI with the median duration of neutropenia (ANC < 500/microliters) being 19 days (range 10-27) and the median duration of thrombocytopenia being 23 days (range 13-173). Twenty-three patients remain in continuous complete remission at a median of 56 months after transplant (range 36-132 months). Probabilities of disease-free survival, persistent/recurrent disease and transplant related mortality are .32, .47, and .37 respectively. Multivariate analysis indicated that grade > or = 2 acute graft-vs-host disease and transplant in untreated first relapse were associated with increased DFS due to reduced relapse risk. We conclude that high-dose etoposide with cyclophosphamide and TBI followed by allogeneic BMT is effective therapy for resistant AML, producing durable remission in approximately one-third of those treated. Disease persistence or recurrence was the major cause of treatment failure. Further improvement in DFS following allogeneic BMT for resistant AML might be achieved by using less intensive GVHD prophylaxis or through infusion of donor peripheral blood cells in patients who fail to develop significant acute GVHD.","['Brown, R A', 'Wolff, S N', 'Fay, J W', 'Pineiro, L', 'Collins, R H Jr', 'Lynch, J P', 'Stevens, D', 'Greer, J', 'Herzig, R H', 'Herzig, G P']","['Brown RA', 'Wolff SN', 'Fay JW', 'Pineiro L', 'Collins RH Jr', 'Lynch JP', 'Stevens D', 'Greer J', 'Herzig RH', 'Herzig GP']","['Department of Medicine, Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri 63110, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/immunology', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', '*Whole-Body Irradiation']",1996/07/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199609051758 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1996 Jul;22(3-4):271-7. doi: 10.3109/10428199609051758.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

B cell superantigens have recently been described, stimulating a restricted subset of B cells, those expressing the VH3 subgroup in their rearranged immunoglobulin genes. A number of murine malignancies have been shown to be due to T cell superantigens acting either on T cells or on B cells: the RCS B cell lymphomas in SJL mice, the radiation leukemia virus-induced T cell thymic lymphomas in C57BL/Ka mice and B cell lymphomas in the murine AIDS. We propose that some human B cell malignancies can be due to a similar type of interaction. B cell lymphomas in AIDS patients were recently suggested to be due to the HIV gp120 envelope glycoprotein, a newly recognized superantigen. It can be speculated that the low grade B cell gastric lymphomas of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) are the result of exposure to the H. pylori pathogen. EBV-related lymphocytic proliferation has also been shown to be related with a restricted repertoire and may constitute another example of superantigen driven proliferation. A classification of the various superantigen-driven lymphoproliferative states is proposed.","['Amariglio, N', 'Rechavi, G']","['Amariglio N', 'Rechavi G']","['Institute of Hematology, Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,['0 (Superantigens)'],IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/physiology', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Superantigens/*physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/physiology']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199609051754 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1996 Jul;22(3-4):237-43. doi: 10.3109/10428199609051754.,,44,,,,,,,,,,,,

The t(15;17) leads to the formation of two reciprocal fusion genes, PML/RARA on chromosome 15 and RARA/PML on chromosome 17; it is responsible for the unique response of the disease to retinoic acid (ATRA) treatment. As was described for chronic myeloid leukemia and its associated t(9;22) [Philadelphia chromosome], variant translocations have been reported in APL, which are either complex translocations involving additional chromosome(s), or simple variant translocations involving only either one chromosome 15 or 17 and any of several chromosomes. Rearrangements of RARA and PML were documented in some of these variant translocations. In contrast, recent molecular analysis of APL cases with cytogenetically normal chromosomes 15 and 17 revealed the occurrence of submicroscopic translocations, leading to the formation of non reciprocal fusion genes, either PML/RARA or RARA/PML only. Detailed analysis of such cases may shed light on the mechanisms of translocation, on the selection of oncogenic products, and on the respective role(s) of the products of the translocation. Demonstration of the existence, in some APL-like leukemias, of masked translocations with involvement of PML and RARA, thus allows to (i) confirm the diagnosis of APL, (ii) adapt the treatment and (iii) monitor the residual disease. Finally APL-like leukemias were recently reported, with either a t(11;17) or t(5;17), resulting in the fusion of RARA to genes other than PML; these patients do not appear to respond to ATRA treatment.

Activated mutant Ki-ras(G12V) is frequently found in human colon cancer and adenocarcinomas of the lung and pancreas. We have transformed BALB/c-3T3 cells by stable transfection of a plasmid directing the expression of the mutant Ki-ras cDNA. To transfer the HSVtk gene into tumor cells we used a Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV)-based retroviral vector that carries the HSVtk gene. In this study we show that the activity of HSV-TK inhibits tumor growth in immune-compromised nude mice following GCV treatment for up to 50 days but is not sufficient to completely eliminate all tumor cells in these mice as evidenced by the occurrence of tumors between 40 and 50 days after tumor cell implantation. By contrast, immune-competent BALB/c mice develop a long-lasting antitumor immunity in response to HSVtk transduction and GCV treatment, indicating that the immune system is important for the long-term tumor suppression in vivo. In the presence of GCV co-culturing of tumor cells with HSVtk transfected cells leads to the efficient killing of HSVtk negative tumor cells. While this retroviral vector independent HSV-TK/GCV-mediated bystander effect is not sufficient to inhibit tumor formation in athymic animals it is very efficient in immune-competent syngeneic mice. Taken together the data indicate that the antitumor activity of HSV-TK is enhanced by an intact immune system.","['Pavlovic, J', 'Nawrath, M', 'Tu, R', 'Heinicke, T', 'Moelling, K']","['Pavlovic J', 'Nawrath M', 'Tu R', 'Heinicke T', 'Moelling K']","['Institute for Medical Virology, University of Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Gene Ther,Gene therapy,9421525,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'P9G3CKZ4P5 (Ganciclovir)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Ganciclovir/*pharmacology', '*Genes, ras', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/therapy', 'Plasmids', 'Simplexvirus/enzymology', 'Thymidine Kinase/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Gene Ther. 1996 Jul;3(7):635-43.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously shown that LIF stimulates proteoglycan release and suppresses proteoglycan synthesis in pig and goat cartilage explants. The aim of this study was to determine whether OSM and related cytokines influence proteoglycan metabolism in pig cartilage explants. Slices of pig articular cartilage were incubated for 6 days in serum free DMEM with or without cytokines. The total proteoglycan content in papain digested cartilage explants and medium was determined by the 1,9 dimethylmethylene blue method. Cytokine activity was assessed by determining the percentage release of total proteoglycan. To evaluate proteoglycan synthesis, cartilage was cultured for 48 h under the same conditions and in the final 6 h the tissue was cultured in sulphate free DMEM containing 35SO4. The radioactivity in the medium and tissue was determined in cetylpyridinium chloride precipitates. Biosynthetic activity was expressed as DPM per mg wet weight of cartilage. Dose dependent stimulation of proteoglycan release and suppression of proteoglycan synthesis were observed with rhOSM. IL-6, IL-11 and CNTF also inhibited proteoglycan synthesis in a dose dependent manner but the degree of inhibition was less than that for OSM and these cytokines had no significant effect on proteoglycan release. New biological effects have been identified for OSM and the related cytokines CNTF and IL-11. All three of these cytokines, like LIF and IL-6, suppress proteoglycan synthesis in pig cartilage explants. This common effect suggests that the gp130 subunit of the receptors for these cytokines may represent a common signalling pathway whereby proteoglycan synthesis is regulated. Whilst OSM and LIF stimulate proteoglycan catabolism; IL-6 IL-11 and OSM do not. Thus these effects are not always coupled and activation of gp130 alone may not be a sufficient signal for proteoglycan catabolism.","['Hui, W', 'Bell, M', 'Carroll, G']","['Hui W', 'Bell M', 'Carroll G']","['Department of Rheumatic Diseases, Royal Perth Hospital, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cytokine,Cytokine,9005353,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cartilage, Articular/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Growth Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-11/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Nerve Growth Factors/pharmacology', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/pharmacology', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Proteoglycans/*biosynthesis', 'Swine']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1043-4666(96)90067-8 [pii]', '10.1006/cyto.1996.0067 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytokine. 1996 Jun;8(6):495-500. doi: 10.1006/cyto.1996.0067.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In combination with reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) we have successfully separated various H2A variants and posttranslationally acetylated forms of H2A variants and H4 proteins in very pure form. An unambiguous assignment of the histone fractions obtained was performed using high-performance capillary and acid-urea-Triton gel electrophoresis. Our results demonstrate that for the analysis and isolation of modified core histone variants HILIC provides a new and important alternative to traditional separation techniques and will be useful in studying the biological function of histone acetylation.","['Lindner, H', 'Sarg, B', 'Meraner, C', 'Helliger, W']","['Lindner H', 'Sarg B', 'Meraner C', 'Helliger W']","['Institute of Medical Chemistry and Biochemistry, Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Chromatogr A,Journal of chromatography.

We have consequently evaluated the content and fate of myeloid progenitor cells (BFU-E, CFU-GM, and CFU-GEMM) in bone marrow preparations from cancer patients in an attempt to uncover factors of importance for their slow hematopoietic recovery after ABMT using three experimental setups. First, we analyzed progenitors in marrow samples from 36 patients [18 AML, 5 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and 13 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL)] exposed to multiple doses of severely myelotoxic cytoreductive regimens and observed that AML patients had suppressed numbers of CFU-GEMM and BFU-E (80% that of normal volunteers) but increased levels of CFU-GM. In contrast, the decrease in ALL patients was more pronounced (50% that of normal volunteers) and demonstrable for all progenitors. NHL patients exhibited normal progenitor frequencies of CFU-GM and CFU-GEMM, whereas their BFU-E counts were found to be increased nearly two-fold. Second, we followed the fate of progenitors through the laboratory manipulations of marrow grafts and found no evidence for selective losses in terms of disease (7 AML, 5 NHL, 1 ALL, and 2 testicular germ cell tumor patients) and progenitor type. Third, we retrospectively evaluated the cell yields of grafts from 121 cases [39 AML, 20 ALL, 22 NHL, 9 Burkitt's lymphoma (BL), 18 Hodgkin's disease (HD), and 13 testicular germ cell tumors] and found those of heavily treated AML, HD, and germinal tumors most affected, with a clear negative correlation in AML patients between age on the one hand and mononuclear cell yield and CFU-GM content on the other. We conclude that the amount of previous chemotherapy and age of patients appear to be among the determining factors on the number of myeloid progenitor cells in cancer patients and that thresholds for acceptability of grafts should take these variables into account.","['Hokland, P', 'Nielsen, B', 'Ellegaard, J', 'Palshof, T', 'Hokland, M']","['Hokland P', 'Nielsen B', 'Ellegaard J', 'Palshof T', 'Hokland M']","['Department of Haematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Hematother,Journal of hematotherapy,9306048,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Child, Preschool', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Female', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Thrombocytopenia/*etiology']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/scd.1.1996.5.279 [doi]'],ppublish,J Hematother. 1996 Jun;5(3):279-88. doi: 10.1089/scd.1.1996.5.279.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Investigation of FITC-labeled as well as PE-labeled BIRMA-K3 resulted in a clear cut-off staining of acute leukemias and CD34+ cell counts in patients submitted to high-dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation.

RBL-2H3 cells preferentially synthesized PGD2 in response to stimulation with low concentrations of antigen or A23187 while higher concentrations also resulted in a marked synthesis of LTC4. The synthesis of LTC4 was dependent upon initial activation of 5-lipoxygenase by IgE/antigen or A23187, since arachidonic acid lone failed to induce LTC4 synthesis. Following the addition of IgE/antigen or A23187 alone, the synthesis of PGD2 and LTC4 was essentially complete by 10 min. To determine whether a limitation of substrate precluded further eicosanoid synthesis, exogenous arachidonic acid was added to washed cells 15-145 min following the initial stimulation with IgE/antigen or A23187, PGD2 and LTC4 synthesis was resumed following the addition of arachidonic acid to washed prestimulated cells, demonstrating that the termination of eicosanoid synthesis in RBL-2H3 cells was nor caused by the inactivation of cyclooxygenase and 5-lipoxygenase. DNP-lysine was added to cells previously stimulated with IgE/antigen to stop receptor aggregation and this greatly inhibited subsequent production of LTC4 following the addition of arachidonic acid, suggesting that ongoing stimulation of Fc epsilon XsRI was required for LTC4 synthesis in this setting. These results indicate that the magnitude of a physiologic stimulus (IgE/antigen) can profoundly affect the arachidonate metabolites produced by mast cells and that the synthesis of these metabolites quickly becomes limited by substrate availability rather than the activity of cyclooxygenase or 5-lipoxygenase.","['Westcott, J Y', 'Wenzel, S E', 'Dreskin, S C']","['Westcott JY', 'Wenzel SE', 'Dreskin SC']","['Department of Medicine, University of Colarado Health Sciences Center, Denver 80262, USA. jay.westcott@uchsc.ed']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Haptens)', '1094-76-4 (epsilon-dinitrophenyllysine)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', '2CU6TT9V48 (Leukotriene C4)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', 'EC 1.13.11.34 (Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)', 'RXY07S6CZ2 (Prostaglandin D2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens/*pharmacology', 'Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase/*metabolism', 'Arachidonic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Calcimycin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Haptens/pharmacology', 'Immunoglobulin E/pharmacology', 'Leukotriene C4/biosynthesis', 'Lysine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Mast Cells/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Prostaglandin D2/biosynthesis', 'Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/09/06 00:00,1996/09/06 00:01,['1996/09/06 00:00'],"['1996/09/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/06 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/06 00:00 [entrez]']","['0005-2760(96)00074-4 [pii]', '10.1016/0005-2760(96)00074-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1996 Sep 6;1303(1):74-81. doi: 10.1016/0005-2760(96)00074-4.,['HL-44122/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

DNA synthesis was initiated from (i) an oligoribonucleotide complementary to the primer-binding sites, (ii) synthetic tRNA(3Lys), and (iii) natural tRNA(3Lys), by the reverse transcriptases of HIV-1, FIV, EIAV, simian immunodeficiency virus, HIV type 2 (HIV-2), Moloney murine leukemia virus, and avian myeloblastosis virus. All enzymes used an oligonucleotide on wild-type HIV-1 RNA, whereas only a limited number initiated (-) strand DNA synthesis from either tRNA(3Lys). In contrast, all enzymes supported efficient tRNA(3Lys)-primed (-) strand DNA synthesis on the genomes of FIV and EIAV. This may be in part attributable to the observation that the U5-inverted repeat stem-loop of the EIAV and FIV genomes lacks an A-rich loop shown with HIV-1 to interact with the U-rich tRNA anticodon loop. Deletion of this loop in HIV-1 RNA, or disrupting a critical loop-loop complex by tRNA(3Lys) extended by 9 nt, restored synthesis of HIV-1 (-) strand DNA from primer tRNA(3Lys) by all enzymes. Thus, divergent evolution of lentiviruses may have resulted in different mechanisms to use the same host tRNA for initiation of reverse transcription.","['Arts, E J', 'Stetor, S R', 'Li, X', 'Rausch, J W', 'Howard, K J', 'Ehresmann, B', 'North, T W', 'Wohrl, B M', 'Goody, R S', 'Wainberg, M A', 'Grice, S F']","['Arts EJ', 'Stetor SR', 'Li X', 'Rausch JW', 'Howard KJ', 'Ehresmann B', 'North TW', 'Wohrl BM', 'Goody RS', 'Wainberg MA', 'Grice SF']","['Division of Infectious Diseases, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Transfer, Amino Acyl)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cats', 'DNA, Viral/*biosynthesis', 'Genome, Viral', 'HIV-1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Horses', 'Humans', 'Infectious Anemia Virus, Equine/genetics/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'RNA, Transfer, Amino Acyl/chemistry/*metabolism', 'RNA, Viral/chemistry/*metabolism', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*metabolism', 'Simian Immunodeficiency Virus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Templates, Genetic']",1996/09/17 00:00,1996/09/17 00:01,['1996/09/17 00:00'],"['1996/09/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/17 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.93.19.10063 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1996 Sep 17;93(19):10063-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.93.19.10063.,"['AI28189/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI31147/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,PMC38336,,,,,,,

Most cases in the high WBC count group elicited the blast suspect flag. The remaining cases of AML and ALL in both the high WBC and normal/low WBC count group were detected by the blast flag, other suspect flags, and/or definitive flags. Only one case of AML-M6 was initially missed using these flag combinations; a subsequent analysis elicited the blast flag. The blast populations in the high WBC count group were localized into characteristic myeloblast or lymphoblast regions of the scatterplot in 82.1% of AML and 63.6% of ALL cases, respectively. However, the remaining cases had indeterminate or aberrant scatterplot patterns, such that an accurate leukemia classification was not possible. The scatterplot pattern also was not helpful in differentiating AML FAB subclasses. The authors conclude that using a combination of appropriate suspect and definitive flags to trigger checking criteria and microscopic review, the Coulter STKS Hematology Analyzer will be successful in detecting virtually all cases of acute leukemia involving the peripheral blood. Although the scatterplots may give useful information, the patterns obtained are not sufficiently distinctive to aid in classifying acute leukemias.","['Hoyer, J D', 'Fisher, C P', 'Soppa, V M', 'Lantis, K L', 'Hanson, C A']","['Hoyer JD', 'Fisher CP', 'Soppa VM', 'Lantis KL', 'Hanson CA']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Hematology/*instrumentation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/*classification/*diagnosis', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*classification/*diagnosis']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ajcp/106.3.352 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1996 Sep;106(3):352-8. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/106.3.352.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Proteins that modulate apoptosis include bcl-2, which inhibits apoptosis, and Fas (CD95, also known as APO-1), which induces apoptosis in susceptible cells bound by Fas ligand (FasL). To characterize precisely the expression of these apoptosis-regulatory proteins in normal and neoplastic hematopoiesis, the authors have performed multiparameter flow cytometric (FCM) analysis in a series of normal and abnormal marrow specimens. Among normal hematopoietic elements, bcl-2 expression was highest in myeloblasts (29 [+/- 9] x 10(3) molecules of equivalent soluble fluorochrome [MESF]), and lymphocytes (28[+/- 7] x 10(3) MESF). bcl-2 was essentially undetectable in granulocytes and nucleated red blood cells, whereas monocytes and B-cell precursors expressed intermediate levels of bcl-2 (11[+/- 4] x 10(3) and 7[+/- 1] x 10(3) MESF, respectively). Fas expression increased with granulocytic and monocytic differentiation; myeloblasts expressed 8(+/- 2) x 10(3) MESF, whereas granulocytes (15 [+/- 2] x 10(3) MESF) and monocytes (28[+/- 5] x 10(3) MESF) displayed relatively greater intensity of staining for Fas. Among lymphoid cells, Fas expression was heterogeneous. B cells expressed lower intensity Fas staining than both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Myeloblasts in 30 cases of myeloid leukemia and myelodysplasia studied for bcl-2 and/or Fas expression manifested variable levels of these molecules (range 9-105 x 10(3) MESF for bcl-2 and 3-33 x 10(3) MESF for Fas). In addition, intraclonal heterogeneity of bcl-2 and Fas expression was seen in certain cases of AML, which correlated with extent of differentiation. Among 28 cases of B-precursor ALL studied for bcl-2 and/or Fas expression, bcl-2 ranged from 22 to 60 x 10(3) MESF (P < .001 versus normal marrow B-cell precursors), and Fas varied between essentially undetectable levels and 6 x 10(3) MESF. In summary, normal marrow subsets display characteristic levels of the apoptosis-regulatory molecules, bcl-2 and Fas. In hematopoietic neoplasms, expression of bcl-2 and Fas varies among cases, and in some instances, within leukemic blast populations. Further study is required to understand the potential significance of this heterogeneous expression of bcl-2 and Fas in hematologic neoplasia.","['DiGiuseppe, J A', 'LeBeau, P', 'Augenbraun, J', 'Borowitz, M J']","['DiGiuseppe JA', 'LeBeau P', 'Augenbraun J', 'Borowitz MJ']","['Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (fas Receptor)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/physiology', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/metabolism', 'fas Receptor/*metabolism']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ajcp/106.3.345 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1996 Sep;106(3):345-51. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/106.3.345.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The LCR consists of four erythroid-cell-specific DNase I hypersensitive sites (HS1 to -4). DNase I hypersensitive sites are thought to represent nucleosome-free regions of DNA which are bound by trans-acting factors. Of the four hypersensitive sites only HS2 acts as a transcriptional enhancer. In this study, we examine the binding of an erythroid protein to its site within HS2 in chromatin in vitro. NF-E2 is a transcriptional activator consisting of two subunits, the hematopoietic cell-specific p45 and the ubiquitous DNA-binding subunit, p18. NF-E2 binds two tandem AP1-like sites in HS2 which form the core of its enhancer activity. In this study, we show that when bound to in vitro-reconstituted chromatin, NF-E2 forms a DNase I hypersensitive site at HS2 similar to the site observed in vivo. Moreover, NF-E2 binding in vitro results in a disruption of nucleosome structure which can be detected 200 bp away. Although NF-E2 can disrupt nucleosomes when added to preformed chromatin, the disruption is more pronounced when NF-E2 is added to DNA prior to chromatin assembly. Interestingly, the hematopoietic cell-specific subunit, p45, is necessary for binding to chromatin but not to naked DNA. Interaction of NF-E2 with its site in chromatin-reconstituted HS2 allows a second erythroid factor, GATA-1, to bind its nearby sites. Lastly, nucleosome disruption by NF-E2 is an ATP-dependent process, suggesting the involvement of energy-dependent nucleosome remodeling factors.","['Armstrong, J A', 'Emerson, B M']","['Armstrong JA', 'Emerson BM']","['Regulatory Biology Laboratory, Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, California 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (Gata1 protein, mouse)', '0 (MAFK protein, human)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (MafK Transcription Factor)', '0 (Mafk protein, mouse)', '0 (NF-E2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (NF-E2 Transcription Factor, p45 Subunit)', '0 (NFE2 protein, human)', '0 (Nfe2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Nucleosomes)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'EC 3.1.21.1 (Deoxyribonuclease I)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Drosophila', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor', 'Globins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'MafK Transcription Factor', 'Mice', 'NF-E2 Transcription Factor', 'NF-E2 Transcription Factor, p45 Subunit', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Nucleosomes/physiology/ultrastructure', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.16.10.5634 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1996 Oct;16(10):5634-44. doi: 10.1128/MCB.16.10.5634.,['GM38760/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,PMC231563,,,,,,,

In contrast, mercuric chloride induces anti-fibrillarin Abs only in SJL and other H-2s mice, and not in BALB/c (H-2d) mice. In the present study, the specificities of autoantibodies induced by pristane and HgCl2 were compared in SJL and BALB/c mice to examine whether these strains are ""programmed"" to make different sets of autoantibodies in response to nonspecific immune stimulation. Unexpectedly, the predominant autoantibodies induced by pristane in SJL mice were neither those characteristic of HgCl2-treated SJL mice nor those associated with pristane-induced disease in BALB/c mice but, rather, anti-ribosomal P, another lupus-related specificity. The autoantibodies were strongly reactive with the C-terminal 22 amino acids of the ribosomal P2 protein, indicating that they exhibited similar fine specificities to anti-P Abs in human SLE and MRL/Ipr mice. Like BALB/c mice, pristane-treated SJL mice developed severe glomerulonephritis characterized by proteinuria, mesangial proliferation, and glomerular immune complex deposits. This is the first evidence that the induction of a lupus-like syndrome by pristane is not restricted to BALB/c mice. The predominance of anti-P Abs in SJL mice contrasts sharply with the predominance of anti-nRNP/Sm and Su, in pristane-treated BALB/c mice, even though the renal lesions were similar in both strains. The data suggest that H-2s does not program mice to produce anti-fibrillarin Abs in response to nonspecific immune stimulation, arguing that autoantibody induction by pristane involves Ag-specific mechanisms.","['Satoh, M', 'Hamilton, K J', 'Ajmani, A K', 'Dong, X', 'Wang, J', 'Kanwar, Y S', 'Reeves, W H']","['Satoh M', 'Hamilton KJ', 'Ajmani AK', 'Dong X', 'Wang J', 'Kanwar YS', 'Reeves WH']","['Department of Medicine, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill 27599, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Antinuclear)', '0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA, Single-Stranded)', '0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (L12E protein, Trypanosoma cruzi)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Protozoan Proteins)', '0 (Ribonucleoproteins, Small Nuclear)', '0 (Ribosomal Proteins)', '0 (Su autoantigen)', '0 (Terpenes)', '0 (fibrillarin)', '0 (snRNP Core Proteins)', '26HZV48DT1 (pristane)', '53GH7MZT1R (Mercuric Chloride)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Antinuclear/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Autoantibodies/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'Autoantigens/chemistry/*immunology', 'Autoimmune Diseases/chemically induced/*immunology', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/immunology', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'DNA, Single-Stranded/immunology', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Female', 'H-2 Antigens/genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immune Complex Diseases/chemically induced/*immunology', 'Immunoglobulin G/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin M/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology', 'Lupus Nephritis/chemically induced/*immunology', 'Mercuric Chloride/toxicity', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred Strains/*immunology', 'Proteins/immunology', '*Protozoan Proteins', '*Ribonucleoproteins, Small Nuclear', 'Ribosomal Proteins/chemistry/*immunology', 'Ribosomes/immunology', 'Species Specificity', 'Terpenes/*toxicity', 'Th2 Cells/immunology/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'snRNP Core Proteins']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1996 Oct 1;157(7):3200-6.,"['AR40391/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'AR42573/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'DK28492/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Evidence for autocrine oncostatin M expression.,3081-8,"Expression of autocrine growth factors by myeloma cells is an important mechanism that may contribute to tumor expansion. IL-6 is one of several cytokines that uses the signal transducer gp130 as a receptor component. Of these cytokines, those that have been shown to be paracrine growth factors for some myeloma cells include IL-6, IL-11, ciliary neurotrophic factor, leukemia inhibitory factor, and oncostatin M (OSM). Only IL-6, however, has been identified as an autocrine growth factor for myeloma cells. In this study we used a panel of three IL-6-responsive myeloma cell lines to investigate the expression of other autocrine growth factor loops. Initial studies employing neutralizing mAbs to IL-6 or gp130 revealed that the growth of the DP-6 and KP-6 cell lines was inhibited by both mAbs, whereas the growth of the KAS-6/1 cell line was inhibited only by the anti-gp130 mAb. Anti-OSM neutralizing mAb also inhibited KAS-6/1 cell growth. Autocrine OSM production by the KAS-6/1 cells was confirmed using a sensitive ELISA. Although the anti-OSM mAb had no significant effects on KP-6 and DP-6 cell growth, OSM was detected in DP-6 supernatants. These results suggest that OSM production and responsiveness by myeloma cells are distinct phenotypes and not necessarily related in all myeloma cells. Finally, we analyzed the significance of OSM-mediated myeloma cell growth by assessing the effects of OSM on normal, in vitro-generated plasmablasts. OSM markedly enhanced plasmablast Ig secretion but did not affect growth. Thus, the nature of the response elicited by OSM in myeloma cells is distinct from its effects on normal B lineage cells. Moreover, because gp130-mediated signaling results in myeloma cell growth, autocrine expression of any gp130-utilizing cytokine has the potential to significantly augment tumor expansion.","['Westendorf, J J', 'Jelinek, D F']","['Westendorf JJ', 'Jelinek DF']","['Department of Immunology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD/immunology/pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Division', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology/pharmacology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/immunology/pharmacology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multiple Myeloma/metabolism/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology', 'Oncostatin M', '*Peptide Biosynthesis', 'Peptides/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1996 Oct 1;157(7):3081-8.,"['CA62228/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA62242/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-AI07425/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Distinct domains that mediate binding and inhibition of endothelial cell function.,3013-20,"We have shown that Leishmania lipophosphoglycan (LPG) inhibits IL-1 beta gene expression in human monocytes. Here, we show that LPG can bind in a time-dependent manner and suppress endothelial cell activation, possibly via specific LPG domains. Endotoxin (10 ng/ml, 4 h) consistently caused endothelium to increase monocyte adhesion (approximately 20-fold). LPG pretreatment (2 microM, 2 h) completely blocked endotoxin-mediated monocyte adhesion. LPG did not grossly suppress endothelial functions because TNF-alpha- and IL-1 beta-mediated adhesion toward monocytes were not affected. Using four highly purified LPG fragments (namely, repeating phosphodisaccharide (PGM), phosphoglycan, phosphosaccharide core-lyso-alkyl-phosphatidylinositol (core-PI), and lyso-alkyl-phosphatidylinositol (lyso-PI)), we examined whether these fragments can independently inhibit endothelial adhesion. In contrast to that of intact LPG, neither the four LPG fragments (2 microM, 2 h) independently nor the co-addition of phosphoglycan and core-P1 fragments blocked the endotoxin-mediated adhesion to monocytes. To determine whether the fragments can reverse the effect of intact LPG, endothelial cells were first pretreated with the LPG fragments (10 microM, 15 min), followed by the addition of LPG (2 microM). All four LPG fragments fully reversed the effect of LPG. Simultaneous addition of LPG fragments and intact LPG caused only partial suppression (approximately 45%), while the addition of LPG fragments 14 min later had no reversal effect. Flow cytometry revealed that only core-P1 and lyso-P1 competitively inhibited (approximately 30%) LPG binding. Conversely, LPG competed with the binding of [3H]lyso-P1 (approximately 30%). Furthermore, mAb against the PGM reversed (approximately 70%) the effect of LPG. Thus, the lyso-P1 domain on LPG mediates binding to endothelial cells, whereas the PGM domain mediates the cell inhibitory effect.","['Ho, J L', 'Kim, H K', 'Sass, P M', 'He, S', 'Geng, J', 'Xu, H', 'Zhu, B', 'Turco, S J', 'Lo, S K']","['Ho JL', 'Kim HK', 'Sass PM', 'He S', 'Geng J', 'Xu H', 'Zhu B', 'Turco SJ', 'Lo SK']","['Division of International Medicine and Infectious Diseases, Cornell University Medical College, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Endotoxins)', '0 (Glycosphingolipids)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (lipophosphonoglycan)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Carbohydrate Sequence', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Endothelium, Vascular/*drug effects', 'Endotoxins/pharmacology', 'Glycosphingolipids/*chemistry/immunology/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Leishmania donovani/*chemistry/physiology', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Macrophage Activation/drug effects', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Structure', 'Monocytes/cytology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Umbilical Veins']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1996 Oct 1;157(7):3013-20.,"['AI20941/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R29HL49883/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37-22624/PHS HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the involvement of Fas-mediated pathway in the killing activity of purified human CD3-, CD16+ NK cells. Fas ligand mRNA was expressed in freshly isolated NK cells. Apoptosis, which was identified by the fragmented chromatin in individual cells, was induced in the cells that expressed high levels of Fas via direct NK-to-target cell interaction or Ab-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, even in Ca(2+)-free medium, in which perforin pores are known not to be formed. Apoptosis in both the presence and absence of external Ca2+ was inhibited by Fab of an anti-Fas mAb. Transfection of the Fas gene in target cells facilitated the induction of apoptosis, compared with the parental cell line. The function of the Fas-mediated pathway in the coexistence of the perforin-dependent pathway was examined in 10 cell lines expressing different levels of Fas by Ca2+ imaging and morphologic observation of single cells. With a certain boundary level, low or high levels of Fas expression in target cells were correlated to a great degree with either acute necrosis due to severe membrane damage after NK-target cell contact or apoptosis at a later period, respectively. We concluded that Fas ligand/Fas interaction is present and plays a significant role in the human NK cell-induced apoptosis.","['Oshimi, Y', 'Oda, S', 'Honda, Y', 'Nagata, S', 'Miyazaki, S']","['Oshimi Y', 'Oda S', 'Honda Y', 'Nagata S', 'Miyazaki S']","[""Department of Physiology, Tokyo Women's Medical College, Japan.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '126465-35-8 (Perforin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/pharmacology', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Base Sequence', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/pathology', 'Calcium/analysis', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*physiology', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*immunology/physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Perforin', 'Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fas Receptor/biosynthesis/genetics/*immunology']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1996 Oct 1;157(7):2909-15.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has become possible to detect disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) at an early stage due to the development of highly sensitive methods which quantitate so called ""molecular markers"". Herein, to evaluate the clinical usefulness of plasmin-alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor complex (PIC) and tissue factor activity in plasma were examined. The first time, monitoring the plasma levels of PIC might be useful for the diagnosis of a pre-DIC condition and for effective control of therapy. We believed that combination assay for both PIC and D dimer will be adequate to differentiate whether the hemostatic abnormalities are induced mainly by DIC or hepatic insufficiency. Recently, new clinical usefulness of PIC has been reported. The PIC/thrombin-antithrombin III complex ratio was lower in patients with poor prognosis than in those with good prognosis, and it was also lower in those with organ failure than in those without it. The tissue factor is a major activator of the coagulation cascade and may play a role in initiating thrombosis. A simple chromogenic substrate assay for the quantitation of tissue factor activity in plasma samples was developed. Abnormally high levels were found in 80% of the patients with DIC, predominantly in patients with non-hematological solid tumors and acute leukemia. Serial determinations of plasma tissue factor demonstrated that plasma tissue factor changes immediately with the course of DIC. Plasma tissue factor did not correlate with hemostatic markers of DIC such as thrombin-antithrombin III complex, PIC, FDP D-dimer. Tissue factor activity correlated well with membrane anchoring region of tissue factor protein levels. Tissue factor activity correlate with tumor necrosis factor alpha levels in patients with non-hematological solid tumors without hepatocellular carcinoma. These findings suggest that the plasma tissue factor is potentially valuable for monitoring the progress of DIC in a limited population of patients.","['Fukuda, C', 'Iijima, K', 'Nakamura, K']","['Fukuda C', 'Iijima K', 'Nakamura K']","['Department of Medical Technology, Tottori University College of Medical Care Technology, Yonago.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Rinsho Byori,Rinsho byori.

DESIGN: A decision analysis and Markov model that described the natural history of the therapeutic process. The Markov model contained two treatment arms (interferon-alpha and hydroxyurea) and eight states of health (complete hematologic remission with cytogenetic response, complete hematologic remission without cytogenetic response, partial hematologic remission, chronic phase without hematologic remission, accelerated phase, blast crisis, bone marrow transplantation, and death). Probabilities, costs, and utilities were obtained from published clinical studies and clinical investigators. MEASUREMENT: Quality-adjusted years of life saved and costs and qualities discounted at 5% per year. SETTING: University medical centers in North America and Europe. PATIENTS: Meta-analysis of results from patients studied in clinical trials. RESULTS: The model's predictions of median survival (69 months with interferon-alpha therapy and 58 months with hydroxyurea therapy) were derived from data in the recent literature. In patients 50 years of age, interferon-alpha improved life expectancy over hydroxyurea by approximately 18 months. The marginal cost-effectiveness of interferon-alpha (incremental discounted cost of interferon-alpha compared with that of conventional therapy) was $34800 per quality-adjusted year of life saved. The model was sensitive to the monthly cost of interferon-alpha therapy (if the cost of interferon-alpha is reduced by one third, the cost-effectiveness becomes $19300 per quality-adjusted year of life saved) but was not particularly sensitive to the costs associated with blast crisis or bone marrow transplantation. The other significant variable was quality of life during therapy with interferon-alpha; when this measure was varied from 70% to 100% of the quality of life during hydroxyurea therapy, cost-effectiveness changed from $123200 to $25620 per quality-adjusted year of life saved. When the quality of life associated with interferon-alpha was less than 62% of the quality of life associated with hydroxyurea, the discounted quality-adjusted life expectancy with interferon-alpha was less than that with hydroxyurea. CONCLUSION: Compared with hydroxyurea, interferon-alpha is, in most clinical scenarios, a cost-effective initial therapy for patients with chronic-phase CML who can tolerate the drug.","['Kattan, M W', 'Inoue, Y', 'Giles, F J', 'Talpaz, M', 'Ozer, H', 'Guilhot, F', 'Zuffa, E', 'Huber, S L', 'Beck, J R']","['Kattan MW', 'Inoue Y', 'Giles FJ', 'Talpaz M', 'Ozer H', 'Guilhot F', 'Zuffa E', 'Huber SL', 'Beck JR']","['Information Technology Program, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Ann Intern Med,Annals of internal medicine,0372351,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/economics/*therapeutic use', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Decision Support Techniques', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/economics/therapeutic use', 'Interferon-alpha/economics/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*drug therapy', 'Markov Chains', 'Middle Aged', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.7326/0003-4819-125-7-199610010-00002 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Intern Med. 1996 Oct 1;125(7):541-8. doi: 10.7326/0003-4819-125-7-199610010-00002.,"['LM04905/LM/NLM NIH HHS/United States', 'LM07093/LM/NLM NIH HHS/United States']",,,['Ann Intern Med. 1997 Apr 15;126(8):664-5.

There were 59 cattle studied, the majority during 1991, when a severe environmental stress occurred, each with one or more primary causes of death, natural or by euthanasia, and most with several secondary diseases. The encephalitis was characterized by meningeal, perivascular and parenchymal infiltration with lymphocytes, occasional plasma cells and macrophages with perivascular edema in some cows. Affected areas included the cerebrum, cerebellum, and spinal cord with no particular distribution pattern recognized. The lymphoid depletion was primarily an absence of follicular development in nodes draining regions with secondary infections such as chronic mastitis and chronic suppurative pododermatitis. Paucity of lymphocytes in thymic-dependent regions of lymph nodes and the spleen suggested a primary depletion of T cells. Secondary infections were often multiple with each cow having several minor conditions, usually considered short-term and treatable. These included mastitis and pododermatitis, with many cows having non-responding abscesses, cellulitis and myositis attributed to injection site infections. A large number of the cattle had parturition difficulties such as dystocia, obturator paralysis, and metritis. Pulmonary, cardiovascular, and intestinal disease were recognized as both primary and secondary disease conditions. There was a high level of infection with bovine leukemia virus with 4 of the 59 cattle having lymphosarcoma. Under practical conditions, the infection with BIV has a different effect on the host than has been observed under experimental conditions. The presence of BIV combined with the stresses associated with parturition and a modern dairy production system were considered causal for the development of untreatable secondary diseases in immunocompromised cattle.

METHODS: The first group included 302 cancer cases received from the Wisconsin Eye Bank between 1988 and 1993. In the second group, ocular pathology records at the Wilmer Institute from 1976 to 1980 were analysed for ocular metastases in necropsy subjects dying of cancer. Nonocular cancer was the cause of death in 741 cases; among these, 510 were attributed to carcinomas. RESULTS: In the Wisconsin Eye Bank group, three cases (1%) had gross metastases. Out of 255 carcinoma cases, one (0.4%) had gross metastases. In the Wilmer Institute group, gross metastases were observed in 35 (4.7%) cases. Of the 510 patients dying of carcinomas, six (1.2%) had macroscopic metastases. Ocular metastases were detected histopathologically in 93 of 741 (12.6%) of cases. CONCLUSION: Even though it is difficult to assess the true frequency of ocular metastases in patients dying of cancer, the answer to this question was attempted by determining the frequency of ocular metastasis in patients who died of cancer and who donated their eyes to the Wisconsin Eye Bank or had postmortem examination at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. Microscopic metastases were found in 12.6% of cases. The frequency of gross metastases has decreased over the past 12 years from 4.7% to 1% (p value = 0.005) owing to improved treatment of leukaemia; however, the frequency of macroscopic metastases due to carcinomas has not changed (p value = 0.38).","['Eliassi-Rad, B', 'Albert, D M', 'Green, W R']","['Eliassi-Rad B', 'Albert DM', 'Green WR']","['Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, University of Wisconsin Medical School, Madison, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Ophthalmol,The British journal of ophthalmology,0421041,,IM,"['Autopsy', 'Eye Banks', 'Eye Neoplasms/*epidemiology/pathology/*secondary', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/mortality', 'Wisconsin/epidemiology']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/bjo.80.2.125 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Ophthalmol. 1996 Feb;80(2):125-8. doi: 10.1136/bjo.80.2.125.,['EY01917/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,PMC505402,,,,,,,

The pHi was controlled by changing the pH of media as well as by interfering with the pHi regulatory mechanisms with 3-amino-6-chloro-5-(1-homopiperidyl)-N-(diaminomethylene) pyrazincarboxamide (HMA; an inhibitor of Na+/H+ antiport), 4-diiosothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'disulfonic acid, (DIDS; an inhibitor of Na(+)-dependent HCO3-/Cl- exchange) and nigericin (a K+ ionophore). The [Ca2+]i was increased with ionomycin, a Ca2+ ionophore. The apoptosis of HL-60 cells was measured with conventional agarose gel electrophoresis for DNA fragmentation and also with the release of 3H from 3H-thymidine-labelled DNA. Based on the magnitude of DNA fragmentation and 3H release at different pHi, it was shown that apoptosis occurred in HL-60 cells when the pHi was lowered from normal pHi of 7.4 to about 7.2-6.7 with a peak increase at pHi 6.8-6.9. Addition of 4 microM ionomycin to RPMI 1640 medium, which contained 615 microM Ca2+, elevated the apoptosis in the cells. Such an increase in apoptosis by ionomycin in HL-60 cells appeared to result from both an increase in [Ca2+]i and from a decline in pHi. The results indicate that the acidic intratumour environment may greatly affect the response of neoplastic tissues to hyperthermia, radiation and chemotherapeutic drugs which cause apoptosis.","['Park, H J', 'Makepeace, C M', 'Lyons, J C', 'Song, C W']","['Park HJ', 'Makepeace CM', 'Lyons JC', 'Song CW']","['Department of Microbiology, Inha University, Inchon, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,"['0 (Ionophores)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Calcium/*analysis', '*DNA Damage', 'HL-60 Cells/chemistry/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration/*drug effects', 'Ionomycin/*pharmacology', 'Ionophores/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0959-8049(95)00606-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0959-8049(95)00606-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 1996 Mar;32A(3):540-6. doi: 10.1016/0959-8049(95)00606-0.,"['CA13353/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA44114/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

These leukemias generally have one allele involved in a rearrangement, while the remaining allele is uninvolved and demonstrates a germline MLL configuration. In this study, we describe a leukemic cell line that does not have a germline MLL allele and thus cannot produce a normal MLL gene product. We show that the ML-1 cell line, derived from a patient with acute myeloid leukemia, has one allele involved in a t(6;11)(q27;q23), while the remaining MLL allele is deleted. Cloning of the genomic breakpoints on the derivative(6) and der(11) chromosomes demonstrated a balanced translocation between MLL on chromosome band 11q23 and AF6 on chromosome band 6q27. Sequence analysis of the derivative chromosomes revealed that a 186-bp segment of MLL intron 6, downstream of the breakpoint, had been duplicated, inverted, and inserted between MLL and AF6 on the der(11) chromosome. In light of the fact that ML-1 cells can be induced to differentiate along the granulocyte and macrophage lineages, the finding that ML-1 lacks a germline MLL allele demonstrates that a normal MLL gene is not required for survival, proliferation, or differentiation of this cell line.","['Strout, M P', 'Mrozek, K', 'Heinonen, K', 'Sait, S N', 'Shows, T B', 'Aplan, P D']","['Strout MP', 'Mrozek K', 'Heinonen K', 'Sait SN', 'Shows TB', 'Aplan PD']","['Division of Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosome Banding', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', '*Gene Deletion', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Restriction Mapping', '*Transcription Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/07/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1098-2264(199607)16:3<204::AID-GCC8>3.0.CO;2-2 [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1098-2264(199607)16:3<204::AID-GCC8>3.0.CO;2-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1996 Jul;16(3):204-10. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1098-2264(199607)16:3<204::AID-GCC8>3.0.CO;2-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These therapy-induced antibodies (Tab) were compared with IFN-alpha-specific autoantibodies (Aab) from two patients with systemic lupus erythematosus who had never received any exogenous IFN-alpha. Although IFN-alpha subtypes are closely related in structure, Tab inhibited the antiviral activity of only recombinant (r)IFN-alpha 2 and rIFN-alpha 6, but not or slightly that of rIFN-alpha 1, -alpha 7, -alpha 8 and -alpha 14. Furthermore, of four different rIFN-alpha 1/alpha 2 hybrids tested, Tab inhibited only those which contained the N-terminal residues 17-64 of rIFN-alpha 2. Comparison of the primary sequences of neutralized and not neutralized subtypes suggests an epitope involving the residues 22-31 of IFN-alpha 2 is recognized. Thus, Tab block rIFN-alpha 2 by reacting with only one of two functional domains.

METHODS: CSF tPA and urokinase (uPA) activities were studied using an immunocapture assay and zymography in 44 patients with neurological disease and 20 reference subjects. The patient group comprised three patients with meningitis, 21 with encephalitis, nine with acute lymphoblastic (n = 7) and myeloid (n = 2) leukaemia, seven with multiple sclerosis, three with facial paresis, and one with polyradiculitis. RESULTS: Raised tPA activities were observed in patients with multiple sclerosis, leukaemia and encephalitis. In contrast, there were no differences in the mean activities of tPA in patients with meningitis or other diseases compared with the reference subjects. The highest tPA activities were found in patients with multiple sclerosis. The mean activity in patients with leukaemia was higher than in those with meningitis and polyradiculitis, but not encephalitis and facial paresis. Although the CSF tPA activity correlated positively with age in reference subjects, no correlation was observed in patients. Samples were qualitatively screened for both tPA and uPA activity by zymography and positive samples were quantitated. Some of the samples had quantifiable levels of uPA activity: three of seven multiple sclerosis samples, 10 of 21 samples from patients with encephalitis and five of nine leukaemic samples. The highest activities were recorded in patients with leukaemia. uPA was not detected in the CSF of the patients with meningitis, facial paresis or polyradiculitis.

These results suggest that the interferon-gamma-induced inducible NO synthase induction involves activation of Jak2-STAT1 alpha pathway in both glial cells and macrophages.","['Kitamura, Y', 'Takahashi, H', 'Nomura, Y', 'Taniguchi, T']","['Kitamura Y', 'Takahashi H', 'Nomura Y', 'Taniguchi T']","['Department of Neurobiology, Kyoto Pharmaceutical University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Eur J Pharmacol,European journal of pharmacology,1254354,"['0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Interferon)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak2 protein, rat)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Macrophages/drug effects/enzymology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Neuroglia/drug effects/*enzymology', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase/*metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Rabbits', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Interferon/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology']",1996/06/13 00:00,1996/06/13 00:01,['1996/06/13 00:00'],"['1996/06/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/13 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/13 00:00 [entrez]']","['0014-2999(96)00212-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0014-2999(96)00212-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharmacol. 1996 Jun 13;306(1-3):297-306. doi: 10.1016/0014-2999(96)00212-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These tumours, including neuroblastoma, meningioma, low-grade astrocytoma and medulloblastoma express somatostatin receptors and can be imaged effectively using 111In-octreotide. In addition to improved imaging techniques, somatostatin analogues are being developed for use in radioreceptor-guided surgery, as a component of adjuvant chemotherapy and for supportive treatment. Radioreceptor-guided surgery utilises 125I-Tyr3-octreotide or 125I-lanreotide to detect tumour foci within minutes of injection. It allows the detection of 0.1-1.0 mg tumour (1 x 10(5) to 1 x 10(6) tumour cells). This technique has successfully located foci of occult tumour in children with neuroblastoma. Somatostatin analogues are also currently being studied as tumour growth inhibitors between regular chemotherapy cycles and for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced pancreatitis in children with leukaemia. Research on somatostatin receptor subtype expression in paediatric tumours suggests that further investigation of analogue effects on growth inhibition and induction of differentiation will contribute to improved therapy for children with solid tumours.","['Albers, A R', ""O'Dorisio, M S""]","['Albers AR', ""O'Dorisio MS""]","['Department of Paediatrics, Ohio State University College of Medicine, Columbus, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Digestion,Digestion,0150472,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Hormone Antagonists)', '0 (Receptors, Somatostatin)', '51110-01-1 (Somatostatin)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Hormone Antagonists/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/diagnosis/diagnostic imaging/*drug therapy', 'Radionuclide Imaging', 'Receptors, Somatostatin/metabolism', 'Somatostatin/*analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000201392 [doi]'],ppublish,Digestion. 1996;57 Suppl 1:38-41. doi: 10.1159/000201392.,,32,,,,,,,,,,,,

B-cell lymphomas and T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia are much more prevalent in developing countries where the chances of acquiring infections especially at a younger age are high. B-cell precursor acute lymphatic leukemia, however, are much more prevalent in the Western world. Many infectious agents are associated with lymphatic malignancies. Epstein-Barr virus is involved in African Burkitt's lymphoma, human immunodeficiency virus-related Burkitt's lymphoma, lymphoproliferative syndrome post-transplantation, and Hodgkin's disease. Other infectious agents which may play a role in lymphoproliferative disorders are human immunodeficiency virus in acquired immune deficiency syndrome-associated lymphoma, human T-lymphotropic virus in adult T-cell lymphoma, Helicobacter pylori in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, theileriosis in lymphoproliferative syndrome in cattle, Avian leukosis virus in chicken bursal lymphoma, and possibly a bacterial infection in immunoproliferative small intestine disease, potentially reversed by antibiotic therapy. The association between infectious agents and hematologic malignancies may be explained by the creation of large populations of activated cells followed by higher occurrences of 'genetic accidents'. This theory may be reinforced in at least some malignancies with the existence of viral proteins which either have complex relationships with key cellular gene products like p53 and Rb which have roles in cell cycle control, or share common motifs with bc1-2, therefore operating as anti-apoptotic elements. Whenever these genes are deranged, cell deoxysibonucleic acid repair or apoptosis are no longer possible, thereby creating a state of genome instability, increased acquisition of mistakes, and increased chances for malignant transformation.","['Toren, A', 'Ben-Bassat, I', 'Rechavi, G']","['Toren A', 'Ben-Bassat I', 'Rechavi G']","['Institute of Hematology, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Blood Rev,Blood reviews,8708558,"['0 (Carcinogens, Environmental)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinogens, Environmental/*adverse effects', 'Helicobacter pylori', 'Humans', 'Infections/*complications', 'Lymphoma/*etiology/microbiology/virology']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0268-960X(96)90037-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s0268-960x(96)90037-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Rev. 1996 Jun;10(2):89-94. doi: 10.1016/s0268-960x(96)90037-5.,,63,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our present data show that this MAA is encoded by the env gene of an ecotropic retrovirus produced by B16 melanoma cells. Transfection of H-2Kb or H-2Kd genes into two individual clones isolated from B16BL6 melanoma, BL6-8 (H-2Kb-, H-2Db+) and BL6-2 (H-2Kb-, H-2Db-), resulted in a loss of MAA expression. Electron immunohistochemical analysis of melanoma cells and reverse transcriptase assay revealed that the loss of MAA expression in the H-2K gene-transfected cells paralleled the elimination of retroviral particles. In contrast, expression of the endogenous H-2Db gene or transfection with the H-2Dd or H-2Ld gene had no effect on MAA expression or retrovirus production. Northern blot analysis showed equivalent retroviral messages in retrovirus-producing and -nonproducing BL6 melanoma clones. Southern blot analysis revealed that H-2Kb-negative BL6 melanoma cells contain at least four different ecotropic retroviruses with different insertion sites that somatically emerged during malignant transformation or progression. Restriction enzyme analysis showed various changes in proviral DNAs from the H-2Kb- and H2Kd-transfected cells that failed to produce retroviral particles. The observed alterations in the patterns of PstI- and HindIII-digested proviral DNA were found to be due to the appearance of PstI and loss of HindIII restriction sites in the pol region as a result of several nucleotide substitutions. Thus, BL6 melanoma cells produce melanoma-specific ecotropic murine leukemia viruses that encode serologically detectable cell surface MAA. The transfection of BL6 melanoma cells with H-2Kb or H2Kd genes but not H-2Dd or H-2Ld genes resulted in a loss of MAA expression that was attributed to the changes in proviral DNA and loss of melanoma-specific ecotropic retrovirus particle production.","['Li, M', 'Muller, J', 'Xu, F', 'Hearing, V J', 'Gorelik, E']","['Li M', 'Muller J', 'Xu F', 'Hearing VJ', 'Gorelik E']","['University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Pennsylvania 15213, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (H-2K(K) antigen)', '0 (H-2Kb protein, mouse)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigen H-2D)', '0 (Melanoma-Specific Antigens)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Defective Viruses/genetics/immunology/*physiology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, env/*biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', '*Genes, MHC Class I', 'Genes, env', 'Genes, pol', 'H-2 Antigens/genetics/*physiology', 'Histocompatibility Antigen H-2D', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/immunology/*physiology', 'Melanoma, Experimental/genetics/*immunology/virology', 'Melanoma-Specific Antigens', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Point Mutation', 'Proviruses/genetics/immunology/physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis/genetics', 'RNA, Viral/analysis/genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Transfection', '*Virus Replication']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1996 Oct 1;56(19):4464-74.,['CA59903/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

TALL-104 purging efficacy was lower if the marrows were infiltrated by >/= 30%. Ex vivo purging with a human lymphokine-activated killer cell preparation in the same conditions proved to be less effective. The overall data indicate the potent antileukemic effects of TALL-104 cells in vivo and provide evidence that xenogeneic effectors can induce tumor regression via a dual mechanism of direct tumoricidal activity and recruitment of endogenous antitumor immunity.","['Cesano, A', 'Visonneau, S', 'Pasquini, S', 'Rovera, G', 'Santoli, D']","['Cesano A', 'Visonneau S', 'Pasquini S', 'Rovera G', 'Santoli D']","['The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Apoptosis', 'Bone Marrow Purging/*methods', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'DNA Replication', 'Humans', 'Immunocompetence', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/*therapy', 'Radiation Chimera', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology/radiation effects/transplantation', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1996 Oct 1;56(19):4444-52.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both drugs were comparable as inhibitors of the glutamate-induced assembly of purified tubulin, with D10 being slightly more potent. CP1, like D10, was a noncompetitive inhibitor of the binding of [3H]vinblastine to tubulin (apparent Ki, 3.9 microM); and the depsipeptide was a competitive inhibitor of the binding of [3H]D10 to tubulin (apparent Ki, 2.1 microM). CP1 was less potent than D10 as an inhibitor of nucleotide exchange on tubulin, but the two drugs were equivalent in stabilizing the colchicine binding activity of tubulin. CP1, like D10, caused the formation of extensive structured aggregates of tubulin when present in stoichiometric amounts relative to the protein. Whereas at lower concentrations the drugs were equivalent in causing formation of small oligomers detected by gel permeation high-performance liquid chromatography, there were notable differences in the aggregation reactions induced by the two drugs.

These results suggest that the use of mdr1 antisense ODNs in combination with standard antineoplastic drugs might be useful in reversing MDR in vitro and in vivo.","['Cucco, C', 'Calabretta, B']","['Cucco C', 'Calabretta B']","['Kimmel Cancer Institute, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107-6799, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells/*drug effects/transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/genetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Vincristine/*pharmacology']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1996 Oct 1;56(19):4332-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Monocytes are the key element in this process because they intervene first at the biomaterial implantation site during inflammatory reaction. In this work, in vitro studies were conducted on an ultrastructural scale to determine the specific behavior of these cells with regard to a calcium phosphate (CaP) ceramic. Two types of phagocytosis were observed when cells came into contact with the biomaterial: either CaP crystals were taken up alone and then dissolved in the cytoplasm after disappearance of the phagosome membrane or they were incorporated together with large quantities of culture medium, in which case dissolution occurred after the formation of heterophagosomes. Phagocytosis of CaP coincided with autophagy and the accumulation of residual bodies in the cells. Addition of HILDA/LIF factor to these cultures induced a very marked decrease in phagocytotic activity directed at the capture of CaP crystals and culture medium. Autophagy was reduced, and residual bodies were rare or absent. This study specifies the role of monocytes in CaP biodegradation and demonstrates for the first time that HILDA/LIF has a biological effect on this cell line.","['Benahmed, M D', 'Heymann, D', 'Berreur, M', 'Cottrel, M', 'Godard, A', 'Daculsi, G', 'Pradal, G']","['Benahmed MD', 'Heymann D', 'Berreur M', 'Cottrel M', 'Godard A', 'Daculsi G', 'Pradal G']","['Centre de Recherche Interdisciplinaire sur les Tissus Calcifies et les Biomateriaux, Nantes, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Histochem Cytochem,The journal of histochemistry and cytochemistry : official journal of the Histochemistry Society,9815334,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '91D9GV0Z28 (Durapatite)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biodegradation, Environmental/drug effects', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Ceramics/*metabolism', 'Cricetinae', 'Durapatite/*metabolism', 'Foreign-Body Reaction/metabolism/*pathology', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Macrophages/drug effects/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Monocytes/drug effects/*metabolism/ultrastructure', '*Phagocytosis', 'Phagosomes/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/44.10.8813078 [doi]'],ppublish,J Histochem Cytochem. 1996 Oct;44(10):1131-40. doi: 10.1177/44.10.8813078.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PCR amplified HIV-1 DNA was detected, on average, in about 30% and 20% of the CD4 and CD21 dendritic cells, respectively, in and around the expanded germinal centers of hyperplastic lymph nodes in seropositive, asymptomatic people. PCR-amplified EBV DNA was noted, on average, in about 20% of L26 B-cells. The amplified HIV-1 DNA was noted in rare non-neoplastic cells in five AIDS-related lymphomas; the other three cases were negative for the viral DNA. Amplified EBV DNA was detected in five of eight lymphomas but in only three of these tissues did the viral DNA localize to the malignant cells. We conclude that although many cells in hyperplastic lymph nodes from people with early HIV-1 infection contain HIV-1 and EBV DNA, these viruses are of ten absent in the malignant cells of AIDS-related lymphoma. This suggests that although infection by these viruses and the concomitant lymphoid hyperplasia may predispose to lymphoma, the viruses are not required for maintenance of the malignant phenotype.","['Becker, J L', 'Steigbigel, R T', 'Nuovo, G J']","['Becker JL', 'Steigbigel RT', 'Nuovo GJ']","['Department of Pathology, State University of New York, Stony Brook, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Histochem Cytochem,The journal of histochemistry and cytochemistry : official journal of the Histochemistry Society,9815334,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'DNA, Viral/*analysis', 'Female', 'HIV-1/genetics/*isolation & purification/pathogenicity', 'Herpesviridae Infections/*virology', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/genetics/*isolation & purification/pathogenicity', 'Hodgkin Disease/virology', 'Humans', '*In Situ Hybridization', 'Lymph Nodes/chemistry/*virology', 'Lymphoma, AIDS-Related/chemistry/*virology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/chemistry/virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/chemistry/*virology', 'Proviruses/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*virology']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/44.10.8813072 [doi]'],ppublish,J Histochem Cytochem. 1996 Oct;44(10):1085-9. doi: 10.1177/44.10.8813072.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Indirect standardization (SIR) based on comparison populations in Connecticut (USA), Canada and Denmark showed excess risk of cancer of the lung, nasopharynx, salivary glands, gallbladder and extrahepatic bile ducts in both sexes, of liver and stomach cancer in men, and renal and cervical cancer in women. Low risk was observed for cancer of the bladder, breast, endometrium and prostate, and for non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, leukaemia, multiple myeloma and melanoma. Age-standardized incidence rates (ASRs) of cancer of lung, cervix, nasopharynx and salivary glands among Inuit were among the world's highest as were rates in women of oesophageal and renal cancer. Regional differences in ASRs within the Circumpolar area were observed for cancer of the cervix, lung, colon and rectum, liver, gallbladder and breast. The differences in the Inuit cancer incidence pattern to some extent reflect known variations in lifestyle, diet and other exposures, as well as implementation of cancer control measures. Future research addressing possible individual differences are needed to evaluate environmental and genetic factors in etiology and evaluate intervention studies.","['Nielsen, N H', 'Storm, H H', 'Gaudette, L A', 'Lanier, A P']","['Nielsen NH', 'Storm HH', 'Gaudette LA', 'Lanier AP']","['Institute of Forensic Medicine, University of Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Acta Oncol,"Acta oncologica (Stockholm, Sweden)",8709065,,IM,"['Alaska/epidemiology/ethnology', 'Alcohol Drinking/epidemiology', 'Arctic Regions/epidemiology/ethnology', 'Canada/epidemiology/ethnology', 'Feeding Behavior', 'Female', 'Forecasting', 'Greenland/epidemiology/ethnology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Inuits/*statistics & numerical data', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/ethnology/genetics/prevention & control', 'Registries/statistics & numerical data', 'Reproduction', 'Research', 'Russia/epidemiology/ethnology', 'Sexual Behavior', 'Smoking/epidemiology']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/02841869609096996 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Oncol. 1996;35(5):621-8. doi: 10.3109/02841869609096996.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its water-soluble derivative, CPT-11, has higher therapeutic efficacy and less toxicity than CPT. Recently, CPT-treated cells have been shown to undergo apoptosis. However, the mechanism of induction of apoptosis by CPT has not been characterized in detail in any type of cells. On the other hand, interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme (ICE) is a mammalian homologue of CED3, a protein required for apoptosis in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. To determine how CPT-11 brings about cell death by apoptosis, we investigated the effects of CPT-11 on the expression of ICE activity in K562 cells, which represent human myeloid leukemia cells. The proliferation of K562 cells was shown to be inhibited by the presence of CPT-11 in the culture medium. We also found that the levels of mRNA for ICE in the cells were increased in the presence of CPT-11. Furthermore, we demonstrated that when CPT-11 was added to the culture medium, apoptosis of K562 cells was clearly detected in situ. These features suggested that CPT-11 enhances the apoptotic cell death in K562 cells and that a part of induction of apoptosis by CPT-11 may be correlated with the stimulation of the ICE activity.","['Shibata, Y', 'Takiguchi, H', 'Tamura, K', 'Yamanaka, K', 'Tezuka, M', 'Abiko, Y']","['Shibata Y', 'Takiguchi H', 'Tamura K', 'Yamanaka K', 'Tezuka M', 'Abiko Y']","['Department of Biochemistry, Nihon University School of Dentistry at Matsudo, 2-870-1 Sakaecho-Nishi, Matsudo, Chiba, 271.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Mol Med,Biochemical and molecular medicine,9508702,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '7673326042 (Irinotecan)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.36 (Caspase 1)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Base Sequence', 'Camptothecin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Caspase 1', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*biosynthesis', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Irinotecan', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1077315096900058 [pii]', '10.1006/bmme.1996.0005 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Mol Med. 1996 Feb;57(1):25-30. doi: 10.1006/bmme.1996.0005.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Undetected micrometastases or tumor that embolizes at the time of liver transplant from manipulation of the liver may account for these recurrences. A model and treatment protocol were developed to address this clinical problem. The protocol is modeled on the concept of bone marrow transplantation for leukemia. Hepatotoxins that are lethal to both normal hepatocytes and hepatoma cells are administered followed by liver transplantation to ""rescue"" the failing liver. The feasibility of this protocol was examined in a rat model. Male Buffalo rats were injected with 1 million Morris hepatoma MH-7777 cells intravenously at Day 0 as a model for micrometastatic disease. Three treatment groups were established. Group 1 received no treatment. Group 2 received 5% dextrose in water (D5W) followed by a syngeneic orthotopic liver transplant (OLTX). Group 3 received the hepatotoxin pyrazofuin (10 mg/kg) followed by OLTX. Animals were followed to Day 35, at which time they were sacrificed and examined for evidence of pulmonary metastases and quantitation of nodules with India ink insufflation. There was a significant decrease in the number with pulmonary nodules as well as the number of animals with pulmonary metastatic disease in the pyrazofurin-treated group compared with groups 1 and 2 (4.8 +/- 4.0 nodules/animal vs 45.2 +/- 11.2 nodules/animal--no treatment and 60.8 +/- 21.4 nodules animal--D5W/OLTX group) These data indicate that this model is reliable for examining metastatic hepatoma and that pyrazofurin is effective in preventing hematogenous micrometastases of hepatoma cells. Other hepatotoxins and the effect of allogeneic transplantation and immunosuppression could be examined in this model.","['Freise, C E', 'Liu, T', 'Ascher, N L', 'Roberts, J P']","['Freise CE', 'Liu T', 'Ascher NL', 'Roberts JP']","['Liver Transplant Division, University of California, San Francisco, 94143-0780, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Surg Res,The Journal of surgical research,0376340,"['0 (Amides)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Ribonucleosides)', '4B15044GQZ (pyrazofurin)', '681HV46001 (Ribose)']",IM,"['Amides', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*toxicity', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Liver/*drug effects/surgery', 'Liver Neoplasms, Experimental', '*Liver Transplantation', 'Lung Neoplasms/*secondary', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Transplantation/methods', 'Pyrazoles', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred BUF', 'Ribonucleosides/*toxicity', 'Ribose', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-4804(96)90328-5 [pii]', '10.1006/jsre.1996.0328 [doi]']",ppublish,J Surg Res. 1996 Aug;64(2):198-202. doi: 10.1006/jsre.1996.0328.,['5-R29-CA58696-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Human D53 and mouse D52 proteins are predicted to be 52 and 86% identical to human D52, respectively. Analysis of the three protein sequences identified a coiled-coil domain and N- and C-terminally located PEST domains in each. The conservation of homology between the D52 and the D53 sequences, combined with a lack of homology between these and known proteins, defines a new mammalian gene/protein family, the D52 family. The human D52 locus has been previously mapped to chromosome 8q21, and using in situ mapping in the present study, a human D53 locus was mapped to chromosome 6q22-q23. We observed coexpression of the human D52 and D53 genes in some breast tumors and derivative cell lines and found that maintenance of D52 and D53 transcript levels in estrogen receptor-positive MCF7 breast carcinoma cells depends upon estradiol. However, D52 and D53 genes were specifically expressed in HL-60 and K-562 leukemia cells, respectively, with 12-O-tetra-decanoylphorbol-13-acetate treatment decreasing D52 and D53 transcript levels in these cell lines. The presence of a coiled-coil domain, combined with observed co- or independent expression of the D52 and D53 genes, suggests that D52 and D53 proteins may be capable of hetero- and/or homodimer formation.","['Byrne, J A', 'Mattei, M G', 'Basset, P']","['Byrne JA', 'Mattei MG', 'Basset P']","['Institut de Genetique et de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire, CNRS/INSERM/ULP, Illkirch, C.U. de Strasbourg, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genomics,Genomics,8800135,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (TPD52 protein, human)', '0 (TPD52L1 protein, human)', '0 (TPD52L2 protein, human)', '0 (Tpd52 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Breast/metabolism/pathology', 'Breast Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0888-7543(96)90393-6 [pii]', '10.1006/geno.1996.0393 [doi]']",ppublish,Genomics. 1996 Aug 1;35(3):523-32. doi: 10.1006/geno.1996.0393.,,,"['GENBANK/AF004427', 'GENBANK/AF004428', 'GENBANK/AF004429', 'GENBANK/AF004430', 'GENBANK/U44426', 'GENBANK/U44427', 'GENBANK/U44428', 'GENBANK/U44429']",,,,,,,,,,,

Nutritional status was assessed by anthropometric measurements including weight, height, weight for height, midarm circumference (MAC) and triceps skin-fold (TSF), and by biochemical indices, in particular prealbumin (TBPA) and retinol-binding protein (RBP). On admission, no significant differences were found between groups in weight, height, weight for height, MAC, and TSF values. TBPA and RBP, lower than normal in most cases, were not significantly different in the two groups. Furthermore, no differences were observed when children with high-risk leukemia were compared with those at standard risk. In conclusion, children with newly diagnosed leukemia do not seem to present significant nutritional depletion, and their nutritional status is similar to that of children admitted for other nonmalignant acute diseases. However, nutritional indices should be monitored in children with high-risk leukemia because treatment intensity is likely to result in a malnutritional status later, which might be prevented by early adequate nutritional support.","['Uderzo, C', 'Rovelli, A', 'Bonomi, M', 'Barzaghi, A', 'Strada, S', 'Balduzzi, A', 'Pirovano, L', 'Masera, G']","['Uderzo C', 'Rovelli A', 'Bonomi M', 'Barzaghi A', 'Strada S', 'Balduzzi A', 'Pirovano L', 'Masera G']","[""Clinica Pediatrica dell'Universita di Milano, Ospedale San Gerardo, Monza, Italy.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr,Journal of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition,8211545,"['0 (Prealbumin)', '0 (Retinol-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Anthropometry', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/complications/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Nutrition Disorders/epidemiology/*etiology/prevention & control', '*Nutritional Status', 'Prealbumin/analysis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Retinol-Binding Proteins/analysis', 'Risk Factors']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00005176-199607000-00007 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr. 1996 Jul;23(1):34-7. doi: 10.1097/00005176-199607000-00007.,,,,['J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr. 1997 Aug;25(2):248-9.

We previously reported that mast cells isolated from the epithelial compartment of nasal polyp tissue contain significantly less tryptase when compared with mast cells isolated from the stroma of the same tissue. In an attempt to explore this finding, we analyzed the ability of supernatants obtained from cultured nasal polyp epithelial cells (NP-EpCM) or nasal polyp fibroblasts (NP-FbCM) to regulate the tryptase content of the immature human mast cell line HMC-1. HMC-1 cells were cultured for 7 days in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (IMDM) with 30% of either NP-FbCM or NP-EpCM or 20% MoCM (supernatant of a leukemic T cell line). As assessed by radioimmunoassay and test for enzymatic activity, all three conditioned media were shown to significantly decrease tryptase protein expression in HMC-1, when compared with cultures performed with IMDM alone (NP-EpCM P < 0.001; NP-FbCM P < 0.04; MoCM P < 0.004). In addition, Northern blot analysis demonstrated lower tryptase mRNA levels upon exposure to all three conditioned media tested, suggesting that tryptase downregulation occurs at the transcriptional level. In further studies we found that preincubation of MoCM with anti-granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) completely blocked the observed downregulation of tryptase expression mediated by this conditioned medium. The findings suggest that GM-CSF has a suppressive effect on expression of protease in mast cells, and may thus play a modulatory role in determining the extent of tissue inflammation in allergic airways disease.","['Finotto, S', 'Marshall, J S', 'Butterfield, J H', 'Denburg, J A']","['Finotto S', 'Marshall JS', 'Butterfield JH', 'Denburg JA']","['Department of Medicine, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol,American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology,8917225,"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Inflammation Mediators)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '820484N8I3 (Histamine)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (chymase 2)', 'EC 3.4.21.39 (Chymases)', 'EC 3.4.21.59 (Tryptases)']",IM,"['Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Division/drug effects/immunology', 'Chymases', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/pharmacology', 'Endopeptidases/metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/chemistry', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Histamine/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Inflammation Mediators/*physiology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell', 'Lung/*cytology/immunology', 'Mast Cells/cytology/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Nasal Polyps', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Serine Endopeptidases/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Tryptases', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/drug effects/enzymology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1165/ajrcmb.15.3.8810639 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol. 1996 Sep;15(3):355-60. doi: 10.1165/ajrcmb.15.3.8810639.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mice bearing the L1210 leukaemia were administered 2.5 or 5 mg/kg body weight (b.w.) of A1S2Pc intraperitoneally. Reflectance measurements were performed in the 650-695 nm range before and 1, 4 and 7 h after the drug administration. Fitting of the data with the diffusion theory allowed us to assess the absorption coefficient in both conditions (i.e. before and after). As a difference between the latter and the former data, the in vivo absorption spectrum of A1S2Pc was evaluated. 1 h after the administration of 2.5 mg/kg b.w. A1S2Pc, the absorption peak was centred at 685 nm, red-shifted about 15 nm with respect to the spectrum in aqueous solution. For the lower dose, the absorption line shapes 4 and 7 h after the administration remained very similar. The red shift of the absorption spectrum is consistent with the therapeutic efficacy of the photodynamic therapy which was measured at 672, 685 and 695 nm, and proved to be maximum at 685 nm for both the L1210 leukaemia and the MS-2 fibrosarcoma. With the higher drug dose, the absorption spectra taken from different animals showed significant differences. In particular, in some mice the line shape was similar to that measured with 2.5 mg/kg b.w., while in other subjects it showed a broadening or a second peak at shorter wavelengths.

The possible coupling between the interferon-responsive genes that are directly transactivated by the interferon signaling and the genes that constitute the basic machinery of the cell cycle is not clear yet. We report in this work that interferon-induced double-stranded RNA-activated kinase (PKR) is one of the specific mediators of the antiproliferative effects of the cytokine. Transfections of M1 myeloid leukemia cells with two catalytically inactive mutant forms of PKR abrogated the ability of interferon to suppress c-Myc without interfering with the pRB/cyclin D responses. As a consequence, these genetically manipulated cells displayed a small but significant reduction in their growth sensitivity to interferons, a phenotype that characterizes a single pathway disruption. Transfection of the parental M1 cells with the functional wild-type human PKR restricted their proliferation in the absence of interferons. This PKR-mediated growth inhibition could be efficiently rescued by the ectopic expression of deregulated c-myc. Taken together these results prove the existence of direct or indirect links between PKR and c-Myc suppression, thereby placing this gene along one of the complementary growth suppressive pathways that are triggered by interferons.","['Raveh, T', 'Hovanessian, A G', 'Meurs, E F', 'Sonenberg, N', 'Kimchi, A']","['Raveh T', 'Hovanessian AG', 'Meurs EF', 'Sonenberg N', 'Kimchi A']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, The Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot 76100, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '77238-31-4 (Interferon-beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (eIF-2 Kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Burkitt Lymphoma', 'Cell Line', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Interferon-beta/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Point Mutation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*biosynthesis', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Suppression, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'eIF-2 Kinase']",1996/10/11 00:00,1996/10/11 00:01,['1996/10/11 00:00'],"['1996/10/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/11 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/11 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.271.41.25479 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)78316-1 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1996 Oct 11;271(41):25479-84. doi: 10.1074/jbc.271.41.25479.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In primary samples from virtually all patients with CML or Ph+ALL, the CRKL adapter protein is tyrosine phosphorylated and physically associated with p210(BCR/ABL). CRKL has one SH2 domain and two SH3 domains and is structurally related to c-CRK-II (CRK) and the v-Crk oncoprotein. We have previously shown that CRKL, but not the related adapter protein c-CRK, is tyrosine phosphorylated in cell lines transformed by BCR/ABL, and that CRKL binds to BCR/ABL through the CRKL-SH3 domains. Furthermore, the CRKL-SH2 domain has been shown to bind one or more cellular proteins, one of which is p120(CBL). Here we demonstrate that another cellular protein linked to BCR/ABL through the CRKL-SH2 domain is p130(CAS). p130(CAS) was found to be tyrosine phosphorylated and associated with CRKL in BCR/ABL expressing cell lines and in samples obtained from CML and ALL patients, but not in samples from controls. In both normal and BCR/ABL transformed cells, p130(CAS) was detected in focal adhesion-like structures, as was BCR/ABL. In normal cells, the focal adhesion proteins tensin, p125(FAK), and paxillin constitutively associated with p130(CAS). However, in BCR/ABL transformed cells, the interaction between p130(CAS) and tensin was disrupted, while the associations between p130(CAS), p125(FAK), and paxillin were unaffected. These results suggest that the BCR/ABL oncogene could alter the function of p130(CAS) in at least three ways: tyrosine phosphorylation, inducing constitutive binding of CRKL to a domain in p130(CAS) containing Tyr-X-X-Pro motifs (substrate domain), and disrupting the normal interaction of p130(CAS) with the focal adhesion protein tensin. These alterations in the structure of signaling proteins in focal adhesion like structures could contribute to the known adhesion abnormalities in CML cells.","['Salgia, R', 'Pisick, E', 'Sattler, M', 'Li, J L', 'Uemura, N', 'Wong, W K', 'Burky, S A', 'Hirai, H', 'Chen, L B', 'Griffin, J D']","['Salgia R', 'Pisick E', 'Sattler M', 'Li JL', 'Uemura N', 'Wong WK', 'Burky SA', 'Hirai H', 'Chen LB', 'Griffin JD']","['Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (BCAR1 protein, human)', '0 (Bcar1 protein, mouse)', '0 (CRKL protein)', '0 (Crk-Associated Substrate Protein)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Retinoblastoma-Like Protein p130)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Blood Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Crk-Associated Substrate Protein', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', '*Oncogenes', 'Phosphoproteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphotyrosine', '*Proteins', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/metabolism', 'Retinoblastoma-Like Protein p130', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'src Homology Domains']",1996/10/11 00:00,1996/10/11 00:01,['1996/10/11 00:00'],"['1996/10/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/11 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/11 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.271.41.25198 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)78276-3 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1996 Oct 11;271(41):25198-203. doi: 10.1074/jbc.271.41.25198.,"['CA36167/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA60821/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fifty-six patients (age: 18 approximately 83 years) received a HD-MTX infusion (dosage: 1.9 approximately 3.8 g/m2) for 6 h. These patients were retrospectively divided into a low-clearance group and a high-clearance group based on the serum MTX concentration at 48 h (1 microM). Six out of the 56 patients showed decreased MTX clearance. The MTX concentrations in the low-clearance group were significantly higher than those in the high-clearance group even in earlier sampling times than at 48 h. The average MTX concentrations were 330 microM at 6 h, 72 microM at 12 h, and 16 microM at 24 h in the low-clearance group, and those in the high-clearance group were 210 microM, 18 microM, and 1.0 microM, respectively. The estimated elimination half-lives (t1/2) at 6 approximately 12 h and 12 approximately 24 h after the start of the infusion were also significantly longer in the low-clearance group (2.8 vs. 1.7 h and 5.0 vs. 2.8 h, respectively). Therefore, we proposed convenient criteria based on the mean + 1 S.D. of the high-clearance group: the concentration > 270 microM at 6 h and > 32 microM at 12 h; the t1/2 value > 2.1 h at 6-12 h. All 6 patients were recognized as belonging to the low-clearance group at an early stage after HD-MTX infusion by using our proposed criteria. These results indicate that patients with decreased MTX clearance could be identified within the first 12 h after the start of HD-MTX infusion. The factors influencing the prolonged elimination of MTX were also investigated. A significant decrease in renal function on day 2 was observed in the low-clearance group. The MTX level at 12 h and the estimated t1/2 values were significantly correlated with BUN, Scr and Clcr on the 2nd day after HD-MTX therapy, suggesting that an alteration in renal function occurs within 12 h of the HD-MTX infusion. The prolonged elimination of MTX could be attributable to this decrease in renal function.","['Ikeda, H', 'Kihira, K', 'Kuwata, N', 'Arai, S', 'Kimura, Y', 'Miyake, K', 'Kitaura, T', 'Fujimura, K', 'Kuramoto, A', 'Fukuchi, H']","['Ikeda H', 'Kihira K', 'Kuwata N', 'Arai S', 'Kimura Y', 'Miyake K', 'Kitaura T', 'Fujimura K', 'Kuramoto A', 'Fukuchi H']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Services, Hiroshima University Hospital, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Hiroshima J Med Sci,Hiroshima journal of medical sciences,0421060,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Kidney/physiopathology', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Time Factors']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Hiroshima J Med Sci. 1996 Jun;45(2):57-62.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) is predominantly a B-cell tropic retrovirus, which induces persistent lymphocytosis and leukemia/lymphoma of B-cell lineage in cattle. To understand the mechanisms of proliferation and tumorigenesis of bovine B-cells that are associated with BLV infection, we investigated the B-cell antigen receptor complex, especially bovine mb-1 encoding the bovine Ig-alpha protein. We isolated a full-length bovine mb-1 cDNA clone encoding 223 amino acid residues. The deduced amino acid sequence of the bovine mb-1 showed extensive homology with those of human and murine mb-1. The cytoplasmic tail of the bovine mb-1 also contained a consensus motif (D/E-X7-D/E-X2-L/I-X7-Y-X2-L/I) that may interact with the SH2 domain of src-type kinase. Interestingly, a similar consensus sequence motif was found in the BLV gp30env, although the overall sequence similarity between bovine mb-1 and BLVgp30 was not significant. Furthermore, elevated levels of mb-1 transcript were detected in various bovine leukemia/lymphoma cell lines. These results indicated that the proliferation of B-cells associated with BLV-infection may be related to abnormal signal transduction through the B-cell antigen receptor complex.","['Youn, H Y', 'Goitsuka, R', 'Kato, H', 'Mason, D Y', 'Watari, T', 'Tsujimoto, H', 'Hasegawa, A']","['Youn HY', 'Goitsuka R', 'Kato H', 'Mason DY', 'Watari T', 'Tsujimoto H', 'Hasegawa A']","['Department of Veterinary Internal Medicine, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Vet Immunol Immunopathol,Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,8002006,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'COS Cells', 'Cattle', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-2427(95)05546-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-2427(95)05546-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Immunol Immunopathol. 1996 Jul;52(3):191-200. doi: 10.1016/0165-2427(95)05546-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Functional analysis showed that IRF-BP inhibited DNA-binding and transcriptional activity of IRF-1. Moreover when we examined several leukemia samples, the level of IRF-BP mRNA was increased. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that IRF-BP binds to IRF-1, and that overexpression of IRF-BP in leukemias leads to escape from IRF-1-regulated growth control.

Although IL-6 alone did not alter the growth of these cells, the addition of soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) led to the inhibition of proliferation of one of the NSCLC cell lines, NSCLC-5. This antiproliferative effect was neutralized by antibodies to IL-6 and the IL-6R binding and signaling component (gp130). The IL-6-related cytokines, leukemia inhibitory factor and oncostatin M, inhibited proliferation of NSCLC-5 cells but were ineffective in NSCLC-3 and NSCLC-7 cells. NSCLC-7 cells (but not NSCLC-3 or NSCLC-5 cells) secreted biologically active IL-6 and expressed IL-6R. However, antibodies to IL-6 or gp130 failed to alter the proliferation of NSCLC-7 cells. All three cell lines expressed gp130 mRNA and protein. The level of expression of gp130 protein varied in the three cell lines (NSCLC-7 > NSCLC-3 > NSCLC-5). The examination of tyrosine phosphorylation of gp130 (as an early event in IL-6 signal transduction) revealed that gp130 could be phosphorylated in all cell lines after stimulation with IL-6 and/or IL-6 + sIL-6R. These results demonstrate that the mechanisms responsible for IL-6 resistance in different NSCLC cell lines vary and involve defects at either one or more levels of the IL-6 signaling cascade. In the NSCLC-5 cell line, IL-6 resistance (which can be reversed in the presence of sIL-6R) is due to the transcriptional inactivation of the IL-6R gene. In contrast, in the other two cell lines (NSCLC-3 and NSCLC-7), defect(s) in the signaling cascade downstream of gp130 phosphorylation, together with a lack of expression of IL-6R in NSCLC-3 cells, result in IL-6 resistance.","['Ganapathi, M K', 'Weizer, A K', 'Borsellino, S', 'Bukowski, R M', 'Ganapathi, R', 'Rice, T', 'Casey, G', 'Kawamura, K']","['Ganapathi MK', 'Weizer AK', 'Borsellino S', 'Bukowski RM', 'Ganapathi R', 'Rice T', 'Casey G', 'Kawamura K']","['Cancer Center Experimental Therapeutics Program, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Ohio 44195, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cell Growth Differ,Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9100024,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LAMP1 protein, human)', '0 (Lysosome-Associated Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Lung Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Lysosome-Associated Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Growth Differ. 1996 Jul;7(7):923-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we demonstrate that the human GM-CSF promoter and enhancer also encompass binding sites for core-binding factor (CBF). Significantly, the CBF sites are in each case contained within the minimum essential core regions required for inducible activation of transcription. Furthermore, these core regions of the enhancer and promoter each encompass closely linked binding sites for CBF, AP-1, and NFATp. The GM-CSF promoter CBF site TGTGGTCA is located 51 bp upstream of the transcription start site and also overlaps a YY-1 binding site. A 2-bp mutation within the CBF site resulted in a 2-3-fold decrease in the activities of both a 69-bp proximal promoter fragment and a 627-bp full-length promoter fragment. Stepwise deletions into the proximal promoter also revealed that the CBF site, but not the YY-1 site, was required for efficient induction of transcriptional activation. The AML1 and CBF beta genes that encode CBF each have the ability to influence cell growth and differentiation and have been implicated as proto-oncogenes in acute myeloid leukemia. This study adds GM-CSF to a growing list of cytokines and receptors that are regulated by CBF and which control the growth, differentiation, and activation of hemopoietic cells.

The goals of this study were to determine the range of the spatial and temporal distribution of naturally occurring marine anemia, identify potential risk factors, and provide an initial description of the impact of the disease on commercial salmon farms in British Columbia. Data were obtained from mail surveys, farm visits, and reviews of clinical and laboratory records. An attempt was made to evaluate negative, as well as mildly, moderately, and severely affected sites. The results showed marine anemia to be widely distributed throughout the major salmon farming regions in British Columbia. The disease was most commonly diagnosed in August and September, when water temperatures were at their seasonal peaks. A wide variety of lineage's and fish sources were associated with the disease. The average mortality rate attributed to marine anemia was 6% (range 2.5% to 11%). The peak occurrence of the disease was associated with a peak in the occurrence of other infectious and inflammatory diseases. The broad demographic distribution of marine anemia, coupled with its endemic nature, indicated that the disease is unlikely to be due to the recent introduction of a new pathogen and that causal factors are widespread in southern British Columbia. It is concluded that the significance of diagnosing marine anemia is not that it is predictive of an impending epidemic of mortality, but that it is an indicator of the general pattern of disease on a farm.","['Stephen, C', 'Ribble, C S', 'Kent, M L']","['Stephen C', 'Ribble CS', 'Kent ML']","['Department of Veterinary Microbiology, Western College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Canada,Can Vet J,The Canadian veterinary journal = La revue veterinaire canadienne,0004653,,IM,"['Anemia/epidemiology/etiology/*veterinary', 'Animals', 'British Columbia/epidemiology', 'Fish Diseases/diagnosis/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Prevalence', 'Prospective Studies', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', '*Salmon', 'Seasons', 'Temperature']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Can Vet J. 1996 Jul;37(7):420-5.,,,,,,,PMC1576456,,,,,,,

Thirty-eight of 70 (54%) tumors were positive for feline leukemia virus (FeLV) antigen by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and 52/70 (74%) tumors were positive for FeLV DNA using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). B cell tumors were as frequently FeLV-positive as T cell tumors using either IHC or PCR. Intestinal tumors were more likely to be B cell than T. The incidence of B and T cell tumors was not different among young (< or = 3 y), middle-aged (> 3 y to < or = 8 y), and old (> 8 y) cats. Both B and T cell tumors from old cats were FeLV-positive more often by PCR than by IHC. Feline leukemia virus DNA but not antigen, was detected in B cell tumors and intestinal tumors from cats > 8 y as often as it was detected in B cell tumors and intestinal tumors from cats < or = 8 y. Previously, most B cell and intestinal tumors from old cats were considered to be negative for FeLV. Here, the results suggest involvement of latent or replication-defective forms of the virus in such tumors from old cats. This study supports a role for FeLV in feline B cell as well as T cell tumorigenesis.","['Jackson, M L', 'Wood, S L', 'Misra, V', 'Haines, D M']","['Jackson ML', 'Wood SL', 'Misra V', 'Haines DM']","['Department of Veterinary Pathology, Western College of Veterinary Medicine, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Canada,Can J Vet Res,Canadian journal of veterinary research = Revue canadienne de recherche veterinaire,8607793,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Aging/*pathology', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Viral/*analysis/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/*pathology', 'Cat Diseases/immunology/*pathology', 'Cats', 'DNA, Viral/analysis/genetics', 'Immunohistochemistry/*methods', 'Intestinal Neoplasms/chemistry/pathology/*veterinary', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/genetics/*immunology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/immunology/pathology/*veterinary', 'Paraffin Embedding/methods/*veterinary', 'Phenotype', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods/veterinary', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*pathology']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Can J Vet Res. 1996 Jul;60(3):199-204.,,,,,,,PMC1263833,,,,,,,

In the present study, we evaluated peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) cytotoxicity activity from chagasic patients with different clinical forms of disease. To verify the cytotoxic response, we performed cell lysis assays using 51Cr-labelled K562 cells as targets. Results are reported as lytic units (LU = number of cells required for 30% lysis) per million PBMC. Exposure of patients' PBMC to Trypanosoma cruzi antigen led to an increase in cytotoxic activity compared with unstimulated patient cells against K562. Asymptomatic cardiomyopathy patients had higher responses (37.8 +/- 5.0 LU/10(6) PBMC; mean +/- s.d.) than indeterminate (11.5 +/- 3.6 LU/10(6) and symptomatic cardiomyopathy (7.8 +/- 2.5 LU/10(6)). Normal control PBMC stimulated with T. cruzi antigen had 4.36 +/- 1.31 LU/10(6)) PBMC against K562. Addition of recombinant interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) did not lead to significant increase in cytotoxicity in any group of patients. On the other hand, recombinant human IL-12 significantly increased cytotoxic responses from symptomatic cardiomyopathy patients and normal controls who presented low levels of cytotoxicity induced by T. cruzi antigen. The combined use of IL-12 and a neutralizing anti-IFN-gamma antibody did not change IL-12-induced cytotoxic responses, showing the direct role of this cytokine on natural killer (NK) cells. NK cells were the main cells responsible for the lysis of K562 target cells as evidenced by testing cell subsets following magnetic cell sorting. These data demonstrate that chagasic patients with different clinical forms of disease have PBMC which respond to T. cruzi antigen with a cytotoxic response, and this response is up-regulated by IL-12.","['Brodskyn, C I', 'Barral, A', 'Bulhoes, M A', 'Souto, T', 'Machado, W C', 'Barral-Netto, M']","['Brodskyn CI', 'Barral A', 'Bulhoes MA', 'Souto T', 'Machado WC', 'Barral-Netto M']","['Servico de Imunologia, Hospital Prof. Edgar Santos, Universidade Federal da Bahia (UFBA), Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,"['187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Chagas Disease/*immunology', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interferon-gamma/physiology', 'Interleukin-12/physiology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2249.1996.d01-785.x [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 1996 Sep;105(3):450-5. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2249.1996.d01-785.x.,['AI-30639/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,PMC2200534,,,,,,,

Several factors have been implicated in the two-cell block, amongst which oxidative stress, glucose and missing maternal factors have been examined to date. Because of their anabolic and anti-apoptotic properties, IGFs are good candidates for such missing maternal factors. Using MF1 strain mice and M16 medium we have examined the effects of IGF-I, II and insulin on the two-cell block.

We report a novel method based on the use of cis-parinaric acid (PnA) as a reporter molecule for membrane lipid peroxidation in intact mammalian cells. Using four different cell lines (human leukemia HL-60, K562 and K/VP.5 cells, and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) fibroblasts), we developed a technique to metabolically integrate PnA into all major classes of membrane phospholipids, i.e., phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol and cardiolipin, that can be quantified by HPLC with fluorescence detection. Integrated PnA constituted less than 1% of lipid fatty acid residues, suggesting that membrane structure and characteristics were not significantly altered. Low concentrations (20-40 microM) of tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BuOOH) caused selective oxidation of PnA residues in phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine of K562 cells and K/VP.5 cells while cell viability was unaffected. At higher t-BuOOH concentrations (exceeding 100 microM), however, a progressive, random oxidation of all major phospholipid classes occurred and was accompanied by significant cell death. In HL-60 cells, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine and cardiolipin were sensitive to low concentrations of t-BuOOH, while phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylinositol were not affected. Phosphatidylinositol was the only phospholipid that responded to the low concentrations of t-BuOOH in CHO cells. At high t-BuOOH concentrations, again, all phospholipid classes underwent extensive oxidation. All phospholipids were nearly equally affected by peroxidation induced by a initiator of peroxyl radicals, 2,2'-azobis-(2,4-dimethylvaleronitrile) AMVN), in K562 cells. In gamma-irradiated (4-128 Gy) CHO cells, phosphatidylserine was the most affected phospholipid class (34% peroxidation) followed by phosphatidylinositol (24% peroxidation) while the other three phospholipid classes were apparently unaffected. Since loss of PnA fluorescence is a direct result of irreparable oxidative loss of its conjugated double bond system, the method described allows for selective and sensitive monitoring of oxidative stress in live cells without interference from cell repair mechanisms.","['Ritov, V B', 'Banni, S', 'Yalowich, J C', 'Day, B W', 'Claycamp, H G', 'Corongiu, F P', 'Kagan, V E']","['Ritov VB', 'Banni S', 'Yalowich JC', 'Day BW', 'Claycamp HG', 'Corongiu FP', 'Kagan VE']","['Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, University of Pittsburgh, PA 15238, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Azo Compounds)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Unsaturated)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Membrane Lipids)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Peroxides)', '0 (Phospholipids)', ""02830LWZ4X (2,2'-azobis(2,4-dimethylvaleronitrile))"", '955VYL842B (tert-Butylhydroperoxide)', 'PK8M3ENX8C (parinaric acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Azo Compounds/pharmacology', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cricetinae', 'Fatty Acids, Unsaturated/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Gamma Rays', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', '*Lipid Peroxidation', 'Membrane Lipids/*metabolism', 'Nitriles/pharmacology', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Peroxides/pharmacology', 'Phospholipids/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'tert-Butylhydroperoxide']",1996/09/04 00:00,1996/09/04 00:01,['1996/09/04 00:00'],"['1996/09/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/04 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/04 00:00 [entrez]']","['0005-2736(96)00083-1 [pii]', '10.1016/0005-2736(96)00083-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1996 Sep 4;1283(2):127-40. doi: 10.1016/0005-2736(96)00083-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is highly expressed in proliferating but not in differentiated or growth-arrested cells. Structurally, p55Cdc is similar to the Cdc4 and Cdc20 proteins, which have been proposed to regulate DNA synthesis and mitosis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. To define the role of p55Cdc during myelopoiesis, we studied the expression and regulation of this protein in response to the hematopoietic growth factors, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). We analysed the time course of expression of p55Cdc in response to GM-CSF and G-CSF stimulation in the murine factor-dependent myeloid leukemic cell line, 32Dc13, and demonstrated differential regulation of p55Cdc in response to these two growth factors. Over-expression of p55Cdc resulted in acceleration of apoptosis in growth factor- and serum-free conditions, although no difference was observed in the rate of cell proliferation. Decreases in p55Cdc protein levels correlated with cells undergoing apoptosis. p55Cdc over-expression also inhibited granulocyte differentiation of 32Dc13 cells treated with G-CSF.

Immunoprecipitation analysis of the proteins produced in three ABPL lines revealed an interesting anomaly. Despite the invariant position of the virus integration event, the three ABPL tumor cell lines we examined (ABPL-1, ABPL-2 and ABPL-4) produced three different sized proteins. In this report, we examined the molecular basis for this protein size heterogeneity. Molecular cloning and sequence analysis of the cDNAs derived from the myb transcripts show that ABPL-1 tumor produces a tripartate mRNA containing sequences derived from the viral gag and env genes fused to the myb coding region. This results in the synthesis of a 74 kd protein. In the ABPL-2 tumor line, a gag-myb fusion protein is produced which is of 68 kd. In ABPL-4 cell line a gag-myb fusion protein is produced which contains an internal deletion of coding sequences derived from exons 13 and 14. This deletion results in the synthesis of a 59 kd protein in ABPL-4 tumor cell line. These observations were further confirmed by RNase protection assays which demonstrate the presence of aberrantly spliced mRNAs in ABPL-1 and ABPL-4 tumor cells but not in cells containing an undisrupted c-myb locus. In vitro translation and immuno-precipitation analysis of the cRNAs derived from the ABPL-1, ABPL-2 and ABPL-4 cDNAs show the synthesis of protein products that were identical to Myb proteins produced by these tumors in vivo. These results suggest that integration of Mo-MuLV within the c-myb locus not only results in deletions of the 5' end of the transcript but splicing aberrations within the encoded mRNA, which results in the synthesis of a heterogeneous array of proteins, not seen in normal hematopoietic cells.","['Tantravahi, R', 'Dudek, H', 'Patel, G', 'Reddy, E P']","['Tantravahi R', 'Dudek H', 'Patel G', 'Reddy EP']","['Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19140, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', 'EC 3.1.- (Ribonucleases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb', '*RNA Splicing', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Ribonucleases/metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/*biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transformation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/09/19 00:00,1996/09/19 00:01,['1996/09/19 00:00'],"['1996/09/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/19 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/19 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1996 Sep 19;13(6):1187-96.,['CA52009/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,"['GENBANK/S83051', 'GENBANK/S83053']",,,,,,,,,,,

Two different fusion proteins can be produced, p190BCR/ABL and p210BCR/ABL, depending on the location of the breakpoint in BCR. Although the ABL tyrosine kinase activity of the resulting oncoprotein is essential for transformation, the exact functional contribution of BCR to transformation is unclear. A novel oncogene containing ABL is formed by the (9;12) translocation which fuses part of the ets-family member TEL to c-ABL in patients with acute leukemia. In an effort to compare the biological effects of various ABL oncogenes, we transformed two different factor-dependent murine hematopoietic cell lines with cDNA's encoding p210BCR/ABL, p190BCR/ABL, or TEL/ABL. Transfection of each of the three activated ABL oncogenes resulted in rapid emergence of growth factor-independence, and 2-4 sublines from each cell line with each oncogene were further studied. Each oncogene induced an increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins and autophosphorylation of the oncoprotein itself. Overall, the pattern of increased tyrosine phosphorylation was similar in the cell lines, suggesting that many of the major substrates were identical. We specifically examined a series of proteins known to be p210BCR/ABL substrates, including rasGAP, Shc, SH-PTP2, SH-PTP1, CRK-L, CBL, paxillin, and STATs, and found that each were also tyrosine phosphorylated in response to p190BCR/ABL and TEL/ABL. These results suggest that the function of BCR can be largely replaced by the unrelated protein TEL with regards to transformation of murine hematopoietic cell lines to factor-independence, and support the hypothesis that a major contribution of both fusion partners is to activate the ABL tyrosine kinase.","['Okuda, K', 'Golub, T R', 'Gilliland, D G', 'Griffin, J D']","['Okuda K', 'Golub TR', 'Gilliland DG', 'Griffin JD']","[""Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (GRB2 Adaptor Protein)', '0 (Grb2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Chemical Precipitation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*physiology', 'GRB2 Adaptor Protein', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hematopoietic System/cytology/metabolism/*physiology', 'Immunoblotting', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', '*Repressor Proteins', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*physiology', 'Transfection', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",1996/09/19 00:00,1996/09/19 00:01,['1996/09/19 00:00'],"['1996/09/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/19 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/19 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1996 Sep 19;13(6):1147-52.,['CA66996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) have previously been shown to promote the proliferation of myoblasts in vitro, and thus may be involved in muscle regeneration. In the present investigation, the in vivo expression of these two myogenic growth factors was examined in regenerating muscle after a crush injury of wild type mice, and in diseased skeletal muscle and diaphragm of the mdxmouse. Using Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction we have demonstrated that while normal muscle rarely expresses mRNA for these two molecules, there is significant up-regulation following injury, coinciding with the active period of muscle regeneration. This suggests these molecules act as locally produced trauma factors. This observation is reinforced in mdxmouse muscle, which is undergoing a cycle of degeneration and regeneration, and expresses both LIF and IL-6. Using in situ hybridization we have localized mRNA for LIF expression in the mdx diaphragm, suggesting that local production of these molecules by regenerating muscle itself, as well as by other cells in muscle, plays an important role in muscle regeneration.","['Kurek, J B', 'Nouri, S', 'Kannourakis, G', 'Murphy, M', 'Austin, L']","['Kurek JB', 'Nouri S', 'Kannourakis G', 'Murphy M', 'Austin L']","[""Melbourne Neuromuscular Research Centre, St. Vincent's Hospital, Fitzroy, Victoria, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Muscle Nerve,Muscle & nerve,7803146,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Diaphragm/metabolism/pathology', 'Growth Inhibitors/*biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-6/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*biosynthesis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred mdx', 'Muscle, Skeletal/injuries/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Muscular Diseases/*metabolism/pathology', '*Regeneration', 'Time Factors']",1996/10/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-4598(199610)19:10<1291::AID-MUS6>3.0.CO;2-9 [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1097-4598(199610)19:10<1291::AID-MUS6>3.0.CO;2-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Muscle Nerve. 1996 Oct;19(10):1291-301. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-4598(199610)19:10<1291::AID-MUS6>3.0.CO;2-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Each 21 bp TRE target site contains an imperfect copy of the intrinsically bent CRE target site (the TRE core) surrounded by highly conserved flanking sequences. These flanking sequences are essential for maximal increases in DNA affinity and transactivation, but they are not, apparently, contacted by protein. Here we employ non-denaturing gel electrophoresis to evaluate TRE conformation in the presence and absence of bZIP proteins, and to explore the role of DNA conformation in viral transactivation. RESULTS: Our results show that the TRE-1 flanking sequences modulate the structure and modestly increase the affinity of a CREB bZIP peptide for the TRE-1 core recognition sequence. These flanking sequences are also essential for a maximal increase in stability of the CREB-DNA complex in the presence of Tax. CONCLUSIONS: The CRE-like TRE core and the TRE flanking sequences are both essential for formation of stable CREB-TRE-1 and Tax-CREB-TRE-1 complexes. These two DNA segments may have co-evolved into a unique structure capable of recognizing Tax and a bZIP protein.","['Cox, J M', 'Sloan, L S', 'Schepartz, A']","['Cox JM', 'Sloan LS', 'Schepartz A']","['Department of Chemistry, Yale University, New Haven, CT 06520-8107, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Chem Biol,Chemistry & biology,9500160,"['0 (Activating Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (G-Box Binding Factors)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Activating Transcription Factor 1', 'Autoradiography', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors', 'DNA/chemistry/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Deltaretrovirus/*metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'G-Box Binding Factors', 'Gene Products, tax/*chemistry/physiology', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis/chemistry', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/chemistry', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['1074-5521(95)90088-8 [pii]', '10.1016/1074-5521(95)90088-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol. 1995 Dec;2(12):819-26. doi: 10.1016/1074-5521(95)90088-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, phorbol ester (PMA), and calcium ionophore A23187 were found to stimulate GM-CSF production from K-562 cells. PMA caused the cells to differentiate into megakaryocytic lineage, whereas treatment with A23187 resulted in increased expression of monocyte/macrophage marker CD14. Neutralization of the GM-CSF activity in the culture medium, as well as blocking of its receptors, resulted in suppression of the increase in CD14 expression and partially restored the proliferative capacity in cells exposed to A23187.

Two different preparative regimens were used: CY (120 mg/kg) and 12 Gy of fractioned TBI (19 patients), and Bu (16 mg/kg) and Cy (120 mg/kg) (BuCy2) in 12 patients. Main clinical characteristics including age, sex, length of first remission, FAB type, and number of leukocytes at diagnosis were similar in both groups. A combination of MTX and CsA was used in 13 cases whereas either CsA or MTX alone was employed in the other two patients. With a median follow-up of 5 years the actuarial 5 year probability of disease-free survival (DFS) for the whole group was 39.8% (95% CI: 29.5-50.1%). The 5 year DFS was equivalent for those who received either ABMT (41.6 +/- 14.2%) or allogeneic BMT (40 +/- 15%).

In conclusion, similar results were observed when ABMT and allo BMT were compared for AML in CR2. A higher antileukemic effect associated with the allo BMT is balanced by an increase in transplant-related mortality. Duration of first remission was the most important factor affecting DFS and better outcome was observed for patients with longer CR1.","['Tomas, F', 'Gomez-Garcia de Soria, V', 'Lopez-Lorenzo, J L', 'Arranz, R', 'Figuera, A', 'Camara, R', 'Alegre, A', 'Fernandez-Ranada, J M']","['Tomas F', 'Gomez-Garcia de Soria V', 'Lopez-Lorenzo JL', 'Arranz R', 'Figuera A', 'Camara R', 'Alegre A', 'Fernandez-Ranada JM']","['Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario La Princesa, Universidad Autonoma, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1996 Jun;17(6):979-84.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We observed no difference in disease-free survival between patients transplanted with partially matched bone marrow (median follow-up 1252 days, range 778-2035 days) vs those transplanted with HLA-matched bone marrow (median follow-up 1472 days, range 1165-2800 days; P = 0.48). Median survival for all patients is 38% (95% CI 24-52%) at 6 years. Patients transplanted in remission had a significant increase in disease-free survival when compared to those in relapse (P = 0.007). Our data suggest that partially matched BMTs from related donors are a comparable alternative to fully matched transplants in patients with ALL.","['Fleming, D R', 'Henslee-Downey, P J', 'Romond, E H', 'Harder, E J', 'Marciniak, E', 'Munn, R K', 'Messino, M J', 'Macdonald, J S', 'Bishop, M', 'Rayens, M K', 'Thompson, J S', 'Foon, K A']","['Fleming DR', 'Henslee-Downey PJ', 'Romond EH', 'Harder EJ', 'Marciniak E', 'Munn RK', 'Messino MJ', 'Macdonald JS', 'Bishop M', 'Rayens MK', 'Thompson JS', 'Foon KA']","['Lucille P Markey Cancer Center, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Kentucky Medical Center, Lexington, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', '*Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1996 Jun;17(6):917-22.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have demonstrated differences in GPIIb-IIIa ligand binding properties of HEL cells when compared to platelets. Although the mRNA sequences for GPIIb and GPIIIa are identical in platelets and HEL cells, cell specific differences in the conformation states of the GPIIb-IIIa complex may exist and may explain in part the contrasting functional properties. Two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), an anti-GPIIb mAb C3 and an anti-GPIIIa mAb D3, were used to determine whether differences in GPIIb-IIIa conformational states could be measured. Initial studies in a purified system showed that the mAbs' binding to isolated GPIIb-IIIa conformers was increased to the active GPIIb-IIIa and to dissociated receptor subunits when compared to the inactive form. Furthermore, soluble active GPIIb-IIIa was a much better inhibitor of D3 binding to the immobilized receptor compared to soluble inactive GPIIb-IIIa. Extending these studies with intact cells, we detected at least two classes of binding sites for each mAb on each cell type. Differences in Bmax and in the relative affinities of the mAbs were identified and may represent subpopulations of GPIIb-IIIa conformations. Total HEL cell and platelet GPIIb-IIIa was determined in our binding assays using a radiolabeled GPIIb-IIIa complex specific mAb, 10E5. HEL cells express approximately five times more GPIIb-IIIa on a per cell basis. The percent of total GPIIb-IIIa that represented each class of mAb binding sites was determined. In summary, the relative differences in GPIIb-IIIa conformation found on platelets and HEL cells may be related to cell-specific ligand binding properties and activation states of the receptor.","['Jennings, L K', 'Slack, S M', 'Wall, C D', 'Mondoro, T H']","['Jennings LK', 'Slack SM', 'Wall CD', 'Mondoro TH']","['Department of Medicine, University of Tennessee, Memphis, USA. ljennings@utmem1.utmem.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,"['0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Platelet Glycoprotein GPIIb-IIIa Complex)', 'AC6UDA2MFC (arginyl-glycyl-aspartyl-serine)']",IM,"['Analysis of Variance', 'Binding Sites', 'Blood Platelets/*metabolism', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/blood/*genetics', 'Oligopeptides/metabolism', 'Platelet Glycoprotein GPIIb-IIIa Complex/*genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1079-9796(96)90005-4 [pii]', '10.1006/bcmd.1996.0005 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 1996;22(1):23-35. doi: 10.1006/bcmd.1996.0005.,['HL48244/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

C57BL/6 mice were treated with synthetic peptides based upon different human TCR V beta CDR1 sequences following experimental infection with the murine retrovirus.

This study determined whether the complete 16-mer synthetic peptides modeling the V beta CDR1/FR3 were required, and whether admixture of autoantigenic peptides synergized immune preservation. Treatment with complete TCR pep beta 3 and pep V beta 5.2 peptide alone and combined largely prevented the retrovirus-induced reduction in B and T cell proliferation and Th1 cytokine secretion while suppressing excessive production of Th2 cytokines, which are stimulated by retrovirus infection. Treatment with overlapping short peptides corresponding to the N-terminal 11-mer and C-terminal 12-mer did not significantly prevent the immune dysfunction in retrovirus-infected mice. These data suggest that immune dysfunction and abnormal cytokine production, induced by murine retrovirus infection, were largely prevented by TCR V beta CDR1 peptides, and the complete CDR1 in association with the five residues from FR2 was required.","['Liang, B', 'Marchalonis, J J', 'Zhang, Z', 'Watson, R R']","['Liang B', 'Marchalonis JJ', 'Zhang Z', 'Watson RR']","['Department of Family and Community Medicine, University of Arizona, Tucson 85724, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Mitogens)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/*immunology', 'Body Weight', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Concanavalin A/pharmacology', 'Cytokines/immunology', 'Female', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*immunology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mitogens/pharmacology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/immunology/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Peptides/chemical synthesis/immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*immunology', 'Spleen/cytology/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/*immunology', 'Vaccination']",1996/08/25 00:00,1996/08/25 00:01,['1996/08/25 00:00'],"['1996/08/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/25 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/25 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0008-8749(96)90223-3 [pii]', '10.1006/cimm.1996.0223 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1996 Aug 25;172(1):126-34. doi: 10.1006/cimm.1996.0223.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IL-3-induced proliferation of myeloid cells is mediated by the interaction with an heterodimeric receptor (IL-3R) comprised of a ligand binding subunit denoted alpha and a common transducing subunit designated as beta (beta). Ligand binding to the receptor activates a number of signaling molecules including proteins of the STATs (signal transducing and activators of transcription) family. To elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the abnormal proliferative response of AML cells to IL-3, we evaluated, both in the IL-3-dependent M-07e cell line and in 20 AML cases, the activation of STAT1 p91 and its association with the beta c subunit. On the basis of the in vitro proliferation assay, 11 out of 20 cases were found to be responsive to IL-3 and eight out of 16 to GM-CSF. Our results demonstrated that in M-07e cells and in six AML cases (five IL-3 responsive and one unresponsive) p91 tyrosine phosphorylation was ligand dependent. Ligand independent p91 tyrosine phosphorylation was detected in 10 AML cases (five responsive and five unresponsive). p91 association with the beta c subunit was consistent with its ligand dependent activation and with the ability to form a DNA-binding complex containing p91. In the remaining four cases (three unresponsive and one responsive) no p91 tyrosine phosphorylation and/or association were detected. These findings, together with the observation that in five IL-3 responsive cases p91 was constitutively phosphorylated, suggest that IL-3-mediated AML proliferation is only partially sustained by p91 activation and that other post-receptor molecules are required to achieve maximal proliferative response. Moreover structural abnormalities of the receptor or of post-receptor signaling proteins may account for the constitutive p91 phosphorylation and growth factor independent proliferation observed in the unresponsive AML cases.","['Aronica, M G', 'Brizzi, M F', 'Dentelli, P', 'Rosso, A', 'Yarden, Y', 'Pegoraro, L']","['Aronica MG', 'Brizzi MF', 'Dentelli P', 'Rosso A', 'Yarden Y', 'Pegoraro L']","['Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche e Oncologia Umana, Universita di Torino, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-3)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*drug effects/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Receptors, Interleukin-3/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'Trans-Activators/*drug effects/*genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",1996/09/05 00:00,1996/09/05 00:01,['1996/09/05 00:00'],"['1996/09/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/05 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/05 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1996 Sep 5;13(5):1017-26.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Transient transfection of NIH3T3 cells with PIC1 results in a nuclear staining pattern coincident with that of endogenous mouse PML. Further, cotransfection of PIC1 with human PML produces a completely overlapping staining pattern between the two proteins. An antibody raised against PIC1 detects a punctate staining pattern in HeLa cells that is coincident with endogenous human PML. There is no significant colocalisation observed between the staining of PML/ PML-RARA and PIC1 in an APL-derived cell line NB4, as compared to cells expressing only wild type PML.

The present studies demonstrate that treatment of U-937 cells with 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C) is associated with tyrosine phosphorylation of Cdk2 and inhibition of Cdk2 activity. The results also demonstrate that Cdk2 directly associates with the Src-like tyrosine kinase Lyn as a consequence of ara-C-treatment. Confocal microscopy studies show that Lyn is detectable in the nucleus and that it colocalises with Cdk2. Subcellular fractionation and coimmunoprecipitation studies further demonstrate nuclear binding of Lyn and Cdk2. We also show that Lyn phosphorylates Tyr15 of Cdk2 and that incubation of Lyn with Cdk2 results in inhibition of Cdk2 activity. These findings suggest that the association of Lyn and Cdk2 in ara-C-treated cells may contribute to regulation of Cdk2-dependent cell cycle checkpoints.,"['Yuan, Z M', 'Huang, Y', 'Kraeft, S K', 'Chen, L B', 'Kharbanda, S', 'Kufe, D']","['Yuan ZM', 'Huang Y', 'Kraeft SK', 'Chen LB', 'Kharbanda S', 'Kufe D']","['Division of Cancer Pharmacology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2-CDC28 Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', '*CDC2-CDC28 Kinases', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/drug effects/immunology/*metabolism', 'Cyclins/metabolism', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/immunology', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/drug effects/immunology/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/drug effects/metabolism', 'Subcellular Fractions', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/metabolism', 'src-Family Kinases/drug effects/immunology/*metabolism']",1996/09/05 00:00,1996/09/05 00:01,['1996/09/05 00:00'],"['1996/09/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/05 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/05 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1996 Sep 5;13(5):939-46.,['CA29431/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

To understand whether the observed high proviral load could be associated with the clonal expansion of the infected cells, we have studied the mode of integration of HTLV-II in six infected individuals with proviral load higher than 1% of total peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). An inverse polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis, which allowed the amplification of the region flanking the 5' end of the provirus, was developed for HTLV-II. A single band, corresponding to a monoclonal expansion, was found in four of six patients analyzed, while in the other two patients an oligoclonal type of integration was observed. The results for inverse PCR analysis were confirmed by sequencing the PCR products and showing that the 5' LTR flanking sequences of proviral DNA obtained from the different subjects presented no homology, thus suggesting that no specific site or sequence is required for the integration process of HTLV-II. The results indicate that the HTLV-II high proviral load observed in PBMCs from infected patients is associated with a clonal expansion of HTLV-II-infected cells. This study also suggests that the very high genetic stability of HTLV-II could be explained by viral amplification via clonal expansion rather than by reverse transcription.","['Cimarelli, A', 'Duclos, C A', 'Gessain, A', 'Casoli, C', 'Bertazzoni, U']","['Cimarelli A', 'Duclos CA', 'Gessain A', 'Casoli C', 'Bertazzoni U']","['Istituto di Genetica Biochimica ed Evoluzionistica del CNR, I-27100 Pavia, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,,IM,"['Blotting, Southern', 'HTLV-II Infections/*virology', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/virology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proviruses/*growth & development', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Virus Integration']",1996/09/15 00:00,1996/09/15 00:01,['1996/09/15 00:00'],"['1996/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(96)90487-0 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1996.0487 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 1996 Sep 15;223(2):362-4. doi: 10.1006/viro.1996.0487.,,,"['GENBANK/X98040', 'GENBANK/X98041', 'GENBANK/X98042', 'GENBANK/X98043']",,,,,,,,,,,

Both the 61E and 61C viruses were tropic for CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as well as IgG+ B lymphocytes in blood and lymph node. High provirus burden were established for both virus genomes-ranging from 0.3 to > 2 copies/cell. To identify the fraction of circulating cells which expressed viral antigen in vivo, we developed a flow cytometric method to simultaneously label blood leukocytes for surface immunophenotype and intracytoplasmic FeLV CA (p27 Gag).

In other vectors, CAT production was regulated by the HIV-1 LTR; these vectors also contained the HIV-1 tat gene and pol sequences reported to exert cis-acting positive effects on reverse transcription or gene expression. Vectors employing the Tat-driven HIV-1 LTR exhibited up to 500-fold greater CAT expression in Jurkat lymphocytes or human peripheral blood mononuclear cells compared with vectors using the internal MuLV LTR element as a promoter. This difference was not due to improved packaging of the vector RNA into virions, but to an improved level of gene expression in the target cells. Target cell CAT expression was two- to threefold higher for the vector containing the pol sequences and was only slightly less than that seen for a trans-complemented envdeleted provirus.

In HIV-1-infected cells Tat can also activate the expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Recent results indicate that essential for this effect is the interaction of Tat with a TAR-like structure present in the TNF beta messenger RNA leader region that closely resembles the TAR of the HIV-LTR. Here we show that because of this similarity of mechanisms, the expression of an RNA species encoding polymeric-TAR sequences and known to inhibit Tat-mediated HIV-1 gene expression also blocks TNF gene expression in response to Tat, but not TNF promoter activation induced by human T cell leukemia/lymphotropic virus type I Tax protein. Since TNF is increased in HIV-1-infected individuals and can activate HIV-1 gene expression or rescue Tat-defective HIV-1 proviruses, activation of TNF by Tat may be part of a complex pathway in which HIV-1 uses its own expression to increase infectivity and to induce disease.

The effect of hypoxia on pRB nuclear binding and its state of phosphorylation was studied by two methods: (a) two-parametric flow cytometric measurement of pRB versus DNA and (b) Western blotting. Pulse-chase and pulse labeling with BrdUrd was used to record cell-cycle progression under versus after extremely hypoxic conditions. We demonstrate that pRB is dephosphorylated and rebound in the nucleus in more than 90% of cells located in S and G2 under extremely hypoxic conditions. While inhibition of DNA synthesis was instantaneous under hypoxic conditions, dephosphorylation and rebinding to nuclear structures of pRB takes more than 4 h. Within this time span, cells in G2 complete mitosis and divide. The slow dephosphorylation of pRB indicates that pRB is neither associated with the instantaneous inhibition of DNA synthesis nor is it the cause of the oxygen-dependent restriction point located in late-G1. The observed dephosphorylation of pRB is not dependent on functional p53, suggesting that at least one of the mechanisms responsible for the dephosphorylation is due to hypoxic activation of a pRB-specific phosphatase in the absence of p53-dependent inhibition of pRB kinase activity. However, it cannot be ruled out the participation of pRB kinase inhibitors independent of p53 activation. Cells arrested in G1 during prolonged hypoxia resumed cell-cycle progression within 2-->24 h after reoxygenation, while cells arrested in S were unable to reenter cell-cycle progression after reoxygenation. The hypoxia-induced dephosphorylation of pRB was only partly reversible by reoxygenation. Reentry into the cell cycle induced by reoxygenation occurred concomitant with unbinding (hyperphosphorylation) of pRB. Thus, rephosphorylation of pRB seem to be the rate-limiting step for reentry into the cell cycle after reoxygenation. Although pRB seems to play a major role in suppression of cell growth under and following hypoxic stress, other factors seem to be responsible for the immediate hypoxia-induced arrest in late-G1 and S phases.","['Amellem, O', 'Stokke, T', 'Sandvik, J A', 'Pettersen, E O']","['Amellem O', 'Stokke T', 'Sandvik JA', 'Pettersen EO']","['Department of Cell Biology, Norwegian Radium Hospital, Oslo, Norway. amellom@radium.uio.no']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",IM,"['Breast Neoplasms', 'Cell Cycle/physiology', 'Cell Hypoxia/*physiology', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'G2 Phase/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Oxygen/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Protein Binding', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/*metabolism', 'S Phase/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/physiology']",1996/08/25 00:00,1996/08/25 00:01,['1996/08/25 00:00'],"['1996/08/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/25 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/25 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(96)90255-4 [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1996.0255 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1996 Aug 25;227(1):106-15. doi: 10.1006/excr.1996.0255.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hence, a specific and sensitive cellular marker of apoptosis is needed to determine the role of apoptotic death in biology and pathology. The present study describes a novel immunohistochemical procedure for the staining of apoptotic cells using a monoclonal antibody (MAb) to single-stranded DNA. This MAb stained all cells with the morphology typical of apoptosis in etoposide-treated HL-60, MOLT-4, and R9 cell cultures, in which apoptosis was accompanied by high, moderate, and low levels of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, respectively. TUNEL stained all apoptotic cells in HL-60 cultures, nearly 60% of apoptotic cells in MOLT-4 cultures, and only 14% of apoptotic cells in R9 cultures. Apoptotic R9 cells, which progressed into secondary necrosis, retained MAb staining and became TUNEL-positive. Necrotic cells in MOLT-4 cultures treated with sodium azide were stained by TUNEL, but were negative for MAb staining. All floating cells at a late stage of apoptosis in MDA-MB-468 cultures treated with cisplatin were stained by both MAb and TUNEL. However, among adherent cells in the early stages of apoptosis, MAb stained nearly 20 times more cells than TUNEL. In histological sections of human tumor xenografts, MAb detected clusters of apoptotic cells in viable tumor tissue, but did not stain cells in areas of central ischemic necrosis. In contrast, TUNEL stained nuclei in necrotic areas. Thus, MAb to single-stranded DNA is a specific and sensitive cellular marker of apoptosis, which differentiates between apoptosis and necrosis and detects cells in the early stages of apoptosis.","['Frankfurt, O S', 'Robb, J A', 'Sugarbaker, E V', 'Villa, L']","['Frankfurt OS', 'Robb JA', 'Sugarbaker EV', 'Villa L']","['Department of Pathology, Cedars Medical Center, Miami, Florida 33136, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (DNA, Single-Stranded)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Antibodies, Monoclonal', '*Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Line', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology', 'DNA, Single-Stranded/*analysis/immunology', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', '*Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', '*Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Mice', 'Necrosis', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(96)90240-2 [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1996.0240 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1996 Aug 1;226(2):387-97. doi: 10.1006/excr.1996.0240.,['CA-50677/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

HL60 cells are p53 null and extremely sensitive to a variety of apoptotic stimuli including DNA damage induced by the topoisomerase I inhibitor, camptothecin. We measured DNA fragmentation induced in isolated nuclei by cytosolic extracts using a filter elution assay. Cytosol from camptothecin-treated HL60 cells induced internucleosomal DNA fragmentation in nuclei from untreated cells. This fragmentation was suppressed by serine protease inhibitors. Serine proteases (trypsin, endoproteinase Glu-C, chymotrypsin A, and proteinase K) and papain by themselves induced DNA fragmentation in naive nuclei. This effect was enhanced in the presence of cytosol from untreated cells. Cysteine protease inhibitors (E-64, leupeptin, Ac-YVAD-CHO [ICE inhibitor]) did not affect camptothecin-induced DNA fragmentation. The apopain/Yama inhibitor, Ac-DEVD-CHO, and the proteasome inhibitor, MG-132, were also inactive both in the cell-free system and in whole cells. Interleukin-1 beta converting enzyme (ICE) or human immunodeficiency virus protease failed to induce DNA fragmentation in naive nuclei.

METHODS: A population-based case-control study was conducted. Cases, diagnosed during 1983 through 1986 among residents of the Upper Cape Cod area of Massachusetts, involved incident cancers of the lung (n = 252), breast (n = 265), colon-rectum (n = 326), bladder (n = 63), kidney (n = 35), pancreas (n = 37), and brain (n = 37), along with leukemia (n = 35). Control subjects were randomly selected from among telephone subscribers (n = 184), Medicare beneficiaries (n = 464), and deceased individuals (n = 723). RESULTS: No meaningful increases in risk were seen for any of the cancer sites except for the brain. When latency was considered, subjects who had ever lived within 2600 ft (780 m) of a cranberry bog had a twofold increased risk of brain cancer overall (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.8, 4.9) and a 6.7-fold increased risk of astrocytoma (95% CI = 1.6, 27.8). CONCLUSIONS: Residential proximity to cranberry bog cultivation was not associated with seven of the eight cancers investigated; however, an association was observed with brain cancer, particularly astrocytoma. Larger, more detailed studies are necessary to elucidate this relationship.","['Aschengrau, A', 'Ozonoff, D', 'Coogan, P', 'Vezina, R', 'Heeren, T', 'Zhang, Y']","['Aschengrau A', 'Ozonoff D', 'Coogan P', 'Vezina R', 'Heeren T', 'Zhang Y']","['Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Boston University School of PPublic Health, MA 02118, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Public Health,American journal of public health,1254074,"['0 (Agrochemicals)', '0 (Air Pollutants)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Agrochemicals/*adverse effects', 'Air Pollutants/adverse effects', 'Astrocytoma/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Brain Neoplasms/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Female', '*Fruit', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Massachusetts/epidemiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.2105/ajph.86.9.1289 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Public Health. 1996 Sep;86(9):1289-96. doi: 10.2105/ajph.86.9.1289.,,,,,,,PMC1380593,,,,,,,

Furthermore, the enhancement of the immunogenicity of the 8-MOP/UVA-treated RL male 1 cells was found to be strongly associated with the increase of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression on these 8-MOP/UVA-treated tumor cells.

Chairman's Summary of the European School of Oncology Task Force meeting Peripheral Blood progenitor cell's held September 29-30, 1995.",1-4,"Whether or not peripheral stem cells have an unlimited capacity for self renewal is debated. However, everyday haematopoietic requirements are met by progenitors; and it seems that few ""real' stem cells are needed. Although we may not yet have identified these ""true' stem cells, for practical purposes the long term culture-initiating cells (LTC-ICs) are a close approximation. To date, experience in peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) transplantation is largely confined to non-ablative regimens. It is therefore difficult to determine the number of PBPCs needed to effect long-term reconstitution. The number of tumour cells present among mobilised PBPCs can be reduced using the CD34 affinity column and by positive purging methods. The ex vivo expansion of CD34 cells also has the effect of diluting tumour cell concentration. In clinical use, PBPC transplantation has a proven role in support of high dose chemotherapy in certain haematological and oncological malignancies but the concept of dose intensification is not universally accepted. With the exception of leukaemia, lymphoma, myeloma or relapsed testicular cancer and possibly some subgroups of breast cancer; high dose chemotherapy does not demonstrate a survival benefit. For patients with CML, autografting with Ph- cells appears to become a useful alternative to allogeneic BMT. Allogeneic PBPC transplantation may have potential, though work is preliminary. Cord blood transplantation between matched siblings is viable, but it is not yet clear whether this source will increase the donor pool for adults needing allogeneic transplantation. For gene therapy using haematopoietic cells to be effective, a greatly increased rate of transduction will be needed. Meeting in Paris in September 1995, a European School of Oncology Task Force considered a number of important questions relating to peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) physiology and transplantation. This review is a brief account of their conclusions.","['Boogaerts, M A', 'Brugger, W', 'Carella, A M', 'Cortes-Funes, H', 'Fibbe, W E', 'Hows, J', 'Khayat, D', 'Linch, D C', 'Link, H', 'Moore, M A', 'Testa, N G']","['Boogaerts MA', 'Brugger W', 'Carella AM', 'Cortes-Funes H', 'Fibbe WE', 'Hows J', 'Khayat D', 'Linch DC', 'Link H', 'Moore MA', 'Testa NG']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/therapy', 'Neoplasms/*therapy']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/annonc/7.suppl_2.1 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(20)30406-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 1996;7 Suppl 2:1-4. doi: 10.1093/annonc/7.suppl_2.1.,,20,,,,,,,,,,,,

IL10 inhibits cytokine production of activated macrophages and T-helper 1 cells. We analysed whether IL10 can also suppress cytokine production and may inhibit growth of AML cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: AML blasts of 18 patients were purified by immunomagnetic separation and cultured in serum-free medium in the presence of cytokines. The production of cytokines was analysed by ELISA, DNA synthesis by 3H-thymidine incorporation and mRNA expression of cytokine genes by semiquantitative RT-PCR. RESULTS: Our results confirm previous results that AML blasts produce a variety of cytokines such as GM-CSF, IL1 alpha, IL1 beta, IL6 and TNF alpha. AML cells were induced to proliferation by G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL3, IL1 beta and SCF to a different extent. In contrast, IL10 significantly inhibited the cytokine production at the mRNA and protein level and spontaneous thymidine uptake in a dose-dependent way. This inhibition could be abrogated by IL10 specific antibodies. CONCLUSION: These observations suggest an inhibitory effect of IL10 on the proliferation of cultured AML blasts most likely through suppression of endogenous cytokines.","['Westermann, F', 'Kube, D', 'Haier, B', 'Bohlen, H', 'Engert, A', 'Zuehlsdorf, M', 'Diehl, V', 'Tesch, H']","['Westermann F', 'Kube D', 'Haier B', 'Bohlen H', 'Engert A', 'Zuehlsdorf M', 'Diehl V', 'Tesch H']","['Klinik I fur Innere Medizin, Universitat, Koln, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-10/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Stimulation, Chemical', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/oxfordjournals.annonc.a010607 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(19)60590-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 1996 Apr;7(4):397-404. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.annonc.a010607.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-two patients aged 39-84 years with previously treated CLL received cladribine 0.12 mg/kg/day in 2-hour infusions for 5 days in monthly courses. Two-thirds were refractory to previous therapy, and 8 had prior fludarabine. RESULTS: Sixteen (31%) patients achieved complete response (CR) and 14 (27%) partial remission (PR) according to consensus criteria. Response correlated with clinical stage, number of previous treatment regimes, blood lymphocyte count, and lymphocyte halflife following the first cladribine course. Toxicity included pneumonia (n = 9), herpes zoster (n = 7), and septicemia (n = 2). Four patients in CR underwent high-dose chemotherapy with autologous blood stem cell support, and 2 remain in CR 48 and 60 months from start of cladribine, and 2 had relapse at 42 and 48 months, respectively. Median progression-free survival (Kaplan-Meier analysis) for CR patients was 23 months from start of cladribine treatment, and for PR patients 16 months. The projected overall survival was 80% at 3 years for CR patients, and the median survival 28 months for PR patients and 4 months for non-responding patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our previous finding of durable CRs from cladribine in advanced CLL is thus confirmed in a larger patient material, and follow-up indicate that long-term survival may be achieved.","['Juliusson, G', 'Liliemark, J']","['Juliusson G', 'Liliemark J']","['Department of Medicine, Huddinge Hospital, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Count/drug effects', 'Cladribine/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Opportunistic Infections/complications/epidemiology', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'Retreatment', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/oxfordjournals.annonc.a010604 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(19)60587-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 1996 Apr;7(4):373-9. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.annonc.a010604.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the expression and regulation of the IL-2R alpha, IL-2R beta, gamma c chain, IL-4R and IL-7R mRNA in a human monoblastic leukemia cell line, THP-1. Unstimulated THP-1 cells constitutively expressed a low level of gamma c chain and IL-4R mRNA. Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) induced macrophage-like differentiation and up-regulated the gamma c chain mRNA expression in THP-1 cells. This effect of PMA was suppressed by the protein kinase inhibitors H-7 and staurosporine. PMA did not affect the expression of the other IL-R mRNAs examined. 1 alpha, 25(OH)2D3 and interferon-gamma also induced differentiation of THP-1 cells, but these reagents did not affect the expression of the IL-R mRNAs in THP-1 cells.

Activation of the transcription factor NF-kappa B is one of the earliest events induced by TNF, but whether it is mediated through one or both forms of the TNF receptor is controversial. in the present studies, we examined the role of each receptor in the activation of NF-kappa B by using TNFs that has been designed by site-specific mutagenesis to bind either the p60 (R32W; S86T) or the p80 (D143N; A145R) form of the receptor. Human myelogenous leukemic ML-1 a cells known to express almost equal amounts of the two receptors were used. The binding of TNF to these cell could be inhibited equally by either TNF(p60) or TNF(p80) mutein. Treatment of these cells with TNF(p60) mutein activate NF-kappa B within 30 min, whereas TNF(p80) mutein, even at a 1000-fold excess, had no effect, suggesting that the activation of NF-kappa B is differentially regulated through the p60 receptor. Consistent with these results, treatment with either anti-p80 monoclonal or polygonal Abs blocked the binding of TNF to the p80 receptor without affecting TNF-mediated activation of NF-kappa B TNF(p60) mutein was also effective in cell killing, but the TNF(p80) mutein was totally ineffective. The effect was not cell type-specific, since other p80-expressing cell lines were also unresponsive. Overall, our results clearly demonstrate that the activation of NF-kappa B and cytotoxicity by TNF is differentially regulated through the p60 receptor.","['Chainy, G B', 'Singh, S', 'Raju, U', 'Aggarwal, B B']","['Chainy GB', 'Singh S', 'Raju U', 'Aggarwal BB']","['Department of Molecular Oncology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Antibodies/pharmacology', 'Binding, Competitive/immunology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells/immunology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/immunology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/immunology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Mutation/*immunology', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/*genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*genetics']",1996/09/15 00:00,1996/09/15 00:01,['1996/09/15 00:00'],"['1996/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1996 Sep 15;157(6):2410-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the effects of the glucocorticoid dexamethasone on these events in a cultured (RBL-2H3) mast cell line. Nanomolar concentrations of dexamethasone suppressed phosphorylation of proteins that were associated with the activation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase/phospholipase A2 pathway without inhibiting initial events. For example, tyrosine phosphorylation of the subunits of Fc epsilon RI, Lyn, or Syk or of the Ras-guanine nucleotide exchange factor, Vav, was not suppressed in cells treated with up to 1 microM dexamethasone. In contrast, phosphorylation of Raf1, MEK1, p42mapk, and cytosolic phospholipase A2, as well as the associated increase in MAP kinase activity and release of arachidonic acid, were markedly inhibited in cells treated with as little as 10 nM dexamethasone--a concentration that only partially inhibited hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids or release of secretory granules. Prolonged exposure to dexamethasone also resulted in a partial decrease in expression of MEK1, p42mapk, and cytosolic phospholipase A2, which may contribute further to the effects of dexamethasone on this pathway. Activation of the MAP kinase/phospholipase A2 pathway by the calcium-mobilizing agent thapsigargin was similarly suppressed in dexamethasone-treated cells. These findings suggested that an early step in the pathway, possibly a step immediately before the activation of Raf1, was suppressed by low concentrations of dexamethasone.","['Rider, L G', 'Hirasawa, N', 'Santini, F', 'Beaven, M A']","['Rider LG', 'Hirasawa N', 'Santini F', 'Beaven MA']","['Arthritis and Rheumatism Branch, National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Arachidonic Acids)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '67526-95-8 (Thapsigargin)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.1.32 (Phospholipases A)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Phospholipases A2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens/physiology', 'Arachidonic Acids/metabolism', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/immunology/*metabolism', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 1', 'Mast Cells/*drug effects/*enzymology/immunology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1', '*Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases', 'Phospholipases A/drug effects/metabolism', 'Phospholipases A2', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/drug effects/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/drug effects/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/drug effects/metabolism', 'Thapsigargin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/drug effects/metabolism', 'src-Family Kinases/drug effects/metabolism']",1996/09/15 00:00,1996/09/15 00:01,['1996/09/15 00:00'],"['1996/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1996 Sep 15;157(6):2374-80.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The identification of binding partners for these domains has added considerably to our understanding of signal-transduction pathways, and the purpose of this work was to identify SH3-binding proteins in haematopoietic cells. RESULTS: We performed affinity-chromatography experiments with a panel of GST-SH3 fusion proteins (composed of glutathione-S-transferase appended to various SH3 domains) to search for SH3-binding proteins in a human megakaryocytic cell line. Protein microsequencing identified one of the SH3-binding proteins as WASp, the protein that is defective in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) and isolated X-linked thrombocytopenia. WASp bound preferentially in vitro to SH3 domains from c-Src family kinases, and analysis of proteins expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus vector demonstrated a specific interaction between WASp and the Fyn protein-tyrosine kinase. Finally, in vivo experiments showed that WASp and Fyn physically associate in human haematopoietic cells. CONCLUSIONS: Haematopoietic cells from individuals with WAS exhibit defects in cell morphology and signal transduction, including reduced proliferation and tyrosine phosphorylation in response to stimulatory factors. Members of the c Src family of protein-tyrosine kinases, including Fyn, are involved in a range of signalling pathways - such as those regulating cytoskeletal structure - in both haematopoietic and non-haematopoietic cells. Our data suggest that binding of Fyn to WASp may be a critical event in such signalling pathways in haematopoietic cells.","['Banin, S', 'Truong, O', 'Katz, D R', 'Waterfield, M D', 'Brickell, P M', 'Gout, I']","['Banin S', 'Truong O', 'Katz DR', 'Waterfield MD', 'Brickell PM', 'Gout I']","['Leukaemia Research Fund Centre for Childhood Leukaemia, Molecular Haematology Unit, Institute of Child Health, 30 Guilford Street, LondonWC1N 1EH, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Curr Biol,Current biology : CB,9107782,"['0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (WAS protein, human)', '0 (Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (FYN protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fyn)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Glutathione Transferase/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Protein Binding', 'Proteins/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fyn', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome/*metabolism', 'Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein', 'src Homology Domains', 'src-Family Kinases/*metabolism']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0960-9822(02)00642-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s0960-9822(02)00642-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Biol. 1996 Aug 1;6(8):981-8. doi: 10.1016/s0960-9822(02)00642-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Myb-Ets transforms hematopoietic progenitor cells (myb-Ets progenitors, MEPs) that can be induced to differentiate into eosinophilic and myeloid cells by the activation of pathways involving Ras and/or protein kinase C. The Ets portion of the fusion protein seems to be required to maintain the multipotency of MEPs: MEPs transformed with a temperature-sensitive E26 mutant with a lesion in Ets (ts 1.1) and shifted to the non-permissive temperature predominantly form erythroid cells, but also form eosinophilic and myeloid cells. This interpretation is complicated, however, by the observation that ts 1.1-transformed MEPs differ from MEPs transformed with wild-type E26 in that they expressed erythroid and eosinophil markers even at the permissive temperature. RESULTS: In order to alleviate the problems associated with the use of temperature-sensitive mutants we have designed a vector that allows the inducible deletion of the Ets domain. To this end, we introduced FLP recombinase target sites into the E26 virus on the 5' and 3' sides of Ets and included within the same retroviral vector sequences encoding and estrogen-dependent FLP recombinase. This construct, termed FRV-3, is capable of transforming cells to produce a phenotype indistinguishable from that of MEPs obtained with wild-type virus. Hormone treatment of MEPs transformed with FRV-3 induced erythroid differentiation in a subpopulation of the cells; this subpopulation was found to have completely excised ets. However, in contrast to previous results obtained with ts 1.1-transformed MEPs, no differentiation along the eosinophilic and myeloid lineages was seen in hormone-treated FRV-3-transformed MEPs. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using a site-specific recombinase to excise a fused oncoprotein domain encoded by a retrovirus. More specifically, they show that the Ets portion of the Myb-Ets protein selectively inhibits differentiation of MEPs along the erythroid lineage, and suggests that Ets is also required for their differentiation along the eosinophil and, possibly, myeloid lineages.","['Rossi, F', 'McNagny, K M', 'Logie, C', 'Stewart, A F', 'Graf, T']","['Rossi F', 'McNagny KM', 'Logie C', 'Stewart AF', 'Graf T']","['Cell Regulation Program, European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Curr Biol,Current biology : CB,9107782,"['0 (Estrogen Antagonists)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Recombinases)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (oncogene proteins v-ets)', '22X328QOC4 (Fulvestrant)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Integrases)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (integron integrase IntI1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Chick Embryo', 'Chickens', 'DNA Nucleotidyltransferases/*metabolism', 'Estradiol/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Estrogen Antagonists/pharmacology', 'Fulvestrant', 'Globins/genetics/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism/physiology', 'Humans', '*Integrases', 'Oncogenes', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinases', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/genetics/*metabolism']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0960-9822(02)00610-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s0960-9822(02)00610-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Biol. 1996 Jul 1;6(7):866-72. doi: 10.1016/s0960-9822(02)00610-3.,['F32HL08736/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the link to these mitogenic signal transducers, v-Abl does not stimulate cell growth in general. Only a subset of NIH3T3 cells, represented by the P-3T3 subclone, can respond to the mitogenic effects of v-Abl, whereas the majority of NIH3T3 cells respond to the growth-inhibitory effects of v-Abl. This restricted mitogenic function suggests that v-Abl may rely on additional signal transducers--which are not required for the physiological mitogenic response--to stimulate DNA synthesis. RESULTS: A dominant-negative mutant of the small GTP-binding protein Rac (Rac N17, containing an asparagine residue at position 17) was found to block v-Abl-induced activation of two mitogenic enhancer elements. Activation of the serum response element by v-Abl was inhibited by Rac N17 and Ras N17, whereas activation of the TPA response element was inhibited by Rac N17 but not by Ras N17. The Rac N17 mutant also compromized the ability of v-Abl to activate the MAP-kinase, Erk2, and the stress-activated protein kinase, JNK1. Activation of endogenous Rac was indicated by the ability of v-Abl to stimulate pinocytosis. P-3T3 cells transformed by v-abl could proliferate without serum, but became serum-dependent when Rac N17 was expressed. However, Rac N17 did not inhibit the morphological change or anchorage-independent growth of cells transformed with v-Abl. CONCLUSIONS: The activation of the mitogenic program by v-Abl tyrosine kinase requires not only Ras but also Rac. Multiple pathways are activated by v-Abl in transformed cells. The availability of some of these pathways may determine whether v-Abl can activate mitogenesis.","['Renshaw, M W', 'Lea-Chou, E', 'Wang, J Y']","['Renshaw MW', 'Lea-Chou E', 'Wang JY']","['Department of Biology and Center for Molecular Genetics, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla 92093-0347, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Curr Biol,Current biology : CB,9107782,"['0 (Mitogens)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins v-abl)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 4)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rac GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', '*JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 4', 'Mice', '*Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Mitogens/*metabolism', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins v-abl/*metabolism', 'Pinocytosis/physiology', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'rac GTP-Binding Proteins']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0960-9822(02)00424-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s0960-9822(02)00424-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Biol. 1996 Jan 1;6(1):76-83. doi: 10.1016/s0960-9822(02)00424-4.,['R01 CA043054/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Clinical, microbiological, and pathological records were reviewed retrospectively once the outbreak was appreciated, and prospectively thereafter, to determine the presence or absence of aspergillosis and duration of neutropenia. SETTING: A university tertiary-care center with a single designated hematology-oncology unit. PATIENTS: From January 1988 to September 1993, there were 141 patients with leukemia or bone marrow transplants identified as being neutropenic during 231 admissions to this specialized unit. INTERVENTIONS: Installation of wall-mounted portable high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA)-filter air purifiers, application of copper-8-quinolinolate-formulated paint, replacement of perforated ceiling tiles with nonperforated type, sealing of all windows, replacement of horizontal, dust-accumulating blinds with vinyl, opaque, roller shades, and systematic and regular cleaning of surfaces. RESULTS: Thirty-six cases of nosocomial aspergillosis were diagnosed during this period. The incidence density (ID) in the preconstruction period was 3.18 per 1,000 days at risk. During construction activity-before the implementation of a control strategy-the ID increased dramatically to 9.88 per 1,000 days at risk. With infection control measures implemented and continued construction work, the ID decreased to 2.91 per 1,000 days at risk, comparable to the preconstruction baseline rate.

We conclude that chromaffin cells, which are known to receive a sensory innervation, can provide (a) trophic factor(s), which, in addition to neurotrophins, may be relevant for the maintenance of DRG neurons.","['Krieglstein, K', 'Unsicker, K']","['Krieglstein K', 'Unsicker K']","['Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology III, University Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Brain Res Dev Brain Res,Brain research.

Larger target cells (Chinese hamster ovary or L1210 cells) were stacked among smaller human erythrocytes or erythrocyte ghosts by sequential centrifugation at 700 g to form five-tier pellets in a specially designed centrifugation-electrofusion chamber. The membranes of erythrocytes and ghost were labeled with fluorescent membrane dye (1,1' dioctadecyl-3,3,3'3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine (Dil)), and the contents of ghosts were loaded with water-soluble fluorescent dye (42-kDa fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran (FITC-dextran)), to monitor heterogeneous cell fusion. Fusion efficiency was assayed by the extent of either membrane dye mixing or contents (FITC-dextran) mixing with target cells. Four rectangular electric pulses at 300 V and 80 microseconds each were found to give the optimal fusion results of approximately 80% heterogeneous fusion by the content-mixing assay and approximately 95% by the membrane-dye-mixing assay. Cell viability remained greater than 80% after electrofusion. Because of the electric breakdown of cell membranes at the beginning of the pulse, the pellet resistance and hence the partial voltage across the pellet reduced rapidly during the remaining pulse time. This voltage redistribution favored the survival of fused cells. The limited colloidal-osmotic swelling of cells in pellets enhanced cell-cell contact and increased the pellet resistance after each pulse. As a result, the partial voltage across the pellet was restored when the next pulse was applied. This redistribution of pulse voltage in the pellet system permitted the breakdown of cell membranes at a lower applied voltage threshold than that required for electrofusion of cells in suspension or in dielectrophoretic cell chains. The cell viability and soluble dye retention within cells (FITC-dextran) remained at the same high levels for 3 h when the cells were incubated in respective culture media with serum at 37 degrees C. Viability and dye retention decreased significantly within 30 min when cells were incubated in phosphate-buffered saline without serum. The pellet technique was applied to form hybridomas by fusion of larger SP2/0 murine myelomas with smaller naive mouse lymphocytes. An optimum of 173 +/- 70 hypoxanthine aminopterin thymidine (HAT)-selected clones of the hybridomas was obtained from 40,000 SP2/0 cells and 1.5 x 10(6) lymphocytes used in each trial. This high-efficiency fusion technique may be adapted to mediate drug and gene transfer to target cells ex vivo as well as to form hybrid cells with limited cell sources.","['Li, L H', 'Hensen, M L', 'Zhao, Y L', 'Hui, S W']","['Li LH', 'Hensen ML', 'Zhao YL', 'Hui SW']","['Membrane Biophysics Laboratory, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York 14263 USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biophys J,Biophysical journal,0370626,,IM,"['Animals', 'Biophysical Phenomena', 'Biophysics', 'Biotechnology', 'CHO Cells', '*Cell Fusion', 'Cell Size', 'Cell Survival', 'Cricetinae', '*Drug Delivery Systems', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Erythrocyte Membrane', 'Erythrocytes', 'Humans', '*Hybridomas', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Lymphocytes', 'Membrane Fusion', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-3495(96)79249-4 [pii]', '10.1016/S0006-3495(96)79249-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Biophys J. 1996 Jul;71(1):479-86. doi: 10.1016/S0006-3495(96)79249-4.,['GM30969/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,PMC1233498,,,,,,,

METHODS: Sixteen patients, 11 males and 5 females, 9 in stage B and 7 in stage C, according to the Binet Staging System, were treated with a maximum of 6 cycles of fludarabine (25 mg/m2) for 5 days, every 4 weeks. All patients had been pretreated, 10 were refractory to standard regimens, 5 were in relapse, and 1 patient was in partial remission. RESULTS: Thirteen patients were judged suitable for evaluation. Overall 9 patients were responsive to treatment; 4 complete and 5 partial responses were observed. Of the 4 patients in complete remission, 3 were alive at 6, 10 and 13 months, respectively, from the beginning of treatment. One patient died after 11 months for acute graft-versus-host disease after allogenic bone marrow transplantation by an HLA sibling donor. Two of the 5 patients in partial remission were alive at 7 and 17 months, respectively, and the other 3 died (2 of disease reexpansion after 14 and 16 months and 1 of septic shock following pneumonia). Four patients were not responsive to treatment: 1 died from disease progression after 8 months from the beginning of therapy, 1 from cardiac failure after 9 months, 1 from septic shock following meningitis, and 1 was alive after 7 months of follow-up. Treatment was well tolerated, with nausea and vomiting in only one patient. We observed two episodes of pneumonitis, without any evidence of the responsible agent, a tumor lysis syndrome with acute renal failure, a recurrence of autoimmune thrombocytopenia, and a Coombs-positive hemolytic anemia. CONCLUSIONS: Fludarabine phosphate is effective in the treatment of patients with advanced B-CLL, even in those refractory to multiple chemotherapy regimens.","['Montillo, M', 'Tedeschi, A', 'Delfini, C', 'Olivieri, A', ""D'Adamo, F"", 'Leoni, P']","['Montillo M', 'Tedeschi A', 'Delfini C', 'Olivieri A', ""D'Adamo F"", 'Leoni P']","['Clinica di Ematologia, Torrette University Hospital, Ancona, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Tumori,Tumori,0111356,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Tumori. 1995 Nov-Dec;81(6):419-23.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These molecules present foreign antigenic peptides to cytotoxic T lymphocytes and thereby play a role in the immune surveillance of cells infected with virus or other intracellular pathogens or altered by malignant transformation. A marked deficiency or lack of expression of these antigens has been reported in a variety of human neoplasms. In the present study, we examined the expression of class I alpha chain, beta 2-microglobulin, TAP (TAP1 and TAP2) and LMP (LMP2 and LMP7) genes in a number of human tumor cell lines including small-cell lung carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, colon adenocarcinoma and basophilic leukaemia. These cell lines were deficient in expression of both class I alpha chain and beta 2-microglobulin gene products. In addition, these cell lines lacked the products of MHC-encoded proteasome subunit LMP2 as well as the putative peptide transporter TAP1 genes. In contrast, TAP2 and LMP7 genes were expressed in these cell lines. Treatment of cells with gamma-IFN markedly enhanced the expression of class I alpha chain, beta 2-microglobulin, TAP1 and LMP2 genes with a concomitant increase in cell-surface expression of class I molecules. The upregulation of TAP1 and LMP2 expression is associated with increased class I expression, suggesting that endogenous antigens, e.g. tumor antigens, could be presented by class I molecules following treatment of tumor cells with gamma-IFN.","['Singal, D P', 'Ye, M', 'Ni, J', 'Snider, D P']","['Singal DP', 'Ye M', 'Ni J', 'Snider DP']","['Department of Pathology, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Immunol Lett,Immunology letters,7910006,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 2)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 3)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (TAP1 protein, human)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)', '144416-78-4 (LMP-2 protein)', '145892-13-3 (TAP2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (LMP7 protein)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 2', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 3', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*genetics', '*Cysteine Endopeptidases', 'Down-Regulation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*metabolism', 'Humans', '*Multienzyme Complexes', 'Neoplasms/genetics/*immunology', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Proteins/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/metabolism']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['016524789602531X [pii]', '10.1016/0165-2478(96)02531-x [doi]']",ppublish,Immunol Lett. 1996 May;50(3):149-54. doi: 10.1016/0165-2478(96)02531-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DATA SYNTHESIS: Interventions such as relaxation training, guided imagery, attentional/cognitive distraction, and therapeutic touch have been found to reduce pain, anxiety, and chemotherapy-related side effects, to elicit the relaxation response, and to improve several aspects of immune function in patients with cancer. CONCLUSIONS: A multicomponent, long-term program of behavioral interventions may provide the greatest and most lasting benefit, but it may be very challenging to implement. However, simple relaxation techniques are not difficult to learn, are not particularly time-consuming or costly to practice, and can be used anywhere.

DATA SOURCES: Published articles, book chapters, and personal experience. DATA SYNTHESIS: Various pretransplant agents and methods are under investigation to improve the outcome and reduce the costs of allogeneic and autologous BMT and peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) transplants. Preliminary results of current studies indicate that autologous BMTs and PBPC transplants have merit as a treatment option in patients with AML and require further research. For patients with APL, BMT usually is reserved for those who fail to achieve or relapse after achieving remission with chemotherapy. Preliminary data show that patients with CML and APL who receive a PBPC transplant engraft more rapidly with decreased morbidity and mortality. CONCLUSIONS: BMT options for patients with CML and APL continue to evolve as advances in pretransplant methods and symptom management become capable of improving the outcome, decreasing costs, and shifting patient care to the outpatient and homecare settings. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: Understanding the marrow transplant options available to patients with CML and APL is essential for nurses. They must stay informed about ongoing improvements in pretransplant processes and symptom-management procedures that reduce BMT morbidity and mortality.

DATA SOURCES: Published articles, book chapters, and production information. DATA SYNTHESIS: Two agents with newly approved FDA indications are changing the focus of leukemia treatment from the cytotoxicity of specific drugs to the reversal of arrested maturation of myeloid cells. All-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) induces remission in patients with relapsed or refractory APL. Interferon alfa (IFN-alpha) administered to patients with chronic-phase, Philadelphia-chromosome-positive CML produces improved survival rates and delays disease progression as compared to standard therapy. PCR assays are used with both of these diseases to confirm diagnosis, monitor response to these agents, and predict disease progression. CONCLUSIONS: The care of patients with leukemia continues to change as new agents such as ATRA and are approved for treatment and new assays such as PCR become available for diagnosis and treatment monitoring. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: The nursing care of patients with leukemia requires keeping knowledgeable about the latest information regarding the molecular biology of the disease, the mechanism of action of newly approved agents, and the clinical implications of developing tests. This knowledge allows nurses to assimilate new therapies into practice, which, in turn, enables them to help patients to understand and cope with treatment through patient education and innovative interventions for symptom management.","['Wujcik, D']",['Wujcik D'],"['Vanderbilt Cancer Center Affiliate Network, Nashville, TN, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Oncol Nurs Forum,Oncology nursing forum,7809033,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*drug therapy/nursing', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/diagnosis/*drug therapy/nursing', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nursing Assessment', 'Nursing Diagnosis', '*Patient Care Team', 'Patient Education as Topic', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncol Nurs Forum. 1996 Apr;23(3):478-87.,,70,,,,,,,,,,,,

A weak inhibitory effect on the growth of P388/S and P388/ADR cells was observed at a sense and antisense oligonucleotide concentration of 30 microM. Using the monoclonal antibody to P-glycoprotein and a flow cytometry technique, we showed that the level of expression of P-glycoprotein in P388/ADR cells treated with antisense oligonucleotide was lower than when treated with sense oligonucleotide. The antisense oligonucleotide potentiated the growth-inhibitory effect of vinblastine on P388/ADR cells, whereas sense oligonucleotide did not. This was accompanied by an increase in vinblastine retention in the cells. The reversal of the resistance by antisense oligonucleotide was increased by the combination with 1 microM verapamil.

So far, natural antibodies to p27rex and/or p21X have not been found in sera from HTLV-I-infected individuals, although antibodies to p40tax have been found. Recently, the viral transcripts specific for these proteins were detected in fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells from HTLV-I-infected individuals by the polymerase chain reaction coupled to reverse transcription, showing the in vivo expression of these proteins. We detected antibodies to p21X and p27rex by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) system using a recombinantly produced p21X protein as a common antigen, because p21X is identical to the C-terminal portion of p27rex. The sensitivity of the ELISA was determined to be approximately 100 times greater than that of Western blotting. From the analyzed sera of 31 ATL patients, 30 asymptomatic carriers, 18 HAM patients and 100 healthy donors, three specimens from one ATL patient and two carriers were found to be positive for anti-p21X/p27rex antibodies. The specificity of the ELISA reaction was confirmed by the competitive ELISA test with the highly purified recombinant p21X protein.

In the HTLV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR)-Tax transgenic mouse model, Tax expression causes fibroblastic tumors. A tumor-derived cell line (B line) obtained from an explant of a Tax-transformed tumor, was established. This line expresses high levels of many cytokines as a consequence of Tax activation. However, the tumors are not immunogenic when transplanted into syngeneic mice. Because B line cells do not express the immunogenic cytokine interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), a replication-defective adenoviral vector was used to deliver the IFN-gamma gene to tumor cells. The recombinant IFN-gamma adenovirus (IFN-gamma/Ad) can efficiently infect B line cells, resulting in high levels of IFN-gamma expression and secretion. Local secretion of IFN-gamma from B line cells caused both CD(4+)- and CD(8+)-positive T cell infiltration, and completely inhibited local tumor development in transplanted mice. Immunization with these cells significantly delayed tumor development after subsequent challenges of parental tumor cells. Expression of IFN-gamma in B cells also partially inhibited the highly expressed immune suppressive cytokine, transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1). This system provides us with a valuable tumor immune therapy model to evaluate the effects of cytokines in induction or inhibition of specific antitumor immunity.","['Xu, X', 'Dai, Y', 'Heidenreich, O', 'Nerenberg, M I']","['Xu X', 'Dai Y', 'Heidenreich O', 'Nerenberg MI']","['Department of Molecular and Experimental Medicine, Scripps Research Institue, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Adenoviruses, Human/*genetics', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Fibrosarcoma/*therapy', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Genetic Vectors', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*genetics/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vaccination']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/hum.1996.7.4-471 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 1996 Mar 1;7(4):471-7. doi: 10.1089/hum.1996.7.4-471.,"['CA50234/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'NS12428/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cross-linking of Fc epsilon RI with ligands of well-defined structure and valency has revealed detailed information about the fundamental requirements for functionally active receptor aggregates. Cross-linking-dependent changes in the interaction of these receptors with other cellular components have been characterized with biochemical and biophysical methods to develop a more complete view of signal initiation. Recent evidence suggests that this process involves the interaction of aggregated Fc epsilon RI with specialized plasma membrane domains that may localize important signaling molecules in the vicinity of aggregated receptors.

We studied the capacity of P-glycoprotein to extrude drugs from the cells. For nanomolar concentrations of vinblastine P388/ADR cells, which overexpress P-glycoprotein in the plasma membrane, accumulated vinblastine, at 37 degrees C for 30 min, to a much lower extent than the sensitive cells (P388/S), while in the micromolar range the cellular concentration was similar for both types of cells. When cells were incubated with a low (10 nM) or high concentration (1 microM) of vinblastine while energy deprived, the vinblastine concentration increased only in the resistant cells incubated with the low concentration of vinblastine, and this increased level was lowered to the level under the normal conditions by addition of glucose. In contrast, the cellular concentrations in other cases were increased to the normal level by glucose. After cells were loaded with the low concentration of vinblastine, the cellular vinblastine was extruded more rapidly from the resistant cells than from the sensitive cells. The courses of vinblastine efflux from the cells loaded with the high concentration of vinblastine were similar in both types of cells. NA-382, a reported P-glycoprotein inhibitor, effectively increased the intracellular vinblastine and inhibited the drug efflux only from multidrug-resistant cells, P388/ADR and AH66 cells, which were incubated with the low concentration of vinblastine. Cellular uptake of NA-382 was also less in P388/ADR cells than in P388/S cells in culture with 10 nM but not 1 microM of the agent, and this low level was reversed to the level in the sensitive cells by 10 microM vinblastine.

Two cell variants were used. The first (FL) was completely susceptible to hexamethylene bis-acetamide (HMBA)-treatment and responded in both growth-retardation and hemoglobin synthesis. The second (R1) failed to synthesize hemoglobin in response to HMBA although cell growth was still inhibited. In both cell variants, 2-5A synthetase enzyme activity was induced in a similar fashion, reaching a peak at 26 hours after treatment with HMBA. However, the down regulation of activity thereafter was not identical in both cases. In R1 cells, the reduction was much slower compared to FL cells. A similar pattern was observed with the appearance of the 43 kDa isoform of 2-5A synthetase in immunoblots. An analysis of 2-5A synthetase gene expression revealed the presence of 1.7 kb transcripts which peaked at 16 hours after HMBA-treatment in both cell variants. Again, the down-regulation in expression was slower in R1 than in FL cells. Addition of anti-murin alpha/beta-IFN antibodies did not reduce the level of either 2-5A synthetase expression or enzyme activity in either cell variant. Interestingly, the presence of antibodies also did not affect the pattern of pRb phosphorylation in the cell variants exposed to HMBA. In both cell variants, an increase in the amount of the phosphorylated form (ppRb) was observed in immunoblots after 4 hours. This form was gradually transformed to the underphosphorylated molecule (pRb) with time in culture, even in the presence of antibodies.

This paper describes that the enhancement of BLM cytotoxicity was also achieved by a sequential BLM-treatment immediately after vortex-stirring cells with PAA only. It was suggested that this enhancement resulted from the transient permeabilization of the plasma membrane induced during vortex-stirring in the presence of PAA, leading to an increase in BLM incorporation. This mechanism was supported by the finding of an appreciable uptake by vortex-stirred cells of Lucifer Yellow, a known non-permeant material. This procedure, which did not affect any cell viability, might be a beneficial method for transient permeabilization of cultured mammalian cells to facilitate the internalization of non-permeant materials.","['Shimizu, N', 'Kawazoe, Y']","['Shimizu N', 'Kawazoe Y']","['Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nagoya City University, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Biol Pharm Bull,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,9311984,"['0 (Acrylic Resins)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '4Q93RCW27E (carbopol 940)', '9654F8OVKE (lucifer yellow)']",IM,"['Acrylic Resins/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Bleomycin/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane Permeability/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Isoquinolines', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Mice', 'Temperature', 'Time Factors']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1248/bpb.19.805 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Pharm Bull. 1996 Jun;19(6):805-8. doi: 10.1248/bpb.19.805.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The latter are mostly due to inhibitory effects of some ingredients and/ or to pipetting errors. In order to reveal the errors, it is advisable to apply standard molecules as indicators of the efficacy of the reactions. In the present paper a rapid and simple method is presented to create internal standards for two test PCR assays. One of the assays detects proviral DNA of bovine leukemia virus (BLV-PCR), the other assay amplifies cDNA of feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV-RT-PCR). The internal standard molecules, termed 'mimics', were constructed to have the same primer-binding nucleotide sequences as the viral nucleic acids, but to flank a heterologous DNA fragment of different size. As heterologous DNA, a part of human beta-acin gene was used for the mimic construction. The identical primer-binding nucleotide sequences allowed co-amplification of the viral nucleic acid and the mimic in the same tube, and simultaneously, the size differences allowed easy discrimination between their PCR products. By running a rapid agarose gel electrophoresis after co-amplification, the presence or absence of the mimic PCR products provided proper information on the efficacy of the PCR in each reaction tube. We came to the conclusion that 5 to 20 mimic molecules, co-amplified with the samples, significantly increased the reliability of the diagnostic PCR assays.","['Ballagi-Pordany, A', 'Belak, S']","['Ballagi-Pordany A', 'Belak S']","['Department of Virology, National Veterinary Institute, Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Mol Cell Probes,Molecular and cellular probes,8709751,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/genetics', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'False Negative Reactions', 'Gene Amplification', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Proviruses/metabolism', 'RNA, Viral', 'Reference Standards']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0890-8508(96)90022-5 [pii]', '10.1006/mcpr.1996.0022 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Probes. 1996 Jun;10(3):159-64. doi: 10.1006/mcpr.1996.0022.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The functional importance of these residues was assessed by alanine mutagenesis. Substitution of either F152 or K155 with alanine was found to specifically inhibit cytokine interaction with LIFR without affecting binding to CNTFR alpha or gp130. The resulting variants behaved as partial agonists with varying degrees of residual bioactivity in different cell-based assays. Simultaneous alanine substitution of both F152 and K155 totally abolished biological activity. Combining these mutations with amino acid substitutions in the D-helix, which enhance binding affinity for the CNTFR alpha, gave rise to a potent competitive CNTF receptor antagonist.

We postulate that p36 MBP kinase is a common component in diverse signaling pathways leading to apoptosis.","['Lu, M L', 'Sato, M', 'Cao, B', 'Richie, J P']","['Lu ML', 'Sato M', 'Cao B', 'Richie JP']","[""Division of Urologic Surgery, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '1W21G5Q4N2 (Okadaic Acid)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*radiation effects', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/*radiation effects', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism/radiation effects', 'DNA Damage', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Male', 'Mice', '*Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Okadaic Acid/pharmacology', 'Phorbol Esters/pharmacology', 'Prostatic Neoplasms', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time Factors', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",1996/08/20 00:00,1996/08/20 00:01,['1996/08/20 00:00'],"['1996/08/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/20 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.93.17.8977 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1996 Aug 20;93(17):8977-82. doi: 10.1073/pnas.93.17.8977.,['DK45865/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,PMC38580,,,,,,,

By a combination of ion exchange and reverse-phase liquid chromatography, three inhibitors were purified to homogeneity as ascertained by microsequencing of 14-17 N-terminal amino acids. These inhibitors were identified as oncostatin M (OSM), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1). The identities of the three EC growth inhibitors were confirmed by demonstrating that recombinant human OSM, LIF, and TGF-beta1 were inhibitory in the same concentration range. Inhibition of EC proliferation by OSM was a newly described property of this cytokine. OSM was the most potent inhibitor with a half-maximal inhibition by recombinant material of 0.15-.2 ng/ml compared with 0.6-0.9 and 0. 9-1.0 ng/ml for LIF and TGF-beta1, respectively. The three factors inhibited basal, vascular endothelial cell growth factor-stimulated, and fibroblast growth factor 2-stimulated EC proliferation. Interleukin-6 and ciliary neurotrophic factor, two cytokines related structurally to OSM and LIF, were not active as EC growth inhibitors.

Induced nitric oxide biosynthesis occurs in brain cells only if extracellular cerebrospinal fluid contains -arginine. This study demonstrates for the first time that induced iNOS activity is strictly dependent on concomitant induction of an alternatively spliced transcript of the cat-2 gene encoding high affinity -arginine transporter System y+ in cultured rat astrocytes. Inhibition profiles of radiolabeled -arginine and -leucine uptake identified the dominance of Na+-independent transport System y+ serving cationic amino acids, with insignificant activities of Systems y+L, bo,+, or Bo,+. A reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction/sequencing/cloning strategy was used to identify a single 123-base nucleotide sequence coding the high affinity domain of alternatively spliced CAT-2 (not CAT-2a) in astrocytes activated by lipopolysaccharide/interferon-gamma. Using this sequence as a cDNA probe, it was determined that CAT-2 mRNA, iNOS mRNA, and System y+ activity were concomitantly and strongly induced in astrocytes. Constitutive CAT-1 mRNA was weakly present in neurons and astrocytes, was not inducible in either cell type, and contributed <3% to total System y+ activity. Although astroglial iNOS Km approximately 10 microM L-arginine for intracellular substrate, hyperbolic kinetics of inducible iNOS activity measured as a function of extracellular L-arginine concentration gave Km approximately 50 microM L-arginine with intact cells. The same Km approximately 50 microM was obtained for induced membrane transport System y+ activity. iNOS activity was reduced to zero in the absence of extracellular L-arginine uptake via System y+. These findings expand the current understanding of NO biosynthesis modulation and implicate a coordinated regulation of intracellular iNOS enzyme activity with membrane L-arginine transport in brain.","['Stevens, B R', 'Kakuda, D K', 'Yu, K', 'Waters, M', 'Vo, C B', 'Raizada, M K']","['Stevens BR', 'Kakuda DK', 'Yu K', 'Waters M', 'Vo CB', 'Raizada MK']","['Department of Physiology, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida 32610-0274, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (ecotropic murine leukemia virus receptor)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase)']",IM,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Arginine/*metabolism', 'Astrocytes/*metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological Transport', 'Brain/cytology', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Gene Expression', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nitric Oxide/*biosynthesis', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred WKY', '*Receptors, Virus', 'Recombinant Proteins']",1996/09/27 00:00,1996/09/27 00:01,['1996/09/27 00:00'],"['1996/09/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/27 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/27 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.271.39.24017 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)40181-0 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1996 Sep 27;271(39):24017-22. doi: 10.1074/jbc.271.39.24017.,"['CA09290/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM07752/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-AI30464/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,"['GENBANK/U53927', 'GENBANK/U53928']",,,,,,,,,,,

Different splice variants in L1210 cells encode mitochondrial or cytosolic forms of the enzyme.,23820-7,"The organization of the murine folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS) gene has been determined by sequence analysis that also revealed an interesting complexity in the case of exon 1. The entire nucleotide sequence of the L1210 FPGS cDNA, the 3'- and 5'-untranslated regions, the mitochondrial leader sequence, and the coding region were found to be distributed on 15 exons with an overall length of 10.358 kilobases. Two splice variants of exon 1 were identified by screening of an L1210 cell cDNA library. Variant I (exons 1a + 1b plus 2-15) incorporates all of the sequence homologous to the recently reported (Taylor, S. M., Freemantle, S. J., and Moran, R. G. (1995) Cancer Res. 55, 6030-6034) human exon 1, including two ATG start codons at positions +1 and +126, and encodes both mitochondrial and cytosolic form of FPGS. The most prevalent variant, Variant II (exons 1b plus 2 to 15), incorporates only a portion (92 nucleotides at the 3' end) of this sequence, incorporates only one ATG start codon at position +126, and encodes only cytosolic FPGS. The existence of this variant is consistent with the identification of an appropriately situated internal donor/acceptor site in what was believed to be exon 1. A third related variant (Variant III) with a novel 5' termini was originally identified by screening of a mouse liver cDNA library. This variant, which occurs at moderately low frequency in the L1210 cell cDNA library, incorporates an alternate to exon 1a (exon 1c) spliced to exon 1b plus exons 2-15 and encodes a different mitochondrial leader peptide than Variant I. The identification of these variants suggests another possible mechanism, i.e. at the level of precursor mRNA splicing, for regulating synthesis of mitochondrial versus cytosolic forms of FPGS in the cell. Exon 1c is positioned in the gene upstream of exon 1a separated by an intron of 56 nucleotides within a region of DNA sequence that like the homologous human sequence is distinctly promoter-like. However, the sequence of this region differs from the human sequence in terms of the number, position, and type of putative regulatory elements, particularly in regard to the number of SP-1 binding sites and the position of multiple transcription start sites as determined by enzymatic primer extension.","['Roy, K', 'Mitsugi, K', 'Sirotnak, F M']","['Roy K', 'Mitsugi K', 'Sirotnak FM']","['Program in Molecular Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Cornell University, New York, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (Peptide Synthases)', 'EC 6.3.2.17 (folylpolyglutamate synthetase)']",IM,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cytosol/enzymology', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Exons', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/enzymology', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/enzymology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptide Synthases/*genetics', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid']",1996/09/27 00:00,1996/09/27 00:01,['1996/09/27 00:00'],"['1996/09/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/27 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/27 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.271.39.23820 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)40155-X [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1996 Sep 27;271(39):23820-7. doi: 10.1074/jbc.271.39.23820.,"['CA08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA56517/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,"['GENBANK/U33557', 'GENBANK/U54793']",,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report that CRKL is phosphorylated when overexpressed, activates RAS and JUN kinase signaling pathways, and transforms fibroblasts in a RAS-dependent fashion. We examined the potential role of CRKL in BCR-ABL function by deleting the CRKL binding site in BCR-ABL. This mutant BCR-ABL protein shows a 50% reduction in fibroblast transforming activity. The GRB2 adaptor protein has previously been implicated in this pathway, presumably linking BCR-ABL to RAS. To address the relative roles of CRKL and GRB2 in this system, we compared BCR-ABL mutants with defects in binding to one or both adaptors. Whereas each single mutant showed a 2-3-fold loss in transforming activity, the double mutant showed a 15-fold reduction, suggesting that GRB2 and CRKL both contribute to BCR-ABL transformation.

Posttranslational modification of translation initiation and elongation factors or regulation of mRNA polyadenylation represent common means of regulating translation in response to mitogenic or developmental signals. Induced differentiation of Friend virus-transformed erythroleukemia cells is accompanied by a rapid decrease in the translation rate of these cells. Although inducers do not alter initiation factor modifications, characterization of their effect on mRNA translation provides evidence that this is mediated by the poly(A)-binding protein (PABP). Inducer exposure results in an increase in the amount of mRNA that sediments at 80 S and a decrease in the amount in polysomes. Although these 80 S ribosomes have characteristics previously attributed to ""vacant ribosomal couples,"" including lability in 500 mM KCl and an inability to incorporate amino acids into protein, we provide evidence that these 80 S complexes are not vacant but contain mRNA that is stably bound to the 40 S subunit, whereas the 60 S subunit is dissociated from the complex by high salt. The absence of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 from these complexes suggests that translation has proceeded through subunit joining. Immunoblotting demonstrates that the mRNAs in these 80 S ribosomal complexes do not contain bound PABP and that this protein is found to be almost exclusively associated with translating polysomes. These data suggest that the PABP plays a role in the accumulation of these 80 S ribosomal.mRNA complexes and may facilitate the formation of translationally active salt-stable ribosomes.","['Hensold, J O', 'Barth-Baus, D', 'Stratton, C A']","['Hensold JO', 'Barth-Baus D', 'Stratton CA']","['The University/Ireland Cancer Center, Department of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio 44106, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-2)', '0 (Poly(A)-Binding Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '660YQ98I10 (Potassium Chloride)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Amino Acids/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-2/analysis', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Poly(A)-Binding Proteins', 'Polyribosomes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Potassium Chloride/pharmacology', '*Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Ribosomes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/09/20 00:00,1996/09/20 00:01,['1996/09/20 00:00'],"['1996/09/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/20 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/20 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.271.38.23246 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)40272-4 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1996 Sep 20;271(38):23246-54. doi: 10.1074/jbc.271.38.23246.,['DK43414/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate activated an inward sodium current. This current had a new permeability sequence to monovalent cations and a different pharmacological profile to that of other characterized Na+ channels. Long hyperpolarizing steps revealed that the current declined during the pulse, and the decline was voltage-dependent. Activation of the current required Mg2+ and ATP. The nonhydrolyzable ATP analogues, adenosine 5'-O-(thio)triphosphate and adenosine 5'-(beta,gamma-imino)triphosphate, could not substitute for ATP.

Extensive Northern analysis of Genesis found that the message was exclusively expressed in embryonic stem cells or their malignant equivalent, embryonal carcinoma cells. The Genesis transcript was down-regulated when these cells were stimulated to differentiate. DNA sequences that Genesis protein would interact with were characterized and were found to contain a consensus similar to that found in an embryonic stem cell enhancer sequence. Co-transfection experiments revealed that Genesis is a transcriptional repressor. Genesis mapped to mouse chromosome 4 in a region syntenic with human chromosome 1p31, a site of nonrandom abnormalities in germ cell neoplasia, neuroblastoma, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

Two acute transforming retroviruses, avian myeloblastosis virus and the E26 leukemia virus, transduced portions of c-myb and encode Myb proteins that are truncated in both the DBD and the NRD. Several conserved potential sites for phosphorylation by proline-directed serine/threonine protein kinases reside in or near the NRD, suggesting that phosphorylation might play a role in regulating c-Myb. We have previously demonstrated that serine 528, located in the NRD, is a target for p42(mapk) in vitro. Serine 528 is phosphorylated in vivo in several cell lines, and substitution of serine 528 to alanine (S528A) resulted in an increased ability of Myb to transactivate a synthetic promoter containing five copies of the mim-1A Myb-responsive element and a minimal herpes tk promoter. We have tested the ability of S528A Myb to transactivate a series of cellular target promoters and report that the serine to alanine substitution increased the ability of Myb to activate transcription from the CD34 promoter but not the c-myc or mim-1 promoters. This suggests that phosphorylation of serine 528 may differentially regulate c-Myb activity at different promoters. The DNA binding and multimerization activities of c-Myb appear to be unaffected by the S528A substitution, suggesting that phosphorylation of serine 528 may mediate its effect on the transcription transactivating activity of c-Myb by regulating interactions with other proteins.","['Miglarese, M R', 'Richardson, A F', 'Aziz, N', 'Bender, T P']","['Miglarese MR', 'Richardson AF', 'Aziz N', 'Bender TP']","['Departments of Microbiology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia 22908, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '9DLQ4CIU6V (Proline)', 'OF5P57N2ZX (Alanine)']",IM,"['Alanine', 'Animals', 'Avian Myeloblastosis Virus', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'DNA/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Mice', 'Molecular Weight', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proline/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb', 'Serine', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation']",1996/09/13 00:00,1996/09/13 00:01,['1996/09/13 00:00'],"['1996/09/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/13 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/13 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.271.37.22697 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)61809-0 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1996 Sep 13;271(37):22697-705. doi: 10.1074/jbc.271.37.22697.,"['CA-09109/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-40042/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM-07055/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In humans, it is present as one of the major monosaccharide components in body fluids and serves as an indicator for glycemic control in diabetic care. However, its metabolic origin and fate have been poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that 1,5AnGlc-ol is produced from glucose in erythroleukemia cells, K-562. We show the occurrence of 1,5-anhydrofructose (1,5AnFru), a derivative of 1,5AnGlc-ol oxidized at the C2 position, in K-562 cells. In addition, several pieces of evidence indicated that 1,5AnFru, rather than glucose, was the immediate precursor in 1,5AnGlc-ol production in erythroleukemia cells: exogenous 1,5AnFru was readily taken up into the cells and reduced to 1,5AnGlc-ol, but the reverse reaction, oxidation of 1,5AnGlc-ol to 1,5AnFru, was scarcely observed. The apparent K(m) of the overall cellular reduction for 1,5AnFru was estimated as 70 mg/l. This reduction was markedly inhibited by glucose in the culture medium but not by 1,5AnGlc-ol or glucitol. Since 1,5AnFru arises from alpha-1,4-glucans through lyase reactions in fungi and algae, we suggest the possibilities that glycogen in the precursor of 1,5AnFru and, therefore, 1,5AnGlc-ol originates from glycogen in mammals.","['Suzuki, M', 'Kametani, S', 'Uchida, K', 'Akanuma, H']","['Suzuki M', 'Kametani S', 'Uchida K', 'Akanuma H']","['Department of Functional Material Science, Faculty of Engineering, Saitama University, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['30237-26-4 (Fructose)', '506T60A25R (Sorbitol)', '54BB3B7XMZ (1,5-anhydroglucitol)', '75414-43-6 (1,5-anhydrofructose)', '9G2MP84A8W (Deoxyglucose)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, Ion Exchange', 'Deoxyglucose/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Fructose/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Glucose/metabolism', 'Glycolysis', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mammals', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Molecular Structure', 'Sorbitol/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/08/15 00:00,1996/08/15 00:01,['1996/08/15 00:00'],"['1996/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1996.0023h.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1996 Aug 15;240(1):23-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1996.0023h.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This review focuses on the coding potential of the HTLV-II X region and presents a comparison with that of HTLV-I. Expression of different ORFs present in the X region may be accessed through two expression strategies: alternative splicing and translation of more than one protein from the same mRNA.

The populations at risk are, in a large majority, from developing countries but the epidemic of HTLV-II infection in intravenous drug users (IVDU) represents a possible reservoir for dissemination in the general population. The number of HTLV-I-infected individuals (15 to 25 million), together with the severity of associated disease, justifies the development of a vaccine. Different vaccine preparations have been developed, using mostly recombinant pox and adenoviruses, but DNA plasmid technology will soon become a feasible approach. Various animal models exist for experimental viral infections, involving rats, rabbits, or monkeys, but up to now, neither hematological nor neurological disorders have been induced by HTLV infection in such animal models. For long-term protection from HTLV-I-associated diseases, vaccination should induce both neutralizing antibodies and specific cell-mediated immunity. This will require the incorporation of both env and gag coding sequences in the vaccine preparations. Preventive clinical trials may involve different cohorts of seronegative young girls from endemic areas prior to sexual activity and IVDU in the industrialized world. In parallel, one should consider therapeutic vaccine trials in HTLV-I-positive mothers and IVDU to protect them against disease development.

In our study, 10 previously untreated patients (8 acute ATL, 1 smoldering ATL, and 1 ATL lymphoma) received this combination. Eight responses were obtained, with two complete remissions, four very good partial remissions (PR) with a 95% reduction of the tumor burden, and two 50% PR. Six patients relapsed, with a median event-free survival of 12 months (range, 3-15 months). Seven patients are still alive, with a median follow-up of 15 months (range, 6 to 28 months).

However, later in the course of the disease adult T-cell leukemia (ATL), cells no longer produce IL-2 yet continue to express the IL-2R. During studies to define the pathogenic mechanisms that underlie this IL-2-independent proliferation, we defined a cytokine designated IL-T/IL-15 that stimulates T-cell proliferation and requires the expression of IL-2R beta and IL-2R gamma for its action. To exploit the fact that IL-2Rs are present on abnormal T cells in patients with tropical parasitic paraparesis/HTLV-I-associated myelopathy (TSP/HAM) and ATL but not on normal resting cells, different forms of IL-2R-directed therapy have been initiated. Unmodified humanized anti-Tac is being used to treat patient with TSP/HAM. To enhance its effector function for the treatment of ATL anti-Tac was armed with alpha- and beta-emitting radionuclides. In a clinical trial with 90Y-anti-Tac at the doses used (5, 10, and 15 mCi), 9 of the 18 patients with ATL underwent a partial or sustained complete remission.

These studies showed that TSP/HAM patients have higher antibody levels against viral antigens and a higher proviral load compared to asymptomatic carriers and adult T cell leukemia (ATL) patients. A mutation in the tax gene was found to be associated with TSP/HAM, which in turn correlates with a higher transactivation activity of Tax. In addition, we found that HTLV-I-infected individuals contain infected cells that are clonally expanded. The genomic structure of these expanded clones shows that defective proviruses are present in asymptomatic carriers. A predilection in the defectiveness, however, was found to correlate with the presence (Cosmopolitan molecular genotype) or absence of the tax mutation (Japanese molecular genotype). Our results suggest that defective proviruses retaining structural genes might be a risk factor for TSP/HAM development. Contrary, defective proviruses retaining regulatory genes in the pX region could be a risk factor for ATL development. The molecular mechanism by which these defective proviruses is generated and expressed should give new insight into HTLV-I pathogenesis.","['Renjifo, B', 'Chou, K', 'Soto Ramirez, L', 'Garcia Vallejo, F', 'Essex, M']","['Renjifo B', 'Chou K', 'Soto Ramirez L', 'Garcia Vallejo F', 'Essex M']","['Department of Cancer Biology, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr Hum Retrovirol,Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes and human retrovirology : official publication of the International Retrovirology Association,9501482,"['0 (Deltaretrovirus Antibodies)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)']",IM,"['Clone Cells/virology', 'Defective Viruses/genetics', 'Deltaretrovirus Antibodies/analysis', 'Disease Progression', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics', '*Genome, Viral', 'Genotype', 'HTLV-I Infections/*genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/virology', 'Mutation', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/immunology/virology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'Tropism']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00042560-199600001-00023 [doi]'],ppublish,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr Hum Retrovirol. 1996;13 Suppl 1:S146-53. doi: 10.1097/00042560-199600001-00023.,"['5 D43 TW0004/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 39805/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",46,,,,,,,,,,,,

In parallel, the molecular epidemiology of HTLV-I proviruses showed that the few nucleotide changes observed between isolates were specific for the geographical origin of the patients but not for the type of the associated pathologies (adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma, tropical spastic paraparesis/HTLV-I-associated myelopathy). Thus, based on sequence and/or restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of more than 250 HTLV-I isolates originating from the main viral endemic areas, three major molecular geographical subtypes (or genotypes) emerged, strongly supported by phylogenetic analysis (high bootstrap values). Each of these genotypes (Cosmopolitan, Central African, and Melanesian) appeared to arise from ancient interspecies transmission between monkeys infected with simian T cell leukemia/lymphoma virus type I and humans. Furthermore, careful sequences analyses indicate that, within (or alongside) these three main genotypes, there are molecular subgroups defined clearly by several specific mutations but not always supported by phylogenetic analyses. Thus in Japan, there is evidence for two ancestral HTLV-I lineages: the classical Cosmopolitan genotype, representing approximately 25% of the HTLV-I present in Japan and clustering in the southern islands; and a related subgroup that we called the Japanese group. Similarly, within the Central African cluster, there are molecular subgroups defined by specific substitutions in either the env or the long terminal repeat. Furthermore, recent data from our laboratory indicate the presence of a new molecular phylogenetic group (fourth genotype) found among inhabitants of Central Africa, particularly in Pygmies.

Previous genetic analyses indicated that HTLV-I can be phylogenetically classified into three major lineages: Melanesian, Central African, and Cosmopolitan groups. Recently, more detailed characterization using long terminal repeat sequences (the most variable genomic region) has revealed that the Cosmopolitan group consists of four subtypes: (A) Transcontinental, (B) Japanese, (C) West African, and (D) North African.

HTLV-I encodes a potent transactivator protein termed Tax that appears to play an important role in the process of T-cell immortalization. Even though the mechanisms by which Tax induces transformation are still unknown, it seems likely that the ability of Tax to alter the expression of many cellular genes plays an important part in this process. Tax does not bind directly to DNA but rather deregulates the activity of cellular transcription factors. One family of host transcription factors whose activity is altered by Tax includes NF-kappa B/Rel. These transcription factors are post-transcriptionally regulated by their assembly with a second family of inhibitory proteins termed I kappa B that serve to sequester the NF-kappa B/Rel complexes in the cytoplasm. Upon cellular activation, I kappa B alpha is phosphorylated, polyubiquitinated, and degraded in the proteasome. This proteolytic event liberates NF-kappa B, permitting its rapid translocation into the nucleus where it binds to its cognate enhancer elements. Similarly, the p105 precursor of the NF-kappa B p50 subunit is also post-translationally processed in the proteasome. The mechanisms by which Tax activates NF-kappa B remain unclear, and findings presented in the literature are often controversial. We identified a physical interaction between Tax and the HsN3 subunit of the human proteasome. This raises the intriguing possibility that physical association of the HsN3 proteasome subunit with HTLV-I Tax coupled with the independent interaction of Tax with either p100 or p65-I kappa B alpha targets these cytoplasmic NF-kappa B/Rel complexes to the proteasome for processing.","['Beraud, C', 'Greene, W C']","['Beraud C', 'Greene WC']","['Gladstone Institute of Virology and Immunology, San Francisco, California, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr Hum Retrovirol,Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes and human retrovirology : official publication of the International Retrovirology Association,9501482,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (I kappa B beta protein)', '0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proteins)', '144416-78-4 (LMP-2 protein)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', '*Cysteine Endopeptidases', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/physiology', 'Gene Products, tax/*physiology', 'HTLV-I Infections/*virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*chemistry/*physiology', 'Humans', '*I-kappa B Proteins', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Structure', 'NF-kappa B/*physiology', 'Proteins/*physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/virology']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00042560-199600001-00014 [doi]'],ppublish,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr Hum Retrovirol. 1996;13 Suppl 1:S76-84. doi: 10.1097/00042560-199600001-00014.,,88,,,,,,,,,,,,

According to the seroepidemiologic survey, the seroprevalence of HTLV-I in patients with idiopathic uveitis was significantly higher than that of two control groups, that is, patients with uveitis with defined etiologies and patients with nonuveitic ocular diseases.

The following virologic, molecular biologic findings suggest that cytokines produced by HTLV-I-infected T cells in the eye play the central role in the pathogenic mechanisms of the uveitis: (a) the virus load in the peripheral blood monocytes analyzed by the quantitative polymerase chain reaction methods was significantly greater in patients with the uveitis than in asymptomatic carriers, (b) the proviral DNA of HTLV-I and the gene expression of the virus at the mRNA level was detected in the infiltrating cells from the eyes of the patients, (c) the virus particles were detected by electron-microscopic examination in the T-cell clones established from the intraocular fluid of the patients, and (d) the HTLV-I-infected T cells produced a variety of cytokines without any stimuli, such as interleukin (IL)-1 alpha, IL-2, IL-3, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor alpha, interferon-gamma, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor.

Data on the seroprevalence of HTLV-I in central and eastern Europe are scanty but the few published studies suggest a higher rate than has been documented in western Europe.","['Taylor, G P']",['Taylor GP'],"[""St. Mary's Hospital Medical School, London, England, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr Hum Retrovirol,Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes and human retrovirology : official publication of the International Retrovirology Association,9501482,,IM,"['Adult', 'Blood Donors', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Breast Feeding', 'Europe', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Infections/diagnosis/*epidemiology/immunology', 'HTLV-II Infections/diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Pregnancy', 'Seroepidemiologic Studies', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases/virology', 'Substance Abuse, Intravenous/virology']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00042560-199600001-00003 [doi]'],ppublish,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr Hum Retrovirol. 1996;13 Suppl 1:S8-14. doi: 10.1097/00042560-199600001-00003.,,58,,,,,,,,,,,,

An algorithm for serological screening for HTLV-I and -II infection has been established by consensus. Data from screening almost 4 million subjects, including many unpublished studies, which conform to this algorithm are presented. In extensive studies the seroprevalence of HTL.V-I/II in blood donors is low, ranging from < 1 in 100,000 to 30 in 100,000 donors and is due predominantly to HTLV-I. In antenatal clinics in France and the United Kingdom the seroprevalence of HTLV-I is > 0.2%, but surveillance in this setting has been limited and extensive study of the seroprevalence of HTLV-I/II infection in pregnant women in Europe is urgently required to determine the need for HTLV-I/II antenatal screening. HTLV-I is present in populations who have immigrated to Europe from endemic areas and is spreading into indigenous European populations, particularly through sexual transmission to females.

Allogeneic transplant recipients also have defects in both humoral and cellular immunity and thus are subject to increased risk of serious, often life-threatening, infection even beyond the period of granulocyte recovery. The current study was undertaken to evaluate patients who required operative intervention for perianal sepsis following BMT. METHODS: The bone marrow transplant database at a single institution was used to identify all patients diagnosed with perianal infections after autologous or allogeneic BMT. Charts were reviewed in a retrospective manner. RESULTS: Over a ten-year period ending in November 1993, 963 BMT were performed at the City of Hope National Medical Center. Twenty-four patients were diagnosed with perianal infections following their transplants. Fifteen patients did not have purulent collections requiring drainage and were treated with antibiotics and supportive measures alone. Nine patients (37.5 percent) required surgical intervention between 10 and 380 days following transplantation. At the time of surgical intervention, seven patients had purulent collections and two patients had acute and chronic inflammation, tissue necrosis, and fibrosis. Of the two patients with an absolute neutrophil count less than 1,000, a purulent collection was found in one of the patients. Cultures taken from perianal abscesses were almost all polymicrobial, and the most common organisms were Escherichia coli, Bacteroides, Enterococcus, and Klebsiella. For those patients undergoing surgical intervention, mean time to complete wound closure by secondary intention was 37.6 days; five patients healed in less than 15 days, two patients healed at 93 and 114 days, and two patients had persistent, open wounds at time of death, which was unrelated to their perianal disease. Five patients were receiving systemic steroids at time of surgical intervention; this did not appear to affect time to wound healing. CONCLUSIONS: Perianal infections are a rare complication of BMT. Majority of these infections are polymicrobial, and organisms isolated are similar to those seen in the perianal infections of nonimmunosuppressed patients. Despite steroid use, granulocytopenia does not exclude the possible presence of purulent collections, and clinical examination should guide the decision for surgical drainage. In general, perianal wound healing is not prolonged in BMT patients.","['Cohen, J S', 'Paz, I B', ""O'Donnell, M R"", 'Ellenhorn, J D']","['Cohen JS', 'Paz IB', ""O'Donnell MR"", 'Ellenhorn JD']","['Department of General Oncologic Surgery, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California 91010, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Dis Colon Rectum,Diseases of the colon and rectum,0372764,,IM,"['Abscess/*etiology/*surgery', 'Adult', 'Anus Diseases/*etiology/*surgery', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Cellulitis/*etiology/*surgery', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/surgery', 'Male', '*Postoperative Complications', 'Retrospective Studies']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02054685 [doi]'],ppublish,Dis Colon Rectum. 1996 Sep;39(9):981-5. doi: 10.1007/BF02054685.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, whereas c-Jun activates TRE-controlled promoters, v-Jun represses them. Cotransfection of the two Jun proteins reduces c-Jun-dependent transactivation. The expression of the endogenous c-jun gene, regulated through a promoter-proximal AP-1-binding site, is repressed in v-Jun-transformed chicken embryo fibroblasts. It is suggested that an M(r) 18,000 v-Jun peptide prominent in v-Jun-transformed cells acts as a transdominant-negative regulator of AP-1 activity and of c-jun expression. In contrast to the results with TRE sites, both v-Jun and c-Jun activate transcription through the human T-cell leukemia virus type I 21-bp repeat which contains a sequence homologous to the cyclic AMP responsive element. However, full-length Jun proteins bind to this site only with low affinity, and binding of the truncated v-Jun was barely detectable. These observations show that the oncogenic viral form of Jun differs from the cellular version in promoter preference and on certain promoters acts as an antagonist to c-Jun.","['Gao, M', 'Morgan, I', 'Vogt, P K']","['Gao M', 'Morgan I', 'Vogt PK']","['Department of Molecular and Experimental Medicine, Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Oncogene Protein p65(gag-jun))', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Collagenases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chick Embryo', 'Collagenases/genetics', 'Consensus Sequence', 'DNA Primers', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Genes, jun', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncogene Protein p65(gag-jun)/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection']",1996/09/15 00:00,1996/09/15 00:01,['1996/09/15 00:00'],"['1996/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1996 Sep 15;56(18):4229-35.,['CA 42564/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

After treating TS19-101 cells with HMBA, topoisomerase II (topo II) enzymatic activity was dramatically reduced, and cells became terminally differentiated. The initial reduction in activity was soon followed by reduced topo II alpha phosphorylation, but only later did the protein level drop significantly. PMA, which completely blocked HMBA-induced differentiation in TS19-101 cells, increased the phosphorylation of topo II alpha and restored the enzymatic activity to its original levels. Reduced topo II activity and phosphorylation were also evident in HMBA-treated TR19-9 cells. PMA failed to restore topo II activity and phosphorylation to their original levels in TR19-9 cells. Predictably, the topo II activity and phosphorylation of DS19/R1 cells showed little change in response to HMBA or PMA treatment. Structural changes in chromatin became evident in sensitive cells 24 h after HMBA treatment, suggesting that alterations in topo II alpha phosphorylation may control cell differentiation by altering nuclear architecture.","['Constantinou, A I', 'Vaughan, A T', 'Yamasaki, H', 'Kamath, N']","['Constantinou AI', 'Vaughan AT', 'Yamasaki H', 'Kamath N']","['University of Illinois at Chicago, College of Medicine, Department of Surgical Oncology 60612, USA. andreasc@uic.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Acetamides/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Cell Survival', 'Chromatin/drug effects', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I/metabolism', '*DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Isoenzymes/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*enzymology/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Phosphorylation', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1996/09/15 00:00,1996/09/15 00:01,['1996/09/15 00:00'],"['1996/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1996 Sep 15;56(18):4192-9.,"['CA-55840/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-62184/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we have examined circulating gamma delta lymphocytes that express workshop clusters 1 (WC1) and 2 (WC2).

Likewise, the WC2 cells count is increased (P < 0.01) in BLV+PL+. Furthermore, we have investigated whether BLV infection up-regulates the expression of heat shock proteins (HSP) which in turn could augment the humoral response. Anti-HSP70 activity was examined in the sera of 34 BLV-infected cattle and 40 healthy controls by ELISA.

Class I genes, including regulatory elements, showed no aberrations. The variant, BL3.1, did not differ from the parent cell line in expression of Bovine Leukemia Virus (BLV) or oncogene, c-myc. Transient transfection experiments determined the defect was trans rather than cis, and was due to loss of a trans-activator rather than gain of a trans-suppressor as evidenced by transient heterokaryon fusions. Southwestern blot analysis indicated that two DNA binding proteins associated with the MHC class I promoter were missing in BL3.1 cells. The specific response elements for these proteins in BL3 did not appear to be within the enhancerA region, the major enhancer region of the MHC I promoter.","['Harms, J S', 'Splitter, G A']","['Harms JS', 'Splitter GA']","['Department of Animal Health and Biomedical Sciences, University of Wisconsin-Madison 53706, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Vet Immunol Immunopathol,Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,8002006,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Trans-Activators)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, MHC Class I/*genetics/immunology', 'Genes, myc/immunology', 'Genetic Complementation Test', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Temperature', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics', 'Transfection']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-2427(95)05503-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-2427(95)05503-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Immunol Immunopathol. 1996 May;51(1-2):39-54. doi: 10.1016/0165-2427(95)05503-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The p16 tumour suppressor gene is often inactivated in a wide variety of primary human malignancies, including tumours of ectodermal origin. We have therefore examined the status of the p16 gene in a series of phaeochromocytomas. DESIGN: We studied tumour and constitutive DNA from 26 phaeochromocytoma patients. Twenty-two cases were of sporadic tumours whereas four patients had a hereditary form of the disease. Four tumours were malignant. We performed a semiquantitative multiplex PCR in which the p16 gene was coamplified with an unrelated sequence as an internal control. Standards were constructed by mixing DNA from cell lines with a known p16 status to simulate various degrees of p16 loss. Deletion of the p16 gene was determined by densitometry, measuring the ratio of intensity of the two resulting bands as an indication of the relative abundance of the two templates in the sample. RESULTS: No homozygous deletion of the p16 tumour suppressor gene was found in any of the phaeochromocytoma samples. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that the p16 gene is not deleted in sporadic, hereditary, malignant or benign forms of phaeochromocytomas, and therefore probably does not play a role in the pathogenesis of this tumour. However, because of the small number of malignant cases analysed, we cannot exclude a low frequency of p16 deletions in this subset of tumours.","['Aguiar, R C', 'Dahia, P L', 'Sill, H', 'Toledo, S P', 'Goldman, J M', 'Cross, N C']","['Aguiar RC', 'Dahia PL', 'Sill H', 'Toledo SP', 'Goldman JM', 'Cross NC']","['LRF Centre for Adult Leukaemia, Department of Haematology, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, Hammersmith Hospital, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Endocrinol (Oxf),Clinical endocrinology,0346653,['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adrenal Gland Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Exons', '*Gene Deletion', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Pheochromocytoma/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Endocrinol (Oxf). 1996 Jul;45(1):93-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study the authors analysed the capacity of KU812 to produce the mast cell proteinase tryptase and to synthesize factor(s) mitogenic for fibroblasts. KU812 cells were treated with tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), conditioned medium from the human T-cell line Mo (Mo-CM), or cultured under serum free conditions. After 4 days the cells were analysed for cell growth, differentiation, content of tryptase, and secretion of fibroblast mitogenic activity. Mo-CM and serum starvation increased the expression while TPA treatment down-regulated the expression of Fc epsilon RI-alpha chain. An increase in tryptase content in cell extracts was detected after 4 days of culture in serum-free medium or in the presence of Mo-CM. KU812 conditioned media was found to have a baseline expression of mitogenic activity on normal human foreskin fibroblasts that was increased after serum starvation or after treatment with TPA. Mast cell-derived tryptase has previously been reported to be mitogenic for fibroblasts, but in this study the expression of tryptase did not correlate with the expression of fibroblast mitogenic activity in KU812 cells. Furthermore, affinity-purified lung tryptase did not show any mitogenic activity. Platelet-derived growth factor was also excluded. Although the factor(s) from KU812 cells stimulating fibroblast proliferation have not been identified, our results indicate that basophils may be potential producers of growth factors inducing fibroblast proliferation.","['Forsberg-Nilsson, K', 'Dunder, U', 'Nilsson, K', 'Schwartz, L B', 'Nilsson, G']","['Forsberg-Nilsson K', 'Dunder U', 'Nilsson K', 'Schwartz LB', 'Nilsson G']","['Department of Pathology, University of Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Scand J Immunol,Scandinavian journal of immunology,0323767,"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Mitogens)', '0 (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', '0 (Tpsb2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (chymase 2)', 'EC 3.4.21.39 (Chymases)', 'EC 3.4.21.59 (Tpsab1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.21.59 (Tryptases)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Basophils/cytology/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Chymases', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Fibroblasts/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mitogens/*metabolism', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/*metabolism', 'Serine Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Tryptases', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-3083.1996.d01-311.x [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Immunol. 1996 Sep;44(3):267-72. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-3083.1996.d01-311.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To detect a new transforming gene of CML, we re-investigated the transforming activity of interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-1 and -2 genes in the tumorigenicity assay of NIH3T3 cells transfected with genomic DNA of leukemic cells from 15 patients with CML (12 patients in the chronic phase, one in the blastic phase and two in both phases).

We did not detect integration of the IRF-1 gene in the DNA of any tumors derived from the CML patient samples, and also we detected no expression of human IRF-1 mRNA. Thus, NIH3T3 cells may have been transformed due to integration of the functionally active IRF-2 gene from CML patients in the blastic phase. We surmise that there is a possibility that the IRF-2 gene may be involved in the evolution of the blastic phase of CML.","['Futaki, M', 'Inokuchi, K', 'Hanawa, H', 'Tanosaki, S', 'Dan, K', 'Nomura, T']","['Futaki M', 'Inokuchi K', 'Hanawa H', 'Tanosaki S', 'Dan K', 'Nomura T']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (IRF2 protein, human)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factor-2)', '0 (Irf2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Blast Crisis', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Genes, ras', 'Humans', 'Interferon Regulatory Factor-2', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis', '*Repressor Proteins', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transfection']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0145-2126(96)00013-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(96)00013-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1996 Jul;20(7):601-5. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(96)00013-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A subculture of this line can be maintained in recombinant human c-kit ligand [stem cell factor (SCF)] at 100 ng/ml without requirement for other growth factors. Removal of this subculture from SCF results in rapid loss of viability and decreased proliferation. Cells grown in SCF also can be maintained in GM-CSF but not vice versa. In this work, we have characterized the SCF dependence of this UT-7 subculture. Stem cell factor removal results in apoptosis and a decline in viability which can be restored partially by re-addition of SCF, GM-CSF, or co-culture with adherent marrow stromal cells. Apoptosis in the factor-starved UT-7 population has been documented by light microscopy, electron microscopy and DNA analysis, showing the typical 180 base pair laddering characteristic of apoptosis. To quantitate the degree of apoptosis in the cell populations, and to assess whether apoptosis decreased with re-exposure of starved cells to growth factors or stroma, we utilized flow cytometry. This confirmed that exposure of previously factor-starved cells to stroma decreased the percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis. Co-culture with an SCF-deficient murine stromal cell line was also able to prevent apoptosis, suggesting contribution of other stromal cell factors. Experiments performed using trans-well inserts which do not allow cell passage, showed greatest viability of cells in contact with stroma, but viability was also improved in cells cultured in the presence of, but not in contact with, stromal cells compared to those cultured above plastic, suggesting a role for soluble stroma-produced substances. These data demonstrate that SCF alone can prevent apoptosis in cells dependent upon its presence for proliferation. Also, marrow stromal cells can serve as a partial substitute for growth factor in the prevention of apoptosis in these cells, probably due to constitutive presentation of SCF and other hematopoietic growth factors in both soluble and surface-bound forms.","['Liesveld, J L', 'Harbol, A W', 'Abboud, C N']","['Liesveld JL', 'Harbol AW', 'Abboud CN']","['Department of Medicine, University of Rochester School of Medicine, NY 14642, USA.

Intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of NB4 leukemia cells resulted in aggressive growth of leukemia cells in the peritoneal cavity of irradiated SCID/CB-17 mice. Flow cytometric analysis of human CD15, 33 and 45 expression, as well as cytologic examination, revealed that leukemia cells disseminated into the peripheral blood and multiple tissues of the mice. The approximately linear relationship between the injected leukemia cells and the subsequent leukemia cell proliferation provided a reliable model for monitoring the therapeutic effects of immunotherapy. Intraperitoneal injection of the mAb PM-81 markedly suppressed leukemia cell growth in this SCID/leukemia model. Most of the untreated mice died within 35-50 days of leukemia cell inoculation. Four weeks after inoculation of NB4 cells, five of nine mAb PM-81 treated mice had no solid tumor growth and six of nine had no detectable peritoneal exudate leukemia cells as determined by flow cytometry. In contrast, 100% of the mice in the untreated or control mAb groups were found to have both solid and peritoneal leukemia growth. In further experiments designed to evaluate the effects of therapy on survival, 50% (4/8) of PM-81 treated mice survived to 150 days, and had no detectable solid or suspension leukemia cells detectable at necropsy. In contrast, the median survival of untreated or negative control antibody-treated mice was 40 days (comparison to PM-81 treated; p = 0.006 and p = 0.03, respectively). The mechanism of leukemia cell suppression is not likely due to complement fixation since we could not demonstrate in vitro any cytotoxicity mediated by SCID mouse plasma. Further study is required to understand the mechanism of the antileukemia effect of PM-81 in this model.","['Zhong, R K', 'Donnenberg, A D', 'Shultz, L D', 'Swerdlow, S H', 'Lee, E', 'Rubin, J', 'Kozii, R', 'Chen, J', 'Griffin, D L', 'Wilson, J', 'Ball, E D']","['Zhong RK', 'Donnenberg AD', 'Shultz LD', 'Swerdlow SH', 'Lee E', 'Rubin J', 'Kozii R', 'Chen J', 'Griffin DL', 'Wilson J', 'Ball ED']","['Department of Medicine, Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, University of Pittsburgh, PA 15213, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Lewis X Antigen)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Cell Division', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Complement System Proteins/immunology', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/*therapeutic use', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/analysis', 'Lewis X Antigen/analysis', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0145-2126(96)00004-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(96)00004-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1996 Jul;20(7):581-9. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(96)00004-5.,"['CA20408/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31888/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R0354856/PHS HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The onset age ranged from 44 to 75 years (median 67 years). Bone marrow (BM) cellularity ranged from 12.4 to 39.8% (mean 29.8%) in HL, being significantly lower than in MDS (mean 80.7%) or AML (mean 86.4%) (P < 0.001). All reviewed cases characteristically showed smoldering clinical course, bi- or pancytopenia with rare leukemic blasts in the peripheral blood (PB), proliferation of type I leukemic blasts in the BM and markedly reduced background hematopoietic cells with some dysplastic changes in 12/32 cases (37.50/6). Blast percentage (blast %) in the BM ranged from 38.2 to 93.7% (mean 57.3%) in all nucleated cells (ANC). Although a considerable number of cases had blasts with negative or very low myeloperoxidase activity, immunophenotyping revealed that the leukemic blasts in HL had only myeloid markers. Karyotyping revealed non-random chromosome abnormalities in 30% of cases analyzed, which were considerably different from those seen in MDS. With LDAC regimen, a significantly higher CR rate (13/20 cases: 65.0%) was gained in HL than in RAEB/RAEB-t (0%) and overt AML in the elderly cases (27.3%) (P < 0.05). In CR, most cases showed recovery to normocellular BM with an apparent normalization of PB parameters. However, 12 CR cases relapsed 4-12 months later; most of which again showed hypocellular BM. These results indicate that HL is a distinct subtype of AML characterized by slow but distinct proliferation of immature myeloid blasts and by unique hematological features distinct from MDS or overt AML in the elderly. We propose the following diagnostic criteria: (1) pancytopenia with rare appearance of blasts in PB; (2) less than 40% BM hypocellularity; (3) more than 30% blasts in BM-ANC; and (4) myeloid phenotypes of leukemic blasts by MPO staining and/or immunophenotyping.","['Nagai, K', 'Kohno, T', 'Chen, Y X', 'Tsushima, H', 'Mori, H', 'Nakamura, H', 'Jinnai, I', 'Matsuo, T', 'Kuriyama, K', 'Tomonaga, M', 'Bennett, J M']","['Nagai K', 'Kohno T', 'Chen YX', 'Tsushima H', 'Mori H', 'Nakamura H', 'Jinnai I', 'Matsuo T', 'Kuriyama K', 'Tomonaga M', 'Bennett JM']","['Department of Hematology, Atomic Disease Institute, Nagasaki University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blast Crisis', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', '*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosome Disorders', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/classification/genetics/*immunology/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Retrospective Studies']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0145-2126(95)00136-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(95)00136-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1996 Jul;20(7):563-74. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(95)00136-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To maximize cure and remission rates at an acceptable cost in toxicity, many schedules and combinations of dose-intensive chemotherapy have been tested in recent years in patients with de novo disease, cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) being the most extensively evaluated drug. In this article we review the principal results of both randomized and non-controlled studies. Our analysis indicates that high-dose Ara-C (HIDAC) used during induction results is no substantial benefit relative to conventional doses of drug. On the other hand, consolidation with HIDAC is a major advance in the treatment of this disease. In fact, in individuals less than 60 years of age and a favorable or intermediate-risk karyotype, HIDAC-based regimens have resulted in survival estimates comparable to those of autologous or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Yet, the role of HIDAC is irrelevant in younger individuals with an unfavorable cytogenetic pattern and detrimental in patients greater than 60 years of age. Since recently new cytotoxic agents have expanded the armamentarium of antileukemic drugs, well conducted randomized trials of dose intensive chemotherapy still need to be performed to optimize schedules and combinations of drugs in patients with AML.","['Stasi, R', 'Venditti, A', 'Del Poeta, G', 'Aronica, G', 'Abruzzese, E', 'Pisani, F', 'Cecconi, M', 'Masi, M', 'Amadori, S']","['Stasi R', 'Venditti A', 'Del Poeta G', 'Aronica G', 'Abruzzese E', 'Pisani F', 'Cecconi M', 'Masi M', 'Amadori S']","['Chair of Hematology, University of Rome Tor Vergata, S.

Cytotoxicity experiments of lamellarins were performed on a panel of tumour cell lines, including two multidrug-resistant cell lines. Some lamellarins showed good anti-tumour activity, with similar levels of cytotoxicity against both the resistant and their corresponding parental cell lines. Two lamellarins displayed a high potency against lung carcinoma cells. Studies of the resistance modifier activity of the different lamellarins at non-toxic concentrations were also carried out in cells exhibiting MDR, and lamellarin I was selected for the highest chemosensitising activity. At non-toxic doses, verapamil and lamellarin I effectively increased the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin, vinblastine and daunorubicin in a concentration-dependent manner in multidrug-resistant cells, but the potency of lamellarin I as a MDR modulator was 9- to 16-fold higher than that of verapamil. In vitro measurements of rhodamine 123 accumulation in the multidrug-resistant Lo Vo/Dx cells suggest that lamellarin I reverses MDR by directly inhibiting the P-gp-mediated drug efflux.

Antifolates (4A-S) were effectively prepared by coupling pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine carboxylic acids (11a, b) with some properly protected N5-substituted glutamine derivatives (10A-S), which were prepared by coupling Boc-Glu-OMe (7) with various amines (8A-S) using a suitable condensing reagent, followed by hydrolysis. The inhibitory effects of the resulting products on dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), thymidylate synthetase (TS) and the growth of murine fibrosarcoma Meth A cells in culture were examined. All N5-substituted glutamine analogs (4A-S) inhibited DHFR much more strongly than TNP-351 and some analogs exhibited the same potent growth inhibition of Meth A cells as TNP-351. Some typical analogs (4Bb, 4Db, 4F, 4Oa) were also examined for inhibitory effects on the growth of methotrexate (MTX)-resistant human CCRF-CEM cells in culture and for in vivo antitumor activities against murine leukemia and solid tumors. MTX-resistant cells, with a defect in transport and decreased polyglutamylation activity, showed little cross resistance to the analog (4Oa) having a tetrazole moiety as a substituent of glutamine, which exhibited potent antitumor activities. These results demonstrate that the antifolate analogs (4) with N5-substituted glutamine in place of glutamic acid are novel potent DHFR inhibitors with activity against MTX-resistant tumors. The potent antitumor activity of these analogs (4) may result from their effective uptake via reduced folate carrier in combination with their potent inhibition of DHFR.","['Itoh, F', 'Yoshioka, Y', 'Yukishige, K', 'Yoshida, S', 'Wajima, M', 'Ootsu, K', 'Akimoto, H']","['Itoh F', 'Yoshioka Y', 'Yukishige K', 'Yoshida S', 'Wajima M', 'Ootsu K', 'Akimoto H']","['Pharmaceutical Research Laboratories III, Takeda Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Chem Pharm Bull (Tokyo),Chemical & pharmaceutical bulletin,0377775,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Drug Resistance', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Methotrexate/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Pyrimidines/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Thymidylate Synthase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1248/cpb.44.1498 [doi]'],ppublish,Chem Pharm Bull (Tokyo). 1996 Aug;44(8):1498-509. doi: 10.1248/cpb.44.1498.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We recently reported HLA-G transcription in peripheral blood leukocytes. In this work, we have investigated HLA-G transcription in hematopoietic stem cells, in different hematopoietic lineages and in malignant cells by using a RT-PCR technique. PCR amplification with primers specific to the exon 2 and the 3' untranslated region has enabled to detect HLA-G transcription in B and T cell populations. No transcription was found in CD34+ cells, in thymocytes, in polynuclear cells, in monocytes and in natural killer cells. Among the malignancies analyzed, HLA-G is transcribed in 2 of 13 cases of acute leukemia characterized by a monocytic contingent, in 3 of 6 CLL and in all the cases of B-NHL (n = 6). No HLA-G transcription was detected in myeloma (n = 2). The splicing type does not seem to be linked to a lymphocyte subpopulation nor to a malignant proliferation stage. These results suggest that HLA-G is a marker of mature lymphoid cells and may play an immunological function as a peptide presenting molecule. HLA-G transcription in some cases of malignancy might indicate a contribution to the tumoral progression by blocking natural killing reaction.","['Amiot, L', 'Onno, M', 'Renard, I', 'Drenou, B', 'Guillaudeux, T', 'Le Bouteiller, P', 'Fauchet, R']","['Amiot L', 'Onno M', 'Renard I', 'Drenou B', 'Guillaudeux T', 'Le Bouteiller P', 'Fauchet R']","[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie et de la biologie des cellules sanguines, Universite de Rennes I, France.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Tissue Antigens,Tissue antigens,0331072,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (HLA-G Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HLA Antigens/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'HLA-G Antigens', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/genetics/*immunology', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/classification/*immunology/metabolism', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology/metabolism', 'Macrophages/immunology/metabolism', 'Monocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*immunology/metabolism', 'Organ Specificity', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology/metabolism', 'Thymoma/genetics/immunology', 'Thymus Neoplasms/genetics/immunology', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1399-0039.1996.tb02576.x [doi]'],ppublish,Tissue Antigens. 1996 May;47(5):408-13. doi: 10.1111/j.1399-0039.1996.tb02576.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Tissue Antigens. 1996 Nov;48(5):609-14.

HL60 cells were treated with either phenol, catechol, hydroquinone, or 1,2,4-benzenetriol and then stained with Hoechst 33342 and propidium iodide and subjected to fluorescent microscopy. Cells with nuclear condensation and fragmentation were scored as apoptotic, and etoposide (40 microM) was used as a positive control. Catechol, 1,2,4-benzenetriol, and hydroquinone induced marked time- (0-24 hr) and concentration- (25-100 microM) dependent apoptosis, whereas phenol (750 microM) did not. Under these conditions, no significant necrosis was observed. The induction of apoptosis was confirmed by internucleosomal cleavage of DNA, assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis. CD34+ cells treated with etoposide (40 microM) or hydroquinone (50 microM) for 18 hr were stained and subjected to fluorescent microscopy as above. The percentage of cells exhibiting nuclear condensation and/or fragmentation as well as high intensity staining significantly increased in both cases. The induction of apoptosis was confirmed using a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase assay.

CsA and FK506 associate with intracellular binding proteins (i.e., CsA with cyclophilin A and FK506 with FKBP12) to form protein/drug complexes that suppress the immune system by preventing activation of T cells in response to antigen presentation. The common target of CsA and FK506 is calcineurin, a Ca2+/calmodulin-regulated, serine/threonine-specific protein phosphatase that regulates the nuclear import of a transcription factor, NF-AT, required for expression of T cell activation genes. In previous studies, we identified calcineurin mutations that block binding by the cyclophilin A/CsA or FKBP12/FK506 complexes and thereby render yeast cells resistant to the antifungal effects of CsA or FK506. In this report, we demonstrate that the corresponding mutations in murine calcineurin render the T cell receptor signal transduction cascade CsA resistant in human Jurkat T cells. Our findings support the recently determined calcineurin X-ray crystal structure, provide evidence that calcineurin is the only CsA-sensitive component limiting signaling from the T cell receptor to the nucleus, and suggest a means to render cells and tissues resistant to the toxic side effects of CsA and FK506.","['Zhu, D', 'Cardenas, M E', 'Heitman, J']","['Zhu D', 'Cardenas ME', 'Heitman J']","['Department of Genetics, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Antigens, Viral, Tumor)', '0 (Calmodulin-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (NFATC Transcription Factors)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Calcineurin)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Viral, Tumor/biosynthesis', 'Base Sequence', 'Calcineurin', 'Calmodulin-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/chemistry/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Cyclosporine/*pharmacology', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance/physiology', 'Fungi/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'NFATC Transcription Factors', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/biosynthesis/chemistry/metabolism/*physiology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simian virus 40/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 1996 Sep;50(3):506-11.,['P01-HL50985-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutant induction showed a curvilinear dose-response for acute irradiation (30 Gy/h). The total mutant frequency was lower after irradiation at 0.17 or 0.006 Gy/h compared with acute irradiation. An apparent linear relationship between total dose and mutant frequency was found for the chronic irradiations. Spontaneous mutant frequency increased linearly with the exposure time of protracted irradiation at 0.006 Gy/h. After the spontaneous mutant frequency was subtracted from the total mutant frequency for irradiation at 0.006 Gy/h, no significant difference was found in the mutant frequency as a function of dose between the cultures irradiated at 0.17 Gy/h and those at 0.006 Gy/h. The inverse dose-rate effect, which has been observed in proliferating mouse L5178Y leukemia cells was not evident in WIL2-NS cells at the dose-rates employed. Structural alterations at the HPRT locus in TGr mutants were examined with the multiplex PCR method and compared among cultures irradiated at different dose-rates. Assuming that the mutants isolated were primarily independent, approximately 17% of spontaneous mutants were deletion mutants. When the fraction of spontaneous mutants in the irradiated cultures was subtracted from the total fraction of each type of mutant, it is clear that low dose-rate gamma-rays induced deletion mutations at the HPRT locus just as efficiently (79%) as high dose-rate gamma-rays (74%).","['Furuno-Fukushi, I', 'Tatsumi, K', 'Takahagi, M', 'Tachibana, A']","['Furuno-Fukushi I', 'Tatsumi K', 'Takahagi M', 'Tachibana A']","['Division of Biology, National Institute of Radiological Sciences, Chiba, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J Radiat Biol,International journal of radiation biology,8809243,['EC 2.4.2.8 (Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Survival/radiation effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Gamma Rays', 'Humans', 'Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/095530096145201 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Radiat Biol. 1996 Aug;70(2):209-17. doi: 10.1080/095530096145201.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, COMARF, recognizing the uncertainties involved in the dose and risk calculations, recommended that levels of radioactivity should be measured in the general population living near the plant. Alpha-emitting contamination has been measured by urinary 239Pu analysis and 241Am in-vivo skull measurements in 66 subjects associated with the Dounreay area and in 42 subjects living remote from reprocessing plants. Whole-body counting was employed to check for gamma ray-emitting contamination. Urinary 90Sr and chromosome abnormality analyses were also carried out on subsets of the study group. No significant inter-group differences for measurements of contamination were demonstrated for groups of leukaemia cases, siblings, parents, matched local controls and controls living remote from reprocessing plants.

Current retroviral pseudotyping systems using the HTLV-1 envelope generate titers of less than 200 infectious particles per ml. We describe here an improved system for pseudotyping using a defective human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 genome in combination with HTLV-1 env in 293T producer cells. Introduction of additional copies of rev and treatment of cells with sodium butyrate resulted in a cell-associated titer of 10(5)/ml and cell-free titers of greater than 10(4)/ml . By using this system, we found that the host range of HTLV-1 is even greater than previously suspected. Earlier studies which assigned a chromosomal location for the HTLV-1 receptor may therefore reflect cell-to-cell variation in receptor number rather than the absolute presence or absence of a receptor. The generation of higher-titer HIV(HTLV-1) may facilitate identification of the cellular receptor and investigations of the pathophysiology of HTLV-1 infection.","['Sutton, R E', 'Littman, D R']","['Sutton RE', 'Littman DR']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Stanford University, California 94305, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,,IM,"['Cell Line', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Methods']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.70.10.7322-7326.1996 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1996 Oct;70(10):7322-6. doi: 10.1128/JVI.70.10.7322-7326.1996.,"['AI33856/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI36898/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,PMC190797,,,,,,,

Kato, T. Nakazawa, T. Mizutani, and K. Shimotohno, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 206:863-869, 1995). In order to develop a culture system in which HCV replicates more efficiently, we examined the efficiency of HCV replication in cloned MT-2 cell lines by the limiting dilution method. Consequently, we obtained five clones in which intracellular positive-stranded HCV RNA could be detected until at least 21 days postinoculation (p.i.), as opposed to 15 days p.i. in uncloned MT-2 cells. MT-2C, one of the five clones which supported HCV replication up to 30 days p.i., was used for further characterization of HCV replication. Semiquantitative analysis of HCV by PCR revealed that RNA synthesis in infected cells increased after inoculation, reached a maximum level at 4 days p.i., and maintained this level until at least 11 days p.i. The 5' untranslated region of negative-stranded HCV RNA was also detected in the infected cells by two different methods with strand specificity. These results suggest that HCV replicated and multiplied in the MT-2C cells. HCV-infected MT-2C cells that were treated with antibiotics, such as G418 and hygromycin B, sustained HCV RNA for a longer period than did untreated cells. We demonstrated inhibitory effects on HCV replication by an antisense oligonucleotide complementary to the HCV core encoding region and by interferon-alpha. Furthermore, cell-free viral transmission was demonstrated by this culture system. These results suggest that our cell culture system will be useful for studying the mechanism of HCV replication, for screening antiviral agents, and for developing HCV vaccines.","['Mizutani, T', 'Kato, N', 'Saito, S', 'Ikeda, M', 'Sugiyama, K', 'Shimotohno, K']","['Mizutani T', 'Kato N', 'Saito S', 'Ikeda M', 'Sugiyama K', 'Shimotohno K']","['Virology Division, National Cancer Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Viral Core Proteins)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Transformed', 'HTLV-I Infections/*virology', 'Hepacivirus/*physiology', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/genetics/pharmacology', 'Viral Core Proteins/genetics', '*Virus Replication/drug effects']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.70.10.7219-7223.1996 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1996 Oct;70(10):7219-23. doi: 10.1128/JVI.70.10.7219-7223.1996.,,,,,,,PMC190776,,,,,,,

In the present studies, we have systematically evaluated the function of chimeric retinoid receptors generated by fusion with the transactivation domain of VP16 and expression in adenovirus vectors. By varying the location of fusion of the VP16 transactivation domain with the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) or retinoid X receptor (RXR), marked differences in the specificity of gene activation were obtained. Although several chimeric proteins activated both RAR and RXR target genes, fusion of the NT16 transactivation domain to the N terminus of RAR permitted specific activation of reporter genes containing retinoic acid response elements. In contrast, fusion of the VP16 transactivation domain to the C terminus of RXR permitted specific activation of reporter genes containing RXR response elements. When tested for their ability to activate chromosomal targets, the chimera consisting of VP16 linked to the N terminus of PAR was much more active in promoting the differentiation of HL-60 cells and NTera-2 cells than the chimera consisting of VP16 linked to the C terminus of RXR. These observations support the existence of two distinct retinoid signalling pathways predicted on the basis of biochemical and pharmacologic studies and provide direct evidence that the programs of differentiation elicited by retinoic acid in these cells are mediated by a specific subset of binding sites for RAR-RXR heterodimers. VP16-RAR and VP16-RXR fusion proteins should be of further use in dissecting the relative contributions of RARs and RXRs to specific programs of gene expression. Constitutive retinoid receptors may also be considered for use as novel tumor suppressor genes for genetically based treatment of retinoid-responsive cancers.","['Lipkin, S M', 'Grider, T L', 'Heyman, R A', 'Glass, C K', 'Gage, F H']","['Lipkin SM', 'Grider TL', 'Heyman RA', 'Glass CK', 'Gage FH']","['Laboratory of Genetics, The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, California 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/*genetics', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Chromosomes', '*Gene Targeting', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/metabolism/pathology/therapy', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Teratocarcinoma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology/therapy']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.70.10.7182-7189.1996 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1996 Oct;70(10):7182-9. doi: 10.1128/JVI.70.10.7182-7189.1996.,,,,,,,PMC190771,,,,,,,

Guo, W. Wu, Z. Y. Yuan, K. Post, R. J. Crouch, and J. G . Levin, Biochemistry 34:5018-5029, 1995). We now report that pausing at this site is due to a stem-loop structure in the RNA template, formed by interaction of a number of bases in the polypurine tract, including the six G's, and a 3' sequence which includes four C's. Addition of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) nucleocapsid (NC) protein to reverse transcriptase reactions reduces pausing by approximately 8- to 10-fold and stimulates synthesis of full-length DNA. Thus, NC functions as an accessory protein during elongation of minus-strand DNA and increases the efficiency of DNA synthesis, in this case, by apparently destabilizing a region of secondary structure in the template. Since NC is associated with genomic RNA in the viral core and is likely to be part of a viral replication complex, these results suggest that NC may also promote efficient DNA synthesis during virus replication. Mutational analysis indicates that the features of HIV-1 NC which are important for reduction of pausing include the basic amino acids flanking the first zinc finger, the zinc fingers, and the cysteine and aromatic amino acids within the fingers. These findings suggest that reverse transcription might be targeted by drugs which inactivate the zinc fingers of HIV-1 NC.","['Wu, W', 'Henderson, L E', 'Copeland, T D', 'Gorelick, R J', 'Bosche, W J', 'Rein, A', 'Levin, J G']","['Wu W', 'Henderson LE', 'Copeland TD', 'Gorelick RJ', 'Bosche WJ', 'Rein A', 'Levin JG']","['Laboratory of Molecular Genetics, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,['EC 2.7.7.49 (HIV Reverse Transcriptase)'],IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Capsid/*metabolism', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'HIV Reverse Transcriptase/*metabolism', 'HIV-1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Sequence Analysis']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.70.10.7132-7142.1996 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1996 Oct;70(10):7132-42. doi: 10.1128/JVI.70.10.7132-7142.1996.,,,,,,,PMC190766,,,,,,,

MMMol, a Japanese feral mouse cell line, is an exception in that these cells are susceptible to infection by GALV. We show here that MMMol cells are further distinguished by their unusual receptor properties. MMMol cells infected by GALV are resistant to subsequent infection not only by GALV but also by amphotropic murine leukemia virus. This suggests that GALV can enter MMMol via not only the GALV receptor (MolPit1) but also the amphotropic murine leukemia virus receptor (MolPit2). Therefore, MolPit2 was cloned, sequenced, and compared with the previously reported sequence of MolPit1. Earlier studies have shown that a stretch of nine residues (position 550 to 558) in the fourth extracellular domain of Pit1 is crucial for GALV entry and that an acidic residue at position 550 is indispensable. However, MolPit1 has isoleucine at this position and MolPit2 has glutamine at the corresponding position (position 522), thus breaking this consensus. To determine what effect these specific changes in the fourth extracellular domain of MolPit1 and MolPit2 have on GALV receptor function, chimeric receptors were made by substituting the fourth extracellular domain of either MolPit1 or MolPit2 for the same region of Pit2, a nonfunctional receptor for GALV. These chimeras were then tested in MDTF, a cell line that lacks functional GALV receptors and is resistant to GALV. Results show that MDTF expressing these chimeras became susceptible to GALV, whereas cells expressing wild-type Pit2 remained resistant. Further, the MolPit1 chimera was identical to Pit1 in efficiency, but the MolPit2 chimera proved substantially less efficient.","['Schneiderman, R D', 'Farrell, K B', 'Wilson, C A', 'Eiden, M V']","['Schneiderman RD', 'Farrell KB', 'Wilson CA', 'Eiden MV']","['Laboratory of Cell Biology, National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-4068, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Hylobates', 'Leukemia Virus, Gibbon Ape/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Receptors, Virus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.70.10.6982-6986.1996 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1996 Oct;70(10):6982-6. doi: 10.1128/JVI.70.10.6982-6986.1996.,,,,,,,PMC190748,,,,,,,

Like other retroviruses, ecotropic MuLV infection eliminates virus-binding sites from cell surfaces and results in complete interference to superinfection. Surprisingly, infection causes only partial (ca 40 to 60%) loss of mouse CAT-1 transporter activity. The NIH/Swiss mouse CAT-1 (mCAT-1) contains 622 amino acids with 14 hydrophobic potential membrane-spanning sequences, and it is known that the third extracellular loop from the amino terminus is required for virus binding. Although loop 3 is hypervariable in different species and mouse strains, consistent with its proposed role in virus-host coevolution, loop 3 sequences of both susceptible and resistant species contain consensus sites for N-linked glycosylation. Both of the consensus sites in loop 3 of mCAT-1 are known to be glycosylated and to contain oligosaccharides with diverse sizes (J. W. Kim and J. M. Cunningham, J. Biol. Chem. 268:16316-16320, 1993). We confirmed by several lines of evidence that N-linked glycosylation occludes a potentially functional virus-binding site in the CAT-1 protein of hamsters, thus contributing to resistance of that species. To study the role of receptor glycosylation in animals susceptible to infection, we eliminated loop 3 glycosylation sites by mutagenesis of an mCAT-1 cDNA clone, and we expressed wild-type and mutant receptors in mink fibroblasts and Xenopus oocytes. These receptors had indistinguishable transport properties, as determined by kinetic and voltage-jump electrophysiological studies of arginine uptake in oocytes and by analyses Of L-[3H]arginine uptake in mink cells. Bindings of ecotropic envelope glycoprotein gp7O to the accessible receptor sites on surfaces of mink cells expressing wild-type or mutant mCAT-1 were not significantly different in kinetics or in equilibrium affinities (i.e., K(D) approximately 3.7 X 10(-10) to 7.5 X 10(-10) M). However, when values were normalized to the same levels of mCAT-1 transporter expression, cells with wild-type glycosylated mCAT-1 had only approximately 50% as many sites for gp70 binding as cells with unglycosylated mCAT-1. Although infection with ecotropic MuLV had no effect on activity of the mink CAT-1 transporter that does not bind virus, it caused partial down-modulation of wild-type mCAT-1 and complete down-modulation of unglycosylated mutant mCAT-1.

Three patients in this series also received human recombinant cytokines, but developed eruptions with the typical scant infiltrate of small lymphocytes.

The multifactorial support of motoneurons represents a system of high security, because the inactivation of individual ligands has either no detectable, or relatively small, atrophic or degenerative effect on motoneurons. RESULTS: Leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) has been demonstrated to support motoneuron survival in vitro and in vivo under different experimental conditions. However, when LIF was inactivated by gene targeting, there were no apparent changes in the number and structure of motoneurons and no impairment of their function. The slowly appearing, relatively mild degenerating effects in motoneurons that resulted from ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) gene targeting were substantially potentiated by simultaneous inactivation of the LIF gene, however. Thus, in mice deficient in LIF and CNTF, the degenerative changes in motoneurons were more extensive and appeared earlier. These changes were also functionally reflected by a marked reduction in grip strength. CONCLUSIONS: Degenerative disorders of the nervous system, in particular those of motoneurons, may be based on multifactorial inherited and/or acquired defects which individually do not result in degenerative disorders, but which become apparent when additional (cryptic) inherited disturbances or sub-threshold concentrations of noxious factors come into play. Accordingly, the inherited inactivation of the CNTF gene in a high proportion of the Japanese population may represent a predisposing factor for degenerative disorders of motoneurons.","['Sendtner, M', 'Gotz, R', 'Holtmann, B', 'Escary, J L', 'Masu, Y', 'Carroll, P', 'Wolf, E', 'Brem, G', 'Brulet, P', 'Thoenen, H']","['Sendtner M', 'Gotz R', 'Holtmann B', 'Escary JL', 'Masu Y', 'Carroll P', 'Wolf E', 'Brem G', 'Brulet P', 'Thoenen H']","['Department of Neurology, University of Wurzburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Curr Biol,Current biology : CB,9107782,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Facial Nerve/metabolism', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Growth Inhibitors/*genetics', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Motor Neurons/*physiology', 'Nerve Growth Factors/*genetics', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Sciatic Nerve/metabolism']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0960-9822(09)00450-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s0960-9822(09)00450-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Biol. 1996 Jun 1;6(6):686-94. doi: 10.1016/s0960-9822(09)00450-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As with other genetic toxicology test systems, one criterion for a positive response has been the requirement of at least a 2-fold increase in mutant frequency (MF) as compared to the respective MF of the solvent controls. More recently, an actual specific increase in MF has been proposed as a criterion for determining a positive response in the MLA; however, this may not be appropriate for laboratories with a low, yet stable, background MF. The twofold rule criterion was evaluated in our laboratory with 66 compounds. The mutagenic status of these compounds was previously determined in other test systems and at one or more laboratories, including Lilly Research Laboratories. The results of this evaluation demonstrate that the twofold rule is an effective method for identifying mutagenic agents in the MLA at LRL where a lower, yet acceptable, background mutation frequency is the norm. A small number of compounds (6) yielded results discordant with the literature; however, these compounds have been previously found to be either difficult to detect in genotoxic assays or to show specific sensitivity in the MLA.","['Oberly, T J', 'Hoffman, W P', 'Garriott, M L']","['Oberly TJ', 'Hoffman WP', 'Garriott ML']","['Toxicology Research Laboratories, Lilly Research Laboratories, A Division of Eli Lilly and Company, Greenfield, IN 46140, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,['0 (Mutagens)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Guidelines as Topic', 'Leukemia L5178/*genetics', 'Mice', '*Mutagenicity Tests', 'Mutagens/toxicity', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/08/12 00:00,1996/08/12 00:01,['1996/08/12 00:00'],"['1996/08/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/12 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/12 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0165-1218(96)90027-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-1218(96)90027-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 1996 Aug 12;369(3-4):221-32. doi: 10.1016/s0165-1218(96)90027-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Parallel to the humanitarian need to mitigate health effects from these exposures, the unique opportunities for research on radiation risks related to low dose rate and chronic radiation have to be explored. Increased efforts by the global radiation research community are needed to address the many questions which cannot be answered by the acutely irradiated survivors of Hiroshima/Nagasaki. Specific attention needs to be drawn to the validation of available exposure and health records and to dose reconstruction which must include dietary sources of exposure.

Immunophenotyping is essential for diagnosing and subclassifying acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and is also very helpful in certain types of acute myeloid leukemias (AML), such as AML with minimal differentiation or acute megakaryoblastic leukemia. Cytogenetic findings are clinically relevant for diagnosis and prognosis. Nonrandom chromosomal abnormalities such as t(15;17)(q22;q12) or t(1;19)(q23;p13) have been so closely associated with distinct types of acute leukemias that their recognition can allow diagnosis independent of the other criteria. Molecular analysis is a powerful method in the assessment of the malignant potential, clonality, and classification of the ALs. It has become clear that in some leukemias a proportion of patients exhibit the biologically relevant molecular defect in the absence of a karyotypic equivalent. On the other hand apparently uniform chromosomal abnormalities such as the t(1;19), t(9;22), t(8;14), or t(15;17) may differ at the molecular level. In vitro assays can evaluate the growth pattern and cell-cycle kinetics of leukemic cells, as well as their sensitivity to therapeutic agents. All these data are relevant to the management of AL.

Despite extensive examination of its activities in vitro and anti-tumor effects in vivo, previous studies have failed to document that bryostatin 1 modulates total cellular PKC activity in tumor or normal tissues when administered in vivo. After a single bolus injection of bryostatin 1 (1.0 microgram) in normal C57BI/6 mice, blood was drawn at various intervals and assayed for bryostatin 1 levels. In addition, spleens from bryostatin-treated mice were harvested 10 min to 10 days after treatment, weighed and analyzed for cell numbers, PKC activity and cell surface phenotypes. Bryostatin 1 levels in plasma rose rapidly, reaching peak levels of 56.5 nM less than 1 min after injection, and then declined to undetectable levels by 1 h. A similar pattern was observed when bryostatin 1 was incubated with leukemia cells in vitro, raising the possibility that the rapid fall in plasma levels results from intracellular uptake and binding. Bryostatin 1 induced marked depletion of total splenocyte PKC activity (as much as 69% relative to control values) at 24-96 h after drug administration, but not at earlier times (i.e. 1 h). A single injection of bryostatin 1 also induced expression of the T cell activation marker CD69, leading to positivity in 53% of cells at 3-24 h versus 11% in control mice, and resulted in marked splenomegaly, associated with increased numbers of nucleated cells at 48-96 h. Together, these studies demonstrate that despite rapid disappearance of the drug from plasma, a single i.v. dose of bryostatin 1 exhibits significant and sustained effects on normal murine spleen cells, including early lymphocyte activation, prolonged depletion of PKC activity, splenocyte proliferation and splenomegaly. These findings may have implications for attempts to understand the in vivo effects of bryostatin 1 in normal host tissues.","['Bear, H D', 'McFadden, A W', 'Kostuchenko, P J', 'Lipshy, K A', 'Hamad, G G', 'Turner, A J', 'Roberts, J D', 'Carr, M', 'Carr, S', 'Grant, S']","['Bear HD', 'McFadden AW', 'Kostuchenko PJ', 'Lipshy KA', 'Hamad GG', 'Turner AJ', 'Roberts JD', 'Carr M', 'Carr S', 'Grant S']","['Massey Cancer Center, Medical College of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (CD69 antigen)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (Macrolides)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/biosynthesis', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Bryostatins', 'Cell Division', 'HL-60 Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lactones/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Lectins, C-Type', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Macrolides', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Protein Kinase C/*analysis', 'Spleen/cytology/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Time Factors']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00001813-199605000-00010 [doi]'],ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 1996 May;7(3):299-306. doi: 10.1097/00001813-199605000-00010.,"['CA48075/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

This agent was also found to down regulate the expression of the c-myc oncogene in L1210 leukemia cells. To investigate the possibility that damage within select genomic regions may contribute to the antiproliferative activity of pMC540, differential damage in regions surrounding the c-myc locus as well as other select genes was determined. Southern blot hybridization experiments show that pMC540 treatment induces in situ DNA cleavage products in the 5' end of the c-myc oncogene of L1210 leukemia cells. In cells pre-treated with 50 microM ethidium bromide, an inhibitor of the Topo II-dependent DNA cleavage, a subsequent treatment with pMC540 failed to induce DNA cleavage, suggesting that the cleavage activity of pMC540 was Topo II dependent. pMC540-induced cleavage does not appear to correlate with the over-expression of the c-myc oncogene in these cells as another over-expressed gene c-myb was not affected. Thus, it is proposed that the c-myc gene may be a preferred target for pMC540 may mediated antiproliferative activity.","['Sharma, R', 'Gulliya, K S']","['Sharma R', 'Gulliya KS']","['Baylor University Medical Center, Baylor Research Institute, Dallas, TX 75226, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Pyrimidinones)', '58823-12-4 (merocyanine dye)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'EN464416SI (Ethidium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Southern', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*metabolism', 'Ethidium', 'Genes, myc/*drug effects', 'Mice', 'Pyrimidinones/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00001813-199605000-00009 [doi]'],ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 1996 May;7(3):293-8. doi: 10.1097/00001813-199605000-00009.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunization of mice with a carcinogen-induced colorectal tumor, CT26, engineered to secrete granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor, routinely generated both short-term and long-term CTL lines that not only lysed the parental tumor in vitro, but also cured mice of established tumor following adoptive transfer in vivo. When either short-term or long-term CTL lines were used to screen peptides isolated from CT26, one reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography peptide fraction consistently sensitized a surrogate target for specific lysis. The bioactivity remained localized within one fraction following multiple purification procedures, indicating that virtually all of the CT26-specific CTL recognized a single peptide. This result contrasts with other tumor systems, where multiple bioactive peptide fractions have been detected.

RESULTS: One patient had frank bone marrow relapse at the completion of therapy, which was evident by the presence of blasts in the peripheral blood. None of the other 112 patients had morphologic evidence of bone marrow relapse or positive CSF cytologic findings. The seven subsequent relapses could not have been predicted by the results of end-of-therapy bone marrow or CSF studies.

Pre-transplant conditioning comprised CAMPATH-1G, cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation. Bone marrow was T-cell depleted in vitro using CAMPATH-1 antibodies. Additional GvHD prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporin A (42 cases), cyclosporin plus methotrexate (four) or none (four). 47 patients engrafted.

Adult Leukaemia Working Party.",557-73,"Detection of the t(15;17) or its molecular consequence, the PML-RAR alpha rearrangement, is critical for meaningful analysis of clinical trials involving patients with suspected acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL). Its presence remains the best predictor of a favourable response to retinoids, such as ATRA, which in combination with chemotherapy confer significant improvements in disease-free survival. We have evaluated the relative efficacy of RT-PCR, cytogenetics and PML immunofluorescence staining to identify the existence of the translocation in 100 patients entered into the Medical Research Council (M.R.C.) ATRA trial. RT-PCR successfully identified PML-RAR alpha rearrangements in 93/100 patients, including 65 where only peripheral blood or post-induction marrow samples were available for analysis and in 12 patients in whom cytogenetic assessment failed to demonstrate t(15;17) due to poor-quality metaphases (10/12) or as a reflection of cryptic PML-RAR alpha rearrangements (2/12). Parallel employment of the RAR alpha-PML assay confirmed expression of del(17q)-derived transcripts in 81% and permitted determination of the PML breakpoint (a potential independent prognostic variable) in all 93 cases. Sequencing of RT-PCR products derived from 50 patients with 3' PML breakpoints revealed five bcr 2 cases, including a novel exon 5 breakpoint. 35/81 (43%) patients with cytogenetic evidence of t(15;17) possessed additional karyotypic abnormalities. In four patients with available buffy coat smears, lack of cytogenetic or molecular evidence of the t(15;17) was confirmed by a wild-type PML immunofluorescence nuclear staining pattern, in contrast to the characteristic microparticulate distribution detected in 14 patients with RT-PCR evidence of the rearrangement. However, although PML immunofluorescence staining is suitable for rapid determination of patients likely to benefit from ATRA, this approach does not obviate the need for cytogenetic and RT-PCR analysis of all patients entered into APL clinical trials, because both techniques provide additional information which may prove to be of independent prognostic significance.","['Grimwade, D', 'Howe, K', 'Langabeer, S', 'Davies, L', 'Oliver, F', 'Walker, H', 'Swirsky, D', 'Wheatley, K', 'Goldstone, A', 'Burnett, A', 'Solomon, E']","['Grimwade D', 'Howe K', 'Langabeer S', 'Davies L', 'Oliver F', 'Walker H', 'Swirsky D', 'Wheatley K', 'Goldstone A', 'Burnett A', 'Solomon E']","['Somatic Cell Genetics Laboratory, Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (DNA Primers)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'DNA Primers', 'Exons', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prognosis', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1996 Sep;94(3):557-73.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results of previous studies suggested that CD7 expression on myeloid leukaemic blasts might result from leukaemic transformation and maturation arrest of haemopoietic precursors at the stage of early myeloid differentiation when CD7 was transiently expressed. However, CD7+ myeloid progenitors have not yet been directly documented in normal human haemopoietic tissues. In this study, haemopoietic cells from 16 human fetal livers with a gestational age of 16-28 weeks were studied. Double myeloperoxidase (MPO) and CD7-positive cells could be demonstrated on 0-4% (mean 1.8%) of total fetal liver mononuclear cells (FLMC) by double cytochemical reaction of MPO and immunocytochemical staining of CD7. Simultaneous expression of CD7 and myeloid antigens (CD13 and/or CD33) could also be detected on 2.2-15.6% (mean 9.3%) of FLMC by dual-colour immunofluorescence flow cytometry analyses. CD13 and/or CD33 positive (CD13/33+) myeloid cells were positively selected by immunomagnetic bead separation system to a purity of 86.5-99.1% (mean 96.0%) of which < or = 3.3% were CD3+ cells and < or = 1.2% were CD19+ cells. Coexpression of CD7 was detected on 8.7-34.5% (mean 17.3%) of this CD 13/33+ cell population, but it was induced to decrease significantly after short-term in vitro culture with the differentiation-inducing agent phorbol ester (TPA). Coexpression of CD7 and CD13/33 could also be shown on a minor population of adult bone marrow and cord blood mononuclear cells (mean 3.9% and 1% respectively). In conclusion, the normal putative counterparts of blasts from CD7+ AML could be demonstrated in human haemopoietic tissues. The fact that CD7 expression tended to be lost after TPA stimulation suggested that CD7 was transiently expressed in early myeloid differentiation.","['Tien, H F', 'Chou, C C', 'Wang, C H', 'Chang, C H', 'Hsing, C C']","['Tien HF', 'Chou CC', 'Wang CH', 'Chang CH', 'Hsing CC']","['Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, R.O.C.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antigens, CD7)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antigens, CD7/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow', 'Fetal Blood', 'Gestational Age', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Liver/embryology']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1996 Sep;94(3):501-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hypercalcaemia was detected in 18/165 patients, and was due to primary hyperparathyroidism in 3/17 patients in whom results of humoral mediator assessments were obtained. In the other patients, hypercalcaemia was associated in nine instances with myeloma, in five with B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), and in one with myeloid neoplasia. No evidence was obtained of a humoral mechanism involving 1.25(OH)2 vitamin D, but elevated circulating levels of PTHrP, comparable with those in humoral hypercalcaemia of malignancy, were present in 2/4 patients with NHL, and in 3/9 with myeloma. The relationship between presence or absence of elevated circulating PTHrP, and presence or absence of hypercalcaemia during the course of treatment, indicated PTHrP was involved in the production of hypercalcaemia. Such an association raises the possibility that PTHrP released by neoplastic cells in these disorders acts in a paracrine manner to produce local bone resorption, and when produced in greater amounts causes elevated circulating levels which make an additional humorally-mediated contribution to the development of hypercalcaemia.","['Firkin, F', 'Seymour, J F', 'Watson, A M', 'Grill, V', 'Martin, T J']","['Firkin F', 'Seymour JF', 'Watson AM', 'Grill V', 'Martin TJ']","[""Department of Clinical Haematology, St Vincent's Hospital, Fitzroy, Victoria, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (PTHLH protein, human)', '0 (Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein)', '0 (Proteins)', '104982-03-8 (Osteocalcin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications', 'Humans', 'Hypercalcemia/*etiology/metabolism', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/complications/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/complications/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Osteocalcin/metabolism', 'Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein', 'Proteins/*metabolism']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.d01-1819.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1996 Sep;94(3):486-92. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.d01-1819.x.,,,,['Br J Haematol. 1997 Apr;97(1):239-40.

One of the possible means of DMD therapy is to express the dystrophin gene in patients' muscles. In this study, full length dystrophin cDNA was expressed in mdx (muscular dystrophy model) mouse muscle using the hemagglutinating virus of Japan (HVJ)-liposome method. With the HVJ-liposome method, the lacZ reporter genes were expressed in 50-80% of cultured mdx mouse myoblasts, which suggested its potential usefulness for an in vivo gene study. Three expression vectors containing human full length dystrophin cDNA driven by Rous sarcoma virus (RSV), mouse leukemia virus, or human dystrophin promoters, were used. HVJ-liposomes containing these plasmids were directly injected into mdx mouse quadriceps muscle. The highest efficiency of expression of dystrophin was in 26% of the muscle fibers at the injected site on day 3 after HVJ-liposome injection of the RSV-based vector. The expression was decreased on day 10. The study thus demonstrates the feasibility of full length human dystrophin cDNA transfer and dystrophin expression using HVJ-liposomes in vivo.","['Yanagihara, I', 'Inui, K', 'Dickson, G', 'Turner, G', 'Piper, T', 'Kaneda, Y', 'Okada, S']","['Yanagihara I', 'Inui K', 'Dickson G', 'Turner G', 'Piper T', 'Kaneda Y', 'Okada S']","['Department of Pediatrics, Osaka University, Faculty of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Gene Ther,Gene therapy,9421525,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Dystrophin)', '0 (Liposomes)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Sarcoma Viruses/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA, Complementary/*administration & dosage', 'Drug Carriers', 'Dystrophin/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Lac Operon', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Liposomes', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred mdx', 'Muscle, Skeletal/*metabolism', 'Muscular Dystrophy, Animal/*therapy', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Gene Ther. 1996 Jun;3(6):549-53.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Other features include ocular telangiectasia, high serum AFP levels, immunodeficiency, growth retardation and an increased predisposition to some tumours, particularly T cell leukaemia and lymphoma. We report the 1348 amino acid sequence of the N-terminal half of the A-T gene product which, together with the previously published C-terminal half, completes the sequence of the A-T protein. No homologies with other genes have been found within the N-terminal half of the A-T protein. We have also identified six mutations affecting the N-terminal half of the protein. One of these mutations was found to be associated with a haplotype that is common to four apparently unrelated families of Irish descent. All the patients so far examined for both A-T alleles were shown to be compound heterozygotes. None of these mutations affected a putative promoter region which may direct divergent transcription of both the A-T gene and a novel gene E14. The ability to recognise mutations across the entire coding sequence of the A-T gene provides a practical advantage to A-T families since a DNA based prenatal diagnosis will be possible in families where the mutations are identified irrespective of the level of radiosensitivity in these families.","['Byrd, P J', 'McConville, C M', 'Cooper, P', 'Parkhill, J', 'Stankovic, T', 'McGuire, G M', 'Thick, J A', 'Taylor, A M']","['Byrd PJ', 'McConville CM', 'Cooper P', 'Parkhill J', 'Stankovic T', 'McGuire GM', 'Thick JA', 'Taylor AM']","['Institute for Cancer Studies, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hum Mol Genet,Human molecular genetics,9208958,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia/*genetics', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', '*DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Genes/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proteins/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['5d0340 [pii]', '10.1093/hmg/5.1.145 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Mol Genet. 1996 Jan;5(1):145-9. doi: 10.1093/hmg/5.1.145.,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,['GENBANK/X91196'],,,,,,,,,,,

IL-10 inhibited the spontaneous proliferation in 1 out of 12 (1/12) cases while the IL-1 stimulated the tritiated thymidine (3H-TdR) uptake was suppressed in 2/12 cases as a result of IL-10 administration. In the presence of G-CSF, IL-10 affected 3H-TdR uptake in 2/12 and no distinct changes were observed in the presence of IL-3. In contrast IL-4 alone stimulated (3H-TdR) uptake with a factor two or more in 7/12 cases. In the presence of IL-1 and G-CSF a further enhancement was noted in 2 and 5 cases respectively. In 2/12 cases IL-4 inhibited the spontaneous or IL-1 and G-CSF supported proliferation. To study whether the changes in 3H-TdR uptake are related to the endogenous secretion of G-CSF and GM-CSF, AML blast cells (n = 5) were cultured in medium supplemented with IL-1 or IL-3 in the absence and presence of IL-10 and IL-4. IL-10 did not inhibit the spontaneous secretion of G-CSF or GM-CSF but suppressed the IL-1 induced GM-CSF secretion in 2/5 cases. These moderate effects were observed despite the strong inhibition of IL-10 on the IL-6 secretion by human activated monocytes. In contrast to IL-10, IL-4 also inhibited the spontaneous (3/5) and cytokine induced (5/5) secretion of G-CSF and GM-CSF (4/5) protein in the cases in which an enhancement of the 3H-TdR uptake was noticed. In summary the data indicate that the proliferative effects of IL-4 are in some cases uncoupled from the endogenous secretion of cytokines. In addition IL-10 affects the AML cells in a limited number of cases despite the similarity in effects between IL-4 and IL-10 in suppressing cytokine secretion from activated human monocytes.","['Tuyt, L M', 'Dokter, W H', 'Esselink, M T', 'Vellenga, E']","['Tuyt LM', 'Dokter WH', 'Esselink MT', 'Vellenga E']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Groningen, Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",France,Eur Cytokine Netw,European cytokine network,9100879,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'Growth Substances/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interleukin-10/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/*pathology', 'Monocytes/drug effects/immunology']",1995/07/01 00:00,1995/07/01 00:01,['1995/07/01 00:00'],"['1995/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Eur Cytokine Netw. 1995 Jul-Dec;6(4):231-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An improved understanding of how promoters function from a retroviral vector should facilitate the design of improved vectors. In this study, liver-specific promoters were cloned into a retroviral vector and expression from the retroviral long terminal repeat (LTR) and the internal promoter was analyzed. In addition, oligomerized liver-specific transcription factor binding sites were placed upstream of each promoter in an attempt to increase expression further. Additional oligomerized binding sites only increased expression slightly or inhibited expression in hepatoma cells, suggesting that this is not an effective way to increase expression from a retroviral vector. Unexpectedly, the liver-specific albumin promoter was expressed at high levels from a retroviral vector in fibroblasts, suggesting that retroviral elements functioned as an enhancer. Furthermore, the addition of HNF-4 binding sites adjacent to the albumin promoter inhibited both the LTR and albumin promoter in fibroblasts, an effect that was probably mediated by inhibitory proteins present in nonhepatic cells that can bind to HNF-4 sites. These results suggest that both positive and negative influences can be transmitted between the LTR and the albumin promoter. In contrast, the liver-specific human alpha 1-antitrypsin promoter did not appear to interact with the LTR by either of these criteria. Retroviral vectors have sequences that may inhibit expression of the LTR and some internal promoters in vivo. We hypothesize that internal promoters that do not interact with the LTR in tissue culture will be resistant to inhibitory effects of retroviral sequences in vivo.","['Wu, X', 'Holschen, J', 'Kennedy, S C', 'Ponder, K P']","['Wu X', 'Holschen J', 'Kennedy SC', 'Ponder KP']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (Albumins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (alpha 1-Antitrypsin)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)']",IM,"['Albumins/genetics', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic/genetics', 'Fibroblasts', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Liver/physiology', 'Liver Neoplasms', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'RNA Polymerase II/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'alpha 1-Antitrypsin/genetics']",1996/01/20 00:00,1996/01/20 00:01,['1996/01/20 00:00'],"['1996/01/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/20 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/hum.1996.7.2-159 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 1996 Jan 20;7(2):159-71. doi: 10.1089/hum.1996.7.2-159.,['DK44593/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously demonstrated that the Fas-resistant variants may exist in highly Fas-sensitive human leukemia T-cell lines. The surface expression of Fas antigen was unchanged in the variant cells, suggesting the requirement of the cytoplasmic mechanism to exert apoptosis. In the present study, we examined the changes in cytoplasmic proteins of the Fas-sensitive and Fas-resistant cells after stimulation with anti-Fas antibody, 2D1. In Western blotting analysis, we found that the stimulation of Fas-sensitive cells with 2D1, but not resistant variants, induced a repression of cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks), p34cdc2 and p33cdk2, along with apoptosis. There was no alteration in the expression of bcl-2, HSP70, HSP90, and cyclin proteins examined. This observation seemed specific to Fas-mediated apoptosis, because calcium ionophore A23187 or sodium azide failed to repress the expression of cdks. These results indicate that the specific depletion of cdks, most likely due to proteolysis, may play a role in Fas-mediated apoptosis.","['Oguri-Hyakumachi, N', 'Takahashi, S', 'Nakagawa, T', 'Kikuchi, K']","['Oguri-Hyakumachi N', 'Takahashi S', 'Nakagawa T', 'Kikuchi K']","['Department of Pathology 1, Sapporo Medical University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J Immunopharmacol,International journal of immunopharmacology,7904799,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Culture Media', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*biosynthesis', 'Cyclins/biosynthesis', 'DNA/isolation & purification', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*enzymology/physiology', 'fas Receptor/*immunology']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0192056195000828 [pii]', '10.1016/0192-0561(95)00082-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Immunopharmacol. 1995 Nov;17(11):913-21. doi: 10.1016/0192-0561(95)00082-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients being treated with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) undergo remission due to the differentiation of leukemic cells to functional neutrophils but relapse due to subsequent ATRA resistance. Our group has shown recently that NB4 cells, the only in vitro model of APL, are capable of monocytic differentiation in response to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate in addition to the neutrophilic differentiation response that occurs with ATRA treatment. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) is a ubiquitous protein that plays a role in DNA metabolism and repair. We have shown that, unlike HL-60 cells, NB4 cells completely down-regulate PARP in the neutrophilic lineage and up-regulate PARP 90-fold in the monocytic lineage. To ascertain whether PARP is an active participant in the bipotent differentiation of APL cells, NB4 cells were transiently transfected by lipid-mediated gene transfer with the human PARP gene under the control of the human metallothionein promoter. A 4-fold overexpression of PARP, in response to 8 microM CdCl2, promoted arrest of NB4 cells in the S phase of the cell cycle. Overexpression of PARP alone had no effect on cell viability or induction of phenotypic markers in the monocytic or neutrophilic lineages. However, increased PARP expression did result in an increase in the number of cells in the subdiploid population likely to include apoptotic cells. Overexpression of PARP, alone with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (200 nM), 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (200 nM), or a suboptimal dose of the combined agents, did not alter the expected monocytic differentiation marker profile over cells transfected with control plasmid (pSV2Neo). In contrast, PARP overexpression blocked the appearance of phenotypic markers of terminally differentiated neutrophils in 85% of the transfected population in response to 1 microM ATRA. Comparable to wild-type NB4 cells, 90% of cells transfected with pSV2Neo developed neutrophilic differentiation markers (nitroblue tetrazolium-positive and multi-lobed nuclei) in response to 1 microM ATRA. These data suggest that overexpression of PARP arrests APL cells and blocks ATRA-induced terminal neutrophilic differentiation. We propose that normal down-regulation of PARP in NB4 cells is a requirement for neutrophilic maturation.","['Bhatia, M', 'Kirkland, J B', 'Meckling-Gill, K A']","['Bhatia M', 'Kirkland JB', 'Meckling-Gill KA']","['Department of Human Biology and Nutritional Sciences, University of Guelph, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell Growth Differ,Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9100024,"['1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cholecalciferol/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Neutrophils/*cytology', 'Plasmids/genetics', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/enzymology/physiology']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Growth Differ. 1996 Jan;7(1):91-100.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we report that a RbK-like kinase associates with the amino terminus of p130, another Rb-related protein, only marginally. Moreover, the association of RbK with Rb in vitro is shown to require a discrete portion of the Rb amino terminus, amino acids 89-202. This region has been shown previously to be subject to inactivating mutations in retinoblastoma and to be required for Rb-mediated growth suppression in vitro. Taken together, these data indicate that the formation of Rb-RbK complexes may play an important role in Rb-mediated growth suppression. We have mapped two in vitro sites of Rb phosphorylation by RbK to sites that are phosphorylated in vivo and are targets of cyclin-dependent kinase phosphorylation in vitro. As such, at least some sites of RbK phosphorylation overlap with those of other proline-directed serine and threonine kinases. Consistent with this latter observation, we report that the trans-activation domain of c-myc is phosphorylated specifically by RbK in vitro at a site (serine 62) that is phosphorylated in vivo during G2-M, cell-cycle phases in which RbK activity is maximal.","['Sterner, J M', 'Tao, Y', 'Kennett, S B', 'Kim, H G', 'Horowitz, J M']","['Sterner JM', 'Tao Y', 'Kennett SB', 'Kim HG', 'Horowitz JM']","['Department of Molecular Cancer Biology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell Growth Differ,Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9100024,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RBL1 protein, human)', '0 (RBL2 protein, human)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Retinoblastoma-Like Protein p107)', '0 (Retinoblastoma-Like Protein p130)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Maturation-Promoting Factor)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*metabolism', 'Growth Inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Maturation-Promoting Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Mitosis/physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation/physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Phosphorylation', '*Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Retinoblastoma/genetics/metabolism', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Retinoblastoma-Like Protein p107', 'Retinoblastoma-Like Protein p130', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Transcription, Genetic/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/enzymology']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Growth Differ. 1996 Jan;7(1):53-64.,['CA53248/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Induction of differentiation of MEL cells is a multistep process resulting in cessation of cell division and phenotypic maturation (including hemoglobin production). To investigate HMBA-induced MEL cell differentiation, we have analyzed the regulation of the E2F transcription factor. E2F regulates the transcription of several genes whose products are involved in both cell cycle regulation and differentiation. In nuclear extracts from uninduced MEL cells, three complexes were detected using gel mobility assays with the E2F/E2 oligonucleotide. The complex with the fastest mobility is the free form of E2F binding to DNA, and the more slowly migrating complexes contain E2F, p107, and cdk2. By 8 h of HMBA induction and for the remainder of the differentiation process, the free E2F complex is not detected, and only complexes of slower mobility, which contain p107 and cdk2, are found. The level of p107 protein increases during induction of differentiation; there is no change in the level of cdk2 protein and E2F-4 and DP-1 proteins during the first 4 days. The level of E2F-1 mRNA does not change, but a new form of E2F is detected during induction of differentiation. Thus, HMBA causes a selective loss in the free E2F DNA-binding complex, an increase in p107 protein, and an increase in a form of E2F protein during MEL cell differentiation.","['Richon, V M', 'Venta-Perez, G']","['Richon VM', 'Venta-Perez G']","['DeWitt Wallace Research Laboratory, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021, USA. v-richon@ski.mskcc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell Growth Differ,Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9100024,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arid4a protein, mouse)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (E2F Transcription Factors)', '0 (E2F1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (E2F4 Transcription Factor)', '0 (E2f1 protein, mouse)', '0 (E2f4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Rbl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Retinoblastoma-Binding Protein 1)', '0 (Retinoblastoma-Like Protein p107)', '0 (Tfdp1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factor DP1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)']",IM,"['Acetamides/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', '*Carrier Proteins', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/physiology', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/analysis/genetics/metabolism', 'E2F Transcription Factors', 'E2F1 Transcription Factor', 'E2F4 Transcription Factor', 'Growth Inhibitors/metabolism', '*Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Proteins/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Retinoblastoma-Binding Protein 1', 'Retinoblastoma-Like Protein p107', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factor DP1', 'Transcription Factors/drug effects/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Growth Differ. 1996 Jan;7(1):31-42.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Oral bis(POM)-PMEA was not recovered from plasma, suggesting that it was readily cleaved to free PMEA. In contrast, diphenyl-PMEA was not efficiently cleaved to free PMEA, resulting in a rather low oral bioavailability of PMEA from this prodrug. Bis(POM)-PMEA appears to be an efficient oral prodrug of PMEA that deserves further clinical evaluation in human immunodeficiency virus-infected individuals.","['Naesens, L', 'Balzarini, J', 'Bischofberger, N', 'De Clercq, E']","['Naesens L', 'Balzarini J', 'Bischofberger N', 'De Clercq E']","['Rega Institute for Medical Research, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium. lieve.naesens/rega.kuleuven.ac.be']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,0315061,"['0 (Anti-HIV Agents)', '0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Organophosphonates)', '0 (Prodrugs)', '0 (bis(pivaloyloxymethyl)-9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl)adenine)', '0 (diphenyl-9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl)adenine)', '6GQP90I798 (adefovir)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Anti-HIV Agents/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Antiviral Agents/*pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/drug effects', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy/virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Mice, SCID', 'Moloney murine sarcoma virus/drug effects', '*Organophosphonates', 'Prodrugs/*pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Retroviridae/*drug effects', 'Retroviridae Infections/drug therapy/virology', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/drug therapy/prevention & control', 'Tumor Virus Infections/drug therapy']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/AAC.40.1.22 [doi]'],ppublish,Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 1996 Jan;40(1):22-8. doi: 10.1128/AAC.40.1.22.,,,,,,,PMC163050,,,,,,,

We measured the uptake of seven anthracyclines (daunorubicin, doxorubicin, 4'-epi-doxorubicin, 4'-deoxy-doxorubicin, iododoxorubicin, 3'-(3-methoxymorpholino)-doxorubicin (FCE23762) and 4-demethoxy-daunorubicin) into K562 cells sensitive and resistant (K562/DNR) to daunorubicin.

Uptake of daunorubicin, doxorubicin, 4'-epi-doxorubicin, and 4'-deoxy-doxorubicin was minimal in the K562/DNR subline as compared to their uptake in sensitive cells. On the contrary, iododoxorubicin, FCE23762, and 4-demethoxy-daunorubicin accumulate to nearly the same extent into sensitive and resistant K562 cells. Growth inhibition data indicated that the resistance factor for iododoxorubicin, FCE23762, and 4-demethoxy-daunorubicin is markedly decreased as compared to the other drugs. Fluorescence measurements were carried out to determine the kinetic parameters associated with the influx and efflux of the drugs into and out of K562 cells. Kinetic data indicated that iododoxorubicin, FCE23762, and 4-demethoxy-daunorubicin are not actively rejected from resistant cells, suggesting that they are poor substrates for Pgp-mediated transport.

During drug development, the effectiveness of target inhibition can be assessed by determination of the perturbations of deoxythymidine 5-triphosphate (TTP) and deoxyuridine 5'-monophosphate (dUMP) pools in drug-treated cells. Rapid, sensitive, and reproducible radioimmunoassays for TTP pools and immunoreactive dUMP pools have been developed to meet our requirement for the rapid assessment of TS inhibition by quinazoline antifolates. The assays can be carried out on 1-2 million cells, and require minimal sample preparation. The limit of detection for TTP is 1 pmole/10(6) cells and for immunoreactive dUMP (""dUMP""), 3.0 pmole/10(6) cells, both assays being performed on the same cell extract. TTP and ""dUMP"" pools have been measured in mouse L1210 leukaemia cells treated with the quinazoline antifolates ZD1694 (N-(5-[N-(3,4-dihydro-2-methyl-4-oxoquinazolin-6-ylmethyl )-N-methylamine]-2-thenoyl)-L-glutamic acid) and CB30900 (N-[N-[4-[N-[(3,4-dihydro-2,7-dimethyl-4-oxo-6-quinazolinyl)methyl ]-N-prop-2- ynylamino]-2-fluorobenzoyl]-L-gamma-glutamyl]-D-glutamic acid). Unlike ZD1694, CB30900 is a TS inhibitor that does not rely on polyglutamation for activity. In L1210 cells, both compounds caused a rapid inhibition of TTP pools in a dose- and time-related manner. Greater than 90% TS inhibition was achieved following a 4-hr exposure to each compound at equitoxic doses (up to 100 times the IC50 determine by a 48-hr growth inhibition assay). For both compounds, this was accompanied by a 5-10-fold increase in ""dUMP"" pools. For ZD1694, neither the TTP pool or ""dUMP"" levels were normalised when cells were resuspended in a drug-free medium for 4 hr and, at the higher doses studied, TS was still inhibited after a 16-hr period in the absence of drug. This is consistent with the formation and intracellular retention of potent polyglutamated forms of ZD1694. In contrast, TS activity as determined by repletion of the TTP pools and normalisation of ""dUMP"" levels were demonstrated for CB30900. However, at a high dose (50 microM, equivalent to 250 times the IC50), retention of TS inhibition was observed following 4 hr, but not 16 hr in the absence of drug. The radioimmunoassays described will prove useful to further define the extent and time-course of TS inhibition by novel antifolate compounds, and will also provide valuable in vitro and in vivo pharmacodynamic information on established antimetabolites when used alone or in combination with other drugs and modulators.","['Aherne, G W', 'Hardcastle, A', 'Raynaud, F', 'Jackman, A L']","['Aherne GW', 'Hardcastle A', 'Raynaud F', 'Jackman AL']","['CRC Centre for Cancer Therapeutics, Institute of Cancer Research, Surey, U.K.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Deoxyuracil Nucleotides)', '0 (Dipeptides)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0 (Thiophenes)', '0 (Thymine Nucleotides)', '145788-82-5 (CB 30900)', ""964-26-1 (2'-deoxyuridylic acid)"", 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'FCB9EGG971 (raltitrexed)', ""QOP4K539MU (thymidine 5'-triphosphate)""]",IM,"['Animals', 'Deoxyuracil Nucleotides/*metabolism', 'Dipeptides/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Quinazolines/*pharmacology', 'Radioimmunoassay', 'Thiophenes/*pharmacology', 'Thymidylate Synthase/*metabolism', 'Thymine Nucleotides/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/05/17 00:00,1996/05/17 00:01,['1996/05/17 00:00'],"['1996/05/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/17 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/17 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(96)00035-4 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(96)00035-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1996 May 17;51(10):1293-301. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(96)00035-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cells rendered glutathione peroxidase (GPX) deficient by shortterm (2-3 week) growth in 1%, serum/RPMI medium without added Se [L.Se(-) cells] were found to be much less resistant to clonally assessed UVA/B lethality than Se-supplemented controls [L.Se(+) cells]. By contrast, long-term ( > 20 week) Se-deprived [L'.Se(-)] cells whose catalase (CAT) activity was elevated > 100-fold were far more resistant to UVA/B than L.Se(+) cells. Similar trends were observed for cells irradiated in 1% serum/RPMI or Hank's medium. Whereas the CAT inhibitor 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole had no effect on L.Se(+) photosensitivity, it produced a large increase in L'.Se(-) photosensitivity. These findings are consistent with H2O2 intermediacy in photokilling and suggest that L1210 cells depend mainly on GPX for protection against this species but switch to overexpressed CAT after chronic Se deprivation. In agreement with this, steady-state H2O2 levels measured by H2O2 electrode during UVA/B exposure were higher in L.Se(-) than L.Se(+) suspensions but much lower (barely detectable) in L'.Se(-) suspensions. Cytotoxic effects of UVA/B and variations thereof resulting from Se manipulation could be mimicked by treating cells with glucose oxidase in the presence of D-glucose, providing further support for H2O2 involvement.

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) provides reducing equivalents for the GRS, and it has been suggested that high levels of G6PD in preneoplastic lesions are directly related to neoplastic transformation. We have used THP-1 human promonocytic leukemia cells, an established model of induced macrophage differentiation, to test an important corollary of this hypothesis, viz., that a decrease in G6PD activity should accompany the loss of the transformed phenotype. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) arrests the constitutive cycling of THP-1 and induces a phenotype that approaches normalcy. We measured the specific activities of the GRS enzymes, G6PD, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione reductase during the early stages of phorbol ester-induced differentiation of THP-1 cells. We observed an 80% decrease in G6PD activity and an increase in the apparent KM for glucose 6-phosphate. In contrast, glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity increased, while glutathione reductase (GR) activity remained essentially constant.

Here we report that glucocorticoid hormone and a clinically relevant chemotherapy combination (fludarabine plus mitoxantrone) fail to induce apoptosis in four of 24 CLL patient isolates. Apoptosis resistance was associated with elevated BCL-2 and BAX expression. Interestingly, incubation in vitro led to down-regulation of BCL-2 expression in both apoptosis-sensitive and apoptosis-resistant cells, whereas parallel down-regulation of BAX occurred only in the resistant samples. Evaluation of nuclear endonuclease content indicated that all of the apoptosis-sensitive samples contained appreciable levels of activity, whereas the endonuclease was not detected in the four populations of resistant cells. Our results indicate that nuclear endonuclease activity represents an excellent prognostic indicator of CLL apoptosis sensitivity that may be controlled by differential BCL-2 family polypeptide expression and signals from the in vivo microenvironment.","['McConkey, D J', 'Chandra, J', 'Wright, S', 'Plunkett, W', 'McDonnell, T J', 'Reed, J C', 'Keating, M']","['McConkey DJ', 'Chandra J', 'Wright S', 'Plunkett W', 'McDonnell TJ', 'Reed JC', 'Keating M']","['Department of Cell Biology, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, 77030, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endonucleases)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'X4W7ZR7023 (Methylprednisolone)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Endonucleases/*metabolism', 'Glucocorticoids/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Methylprednisolone/pharmacology', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1996 Apr 1;156(7):2624-30.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CD21 from T cell lines transformed with human T cell leukemia virus type I (MT2, HUT-102, C5.MJ, Mondi, and C91.PL) and T cell lines that were not virus transformed was analyzed by coprecipitation following cell lysis with digitonin. mAbs binding to functional and nonfunctional epitopes of CD21 and a polyclonal antiserum against its intracellular portion precipitated CD21, which was indistinguishable from CD21 on B cell lines. In contrast to B cells, where CD21 is complexed with CD19 and CD81 (target of anti-proliferative Ab 1) or, alternatively, with CD35 (CR1), no surface molecules could be coprecipitated with three of four mAbs from these T cell lines. Therefore, we assume that CD21 is not part of a preformed complex in T cell lines. OKB7, the only mAb directed against the functional C3d binding site, coprecipitated two proteins of 105 and 55 Mr with CD21 from MT2 and Mondi cells and from the T cell lines Jurkat E6-1 and SupT1. These bands were also recovered with CD21 precipitated from MT2 cells with C3d bound to Sepharose via the internal thioester, but were absent in CD21-expressing B cell lines. As C3d and OKB7 are functional ligands for B cells, we propose that upon ligation on T cells, CD21 associates with molecules of 105/55 Mr in the plasma membrane.

Cyclodextrins did not seem to affect the efflux of phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide from cells.

The ability of 13-cis RA to induce apoptosis in PBMC from ATL patients suggests that retinoids may be useful in the treatment of ATL.","['Maeda, Y', 'Miyatake, J', 'Sono, H', 'Matsuda, M', 'Tatsumi, Y', 'Horiuchi, F', 'Irimajiri, K', 'Horiuchi, A']","['Maeda Y', 'Miyatake J', 'Sono H', 'Matsuda M', 'Tatsumi Y', 'Horiuchi F', 'Irimajiri K', 'Horiuchi A']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Kinki University School of Medicine, Osaka.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Intern Med,"Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)",9204241,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Keratolytic Agents)', 'EH28UP18IF (Isotretinoin)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Female', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Isotretinoin/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Keratolytic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/pathology', 'Thymidine', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.2169/internalmedicine.35.180 [doi]'],ppublish,Intern Med. 1996 Mar;35(3):180-4. doi: 10.2169/internalmedicine.35.180.,,,,['Intern Med. 1996 Mar;35(3):167-8.

Rapid detection of antigen respiratory samples obtained from the lower respiratory tracts of IC adults is sensitive and specific, but detection in upper respiratory tract samples is insensitive.

These two-mutation models are such that the first (but not the second) mutation rate and the susceptible stem cell population vary rapidly with age. CLL is also adequately fitted by a model with three mutations, and the mutation rates and the variation in the stem cell population numbers implied by the three-mutation model are more plausible than those of the two-mutation model. For CLL there are no significant differences between the sexes in either of the optimal models fitted, but this is not the case for ALL.

Exposure of human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y and IMR-32) to ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), leukemia inhibitory factor or oncostatin-M resulted in a 30-40% decline in alpha-bungarotoxin receptors on the cells with no decrease seen in either muscarinic acetylcholine receptors or in L-type Ca2+ channels. The level of nicotinic receptor was not affected by the related cytokine, interleukin-6. Treatment of IMR-32 cells with 40 pM CNTF produced a half-maximal decrease of alpha-bungarotoxin binding which compared well with the affinity estimated from binding of 125I-CNTF (Ki approximately 40 pM) and the concentration causing c-fos activation in SH-SY5Y cells, as detected by nuclear run-on assays (60-120 pM). Previous results have indicated that the differentiating agents, phorbol esters and retinoic acid, also decrease nicotinic receptor numbers. Here the effects of CNTF, which did not induce neural differentiation, were enhanced by differentiation with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (10 nM) and prevented by retinoic acid (10 microM). Therefore, the response of neuroblastoma cells to cytokines may be under developmental control.

Data on populations originating in the Indian sub-continent, and Caribbean and African Commonwealth were extracted from published works. Cancers were ranked (top seven) on the basis of the number of cases, actual frequency, and also on relative frequency (SMR, SRR, PMR). Cancer was found to be a common cause of death. For example, during 1979-83 the proportion of deaths resulting from neoplasms in immigrants living in England and Wales was 11% for Indian and African men aged 20-49, and 19% for Caribbeans. The corresponding proportions were higher among women. The pattern of cancer depended on the method used to assess rankings. On the basis of the number of cases the top 3 ranking cancers for adults were breast, long and neoplasms of the lymphatic system. Based on SMR's cancer of the gallbladder, liver and oral cavity ranked amongst the top 3 for adults. For children the top ranking cancers were acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, central nervous system tumours and neuroblastoma. Variations by ethnic group were more evident in the rankings of relative frequency than in rankings based on numbers of cases. In conclusion, the most common and preventable cancers among minority ethnic populations were the same as those for the general population. The different cancer pattern based on SMRs highlight additional needs and provide potential models for research into understanding the causes of these cancers. Health services policy and practice should ensure that the common and preventable cancers take priority over rare cancers and those for which there is no effective treatment or prevention. Priorities for policy, prevention, clinical care and research should be set separately, for they differ.","['Bhopal, R S', 'Rankin, J']","['Bhopal RS', 'Rankin J']","['Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, School of Health Care Sciences, University of Newcastle.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Br J Cancer Suppl,The British journal of cancer.

HSCs change with age, but it is unknown whether these changes are determined intrinsically or caused by the aging of their environment.","['Morrison, S J', 'Wandycz, A M', 'Akashi, K', 'Globerson, A', 'Weissman, I L']","['Morrison SJ', 'Wandycz AM', 'Akashi K', 'Globerson A', 'Weissman IL']","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University, California 94305, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Nat Med,Nature medicine,9502015,,IM,"['Aging/*immunology', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/nm0996-1011 [doi]'],ppublish,Nat Med. 1996 Sep;2(9):1011-6. doi: 10.1038/nm0996-1011.,['CA 42551/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,['Nat Med. 1996 Dec;2(12):1281-3.

Microscopically, the tumor consisted of small lymphoid cells without atypia, admixed with neutrophils and other mononuclear cells, but there was no invasion of the bronchial cartilage or visceral pleura, or any lymph node involvement. Most of the tumor cells were positive for L26 and some for UCHL-1. Although a germinal center was not seen, pseudolymphoma could not be ruled out. Southern blot analysis of the frozen tissues revealed clonal rearrangements of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain JH and light-chain J kappa, whereby the tumor was diagnosed as malignant lymphoma of the small lymphocytic B-cell type.

METHODS: A Mayo Clinic database search was conducted to identify patients that developed GCA after the onset of CLL between 1950 and 1994. Inflammatory infiltrates were analyzed immunohistochemically for T cells, B cells, and plasma cells. RESULTS: Five patients with CLL were identified who subsequently developed clinical findings suggestive of GCA. Three of the 5 patients had biopsy proven disease, presented with typical clinical and histomorphological features of GCA, and responded promptly to corticosteroid treatment. Leukemic B cells known for their ability to diffusely seed organs were absent in the inflammatory lesions in the temporal artery. Plasma cells that contribute to the vasculitic infiltrate in patients without CLL were markedly reduced in the GCA lesions of patients with CLL. Two other patients had symptoms suggestive of GCA. Their temporal artery specimens were remarkable for small adventitial lymphocytic infiltrates but lacked typical panarteritis. CONCLUSION: The inflammatory infiltrate of GCA is tightly regulated, and cell accumulation in the granulomas is an active, not a passive, mechanism. The inflammatory pathway in GCA is focused on T cells and macrophages and excludes B cells.","['Martinez-Taboada, V', 'Brack, A', 'Hunder, G G', 'Goronzy, J J', 'Weyand, C M']","['Martinez-Taboada V', 'Brack A', 'Hunder GG', 'Goronzy JJ', 'Weyand CM']","['Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic and Foundation, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Canada,J Rheumatol,The Journal of rheumatology,7501984,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/*pathology', 'Giant Cell Arteritis/complications/immunology/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications/pathology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Rheumatol. 1996 Jun;23(6):1011-4.,,,,['J Rheumatol. 1997 Feb;24(2):407-8.

Involvement of quinone reductase and glutathione-dependent detoxification in nonclassical multidrug resistance.,945-56,"A hydroquinone-resistant derivative of the M1 cell line, designated M1HQ, was generated and used to evaluate the biochemical mechanism responsible for resistance to oxidative stress-inducing agents. The hydroquinone concentrations that were cytotoxic to 50 and 90% of the parental M1 cell line in 48 hr were 25 and 90 microM, respectively, whereas exposure to 500 microM hydroquinone did not decrease M1HQ viability significantly. M1HQ cells grew slower than M1 cells and exhibited significantly higher resistance to colchicine, doxorubicin, hydrogen peroxide, 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide, and 1,3-bis (2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea but not to benzoquinone, vinblastine, or gamma-radiation. M1HQ cells possessed significantly higher levels of total thiols, glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, quinone reductase, and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase than the parental M1 cell line. Steady-state gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase mRNA expression also was 1.6-fold higher in M1HQ cells. P-glycoprotein transcripts were detectable in both M1 and M1HQ cells, but were 2-fold higher in M1HQ. Multidrug resistance-associated protein transcripts were not detectable in either M1 or M1HQ. Hydroquinone resistance in M1HQ cells was partially reversible with a combination of inhibitors of quinone reductase, gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase, glutathione peroxidase, and the multidrug resistance-associated protein, but not with inhibitors of P-glycoprotein, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, or glutathione-S-transferase. When treated with [14C]hydroquinone, M1HQ cells did not generate significant hydroquinone-protein adducts but did release an adduct similar to N-acetylcysteinyl-benzoquinone. In contrast, numerous [14C]hydroquinone-protein adducts were produced in M1 cells, while the N-acetylcysteinyl-benzoquinone-like molecule was undetectable. Thus, hydroquinone resistance in M1HQ cells appeared to result from a glutathione-dependent detoxification and export mechanism.","['Colinas, R J', 'Hunt, D H', 'Walsh, A C', 'Lawrence, D A']","['Colinas RJ', 'Hunt DH', 'Walsh AC', 'Lawrence DA']","['Wadsworth Center, New York State Department of Health, Albany 12201-0509, USA. colinas@wadsworth.ph.albany.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Hydroquinones)', '0 (Radiation-Protective Agents)', 'XV74C1N1AE (hydroquinone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Hydroquinones/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Radiation-Protective Agents/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1996/09/27 00:00,1996/09/27 00:01,['1996/09/27 00:00'],"['1996/09/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/27 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/27 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(96)00470-4 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(96)00470-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1996 Sep 27;52(6):945-56. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(96)00470-4.,"['ES05538/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES05020/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, most of these patients develop RA resistance and relapse. The mechanisms of RA resistance by APL cells are still unclear. To understand the characteristics of human leukemia, human leukemic cell lines are useful tools for study. APL cells have a strikingly low proliferation potential in vitro; thus, only one APL cell line has been established. We developed a novel APL cell line (UF-1) from a patient clinically resistant to all-trans RA. Cell surface markers in the UF-1 cells were positive for CD7, CD13, CD33, and CD38. Cytogenetic analyses revealed additional abnormalities, 46XX, add(1)(q44), add(6)(q12), add(7)(q36), t(15;17) (q21;q21). Molecular analyses showed a PML/RAR alpha fusion transcript. Sequence analysis of the RAR alpha gene in RA-resistant HL-60 cells disclosed a point mutation in codon 411 (C to T substitution), whereas UF-1 cells showed the normal sequence. All-trans RA did not change morphological features of the cell, NBT reduction activity, or their expression of CD11b antigens as determined by FACS analysis except at 10(-6) mol/L. RA also did not alter the growth curve of the cells as determined by the MTT assay. These findings suggest that the UF-1 cell is the first permanent cell line with spontaneous RA-resistant APL cells. This RA-resistant APL cell line may be a useful model for molecular studies on the block of leukemic cell differentiation and as a means to investigate the mechanisms of RA resistance.","['Kizaki, M', 'Matsushita, H', 'Takayama, N', 'Muto, A', 'Ueno, H', 'Awaya, N', 'Kawai, Y', 'Asou, H', 'Kamada, N', 'Ikeda, Y']","['Kizaki M', 'Matsushita H', 'Takayama N', 'Muto A', 'Ueno H', 'Awaya N', 'Kawai Y', 'Asou H', 'Kamada N', 'Ikeda Y']","['Division of Hematology and Clinical Laboratories, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/analysis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prednisolone/administration & dosage', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', '*Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)63538-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Sep 1;88(5):1824-33.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The latter was selected to have little chance of cross-reactivity with other members of the PEBP2 alpha family.

Biochemical analysis confirmed specificity of the antibodies and the nuclear localization of the antigens, the latter being exclusive for AML1 and primary for ETO. Immunoprecipitations of metabolically labeled 32P-proteins from Kasumi-1 cells show that AML1 and ETO are phosphorylated on serine and threonine. Investigations with normal bone marrow reveal AML1 and ETO are coexpressed in megakaryocytes and that each is expressed in a portion of the approximately 10-microns-diameter cells residing there. Using a CD34+ enriched population mobilized to peripheral blood, we found AML1 and, unexpectedly, ETO present in these cells. Because of this, we conclude that the expression of ETO in hematopoietic cells is not by itself leukemogenic. Also, because ETO would not be exclusively expressed as part of chimeric AML1/ETO in leukemic patients, its presence cannot be used to monitor t(8;21) AML residual disease.","['Erickson, P F', 'Dessev, G', 'Lasher, R S', 'Philips, G', 'Robinson, M', 'Drabkin, H A']","['Erickson PF', 'Dessev G', 'Lasher RS', 'Philips G', 'Robinson M', 'Drabkin HA']","['Division of Medical Oncology, University of Colorado Medical School, Denver 80262, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/*ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/genetics/*ultrastructure', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immune Sera', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Peptide Fragments/immunology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Rabbits', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)63537-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Sep 1;88(5):1813-23.,['P01-HD017449/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

From such observations it has been inferred that the initial BCR-ABL gene rearrangement event occurs in a pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell and that the clone subsequently generated is maintained by a subpopulation of neoplastic, BCR-ABL-expressing cells that retain at least some of the defining properties of normal hematopoietic stem cells. To test this hypothesis directly, we isolated various subpopulations of CD34+ cells from fresh or cryopreserved samples of peripheral blood from 5 CML patients with high white blood cell counts, 4 of which were selected because of their exclusive content of Ph+ progenitors (both colony-forming cells and long-term culture-initiating cells [LTC-IC]). Cells in each of the CD34+ subpopulations isolated were examined for the presence of BCR-ABL mRNA using a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction technique that reproducibly gave a positive signal from single K562 cells. BCR-ABL mRNA was detected in 117 of 147 samples (80%) in which actin mRNA was demonstrable. This included 60% to 90% of a large number of individually analyzed CD34+ cells including 46 single CD34+CD71-CD38- cells and 27 single CD34+CD71+CD38+ cells from 3 patients.

All mice developed hepatosplenomegaly and died within 9 to 12 weeks after infection. Histological analysis showed that spleen, liver, and peripheral blood were invaded by erythroblasts at every stage of differentiation. In contrast to the myeloproliferative syndrome induced by MPLV, we did not observe an infiltration of these organs with cells from the granulocytic lineage nor a thrombocytosis. In fact, the platelet count of HSFmmpl mice progressively decreased and a severe thrombocytopenia was observed late in the course of the disease. Further characterization of the target progenitor of HSFmmpl virus in the spleen and bone marrow of diseased animals was accomplished using in vitro clonogenic progenitor cell assays. This analysis indicated that both late and early erythroid compartment (colony-forming unit-erythroid and burst-forming unit-erythroid) were largely increased in the spleens. The colony-forming unit-granulocyte-macrophage compartment was also increased but to a lesser extent. This study shows for the first time that ectopic expression of a member of the cytokine receptor superfamily promotes hematopoietic progenitor cell proliferation and could play a role in leukemogenesis.","['Cocault, L', 'Bouscary, D', 'Le Bousse Kerdiles, C', 'Clay, D', 'Picard, F', 'Gisselbrecht, S', 'Souyri, M']","['Cocault L', 'Bouscary D', 'Le Bousse Kerdiles C', 'Clay D', 'Picard F', 'Gisselbrecht S', 'Souyri M']","['INSERM U 363, Institut Cochin de Genetique Moleculaire, Hopital Cochin, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '143641-95-6 (MPL protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Clone Cells/pathology', 'Erythropoiesis/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Harvey murine sarcoma virus/genetics', 'Liver/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mice, Nude', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*etiology/physiopathology', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Oncogenes', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', '*Receptors, Cytokine', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis/*toxicity', 'Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms', 'Spleen/pathology', 'Transfection']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)63518-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Sep 1;88(5):1656-65.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The level of alkyltransferase in CD34+ cells or in mononuclear BM cells did not increase after incubation with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interleukin-3, stem cell factor, the combination, or 5637 conditioned medium. BCNU sensitivity remained unchanged as well. In addition, O6-benzylguanine depleted alkyltransferase activity in BM cells at concentrations as low as 1.5 mumol/L after a 1-hour exposure. O6-benzylguanine pretreatment markedly sensitized hematopoietic progenitor colony-forming cells to BCNU, resulting in a reduction in the dose of drug (termed the dose-modification factor) required to inhibit 50% of the colony formation (IC50) of threefold to fivefold.

To identify the earliest human hematopoietic cells on which TPO acts, we cultured single CD34+Thy-1+Lin- adult bone marrow cells in the presence of TPO alone, with TPO and interleukin-3 (IL-3), or with TPO and c-kit ligand (KL) in the presence of a murine stromal cell line (Sys1). Two distinct growth morphologies were observed: expansion of up to 200 blast cells with subsequent differentiation to large refractile CD41b+ MKs within 3 weeks or expansion to 200-10,000 blast cells, up to 25% of which expressed CD34. The latter blast cell expansions occurred over a 3- to 6-week period without obvious MK differentiation. Morphological staining, analysis of surface marker expression, and colony formation analysis revealed that these populations consisted predominantly of cells committed to the myelomonocytic lineage. The addition of IL-3 to TPO-containing cultures increased the extent of proliferation of single cells, whereas addition of KL increased the percentage of CD34+ cells among the expanding cell populations. Production of multiple colony-forming unit-MK from single CD34+Thy-1+Lin- cells in the presence of TPO was also demonstrated. In limiting dilution assays of CD34+Lin- cells, TPO was found to increase the size and frequency of cobblestone areas at 4 weeks in stromal cultures in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor and IL-6. In stroma-free cultures, TPO activated a quiescent CD34+Lin-Rhodamine 123lo subset of primitive hematopoietic progenitor cells into cycle, without loss of CD34 expression. These data demonstrate that TPO acts directly on and supports division of cells more primitive than those committed to the MK lineage.","['Young, J C', 'Bruno, E', 'Luens, K M', 'Wu, S', 'Backer, M', 'Murray, L J']","['Young JC', 'Bruno E', 'Luens KM', 'Wu S', 'Backer M', 'Murray LJ']","['SyStemix Inc, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Megakaryocytes/cytology/*drug effects', 'Mice', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology', 'Stimulation, Chemical', 'Thrombopoietin/*pharmacology', 'Transfection']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)63514-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Sep 1;88(5):1619-31.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report in this study that the effect of MS-5 cells on UT-7 cells can be completely explained by the synergistic action of nerve growth factor (NGF) and stem cell factor (SCF) produced by these murine stromal cells. Purified murine NGF was able to support short-term clone formation and long-term growth of UT-7 cells in suspension cultures as efficiently as rhu-granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. NGF action was mediated through the TrkA receptor, in which messenger RNA (mRNA) was easily detected in UT-7 cells by Northern blot. MS-5 cells strongly expressed NGF mRNA in Northern blot, and direct implication of MS-5-derived NGF in the induction of UT-7 cells proliferation was demonstrated in inhibition assays with an anti-NGF monoclonal antibody (MoAb) that neutralized by 84% +/- 4.1% (n = 5) UT-7 clone formation. However, NGF did not act alone, and several arguments demonstrated the synergistic action of MS-5-derived SCF: (1) an anti-c-kit partially inhibited UT-7 cells clone formation in coculture assays, (2) SCF and NGF synergized in an H3-TdR incorporation assay, and (3) the stimulatory effect of 10x-concentrated MS-5 supernatant was completely inhibited by an anti-c-kit but not by an anti-NGF, and levels of soluble NGF (1.2 ng/mL) detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 10x supernatant of MS-5 cells cultures were below the biologically active concentrations. In contrast, although MS-5 cells also promoted the differentiation of very primitive CD34+/CD38- human stem cells both in colony assays and long-term cultures, we could not incriminate MS-5-derived NGF in the observed effect: an anti-NGF MoAb did not inhibit the synergistic effect of MS-5 cells in colony assays or long-term cultures nor did soluble muNGF duplicate MS-5 effect and survival of CD34+/CD38- clonogenic progenitor cells promoted by MS-5 was unaffected by an anti-NGF and was not induced by soluble NGF alone or combined with SCF. In contrast, NGF in synergy with SCF supported the short-term maintenance of high numbers of CD34+/CD38+ mature erythroid progenitors probably through an indirect mechanism implying macrophages. These results suggest that NGF, in which the primary target cells are outside the hematopoietic system, is present in the marrow environment and might act at some steps of hematopoietic stem cell development. These results also underline that the response of cell lines and normal stem cells to stromal cells is mediated by different pathways.","['Auffray, I', 'Chevalier, S', 'Froger, J', 'Izac, B', 'Vainchenker, W', 'Gascan, H', 'Coulombel, L']","['Auffray I', 'Chevalier S', 'Froger J', 'Izac B', 'Vainchenker W', 'Gascan H', 'Coulombel L']","['INSERM U362, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, trkA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Connective Tissue/metabolism', '*Connective Tissue Cells', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'DNA Replication', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Mice', 'Monocytes/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/physiology', 'Nerve Growth Factors/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/physiology', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/physiology', 'Receptor, trkA', 'Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor/physiology', 'Stem Cell Factor/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)63513-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Sep 1;88(5):1608-18.,,,,,['Blood 1996 Oct 1;88(7):2818'],,,,,,,,,

Epo has been shown to promote cell viability by repressing apoptosis; however, the molecular mechanism involved is unclear. In the present studies we have examined whether Epo acts as a survival factor through the regulation of the bcl-2 family of apoptosis-regulatory genes. We addressed this issue in HCD-57, a murine erythroid progenitor cell line that requires Epo for proliferation and survival. When HCD-57 cells were cultured in the absence of Epo, Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL but not Bax were downregulated, and the cells underwent apoptotic cell death. HCD-57 cells infected with a retroviral vector encoding human Bcl-XL or Bcl-2 rapidly stopped proliferating but remained viable in the absence of Epo. Furthermore, endogenous levels of bcl-2 and bcl-XL were downregulated after Epo withdrawal in HCD-57 cells that remained viable through ectopic expression of human Bcl-XL, further indicating that Epo specifically maintains the expression of bcl-2 and bcl-XL. We also show that HCD-57 rescued from apoptosis by ectopic expression of Bcl-XL can undergo erythroid differentiation in the absence of Epo, demonstrating that a survival signal but not Epo itself is necessary for erythroid differentiation of HCD-57 progenitor cells. Thus, we propose a model whereby Epo functions as a survival factor by repressing apoptosis through Bcl-XL and Bcl-2 during proliferation and differentiation of erythroid progenitors.","['Silva, M', 'Grillot, D', 'Benito, A', 'Richard, C', 'Nunez, G', 'Fernandez-Luna, J L']","['Silva M', 'Grillot D', 'Benito A', 'Richard C', 'Nunez G', 'Fernandez-Luna JL']","['Servicio de Inmunologia, Hospital Universitario Marques de Valdecilla, Santander, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl2l1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Erythropoietin/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-X Protein']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)63509-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Sep 1;88(5):1576-82.,"['CA064556/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'KO4 CA64421/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Homozygous deletion of BRCA2, located within the minimal deletion consensus, was detected in a significant population of cells in 60% of the cases. Deletion of the previously described 13q14 locus (analyzed with RB1 and D13S25 probes) was seen in 63% of the cases. Homozygous deletion of RB1 was seen in one case.

Although some of the mechanisms responsible for transformation remain unknown, increasing evidence supports a direct role of viral as well as dysregulated cellular proteins in transformation. We investigated the potential role of the tumor suppressor gene p53 and of the p53-regulated gene, p21waf1/cip1 (wild-type p53 activated fragment 1/cycling dependent kinases [cdks] interacting protein 1), in HTLV-I-infected T cells. We have found that the majority of HTLV-I-infected T cells have the wild-type p53 gene. However, its function in HTLV-I-transformed cells appears to be impaired, as shown by the lack of appropriate p53-mediated responses to ionizing radiation (IR). Interestingly, the expression of the p53 inducible gene, p21waf1/cip1, is elevated at the messenger ribonucleic acid and protein levels in all HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines examined as well as in Taxl-1, a human T-cell line stably expressing Tax. Additionally, Tax induces upregulation of a p21waf1/cip1 promoter-driven luciferase gene in p53 null cells, and increases p21waf1/cip1 expression in Jurkat T cells. These findings suggest that the Tax protein is at least partially responsible for the p53-independent expression of p21waf1/cip1 in HTLV-I-infected cells. Dysregulation of p53 and p21waf1/cip1 proteins regulating cell-cycle progression, may represent an important step in HTLV-I-induced T-cell transformation.","['Cereseto, A', 'Diella, F', 'Mulloy, J C', 'Cara, A', 'Michieli, P', 'Grassmann, R', 'Franchini, G', 'Klotman, M E']","['Cereseto A', 'Diella F', 'Mulloy JC', 'Cara A', 'Michieli P', 'Grassmann R', 'Franchini G', 'Klotman ME']","['Laboratory of Tumor Cell Biology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892-4255, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (GADD45 protein)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Cycle/*physiology', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/radiation effects', 'Gene Products, tax/physiology', 'Genes, p53', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proteins/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/radiation effects/virology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*physiology']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)63506-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Sep 1;88(5):1551-60.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expression of the BCR/abl gene induces hematologic malignancies in transgenic mice and transformation of interleukin-3-dependent hematopoietic cells. The mechanism of BCR/abl-mediated transformation of hematopoietic cells is poorly understood and involves activation of at least two signaling pathways, p21ras and PI 3-kinase. Here we report that PI 3,4-P2 and PI 3,4,5-P3, the enzymatic products of PI 3-kinase, accumulate in metabolically labeled transformed hematopoietic cells, in contrast to our previous report on the lack of accumulation of PI 3-kinase products in nontransformed NIH 3T3 fibroblasts that express p210 BCR/abl. Transformed cells also have increased PI 3-kinase activity in total cell extracts and membrane fractions. Activation of PI 3-kinase occurs by occupancy of SH2 domains of PI 3-kinase regulatory subunit, p85, by phosphorylated YXXM motifs. Therefore, we investigated whether BCR/abl binds to p85 and whether this binding is mediated by interaction of p85 SH2 domains with YXXM motif of BCR/abl. Association of p210 BCR/abl with p85 in immune complexes and with p85 SH2 domains was evident in hematopoietic cells that express the wt p210 BCR/abl. However, the binding of BCR/abl to p85 SH2 domains was abolished in cells expressing mutant, temperature-sensitive (ts) p210 BCR/abl in which the tyrosine in the YXXM motif of p210 BCR/abl was replaced by histidine. Despite lack of direct interaction with p85 SH2 domains, expression of ts p210 BCR/abl resulted in rapid, time-dependent activation of total and membrane-associated PI 3-kinase and increased PI 3-kinase activity in anti-P-tyr and anti-abl immunoprecipitates. These data suggest that BCR/abl-induced activation of PI 3-kinase in hematopoietic cells does not require binding of p85 SH2 domains to BCR/abl gene product and involves interaction with other tyrosine phosphorylated intermediate proteins.","['Jain, S K', 'Susa, M', 'Keeler, M L', 'Carlesso, N', 'Druker, B', 'Varticovski, L']","['Jain SK', 'Susa M', 'Keeler ML', 'Carlesso N', 'Druker B', 'Varticovski L']","[""Department of Biomedical Research, St Elizabeth's Medical Center, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, MA 02135, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Fibroblasts/enzymology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', '*src Homology Domains']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)63505-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Sep 1;88(5):1542-50.,"['CA01422/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA53094/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We screened a mouse genomic library with rat Met-ase-1 cDNA, and obtained bacteriophage clones that contained the mouse Met-ase-1 gene. The mouse Met-ase-1 gene comprises five exons spanning approximately 5.2 kilobases (kb) and exhibits a similar structural organization to its rat homologue and a family of neutrophil elastase-like serine proteases. Mouse Met-ase-1 mRNA was only detected in total cellular and poly A mRNA of mouse CD3(-) GM1(+) large granular lymphocytes derived from splenocytes stimulated with IL-2 and the mouse NK1.1(+) cell line 4 - 16. Spleen T-cell populations generated by Concanavalin A stimulation and a number of mouse pre-NK and T cell lines did not express mouse Met-ase-1 mRNA. The 5' flanking region of the mouse Met-ase-1 gene also shares considerable regions of identity with the 5' flanking region of the rat Met-ase-1 gene. A 3.3 kb segment of 5' sequence flanking the mouse Met-ase-1 gene was inserted upstream of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene and this construct transiently transfected into a variety of mouse and rat large granular lymphocyte leukemia and T-cell lines. The transcriptional activity of the mouse Met-ase-1 5' flanking region was significant in the RNK-16 large granular lymphocyte leukemia, strongest in the 4 - 16 mouse NK1.1(+) cell line, and weak in several mouse pre-NK cell lines. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of mouse large granular lymphocyte mRNA was used to derive the full-length coding sequence for mouse Met-ase-1. The predicted hexapropeptide of mouse Met-ase-1 (Asn-6 to Gln-1), was deleted by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis to enable expression of active mouse Met-ase-1 in mammalian COS-7 cells.

There were differences among the cells used here in the effect of ascorbate on growth, and also in the concentrations of ascorbate required to lower cell viabilities. This indicates that different cell species have varying sensitivities to ascorbate in medium. On the other hand, cells such as HL-60, which showed growth inhibition at higher concentrations of ascorbate in medium among observed cells, were damaged by the exposure to higher concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Furthermore, there was a positive correlation between the activity of catalase in cells that decomposed H2O2 and the concentration of ascorbate required to lower cell viability (p < 0.01).

During earlier investigation of SM pools hydrolyzed in the SM cycle, we examined the effects of the fungal macrolide brefeldin A (BFA) on cellular levels of SM in HL-60 leukemia cells. We found that BFA induced up to 20-25% hydrolysis of SM. Here we show that this BFA-sensitive SM pool corresponds to the pool of SM hydrolyzed by a previously discovered activator of the SM cycle, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. BFA was also able to induce the biological end points of SM cycle activation: growth inhibition and differentiation. Reciprocally, ceramide inhibited the secretion of 35S-labeled proteins from HL-60 cells and induced a subset of effects of BFA on organelle morphology. Since a ceramide-activated protein phosphatase has been previously suggested as a direct in vitro target of ceramide action, the effects of modulators of protein kinases and phosphatases were examined. Okadaic acid enhanced protein secretion and was able to oppose the effects of both ceramide and BFA on organelle morphology. Dioctanoylglycerol and phorbol myristate acetate, known activators of protein kinase C, were also found to oppose the inhibitory actions of ceramide on secretion. These studies identify BFA as an activator of the SM cycle, with ceramide as a potential mediator of some of the effects of BFA. Additionally, taken with the effects of the PKC activators, these studies suggest that constitutive protein secretion is not a default pathway but is subject to regulation by processes of signal transduction.","['Linardic, C M', 'Jayadev, S', 'Hannun, Y A']","['Linardic CM', 'Jayadev S', 'Hannun YA']","['Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell Growth Differ,Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9100024,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Cyclopentanes)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Sphingomyelins)', '1W21G5Q4N2 (Okadaic Acid)', '20350-15-6 (Brefeldin A)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)']",IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antifungal Agents/*pharmacology', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Brefeldin A', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Ceramides/*physiology', 'Cyclopentanes/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Macrolides', 'Okadaic Acid/pharmacology', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Sphingomyelins/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Growth Differ. 1996 Jun;7(6):765-74.,['GM43825/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Accumulated doses of cyclophosphamide, procarbazine, doxorubicin, mitoxantrone, and etoposide were 18,300 mg, 3000 mg, 580 mg, 100 mg, and 4150 mg, respectively, which had been administered for the treatment of NHL. Myeloblasts in the peripheral blood increased 43 months after the onset of NHL. He was diagnosed as having AML (M2; FAB classification). The karyotype of the bone marrow cells in the present case contained the following abnormalities: t(2;21)(q21;q22), t(8;21)(q22;q22), and add(13)(q34). In the present case, 645 base pairs of chimeric mRNA were detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, indicating the presence of AML1/MTG8 rearrangement. Translocation (2;21)(q21;q22) has not been described previously to our knowledge. It is interesting that the breakpoint of 21q22 existed both in t(2;21) and t(8;21). The disrupted AML1 gene resulting from two 21q22 rearrangements may be involved in the pathogenesis of AML in the present case. The clinical importance of therapy-related AML having the 21q22 rearrangement remains to be examined.","['Izumi, T', 'Ohtsuki, T', 'Ohya, K', 'Ogawa, Y', 'Yoshida, M', 'Muroi, K', 'Imagawa, S', 'Hatake, K', 'Kuriki, K', 'Saito, K', 'Miura, Y']","['Izumi T', 'Ohtsuki T', 'Ohya K', 'Ogawa Y', 'Yoshida M', 'Muroi K', 'Imagawa S', 'Hatake K', 'Kuriki K', 'Saito K', 'Miura Y']","['Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical School, Tochigi-Ken, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '35S93Y190K (Procarbazine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '74KXF8I502 (Aclarubicin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'CAOP protocol', 'CHOP protocol', 'COP-BLAM protocol', 'MCOP protocol']",IM,"['Aclarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects', 'Bleomycin/administration & dosage', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/genetics/*ultrastructure', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/chemically induced/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/chemically induced/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prednisolone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Procarbazine/administration & dosage', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165460896000441 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-4608(96)00044-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1996 Aug;90(1):45-8. doi: 10.1016/0165-4608(96)00044-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A graft-versus-leukemia effect mediated by immunocompetent donor T cells underlies its success. In acute leukemia, however, the effect of this adoptive cellular immunotherapy has not been established, and the results are generally poor. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Five patients, three with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and two with acute myelocytic leukemia, who relapsed within 6 months after allogeneic marrow transplantation were enrolled in a nonrandomized pilot study to receive donor PBBC cell transfusions either before or after undergoing cytoreductive chemotherapy. ABO genotyping and polymerase chain reaction amplification of human tetrameric short tandem repeats DNA typing were used to test for marrow chimerism. RESULTS: Two acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients-both of whom underwent chemotherapy before PBBC cell transfusions, experienced a complete remission, and developed acute and then chronic, extensive graft-versus-host disease-have been leukemia-free for 9 and 7 months, respectively. Repeated molecular studies of their marrow as early as 2 weeks to 8 months after treatment confirmed that the marrow was of donor origin. The other three patients, who chose not to undergo chemotherapy before PBBC cell transfusions, failed to achieve remission and died 14, 16, and 30 days, respectively, after leukemia relapse. CONCLUSION: Adoptive cellular immunotherapy may be effective for acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients in relapse after bone marrow transplantation if chemotherapy is administered before PBBC cell transfusions are initiated.","['Tzeng, C H', 'Lin, J S', 'Lee, J C', 'Yung, C H', 'Hu, H Y', 'Chen, P M']","['Tzeng CH', 'Lin JS', 'Lee JC', 'Yung CH', 'Hu HY', 'Chen PM']","['Department of Medicine, Veterans General Hospital-Taipei, Taiwan, Republic of China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Base Sequence', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', '*Leukocyte Transfusion', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Recurrence', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1537-2995.1996.36896374371.x [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 1996 Aug;36(8):685-90. doi: 10.1046/j.1537-2995.1996.36896374371.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From May 1984 through May 1987, the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) conducted a randomized trial that showed that induction chemotherapy before radiation therapy improved survival during the first 3 years of follow-up. PURPOSE: This report provides data for 7 years of follow-up of patients enrolled in the CALGB trial. METHODS: The patient population consisted of individuals who had clinical or surgical stage III, histologically documented NSCLC; a CALGB performance status of 0-1; less than 5% loss of body weight in the 3 months preceding diagnosis; and radiographically visible disease. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either 1) cisplatin (100 mg/m2 body surface area intravenously on days 1 and 29) and vinblastine (5 mg/m2 body surface area intravenously weekly on days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29) followed by radiation therapy with 6000 cGy given in 30 fractions beginning on day 50 (CT-RT group) or 2) radiation therapy with 6000 cGy alone beginning on day 1 (RT group) for a maximum duration of 6-7 weeks. Patients were evaluated for tumor regression if they had measurable or evaluable disease and were monitored for toxic effects, disease progression, and date of death. RESULTS: There were 78 eligible patients randomly assigned to the CT-RT group and 77 randomly assigned to the RT group. Both groups were similar in terms of sex, age, histologic cell type, performance status, substage of disease, and whether staging had been clinical or surgical. All patients had measurable or evaluable disease at the time of random assignment to treatment groups. Both groups received a similar quantity and quality of radiation therapy. As previously reported, the rate of tumor response, as determined radiographically, was 56% for the CT-RT group and 43% for the RT group (P = .092). After more than 7 years of follow-up, the median survival remains greater for the CT-RT group (13.7 months) than for the RT group (9.6 months) (P = .012) as ascertained by the logrank test (two-sided). The percentages of patients surviving after years 1 through 7 were 54, 26, 24, 19, 17, 13, and 13 for the CT-RT group and 40, 13, 10, 7, 6, 6, and 6 for the RT group. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term follow-up confirms that patients with stage III NSCLC who receive 5 weeks of chemotherapy with cisplatin and vinblastine before radiation therapy have a 4.1-month increase in median survival. The use of sequential chemotherapy-radiotherapy increases the projected proportion of 5-year survivors by a factor of 2.8 compared with that of radiotherapy alone. However, inasmuch as 80%-85% of such patients still die within 5 years and because treatment failure occurs both in the irradiated field and at distant sites in patients receiving either sequential chemotherapy-radiotherapy or radiotherapy alone, the need for further improvements in both the local and systemic treatment of this disease persists.","['Dillman, R O', 'Herndon, J', 'Seagren, S L', 'Eaton, W L Jr', 'Green, M R']","['Dillman RO', 'Herndon J', 'Seagren SL', 'Eaton WL Jr', 'Green MR']","['Hoag Cancer Center, Newport Beach, CA 92663, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Radiation-Sensitizing Agents)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/drug therapy/*mortality/pathology/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy/*mortality/pathology/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Radiation-Sensitizing Agents/administration & dosage', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Radiotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vinblastine/administration & dosage']",1996/09/04 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1996/09/04 00:00'],"['1996/09/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1996/09/04 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/88.17.1210 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1996 Sep 4;88(17):1210-5. doi: 10.1093/jnci/88.17.1210.,,,,['J Natl Cancer Inst. 1996 Sep 4;88(17):1175-7.

It is postulated that leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), the downstream intermediate of several IL-1-induced neuroimmune interactions, mediates IL-1 beta-induced suppression of acetylcholine release from rat jejunum. METHODS: Preparations were preloaded with [3H]choline, and [3H]-acetylcholine release was induced by either electrical field stimulation or by 50 mmol/L KCl. Cytokines and anti-LIF antibodies were added to the preincubation media or to the superfusate before stimulation. RESULTS: Human recombinant LIF had no immediate effects, but preincubation with the cytokine induced a concentration-dependent (2-100 ng/mL) and reversible suppression of acetylcholine release from rat longitudinal muscle myenteric plexus. The effects of human recombinant LIF on acetylcholine release were reversed by anti-human recombinant LIF-neutralizing antibody. Human recombinant IL-1 beta (10 ng/mL) induced a similar suppression of acetylcholine release, and the addition of anti-rat LIF antibody abolished the effects of exogenous IL-1 on acetylcholine release.

Expression of this enzyme has been demonstrated to increase rapidly at the end of the S to G2/M phase and decrease after the completion of mitosis. We immunolocalized topo II in specimens of both normal and neoplastic human gastric mucosas to evaluate expression of this enzyme. Three different antibodies were used for the immunostaining of topo II (anti-topo II alpha isoform, anti-topo II beta isoform and anti-topo II alpha and -beta isoforms). There were no significant differences in topo II labeling index (LI) between frozen and paraffin-embedded tissue sections obtained from the same cases. Topo II LI was significantly correlated with Ki67 LI in all of the specimens examined. The area of cells positive for Topo II was much narrower than that of Ki67 in the normal gastric glands, and the pattern of Topo II immunolocalization in both adenomas and adenocarcinomas was also essentially the same as that of Ki67. The topo II LI values (positive cells/1000 cells) for normal gastric gland, adenoma, intestinal-type adenocarcinoma, and diffuse-type adenocarcinoma were 114.7 +/- 2.2, 266.7 +/- 18.8, 277.6 +/- 19.2, and 324.5 +/- 5.3, respectively. Significant differences in topo II LI and topo II/Ki67 index were observed between normal and neoplastic mucosas (P < 0.0001) and between adenomas or intestinal-type adenocarcinoma and diffuse-type adenocarcinoma (P < 0.001 and P < 0.01, respectively). Simultaneous measurement of topo II alpha and nuclear DNA content by two-parameter flow cytometry revealed that the Jurkat cell line established from acute lymphocytic leukemia cells expressed the enzyme in cells at other than S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle whereas topo-II alpha-positive cells were predominantly observed in S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle in the cells from normal lymph nodes. These findings suggest that dys-regulation or qualitative changes of topo II alpha expression are associated with malignancy. Topo II immunostaining can thus detect proliferating cells in routinely processed tissue sections and can indicate the altered topo II alpha expression in human cancers, which may be related to the sensitivity to topo-II-targeted chemotherapeutic agents.","['Yabuki, N', 'Sasano, H', 'Kato, K', 'Ohara, S', 'Toyota, T', 'Nagura, H', 'Miyaike, M', 'Nozaki, N', 'Kikuchi, A']","['Yabuki N', 'Sasano H', 'Kato K', 'Ohara S', 'Toyota T', 'Nagura H', 'Miyaike M', 'Nozaki N', 'Kikuchi A']","['Department of Pathology, Tohoku University School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Ki-67 Antigen)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*enzymology/pathology', 'Adenoma/*enzymology/pathology', 'Aged', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/immunology/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Ki-67 Antigen', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'Nuclear Proteins/analysis', 'Stomach/enzymology', 'Stomach Neoplasms/*enzymology/pathology']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am J Pathol. 1996 Sep;149(3):997-1007.,,,,['Am J Pathol. 1997 Jul;151(1):313.

Thus, the foremost techniques for estimating apoptosis are based on biochemical, electrophoretic, or flow cytometry analysis of nuclear DNA. However, apoptosis is also associated with a chain of morphologic changes in the nuclear and cytoplasmic structures that are easily recognizable using light microscopy. We suggest that changes in morphology of cells undergoing apoptosis might cause characteristic changes in their optical properties. It follows that continuous measuring of the OD of cells undergoing apoptosis would enable the study of the kinetics of cell death. We recently described an automated microculture kinetic (MiCK) assay that provides multiple OD measurements in nondisrupted cell cultures. In the present study the MiCK assay was employed to follow OD changes in HL-60 and OCI/AML-3 myelogenous leukemia cells and murine thymocytes exposed to ethanol, hydrogen peroxide, etoposide, cisplatin, doxorubicin, or hyperthermia; i.e., divers stimuli known to induce cell death via apoptosis or necrosis. The MiCK assay revealed prominent differences between the optical properties of the cells undergoing the two different modes of death. Plotting the OD data accumulated during the assay period against time betrayed characteristic patterns of either ""apoptotic"" or ""necrotic"" OD curves. The best fit slope of the indicative of apoptosis steep rising component of the apoptotic curve, correlated directly with the percentage of morphologically apoptotic cells in the culture. Criteria for graphical estimate of apoptosis were suggested and used to study apoptosis induced in HL-60 cells by the chemotherapy compounds etoposide and cisplatin. The MiCK assay demonstrated markedly varying time courses of the cell apoptotic response to these two drugs. In both cases, however, the time of graphically predicted peaks of apoptosis correlated with the time of morphologically and electrophoretically recognized peaks of apoptosis. Adaptability of the MiCK assay to a 96-well microplate format opens the way for large-scale studying of cell apoptotic response to various stimuli. An important technical advantage of the automated MiCK assay of apoptosis is that it does not require additional laboratory procedures after microcultures are initiated.","['Kravtsov, V D', 'Fabian, I']","['Kravtsov VD', 'Fabian I']","['Department of Cell Biology and Histology, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Ramat Aviv, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Lab Invest,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,0376617,"['3K9958V90M (Ethanol)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Automation', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology', '*Cytological Techniques', 'DNA Damage', 'Ethanol/pharmacology', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Necrosis', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Thymus Gland/cytology']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Lab Invest. 1996 Feb;74(2):557-70.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Forty-six patients (11%) developed 47 central and three peripheral neurologic complications. The most common complications were cerebral hemorrhage (3.8%), metabolic encephalopathy (3%), and CNS infections (2%). All CNS infections occurred with allogeneic BMT. Eleven of 16 hemorrhages were subdural hematomas (69%), which were more frequent in autologous (8%) than in allogeneic (0.6%) BMT (p < 0.0001), and in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) (5%) than in the remaining leukemia patients (0.8%) (p = 0.013). Eight of 11 subdural hematomas occurred in AML patients receiving autologous BMT. When we compared patient-, disease-, and transplant-related characteristics of these patients with those without subdural hematoma, only platelet refractoriness correlated with an increased risk of subdural hematoma. The actuarial probability of developing subdural hematoma was 44% in patients with platelet-refractory disease and only 2.5% in the other patients (p < 0.0001). Ten patients with subdural hematoma did not have surgery and eight had significant clinical improvement associated with reduction or resolution of the hematoma, confirmed by CT scan in six patients. The subdural hematoma was the cause of death in only one patient. This study shows that the frequency of the different neurologic complications varies among types of BMT. Patients undergoing autologous BMT for AML with platelet refractoriness have an increased risk of subdural hematoma that may be treated with conservative measures.","['Graus, F', 'Saiz, A', 'Sierra, J', 'Arbaiza, D', 'Rovira, M', 'Carreras, E', 'Tolosa, E', 'Rozman, C']","['Graus F', 'Saiz A', 'Sierra J', 'Arbaiza D', 'Rovira M', 'Carreras E', 'Tolosa E', 'Rozman C']","['Service of Neurology, Hospital Clinic i Provincial, Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Neurology,Neurology,0401060,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Brain Diseases, Metabolic/etiology', 'Central Nervous System Diseases/etiology', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders/etiology', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Iatrogenic Disease', 'Infections/etiology', 'Leukemia/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nervous System Diseases/*etiology', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases/etiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1212/wnl.46.4.1004 [doi]'],ppublish,Neurology. 1996 Apr;46(4):1004-9. doi: 10.1212/wnl.46.4.1004.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A serine protease inhibitor TPCK and an ICE-like protease inhibitor VAD-FMK prevented etoposide, camptothecin and ara-C-induced internucleosomal DNA cleavage. Using a cell-free system, we have examined the inhibitory mechanism of these inhibitors on etoposide-induced internucleosomal DNA cleavage. We found that cell lysates prepared from etoposide-treated HL-60 cells undergoing apoptosis contain the significant activity to induce internucleosomal DNA fragmentation in isolated nuclei. On the other hand, we could not detect such activity in the cell lysates from untreated HL-60 cells. Treatment of the cell lysates with a serine protease inhibitor TPCK abrogated the DNA fragmenting activity. An ICE-like protease inhibitor VAD-FMK had no effect on this DNA fragmenting activity in vitro. However, the formation of TPCK-sensitive DNA fragmenting activity in etoposide-treated cells was blocked by the VAD-FMK. These data indicate that serine and ICE-like proteases may be involved in etoposide-induced apoptosis at the different stages, and especially a serine protease may be closely associated with the final step for induction of DNA fragmentation during apoptosis in HL-60 cells.","['Yoshida, A', 'Ueda, T', 'Nakamura, T']","['Yoshida A', 'Ueda T', 'Nakamura T']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Fukui Medical School.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.36 (Caspase 1)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 1', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/physiology', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*blood', 'Serine Endopeptidases/*physiology']",1996/07/01 00:00,2000/03/29 09:00,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/29 09:00 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 1996 Jul;37(7):552-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, there is considerable laboratory evidence from chemical, cell culture and animal studies that antioxidant vitamins and related micronutrients are able to slow, or possibly prevent the carcinogenic process. There is a good theoretical basis for these findings. Current theories for the mechanism of tumourigenesis suggest that reactive species and prooxidants promote and encourage the process whilst antioxidants are inhibitory and protective. Retinoids and folate with limited or no antioxidant activity may protect DNA in other ways. In man there is support for this role from the extraordinarily high concentrations of ascorbate and possibly alpha-tocopherol at sites where oxidant stress is likely to be most intense, with loss of such antioxidant protection in some conditions which predispose to malignancy. There is also impressive epidemiological agreement, particularly from observational studies, where the lowest fruit and vegetable intake has been consistently associated with increased risk of cancer, especially of the lung and gastrointestinal tract, but much less evidence that such low intakes can encourage the development of cancers which are under hormonal control. Where individual micronutrients have been considered, beta-carotene appears to have the strongest protective effect followed by vitamin C and vitamin E. Whilst the experimental studies have suggested a role for retinoids, this has not been confirmed by the observational studies. Unfortunately, with the exception of oral leukoplakia, studies investigating reversal of premalignant conditions have been disappointing, and two intervention studies aimed at prevention in large populations have produced conflicting results. All this begs the question as to what dietary advice or intervention, if any, should be provided prior to the publication of the many randomized intervention studies that are presently investigating the role of micronutrients in cancer prevention. Gey [73] has produced recommendations for minimum blood concentrations and intakes of antioxidant micronutrients.

It was hypothesised that tuberculous lung destruction is mediated, at least in part, by the participation of matrix metalloproteinases released by mononuclear phagocytes. METHODS: Cells of the myelomonocytic leukaemia cell line THP-1 were incubated with lipoarabinomannan (LAM), the major antigenic cell wall component, and with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and analysed by Northern blot analysis. Two patients with active cavitary tuberculosis also underwent bronchoalveolar lavage and the cells were analysed by Northern blotting. RESULTS: Incubation of THP-1 cells with LAM resulted in the stimulated release of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), a 92 kDa gelatinase, by 24 hours in a dose-dependent fashion. In addition, Northern analysis revealed that LAM upregulated the gene for MMP-9 by 24 hours, but not the gene for the 72 kDa gelatinase MMP-2. Heat killed M tuberculosis H37Ra also upregulated the MMP-9 gene. Bronchoalveolar lavage of the two patients with active cavitary tuberculosis showed striking upregulation of the MMP-9 gene compared with a normal control using Northern analysis. LAM also upregulated the type I interstitial collagenase (MMP-1) gene by 24 hours in both THP-1 cells and peripheral blood monocytes. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that M tuberculosis and its major cell antigenic component, LAM, stimulate the release of MMP-9 and upregulate the expression of genes for MMP-1 and MMP-9. It is possible that M tuberculosis and its components contribute directly to cavity formation by their ability to stimulate macrophages to release matrix metallo-proteinases that digest collagens I-IV, and indirectly by stimulating the release of the cytokines interleukin 1 beta and tumour necrosis factor alpha that induce fibroblasts to amplify the release of matrix metalloproteinases.","['Chang, J C', 'Wysocki, A', 'Tchou-Wong, K M', 'Moskowitz, N', 'Zhang, Y', 'Rom, W N']","['Chang JC', 'Wysocki A', 'Tchou-Wong KM', 'Moskowitz N', 'Zhang Y', 'Rom WN']","['Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, New York University Medical Center, NY 10016, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Thorax,Thorax,0417353,"['0 (Antigens, Bacterial)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (lipoarabinomannan)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Collagenases)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Metalloendopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)', 'EC 3.4.24.7 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 1)']",IM,"['Antigens, Bacterial/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Line', 'Collagenases/metabolism', 'Extracellular Matrix/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*pharmacology', 'Lung/microbiology', 'Macrophages/*immunology/metabolism', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 1', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9', 'Metalloendopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis/*pathogenicity', 'Tuberculosis, Pulmonary/metabolism/pathology']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/thx.51.3.306 [doi]'],ppublish,Thorax. 1996 Mar;51(3):306-11. doi: 10.1136/thx.51.3.306.,"['AI 32233/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-51494/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'NR 03212/NR/NINR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,PMC1090645,,,,,,,

An observational study is reported of the hospital environment associated with an outbreak of aspergillosis in a paediatric oncology ward. METHODS: All cases of aspergillosis were identified from the hospital records and categorised as definite or probable according to the extent of supportive clinical and laboratory findings. All relevant aspects of building ventilation, air filtration, and aerosol generation considered relevant were examined and air samples for fungi were taken in triplicate at 25 sites using a slit sampler with appropriate culture media. RESULTS: Six cases of aspergillosis were identified over one year out of the 148 patients who attended the unit - the only part of the hospital where cases were found. Examination of the building services and function suggested that the cause or source was isolated to this paediatric oncology/haematology ward and may have been attributed to a defective disposal conduit door as well as the dispersal of a contaminated aerosol from the ward vacuum cleaner which had the highest measured concentrations of Aspergillus fumigatus in or around the building (65 colony forming units (cfu)/m3 compared with 0-6 cfu/m3 elsewhere). No further cases were identified in the two years after these hygiene arrangements were changed. CONCLUSIONS: The investigation of this outbreak of nosocomial aspergillosis identified several possible sources of fungally contaminated aerosol which could have been implicated as the cause. Their modification was followed by a reduction in the incidence of further cases. Each should be incorporated as an issue of importance in hospital building design and hygiene.","['Anderson, K', 'Morris, G', 'Kennedy, H', 'Croall, J', 'Michie, J', 'Richardson, M D', 'Gibson, B']","['Anderson K', 'Morris G', 'Kennedy H', 'Croall J', 'Michie J', 'Richardson MD', 'Gibson B']","['Department of Respiratory Medicine, Western Infirmary, Glasgow.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Thorax,Thorax,0417353,,IM,"['Air Pollution, Indoor', 'Aspergillosis/complications/*transmission', '*Aspergillus fumigatus', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Environmental Exposure', 'Hematology', 'Hospital Departments', '*Hospital Design and Construction', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Infant', 'Oncology Service, Hospital', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications', 'Ventilation']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/thx.51.3.256 [doi]'],ppublish,Thorax. 1996 Mar;51(3):256-61. doi: 10.1136/thx.51.3.256.,,,,,,,PMC1090635,,,,,,,

This work is aimed to analyse the effect of IL-3, GM-CSF and G-CSF on the proliferative and self-replication capabilities of AML cells and to correlate such response with the morphological and immunological characteristics of the blast cells. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Mononucleated cells from the peripheral blood of 26 AML patients were incubated in liquid medium without serum in presence of IL-3 and GM-CSF alone and in combination with G-CSF. Cell proliferation was evaluated by determination of the increase in the number of cells harvested after incubation with the HGF. The proliferative response was studied in 8 cases by flow cytometry analysis of the cell cycle (number of cells in S-phase). The capability of IL-3 and GM-CSF to induce self-replication of the leukaemic clonogenic cell (CFU-L) was analysed in 9 cases by techniques of replanting on semi-solid medium. RESULTS: Cell proliferation was induced with IL-3 in more cases than with GM-CSF (50% vs 28%); furthermore, the stimulus induced by IL-3 was also more evident, as the number of cells harvested was greater than that corresponding to GM-CSF (2.1 +/- 1.1 x 10(6) cell/mL vs 1.4 +/- 1.4 x 10(6) cells/mL, p = 0.10). Although no clear correlation was seen between the proliferative response to HGF and the immunologic or morphologic subtype of the blast cells, no response to GM-CSF was detected in those cases classified as M2 nor in the CD15-positive leukaemias. A synergistic effect of G-CSF and IL-3 or GM-CSF was found in only 20% of the cases. Both IL-3 and GM-CSF augmented the number of cells in S phase in all the cases analysed; this increase was higher in M1 and M2 with respect to the leukaemias with monocytic component. CONCLUSIONS: IL-3 and GM-CSF induced self-replication of CFU-L in a half of the cases. This effect was not dependent upon the kind of stimulating agent used (IL-3 or GM-CSF), and appeared unrelated to the morphologic or immunologic characteristics of the leukaemia.","['Almeida, J', 'del Canizo, M C', 'Vidriales, B', 'Hernandez, M D', 'Galende, J', 'San Miguel, J']","['Almeida J', 'del Canizo MC', 'Vidriales B', 'Hernandez MD', 'Galende J', 'San Miguel J']","['Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca.']",['spa'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Spain,Sangre (Barc),Sangre,0404373,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Drug Synergism', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/classification/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Sangre (Barc). 1996 Feb;41(1):3-8.,,,,,,,,Accion de algunos factores de crecimiento hematopoyeticos sobre los blastos de leucemia aguda mieloblastica.,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The present work studies the behaviour of CFU-GM from PB in 47 patients subjected to conventional chemotherapy with the following diagnoses: non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL): 16; Hodgkin's disease (HD): 8; multiple myeloma (MM): 5; acute leukaemia (AL): 8; solid tumor (ST): 10. A total of 57 studies was performed. As controls, 51 samples of PB from healthy subjects were used. Cultures were made in semisolid medium (methylcellulose), using PHA-LCM as stimulant, evaluating the growth of clusters (cl) and colonies (col) on days 7 and 14. RESULTS: Our findings show that in the overall series of patients the number of clusters from days 7 and 14 and of colonies-7--that is the most differentiated progenitor cells--were decreased with respect to the controls while colonies-14 were slightly increased. When the patients were separated by diagnostic groups, the col-14 were found to be increased in ST (p = 0.03) and in AL; in NHL col-14 were the same as in the controls. In the patients with HD all progenitor cells, including col-14 were much lower than the control values (p = 0.005). In order to determine whether the kind or the amount of chemotherapy received might affect these progenitor cells, we have analyzed the cases of NHL, 11 patients treated with moderate chemotherapy versus 12 patients receiving intensive chemotherapy: a stronger degree of growth in the latter, although with no significant differences. On comparing the cases that had received little previous chemotherapy (< 5 courses) against those who had received more than 5 courses growth was seen to be stronger in the patients who had received the fewest courses (p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the HPC from PB are scanty in certain diseases, such as HD and that in all lymphomas the collection of these cells for transplantation purposes should be performed before they have damaged by an excessive number of chemotherapy courses.","['Nieto, M J', 'Canizo, C', 'Corral, M', 'Almeida, J', 'San Miguel, J']","['Nieto MJ', 'Canizo C', 'Corral M', 'Almeida J', 'San Miguel J']","['Hospital Universitario, Salamanca, Espana.']",['spa'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Spain,Sangre (Barc),Sangre,0404373,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Blood Cell Count/*drug effects', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects/pathology', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Hodgkin Disease/blood/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/blood/drug therapy', 'Multiple Myeloma/blood/drug therapy', 'Neoplasms/blood/drug therapy']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Sangre (Barc). 1996 Feb;41(1):29-35.,,,,,,,,Efecto de la quimioterapia sobre las celulas progenitoras hematopoyeticas de sangre periferica.,,,,,,

Bioassays have demonstrated that oral snuff induces cancer of the oral cavity of rats, that the major carcinogens in snuff are NNN and NNK and that swabbing of the mouth with a solution containing NNN and NNK induces tumors in rats at the site of application. Biochemical studies are currently underway to provide further documentation that oral snuff is a carcinogen in humans. The major leukemogenic agent in cigarette smoke is benzene. Biomarker studies with t,t-MA, a urinary metabolite of benzene, have shown significantly higher uptake of benzene by smokers than by nonsmokers and benzene uptake by smokers of the order found in the urine of workers with low occupational exposure to benzene. These studies are being continued. Laboratory studies have supported the concept that smokers of low-yield cigarettes are more likely to have higher risk for lung adenocarcinoma than smokers of high-yield cigarettes who were more likely to develop squamous cell carcinoma. Smokers of low-yield cigarettes smoke more intensely and inhale more deeply to satisfy a need for nicotine. These changes in smoking patterns lead to relatively greater exposure of the bronchioalveolar regions and smaller bronchi to lung carcinogens, some of which have organ specificity and may well be responsible for induction of adenoma or adenocarcinoma of the peripheral lung. Biomarker studies are in progress to verify this hypothesis.","['Hoffmann, D', 'Melikian, A A', 'Wynder, E L']","['Hoffmann D', 'Melikian AA', 'Wynder EL']","['Naylor Dana Institute for Disease Prevention, American Health Foundation, Valhalla, New York 10595, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Prev Med,Preventive medicine,0322116,"['0 (Carcinogens, Environmental)', '0 (Nitrosamines)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)', ""X656TZ86DX (N'-nitrosonornicotine)""]",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/chemically induced/prevention & control', 'Animals', 'Benzene/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Carcinogens, Environmental/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/prevention & control', 'Lung Neoplasms/chemically induced/prevention & control', 'Mouth Neoplasms/chemically induced', 'Neoplasms/*chemically induced/prevention & control', 'Nitrosamines/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Plants, Toxic', 'Smoking/adverse effects', 'Tobacco, Smokeless/adverse effects']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0091-7435(96)90007-9 [pii]', '10.1006/pmed.1996.0007 [doi]']",ppublish,Prev Med. 1996 Jan-Feb;25(1):14-22. doi: 10.1006/pmed.1996.0007.,"['CA-29580/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-32617/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",85,,,,,,,,,,,,

We also sought evidence of a distinct viral species in the lesions by amplifying, cloning and sequencing the env genes from tissues sections in which there were pathological changes. We did not find changes in the env gene that correlated with HTLV-I-associated neurological disease vs adult T cell leukemia or with the nervous system vs peripheral blood and lymphoid organs. We did, however, find evidence of extensive mutation and possibly deletions in the env gene in HTLV-I-associated neurological disease.

The Institute of Naval Medicine therefore reviewed the submariner's occupational exposure history to benzene with a view to determining whether this had been a causative agent in the development of the disease. Past atmosphere patrol reports taken from the submarines on which the submariner served were scrutinised to determine the maximum and median weighted levels of benzene to which he was exposed over the 13 year period. These were 830 micrograms m/m3 and 189 micrograms m/m3 respectively. To determine what increased risk, if any, is associated with the submariner's exposure to benzene at these levels it was necessary to compare the data with the results obtained from epidemiological studies of workers exposed to benzene in various industries. Industrial epidemiological studies have proved statistically that benzene induces leukaemia above occupational exposure levels of 16 mg/m3 (5ppm). Below this level there is no statistical evidence that benzene is carcinogenic and estimates of increased risk have therefore necessitated the use of mathematical modelling. The estimated range of increased leukaemia cases due to benzene exposure is 0.5-6.6 additional cases per 1000 workers exposed over a working lifetime of 40 years (40ppm-years). The increased risk to the submariner using the median submarine benzene levels was calculated to be 0.02-0.3 additional cases (of all types of leukaemia) per 1000 submariners. The increased risk of developing the rare Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia from benzene exposure in submarines is considered to be extremely small.","['Dean, M R']",['Dean MR'],,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,J R Nav Med Serv,Journal of the Royal Naval Medical Service,7503111,"['0 (Carcinogens)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Benzene/*adverse effects', 'Carcinogens/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*chemically induced', 'Male', '*Military Personnel', 'Occupational Diseases/*chemically induced', 'Occupational Exposure/adverse effects', 'Submarine Medicine']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J R Nav Med Serv. 1996 Spring;82(1):28-33.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Basic considerations, methodology, and summary of results.",179-85,"In two municipalities in Lower Saxony statistically valid clusters were observed, which attracted great public interest. Committees were set up to initiate a large variety of on-the-spot-investigations. Finally, it was decided to conduct a case control study throughout Lower Saxony to explore potential risk factors which might explain the observed clusters. A limited number of already established and currently discussed hypotheses was chosen for investigation. The study was based on patients registrated at the German Children's Cancer Registry (GCCR). For each child with leukemia diseased between 1988 and 1993 two population-based controls (local and state controls) and one tumour control were selected. Data were collected by means of a questionnaire self-administered by the parents and a telephone interview. In addition, measurements of electromagnetic fields and radon were performed and inspections of the child's birth record were made for the purpose of confirming a potential association between parenteral vitamin K prophylaxis and leukemia or tumours. This paper presents the concept and basic considerations of the study, its design and statistical evaluation. Response rates and a summary of results will be presented, too. The paper will serve as a reference for subsequent publications about more detailed analyses of specific potential risk factors. 425 parents of diseased children and 610 of non-diseased children were asked for participation. The rates of response were 82% for families with diseased and 71% for families with non-diseased children. In total, 781 parents participated in the study. The most important results are as follows: The Greaves' hypothesis (9, 10) was supported by the following results: In children diseased with leukemia, vaccinations were less frequent, virus-related infections occurred more rarely, these children were more frequently first-born children and more frequently breast-feed, and they possibly had fewer contacts with other children in infancy. Our data do not show a significant association between parenteral vitamin K prophylaxis and leukemia or tumours (17). Measurements of electromagnetic fields show a weak association between high-level exposure and an increased risk of developing leukemias. Children who were X-rayed more than four times or were born prematurely and had received intensive care treatment show a positive association with occurrence of leukemia, but the number of these patients was very small and these factors are not independent. The only potential job-related hazard was paternal exposure to plastic and resin fumes. The incidence of miscarriages and abortions was increased in mothers of children with leukemia. Our study did not confirm the hypotheses, that leukemia is associated with gestational age, with consumption of alcohol, nicotine, and medicaments during pregnancy. Nor was any association detected with exposure to wood preservatives and insecticides or with a high socio-economic status. The number of patients living in municipalities with increased incidence of leukemia was too small to show statistically valid results. However, it is noteworthy that some of the above-mentioned risk factors were observed also in these children. One of the purposes of a nation-wide case control study which is currently performed at the GCCR is to validate and complete these results.","['Kaatsch, P', 'Kaletsch, U', 'Krummenauer, F', 'Meinert, R', 'Miesner, A', 'Haaf, G', 'Michaelis, J']","['Kaatsch P', 'Kaletsch U', 'Krummenauer F', 'Meinert R', 'Miesner A', 'Haaf G', 'Michaelis J']","['Institut fur Medizinische Statistik, Universitat, Mainz.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,['12001-79-5 (Vitamin K)'],IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Environmental Exposure/adverse effects/*statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Germany/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Risk Factors', 'Vitamin K/administration & dosage']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2008-1046470 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 1996 Jul-Aug;208(4):179-85. doi: 10.1055/s-2008-1046470.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have recently reported improving results in HLA-identical sibling transplant over the ten year period 1981-1990. In this report we described the outcome in patients transplanted at St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney between 1989 and 1993. AIMS: To determine the leukaemia-free survival, transplant-related mortality rate, and relapse rate for patients with AML or CML given HLA-identical sibling marrow transplants between 1989 and 1993. METHODS: Sixty-two patients with AML or CML received high dose busulphan/cyclophosphamide chemotherapy followed by infusion of T replete, HLA-identical sibling bone marrow. Cyclosporin/short methotrexate was utilised as prophylaxis for graft-versus-host disease, ganciclovir as prophylaxis for cytomegalovirus disease and cotrimoxazole as prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Low dose intravenous heparin was used as prophylaxis for hepatic veno-occlusive disease. RESULTS: The five year disease-free survival for patients with AML transplanted in first complete remission was 72% and for those with CML transplanted in first chronic phase was 77%. The relapse rate for AML transplanted in first complete remission was 15% and for CML in first chronic phase 0%. The transplant-related mortality for AML transplanted in first complete remission was 16% and for CML transplanted in first chronic phase 23%. In contrast, the disease-free survival, relapse rate and transplant-related mortality for patients with AML transplanted outside first complete remission and for CML transplanted beyond first chronic phase was 17%, 57% and 57% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The outcome for patients transplanted for early AML or early CML continues to improve and exceeds that obtainable by conventional therapy. The salvage rate is so low for patients transplanted in later stages of AML or CML that all patients less than 55 years of age with these diseases, who have a HLA-identical sibling donor, should be offered bone marrow transplantation early in their disease course.","['Atkinson, K', 'Downs, K', 'Dodds, A', 'Concannon, A', 'Milliken, S']","['Atkinson K', 'Downs K', 'Dodds A', 'Concannon A', 'Milliken S']","[""Department of Haematology, St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney, NSW.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Australia,Aust N Z J Med,Australian and New Zealand journal of medicine,1264322,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'HLA Antigens', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/mortality/pathology/surgery', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*mortality/pathology/*surgery', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1445-5994.1996.tb02907.x [doi]'],ppublish,Aust N Z J Med. 1996 Feb;26(1):54-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1445-5994.1996.tb02907.x.,,,,['Aust N Z J Med. 1996 Aug;26(4):570-1.

AIMS: To document the frequency and severity of Hickman catheter related adverse events and to identify predisposing factors. METHODS: A retrospective review was undertaken of 153 sequential Hickman catheters inserted into patients receiving treatment for cancer or haematological disease. All Hickman catheters were inserted percutaneously in a radiology department under local anaesthesia and fluoroscopic control. The exact position of the catheter tip was determined by reviewing post-insertion radiographs. RESULTS: The median duration of catheter use was 55 days (range one-650). Complications led to the removal of 32% of catheters. Exit site infection complicated 22% of catheters, septicaemia 7%, migration or dislodgment 7%, and venous thrombosis 8%. Complications were more common in male patients (exit site infection and catheter loss), in patients with acute leukaemia (septicaemia) and in obese patients (catheter migration). Left sided catheters caused more venous thrombosis and were more likely to malfunction or block. Left sided catheters required removal more frequently than right sided catheters. Termination of the Hickman catheter within the high superior vena cava (SVC) resulted in loss of function earlier when compared to termination with the low SVC or right atrium (RA). CONCLUSIONS: Right-sided Hickman catheters terminating in the low SVC/RA offer the best chance of durable function. The use of subcutaneously tunnelled catheters in obese patients poses unique problems with catheter migration. Vigilance in the placement and care of Hickman catheters remains essential.","['Craft, P S', 'May, J', 'Dorigo, A', 'Hoy, C', 'Plant, A']","['Craft PS', 'May J', 'Dorigo A', 'Hoy C', 'Plant A']","['Medical Oncology Department, Woden Valley Hospital, Canberra, ACT.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Australia,Aust N Z J Med,Australian and New Zealand journal of medicine,1264322,,IM,"['Catheterization, Central Venous/*adverse effects', 'Equipment Failure', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Obesity', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors', 'Thrombosis/etiology']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1445-5994.1996.tb02904.x [doi]'],ppublish,Aust N Z J Med. 1996 Feb;26(1):33-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1445-5994.1996.tb02904.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The bioavailability of both IGF-I and IGF-II is regulated by specific IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs). IGFBP-2 is the predominant binding protein during fetal life, where it is expressed in most tissues. In contrast, postnatally it is mainly released by specific cell types (hepatocytes, astroglia, kidney cells, prostate cells) and a range of tumour cell lines. Furthermore, phytohaemagglutinin stimulated normal lymphoblasts and malignant lymphoblasts express IGFBP-2. In order to investigate the IGF regulatory pathway in leukaemia serum levels of IGF-I, IGF-II, IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-3 were determined in 28 leukaemic children. Whereas serum levels of IGF-I (mean/range: -2.7/-0.1 to -6.7 SDS), IGF-II (-3.6 SDS/-1.3 to -8.7) and IGFBP-3 (-2.0/+2.2 to -7.1 SDS) were significantly decreased comparable to levels in growth hormone deficiency, IGFBP-2 levels (+4.0/-0.45 to +7.4 SDS) were found to be markedly elevated and inversely correlated to IGF-I (r = -0.51, P = 0.013). After haematological remission upon chemotherapy all four parameters had normalized in the 16 re-investigated children. Similar findings have been observed in one boy with a relapse including CNS leukaemia. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that the proliferation of malignant lymphoblasts (at diagnosis vs treatment) occurs in the presence of decreased serum levels of IGF-I, IGF-II and IGFBP-3 and that diminished production of these peptides may contribute to impaired growth. It further indicates that serum levels of IGFBP-2 may be directly related to the proliferation of lymphoblasts.","['Mohnike, K L', 'Kluba, U', 'Mittler, U', 'Aumann, V', 'Vorwerk, P', 'Blum, W F']","['Mohnike KL', 'Kluba U', 'Mittler U', 'Aumann V', 'Vorwerk P', 'Blum WF']","['Zentrum fur Kinderheilkunde, Otto-von-Guericke-Universitat Magdeburg, G']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Eur J Pediatr,European journal of pediatrics,7603873,"['0 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 2)', '0 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', '67763-97-7 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor II)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'PVDA protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/therapeutic use', 'Cell Division', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Daunorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 2/*blood', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3/*blood', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/*analysis', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor II/*analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/drug therapy/pathology', 'Prednisone/therapeutic use', 'Vincristine/therapeutic use']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02075755 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Pediatr. 1996 Feb;155(2):81-6. doi: 10.1007/BF02075755.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This correlated with previous findings that this cell line is particularly resistant to apoptosis induced by cytotoxic agents. Proteolytic cleavage of PARP and the subsequent progression to apoptosis was inhibited by two protease inhibitors NEM and IOD. As both PARP cleavage and DNA fragmentation appeared closely linked in these cell lines, anti-oxidants (previously shown to be effective inhibitors of DNA fragmentation and apoptosis) were also demonstrated to prevent PARP cleavage.

Understanding the virus life cycle, the proteins and enzymes involved in its replication, is essential for developing potent anti-viral drugs. Phosphorylation of retroviral proteins may alter their shape in such a way as to increase or inhibit their biological activities and thus influence the replication and pathogenic potential of the retroviruses. In our previous work, we demonstrated that non-cytotoxic doses of tyrphostins (protein tyrosine kinase blockers) inhibit moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MuLV) replication in acutely and chronically infected cells. In an attempt to understand their mode of action as anti-MoMuLV drugs, we examined the possibility that a viral protein is phosphorylated in tyrosine. Indeed, in our present work, we show that the p15 matrix protein (MA) of Mo-MuLV is a phosphotyrosine protein and is the only viral protein which is phosphorylated on tyrosine. Moreover, treatment of Mo-MuLV/NIH/3T3 chronically infected cells with tyrphostin AG-555 specifically inhibits the synthesis of p15 and other viral proteins but does not affect the synthesis of cellular proteins. Our results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of p15 MA protein may play a pivotal role in Mo-MuLV replication.","['Seri, I', 'Priel, E']","['Seri I', 'Priel E']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Cancer Research Center, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,FEBS Lett,FEBS letters,0155157,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Benzylidene Compounds)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Tyrphostins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (alpha-cyano-(3,4-dihydroxy)-N-(3-phenylpropyl)cinnamide)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells/virology', 'Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/pharmacology', 'Benzylidene Compounds/pharmacology', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*chemistry/drug effects', 'Nitriles/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Phosphotyrosine/immunology/metabolism', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', '*Tyrphostins', 'Viral Proteins/drug effects/immunology/*metabolism']",1996/09/02 00:00,1996/09/02 00:01,['1996/09/02 00:00'],"['1996/09/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/02 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/02 00:00 [entrez]']","['0014-5793(96)00820-4 [pii]', '10.1016/0014-5793(96)00820-4 [doi]']",ppublish,FEBS Lett. 1996 Sep 2;392(3):229-32. doi: 10.1016/0014-5793(96)00820-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 'R' regions from HTLV-1 have therefore properties similar to internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) originally found in picornavirus. The beginning of the U5 region from HTLV-1 contains a polypyrimidine sequence which is known to play an essential role in the IRES activity in picornavirus. The same experiments carried out using the 'R' region from bovine leukaemia virus (BLV) showed that this sequence has at most a weak IRES effect. One retroviruses, HTLV-1 and perhaps others contain therefore an IRES activity. Interestingly, the combined SU 'R' sequence worked efficiently with different cistrons, different promoters and in all tested cell lines, whereas the poliovirus IRES was active in CHO cells but not in the mouse mammary cell line HC11. The SU 'R' sequence may therefore preferably be used to generate active bicistronic mRNAs.","['Attal, J', 'Theron, M C', 'Taboit, F', 'Cajero-Juarez, M', 'Kann, G', 'Bolifraud, P', 'Houdebine, L M']","['Attal J', 'Theron MC', 'Taboit F', 'Cajero-Juarez M', 'Kann G', 'Bolifraud P', 'Houdebine LM']","['Unite de Differenciation Cellulaire, Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique, Jouy-en-Josas, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,FEBS Lett,FEBS letters,0155157,"['0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'CHO Cells/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cricetinae', 'Genes, Viral', 'Genetic Vectors/chemistry/genetics', 'Growth Hormone/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Luciferases/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/chemistry/genetics', 'Ribosomes/*metabolism', 'Simian virus 40/genetics', 'Transfection']",1996/09/02 00:00,1996/09/02 00:01,['1996/09/02 00:00'],"['1996/09/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/02 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/02 00:00 [entrez]']","['0014-5793(96)00815-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0014-5793(96)00815-0 [doi]']",ppublish,FEBS Lett. 1996 Sep 2;392(3):220-4. doi: 10.1016/0014-5793(96)00815-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of natural and synthetic KA-related compounds showed that the inhibitory activity was strictly related to the structural peculiarities of the molecule. In the presence of DNA as template primer the inhibition mechanism was drastically modified: HIV-1 RT activity was stimulated by low concentrations of KA and was inhibited by increasing the concentration of the compound, while Mo-MuLV and AMV activities were irreversibly inhibited by the formation of a non-reactive complex. The RNase H activities of these RTs were not affected by KA. The results of this study suggest a different mechanism of interaction of Kelletinins with HIV-1 RT compared with other non-nucleoside inhibitors.

Stimulation of formyl peptide receptors with N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMet-Leu-Phe) transiently increased the amount of alpha i subunits in the Triton X-100-insoluble cytoskeleton. Similar to the biphasic regulation of the actin content, fMet-Leu-Phe ( > or = 10 nM) rapidly increased the cytoskeletal alpha i content (about threefold at 30 s), which was followed by a rapid reversal to control levels. The formyl peptide receptor increased the cytoskeletal content of both alpha i subtypes, alpha i2 and alpha i3- present in HL-60 cells. In cells permeabilized with Staphylococcus aureus alpha-toxin, fMet-Leu-Phe increased binding of the stable GTP analogue, guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate (GTP[S]), to cytoskeletal proteins in a pertussis-toxin-sensitive manner, which was completely abolished by the F-actin-disrupting agent, cytochalasin B. Using the photoreactive GTP analogue, m-acetylanilido-GTP, the formyl peptide receptor-regulated GTP binding sites at the cytoskeleton were identified as 40-kDa proteins, the molecular size of alpha i subunits. Cytoskeleton prepared from stimulated cells did not exhibit increased GTP[S] binding, which suggests that activated alpha i subunits are translocated to the cytoskeleton. Finally, in alpha-toxin-permeabilized HL-60 cells, fMet-Leu-Phe and GTP[S] cooperatively stimulated actin polymerization. In conclusion, evidence is provided that chemoattractant receptors cause translocation of activated alpha i subunits to the cytoskeleton coincidentally with F-actin formation. The data therefore argue for a potential role of translocated alpha i subunits in the process of receptor-induced actin polymerization.","['Wieland, T', 'Meyer zu Heringdorf, D', 'Schulze, R A', 'Kaldenberg-Stasch, S', 'Jakobs, K H']","['Wieland T', 'Meyer zu Heringdorf D', 'Schulze RA', 'Kaldenberg-Stasch S', 'Jakobs KH']","['Institut fur Pharmakologie, Universitatsklinikum Essen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['0 (Bacterial Toxins)', '0 (Hemolysin Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Formyl Peptide)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Peptide)', '0 (Virulence Factors, Bordetella)', '0 (staphylococcal alpha-toxin)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Bacterial Toxins/pharmacology', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Cytoskeleton/*metabolism', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hemolysin Proteins/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/*pharmacology', 'Pertussis Toxin', 'Phagocytes/*metabolism', 'Protein Conformation', 'Receptors, Formyl Peptide', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Peptide/*metabolism', 'Virulence Factors, Bordetella/pharmacology']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1996.0752u.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1996 Aug 1;239(3):752-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1996.0752u.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As myelocytic cells differentiate towards either eosinophils or neutrophils, the profile of leukotrienes they produce upon stimulation diverges. Eosinophils produce mainly cysteinyl leukotrienes whereas neutrophils predominantly synthesize 5(S), 12(R)-dihydroxy-6,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (LTB delta). The mechanism by which this change in leukotriene composition occurs is unknown. In this study, we investigated the control of leukotriene biosynthetic enzymes during myeloid cell differentiation. Western-blot analyses of myelocytic leukemia cell lines, HL-60#7 and HL-60, differentiated towards eosinophilic or neutrophilic cell types, respectively, demonstrated that as myelocytic cells differentiate towards eosinophils or neutrophils, the protein levels of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) remain constant, whereas 5-lipoxygenase and 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP) levels are simultaneously elevated. As myelocytic cells become more eosinophil-like, 5(S)-hydroxy- 6(R)-S-glutathionyl-7,9-trans-11, 14-cis-eicosatetraenoic acid (LTC delta) synthase activity and expression of both the protein and messenger RNA in the cells are dramatically increased (approximately 75-fold), while the LTC delta synthase level and activity in neutrophil-like cells remain constant at very low levels. In contrast, in neutrophilic cells, the amount of 5,6-oxido-7,9,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (LTA delta) hydrolase was elevated approximately 100-fold greater than the increase in LTA delta hydrolase from eosinophilic cells. These results indicate that as a myeloid cell differentiates towards a granulocyte, similar mechanisms of regulation may be applied to the leukotriene biosynthetic pathway up to the point at which the pathway diverges. At the stage in the leukotriene biosynthetic pathway where LTA delta may be converted to either LTC delta or to LTB delta, specific regulators of transcription may become activated as a myelocytic cell differentiates, thereby causing increased LTA delta hydrolase or LTC delta synthase expression.","['Scoggan, K A', 'Nicholson, D W', 'Ford-Hutchinson, A W']","['Scoggan KA', 'Nicholson DW', 'Ford-Hutchinson AW']","['Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, McGill University, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['0 (5-Lipoxygenase-Activating Proteins)', '0 (ALOX5AP protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Leukotrienes)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '1HGW4DR56D (Leukotriene B4)', 'EC 1.13.11.34 (Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 3.3.2.- (Epoxide Hydrolases)', 'EC 4.4.1.20 (leukotriene-C4 synthase)', 'V38765PUZ6 (leukotriene A4 hydrolase)']",IM,"['5-Lipoxygenase-Activating Proteins', 'Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase/biosynthesis', 'Carrier Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Eosinophils/*enzymology', 'Epoxide Hydrolases/biosynthesis', 'Glutathione Transferase', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Leukotriene B4/biosynthesis', 'Leukotrienes/*biosynthesis', 'Membrane Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Neutrophils/*enzymology', 'Phenotype']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1996.0572u.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1996 Aug 1;239(3):572-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1996.0572u.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

International Society for Chemo-Immunotherapy.,79-84,"Among the purine analogs, 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (2-CDA) is particularly effective for the treatment of hairy cell leukemia and Waldemstrom's macroglobulinemia. Both efficacy and toxicity of 2-CDA were evaluated in previously treated patients affected with chronic lymphoproliferative disorders such as low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Thirty cases, mainly refractory, 16 affected with CLL, were included from six centers of the International Society for Chemo-Immunotherapy (IGCI). 2-CDA was administered in a 2 h i.v. infusion for 5-7 days at the standard dose of 0.1 mg/kg/day every 4 weeks. The median number of cycles was 3. Of 30 cases, eight (26.7%) achieved a complete remission (CR), nine (30%) a partial remission (PR), and two (6.7%) a minor response, while five cases (16.6%) did not respond, and six (20%) were considered early deaths. The overall response rate (CR + PR) was 56.7%, with a median response duration of 12 months (range 3-28 +) and a better response in CLL patients. Considering that the majority of patients were heavily pretreated, toxicity was acceptable, with 40% of cases not presenting any toxic effect. The main toxicity consisted in infectious complications. Based on the results of the present study, we confirm that 2-CDA is an effective drug in these lymphoproliferative disorders, suggesting its possible use either alone or in combination, also as first-line therapy.","['Brugiatelli, M', 'Holowiecka, B', 'Dmoszynska, A', 'Krieger, O', 'Planinc-Peraica, A', 'Labar, B', 'Callea, V', 'Morabito, F', 'Jaksic, B', 'Holowiecki, J', 'Lutz, D']","['Brugiatelli M', 'Holowiecka B', 'Dmoszynska A', 'Krieger O', 'Planinc-Peraica A', 'Labar B', 'Callea V', 'Morabito F', 'Jaksic B', 'Holowiecki J', 'Lutz D']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology Azienda Ospedaliera Bianchi-Melacrino-Morelli, Reggio Calabria, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cladribine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002770050205 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 1996 Aug;73(2):79-84. doi: 10.1007/s002770050205.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The additive effect of MGF on colony growth was observed in combination with interleukin-3 (IL-3). Preincubation of the cells with MGF in suspension did not sensitize them to the effect of IL-3, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), G-CSF, or IL-4 in a clonogenic cell culture assay.

Neither the expression of MGF nor the response of blast cells to exogenous MGF was related to the capability of the cells to form colonies spontaneously. In conclusion, MGF alone, but especially combined with IL-3, was a potent growth factor for clonogenic blast cells in AML.

Similar to their normal counterparts, transformed blood-forming cells remain dependent on signals from the hematopoiesis-regulating stromal environment for survival and proliferation. There is increasing evidence that the microenvironment may also take a more active part in the disease process. A review of the literature on stromal abnormalities in the leukemias, the myelodysplastic syndromes, and multiple myeloma reveals three principal mechanisms by which stromal derangements can contribute to the evolution of a neoplastic disease. In the simplest case, neoplastic blood-forming cells induce reversible changes in stroma function or composition which result in improved growth conditions for the malignant cells ('malignancy-induced microenvironment'). In the second setting, functionally abnormal end cells derived from the malignant clone become an integral part of the stroma system, selectively stimulating the neoplastic cells and inhibiting normal blood cell formation ('malignant microenvironment'). In the third condition, the emergence of a neoplastic cell population is the consequence of a primary stroma lesion characterized by inability to control regular blood cell formation ('malignancy-inducing microenvironment'). The perception of different stroma-related disease mechanisms may eventually lead to the development of alternative therapeutic approaches.","['Duhrsen, U', 'Hossfeld, D K']","['Duhrsen U', 'Hossfeld DK']","['Abteilung fur Onkologie und Hamatologie, Universitatskrankenhaus Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Multiple Myeloma/*pathology/therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*pathology/therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology', 'Stromal Cells/pathology']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002770050203 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 1996 Aug;73(2):53-70. doi: 10.1007/s002770050203.,,222,,,,,,,,,,,,

French Society of Haematology.,573-7,"BACKGROUND: Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare acquired disorder of haematopoietic stem cells. Although knowledge about the pathophysiology of the disease is increasing, no multivariate analysis of factors influencing survival has been undertaken, mainly because the disease is rare. We undertook such an investigation. METHODS: Data were collected on 220 patients with PNH diagnosed over a 46-year period (1950-1995) from participating French centres. Diagnosis of the disease required, at least, an unequivocally positive Ham's test. FINDINGS: The Kaplan-Meier survival estimate was 65% (SE 4) at 10 years and 48% (6) at 15 years after diagnosis. 8-year cumulative incidence rates of the main complications (pancytopenia, thrombosis, and myelodysplastic syndrome) were 15% (3), 28% (4), and 5% (2), respectively. Demographic data, presenting features, initial treatment, complications, and causes of death were similar to those previously reported. In multivariate analysis, seven factors were significantly associated with survival in patients with PNH. Poor survival was associated with the occurrence of thrombosis as a complication (relative risk 10.2 [95% CI 6-17], p < 0.0001), evolution to pancytopenia (5.5 [2.8-11], p < 0.0001), myelodysplastic syndrome or acute leukaemia (19.1 [7.3-50], p < 0.001), age over 55 years at diagnosis (4 [2.4-6.9], p < 0.0001), need for additional treatment (2.1 [1.3-3.6], p < 0.003), and thrombocytopenia at diagnosis (2.2 [1.3-3.8, p < 0.003). Better survival was shown for patients in whom aplastic anaemia antedated PNH (0.32 [0.14-0.72], p < 0.02). Factors associated in multivariate analysis with a high risk of thrombosis during the disease course were thrombosis at diagnosis (5.1 [2.5-10.6], p = 0.0002), age over 54 years (2.6 [1.5-4.6, p = 0.0014), and infection at diagnosis (2.6 [1.3-5.2], p = 0.0099). The risk factors for progression to pancytopenia were absence at diagnosis of anaemia (4.03 [1.3-12.2], p = 0.03) and neutropenia (2.45 [1.1-5.7], p = 0.03). The risk factors for development of myelodysplastic syndrome or acute leukaemia were abdominal pain crisis at presentation (10.5 [2.5-44.0], p = 0.004) and year of diagnosis after 1983 (8.45 [1.8-40.7], p = 0.004). INTERPRETATION: This large number of cases permitted a detailed analysis of prognostic factors for the first time, in this rare disease. Estimates of PNH prognostic factors may serve as baseline data in the assessment of current and future treatments for this disease.","['Socie, G', 'Mary, J Y', 'de Gramont, A', 'Rio, B', 'Leporrier, M', 'Rose, C', 'Heudier, P', 'Rochant, H', 'Cahn, J Y', 'Gluckman, E']","['Socie G', 'Mary JY', 'de Gramont A', 'Rio B', 'Leporrier M', 'Rose C', 'Heudier P', 'Rochant H', 'Cahn JY', 'Gluckman E']","[""Service d'Hematologie-Greffe de Moelle, Hopital Saint Louis, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Lancet,"Lancet (London, England)",2985213R,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/complications', 'Cause of Death', 'Child', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hemoglobinuria, Paroxysmal/complications/*mortality', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Thrombosis/complications', 'Time Factors']",1996/08/31 00:00,1996/08/31 00:01,['1996/08/31 00:00'],"['1996/08/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/31 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/31 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0140673695123601 [pii]', '10.1016/s0140-6736(95)12360-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Lancet. 1996 Aug 31;348(9027):573-7. doi: 10.1016/s0140-6736(95)12360-1.,,,,['Lancet. 1996 Aug 31;348(9027):560.

These cells can be induced to differentiate along the monocytic or granulocytic pathways with or without acquisition of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigen by various agents. Surprisingly, treatment of HL-60 cells with 10 nM all-trans retinoic acid (RA) for 7 days (HL-60-R7) resulted in a marked increase in MLC stimulation although the cells lacked detectable MHC class II antigen expression at the initiation of the MLC. In contrast, treatment with interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), with or without RA, induced MHC class II antigen expression but failed to enhance MLC stimulation. Lymphocytes responding to HL-60-R7 were predominantly CD8+ and/or CD16+ and displayed enhanced cytolytic capacity for HL-60 and HL-60-R7 cells as well as natural killer (NK)-sensitive K562 cells. Nevertheless, monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to MHC class II antigens substantially inhibited the MLC and some CD4+ lymphocytes in the responding population were required, although this requirement could be replaced by the addition of interleukin-2 (IL-2). HL-60-R7 (and HL-60) cells were shown to acquire detectable MHC class II antigen expression during the first 3 days of the MLC. Thus a low level of activation by MHC class II+ stimulator cells appears to be required for the response. Analysis of the role of cytokines with costimulatory activity for T cells and/or NK cells indicated that tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) was important in the proliferative response, while interleukins-1, -6 and -12 and stem cell factor did not seem to be involved. Cell interaction molecules lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) (CD11a), intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) (CD54), ICAM-3 (CD50) and B7.2 (CD86) were up-regulated on HL-60-R7. Blocking mAb to LFA-1 and B7.2 potently inhibited the proliferative response indicating a key role for these molecules in the enhanced immunostimulation by HL-60-R7 cells. The results may have implications for the mechanism of the therapeutic effect of RA in acute promyelocytic leukaemia and may also provide valuable information in regard to the immunogenicity of tumour cells in general.","['Geary, S M', 'Ashman, L K']","['Geary SM', 'Ashman LK']","['Leukaemia Research Unit, Hanson Centre for Cancer Research, Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science, Adelaide, SA, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (HLA-D Antigens)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytokines/immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HLA-D Antigens/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Tretinoin/*immunology/pharmacology']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2567.1996.d01-668.x [doi]'],ppublish,Immunology. 1996 Jul;88(3):428-40. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2567.1996.d01-668.x.,,,,,,,PMC1456359,,,,,,,

Multidrug resistance is the major obstacle to successful cancer chemotherapy. Circumventing multidrug resistance therefore represents a high priority for clinical anti-cancer treatment. Among many reversal strategies, antisense oligodeoxynucleotides may offer a molecular targeting tool for overcoming cellular multidrug resistance. 2. Two 17-mer phosphorothioate antisense oligomers, complementary to the 5' end of the ATG initiator codon-containing region and loop-forming site (located at nucleotides 991-1007 from the first ATG codon) in mdr-1 cDNA sequence, were synthesized. The purpose was to study their effects on the function and expression of P-glycoprotein and mdr-1 gene. 3. The results showed that 10 mumol/l antisense oligomers could significantly inhibit the growth of multidrug resistant K562/Adm cells cultured in adriamycin-containing medium. No such effect was observed for parental (sensitive) K562/S cells. Intracellular daunorubicin accumulation increased greatly in the K562/Adm cells after they were treated with oligomers for 48 h and P-glycoprotein synthesis was strikingly reduced. 4. Further investigation with [alpha-32P]dCTP incorporation by the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction method revealed that antisense oligomers could result in a reduction in the level of mdr-1 mRNA, probably through hindering mdr-1 gene transcription. 5. The high reversal efficiency and specificity of antisense oligomers in regulating mdr-1 gene expression suggest a potential clinical application in gene therapy for drug resistant malignancies.","['Liu, C', 'Qureshi, I A', 'Ding, X', 'Shan, Y', 'Huang, Y', 'Xie, Y', 'Ji, M']","['Liu C', 'Qureshi IA', 'Ding X', 'Shan Y', 'Huang Y', 'Xie Y', 'Ji M']","[""Research Unit of Haematology, Huashan Hospital, Shanghai Medical University, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Clin Sci (Lond),"Clinical science (London, England : 1979)",7905731,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/*pharmacology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/cs0910093 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Sci (Lond). 1996 Jul;91(1):93-8. doi: 10.1042/cs0910093.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The lung resistance protein LRP is a newly described protein related to MDR in several in vitro models. LRP has been shown to be a strong predictor of poor response to chemotherapy and prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia and in ovarian carcinoma patients. Recently, based on a 57% and 88% amino acid identity with major vault proteins from Dictyostelium discoideum and Rattus norvegicus, respectively, we identified LRP as the human major vault protein, the main component of highly conserved cellular organelles named vaults. We have studied the immunohistochemical expression of LRP in freshly frozen normal human tissues and 174 cancer specimens of 28 tumor types. LRP was broadly distributed in normal and malignant cells, but distinct patterns of expression were noticed. High LRP expression was seen in bronchus, digestive tract, renal proximal tubules, keratinocytes, macrophages, and adrenal cortex whereas varying ing levels were observed in other organs. LRP was detected in all tumor types examined, but its frequency varied, fairly reflecting the chemosensitivity of different cancers. For example, low rates of LRP positivity were seen in testicular cancer, neuroblastoma, and acute myeloid leukemia; intermediate in ovarian cancer; and high in colon, renal, and pancreatic carcinomas. The wide occurrence of LRP in normal and transformed cells in humans, its similar distribution to that of vaults in other species, as well as the high level of conservation among eukaryotic cells of both the amino acid sequence of the major vault protein and the composition and structure of vaults, suggest that vault function is important to eukaryotic cells.","['Izquierdo, M A', 'Scheffer, G L', 'Flens, M J', 'Giaccone, G', 'Broxterman, H J', 'Meijer, C J', 'van der Valk, P', 'Scheper, R J']","['Izquierdo MA', 'Scheffer GL', 'Flens MJ', 'Giaccone G', 'Broxterman HJ', 'Meijer CJ', 'van der Valk P', 'Scheper RJ']","['Department of Pathology, Free University Hospital, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Vault Ribonucleoprotein Particles)', '0 (major vault protein)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Rats', 'Reference Values', 'Tissue Distribution', '*Vault Ribonucleoprotein Particles']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am J Pathol. 1996 Mar;148(3):877-87.,,,,,,,PMC1861735,,,,,,,

To examine the biological functions of DC, we developed a method for generating large numbers of murine splenic DC. First, DC were propagated in vivo by using a granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor-secreting tumor as a continuous in vivo source of the cytokine. The DC enriched in the spleen, especially in the white pulps, were purified after an overnight culture. We could reproducibly obtain 6 to 10 X 10(6) splenic DC per mouse. These DC were morphologically similar to interdigitating cells, expressed high levels of MHC class II and costimulatory molecules, and were highly allo-stimulatory in mixed lymphocyte reactions. Further analysis on T cell stimulation activity revealed that the DC had strong costimulatory activity on human T cells. Activated B cells, which express both B7-1 and B7-2, had little T cell costimulatory activity under the same assay conditions. A human histiocytic leukemia cell line, U937, that showed only weak costimulatory activity by itself, worked synergistically with DC and further intensified the T cell stimulation by DC. These findings suggest the presence of a T cell costimulation mechanism in DC, which is activated synergistically by monocytes or macrophages, and deserves further study.","['Hanada, K', 'Tsunoda, R', 'Hamada, H']","['Hanada K', 'Tsunoda R', 'Hamada H']","['Department of Molecular Biotherapy Research, Cancer Institute, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Cell Communication/*physiology', 'Cell Count', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dendritic Cells/*cytology/*drug effects/immunology', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*metabolism/physiology', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Macrophages/cytology', 'Melanoma, Experimental/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Monocytes/cytology', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Spleen/*cytology/*drug effects/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jlb.60.2.181 [doi]'],ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 1996 Aug;60(2):181-90. doi: 10.1002/jlb.60.2.181.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the hurdles to in vivo use of these agents is their inactivation by components of human serum. Murine leukemia viruses (MLV), from which most current RV are derived, are known to be inactivated by human serum via activation of the classical complement cascade. Other type C retroviruses, e.g., RD114 and BaEV, are resistant to inactivation by human serum when derived from infection of human and mink cells but not murine cells. We hypothesized that amphotropic RV could be made resistant to human serum inactivation if a more appropriate producer cell could be found. To test this hypothesis, RV were made using a variety of human (293, HOS, TE671) and murine (NIH-3T3) cell types as the producer cell. The parental cell lines, RV-producer cells, and RV themselves were evaluated for sensitivity to inactivation by human serum. Results showed that the murine NIH-3T3 cell line, the NIH-3T3-derived PA317 producer cell line, and RV derived from it were all sensitive to human serum inactivation. In contrast, all human cell lines tested were resistant to lysis. RV and RV-producer cells derived from 293 cells were also resistant; RV derived from HOS cells were resistant. Surprisingly, while TE671 cells were resistant, TE671-derived RV were sensitive to inactivation. To test whether expression of the amphotropic envelope protein was responsible for conferring this serum sensitivity to the RV, env was expressed in the absence of gag and pol in TE671 cells. However, TE671 cells expressing env were resistant to human serum inactivation. These observations have important implications for use of RV and RV-producer cells for human gene therapy.","['Pensiero, M N', 'Wysocki, C A', 'Nader, K', 'Kikuchi, G E']","['Pensiero MN', 'Wysocki CA', 'Nader K', 'Kikuchi GE']","['Genetic Therapy, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD 20878, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,['0 (Antiviral Agents)'],IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/*physiology', '*Blood Physiological Phenomena', 'Cell Line', 'Gammaretrovirus/*genetics', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Virus Replication']",1996/06/10 00:00,1996/06/10 00:01,['1996/06/10 00:00'],"['1996/06/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/10 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/hum.1996.7.9-1095 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 1996 Jun 10;7(9):1095-101. doi: 10.1089/hum.1996.7.9-1095.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, while very low levels of Al are mitogenic in bones of experimental animals, the effect of low levels of Al in humans is unknown. Aluminum has been shown to have its mitogenic action at the osteoblast, but whether the effect on resorption is viz osteoblast-directed changes in osteoclast activity has not yet been determined. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels are disrupted by Al in humans and animals. Whether altered PTH levels play a major or even a minor role in Al-dependent osteotoxicity requires clarification. In hematopoietic tissue, Al causes a microcytic anemia, not reversible by iron. Friend leukemia cells treated with Al have been reported to accumulate excess iron, without incorporating it into ferritin or heme. It is not yet known which steps in iron metabolism are disrupted by Al, if they involve a single mechanism of action, or even if this disruption in iron metabolism accounts for the anemia seen in Al toxicosis. In kidney, research is needed to evaluate Al nephrotoxicity; there are almost no studies in this area. Furthermore, research is needed to evaluate mechanisms of renal Al excretion, presently shown by one study to occur at the distal tubule. Such studies might well throw light on whether Al plays a role in aggravating renal insufficiency, or whether the role of the kidney in Al toxicosis is limited to the causative effect of renal compromise on Al accumulation. In summary, while a number of mechanisms have been proposed for the toxic action of Al, no single mechanism emerges to explain these diverse effects of systemic Al. Recommendations for future research are presented and summarized in Table 1.","['Jeffery, E H', 'Abreo, K', 'Burgess, E', 'Cannata, J', 'Greger, J L']","['Jeffery EH', 'Abreo K', 'Burgess E', 'Cannata J', 'Greger JL']","['Institute for Environmental Studies, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign 61801, USA. jeffery@ux1.cso.uiuc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Toxicol Environ Health,Journal of toxicology and environmental health,7513622,"['0 (Minerals)', 'CPD4NFA903 (Aluminum)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Aluminum/*adverse effects', 'Animals', 'Bone and Bones/*drug effects/physiopathology', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects', 'Cells/drug effects', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic System/*drug effects/physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Kidney/*drug effects/physiopathology', 'Minerals/metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Research Design']",1996/08/30 00:00,1996/08/30 00:01,['1996/08/30 00:00'],"['1996/08/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/30 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/30 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/009841096161122 [doi]'],ppublish,J Toxicol Environ Health. 1996 Aug 30;48(6):649-65. doi: 10.1080/009841096161122.,,80,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three types of B cell markers were estimated: 1-light chains (lambda or kappa) on the surface of cells, 2-CD5 antigen, 3-capability of forming mouse erythrocyte rosettes (MER); the last two markers are mostly characteristic of leukaemic cells. The patients were divided into 3 groups according to the localisation of the main mass of tumorous cells: group I-the patients, whose clinical picture was dominated by the infiltration of lymphoid structures of the abdominal cavity and/or with massive infiltration of peripheral lymph nodes; group II-the patients, whose clinical picture was dominated by the infiltration of bone marrow; group III-the intermediate-patients with large mass of tumor in lymphoid structures and with bone marrow insufficiency symptoms. In most of the patients of group I, the percentage of CD5+ cells in peripheral blood was higher than the one in bone marrow (arithmetic means were 38.5% for blood and 26.7% for marrow). It was the reverse in group II (the means were 44.8% for blood and 64.3% for marrow, P < 0.01). The percentage in group III was similar to that of group I (the means-48% for blood and 29.25% for marrow). No correlation between the percentage of CD5+ and MER+ cells was found in respective groups of the patients although the last marker behaved similarly to CD5. The results obtained suggest that while estimating percentages of CD5+ cells in peripheral blood and bone marrow, one can differentiate between chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (with domination of CD5+ cells in bone marrow) and leukaemic phase of small lymphocyte lymphoma (with domination of CD5+ cells in peripheral blood).","['Rupniewska, Z M', 'Wach, M', 'Rolinski, J', 'Antosz, H', 'Dmoszynska, A', 'Wasik, E', 'Stepniak, C']","['Rupniewska ZM', 'Wach M', 'Rolinski J', 'Antosz H', 'Dmoszynska A', 'Wasik E', 'Stepniak C']","['Klinika Hematologii, Akademia Medyczna w Lublinie.']",['pol'],['Journal Article'],Poland,Ann Univ Mariae Curie Sklodowska Med,Annales Universitatis Mariae Curie-Sklodowska.

Lower protein content of experimental diets decreased the severity of nephropathy. Higher fat content of experimental diets appears to have decreased the incidence or delayed the development of leukemia and associated mortality in males. Higher fiber content of experimental diets appears to have delayed the development of mammary tumors and associated mortality in females. Higher fat and/or fiber of the experimental diets decreased the incidence of pheochromocytomas in males. The lower protein and higher fat and fiber contents of the experimental diets decreased the spontaneous tumor burden in two-year studies.

Hypothalamic and pituitary LIF and LIF-R are significantly induced (up to 6- and 4-fold, respectively) in vivo in response to lipopolysaccharide endotoxin (LPS) administered to B6D2F1 and C57BL/6 mice. In contrast to the nearly exclusive expression of matrix-associated LIF messenger RNA (mRNA) in control hypothalamus and pituitary, both diffusible and matrix-associated LIF mRNA alternate transcripts are induced by LPS. Furthermore, the time course of peripheral ACTH-response to LPS peaks at 60 min, whereas hypothalamic LIF mRNA increase occurs at 30 min and pituitary LIF induction occurs at 60 min.

These findings support the routine consideration of serum immunoglobulin levels in addition to CD4 count, especially in early evaluation of disease stage, as these evaluations may modify application of prophylaxis and treatment for HIV-1-infected IDUs.

Its protein product, p120cbl, is cytoplasmic and has several distinctive domains including a highly basic region, a RING finger motif and a large proline-rich domain. A mutation to cbl in the 70Z/3 pre-B cell lymphoma produces an oncogenic protein which exhibits a marked enhancement of tyrosine phosphorylation. Parallel studies have demonstrated that p120cbl is a substrate of protein Tyrosine kinases activated by engagement of the T cell antigen receptor and that cbl is phosphorylated by oncogenic forms of the Abl tyrosine kinase. These studies also demonstrated a constitutive association between cbl and the SHS domains of the Grb2 and Nck adaptor proteins in a range of haemopoietic cell lines. More recently it has been found that cbl is rapidly phosphorylated following stimulation of the EGF receptor, Fcy receptor, c-Kit receptor and CSF-1 receptor. A genetic analysis in Caenorhabditis elegans has identified a cbl homologue, called sli-1, that negatively regulates the LET-23 tyrosine kinase receptor.

The K562/VCR100 cells were treated with 10 microM of 15-mer antisense and sense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides. Modulation of multidrug resistance was analyzed using a daunorubicin/tritiated thymidine incorporation assay and flow cytometric assessment of cellular rhodamine 123 accumulation. RESULTS: Treatment of K562/VCR100 with the antisense oligodeoxynucleotide led to a doubling in daunorubicin growth inhibition at 1 microgram/ml and a tripling of growth inhibition at 0.6 micrograms/ml (p < 0.0023); a 58% reduction in the daunorubicin IC50 (p < 0.02); and an increased rate of rhodamine-123 accumulation (p = 0.02) compared with treatment with sense oligodeoxynucleotide or media controls. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that antisense oligodeoxynucleotides may serve as a useful adjunct in the treatment and prevention of multidrug resistance during cancer chemotherapy.","['Sola, J E', 'Colombani, P M']","['Sola JE', 'Colombani PM']","['Department of Surgery, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Ann Surg Oncol,Annals of surgical oncology,9420840,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Codon)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Rhodamines)', '1N3CZ14C5O (Rhodamine 123)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Codon', 'Daunorubicin/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Dyes/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics', 'Rhodamine 123', 'Rhodamines/metabolism', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02409056 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Surg Oncol. 1996 Jan;3(1):80-5. doi: 10.1007/BF02409056.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and interleukin (IL)-6, produced by a variety of tumors, have been implicated as mediators of cachexia. METHODS: Five murine tumor cell lines were tested for the production of these cytokines. 4JK tumor was further tested to determine if IL-1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), or cocultivation with RAW 264 cells augmented IL-6 or LIF production. RESULTS: 4JK from in vivo tumors produced significantly more IL-6 than did 4JK from culture, indicating that tumor production of IL-6 and LIF is potentially augmented by infiltrating macrophages. When 4JK was cocultured with RAW 264 cells, TNF, or IL-1 in vitro, a three- to 15-fold increase in tumor production of LIF and IL-6 was noted (p2 < or = 0.03). Conversely, in coculture experiments performed with a neutralizing TNF antibody, a 50% reduction in tumor production of LIF ad IL-6 was noted (p2 < 0.04). Resting RAW cells produced only minimal quantities of TNF; however, when RAW cells were exposed to tumor-conditioned supernatant from 4JK, their TNF production was markedly increased. CONCLUSIONS: In the tumor microenvironment, host macrophages may be activated and produce inflammatory cytokines such as TNF. Local TNF then appears to act on tumor cells to stimulate production of IL-6 and LIF. Enhanced tumor production of cytokine mediators may contribute to deleterious effects of neoplastic growth on the host.","['Billingsley, K G', 'Fraker, D L', 'Strassmann, G', 'Loeser, C', 'Fliot, H M', 'Alexander, H R']","['Billingsley KG', 'Fraker DL', 'Strassmann G', 'Loeser C', 'Fliot HM', 'Alexander HR']","['National Cancer Institute/National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Ann Surg Oncol,Annals of surgical oncology,9420840,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/immunology', 'Cachexia/etiology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Growth Inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/complications/*metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/immunology/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02409048 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Surg Oncol. 1996 Jan;3(1):29-35. doi: 10.1007/BF02409048.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One patient showed abnormal rearrangement with the participation of two JH regions. In the remaining case a VH6 germline fragment was involved in an apparently abnormal rearrangement. Based on the sequence information, clone-specific DIG-labeled probes were designed and used in subsequent nonradioactive hybridization protocols to estimate the prevalence of residual leukemic cells in the course of therapy. Five of the six cases of B-ALL could be included in the rest cell analysis. In all patients investigated, residual leukemic cells were detected, independent of whether a normal or apparently abnormal rearrangement has occurred.

The approach was based on previous experience showing that complete remission (Ph-negative bone marrow cells) is rarely achieved after chemotherapy and is very short-lasting. We decided to explore whether it was possible to collect Ph-negative precursor cells in peripheral blood during the early phase of haemopoietic recovery. These data show that: the collection of Ph-negative precursor cells occurred in 12/16 (75%) patients mobilized within one year of diagnosis (group A) versus 12/33 (36%) in patients with a history of more than one year of disease (group B). Furthermore the numbers of Ph-negative precursor cells were significantly much higher at diagnosis. Ten patients mobilized at diagnosis were subsequently autografted with such Ph-negative precursor cells. Five of them remain Ph-negative from 4 to 12 months while the other five have percentages of Ph-positive cells in their marrow ranging from 20% to 70%. In this stage of the disease the procedure is safe and associated with a very good compliance. Occasional restoration of Ph-negative haemopoiesis could be observed up to 40 months after autograft, in patients of group B, but most of patients revert to Ph-positive haemopoiesis. in conclusion these data suggest that it is possible to restore Ph-negative haemopoiesis in 70% of patients mobilized at diagnosis.

This comprises both reduction of white blood cell (WBC) mass and reduction of the Philadelphia (Ph)-positive clone. Besides drug monotherapy, intensive combination chemotherapy is also very effective in reducing tumor burden in the chronic phase of CML. Therapeutic concepts consisting of combination chemotherapy include intensive chemotherapy alone or in combination with interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) and preparative regimens before autografting or allografting. All these concepts demonstrate the effectiveness of this treatment form. The high toxicity of combination chemotherapy does not justify its application in unselected patients.

German CML Study Group.,S49-54,"The analysis and validation of prognostic factors is a decisive prerequisite with regard to the development and application of risk-adjusted therapies. Among others, the Sokal index 1 and Kantarjian's new staging system 2 were scores set up to assess the survival of every patient individually. By means of 504 Ph- and/or bcr-abl-positive patients of the German CML study I, we tried to validate both scores mentioned above. Whereas Kantarjian's staging system provided rather unsatisfactory results, the discrimination of different risk groups was more promising with respect to the Sokal index. Still, concerning the differentiation between risk groups for the interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) treated patients of the German study I, the Sokal index also failed. Hence, we applied Cox stepwise regression technique and identified three prognostic factors for the IFN-alpha treated patients, i.e. eosinophils, erythroblasts (both in peripheral blood), and extramedullary manifestations. We developed our own score and found an encouraging 5-y survival rate of 90% (95% confidence interval (CI) 76-100%) for a certain low-risk group of 41 out of 120 IFN-alpha treated patients. With the need to validate our score and, if possible, not only to confirm the above result but also to identify other particular patient groups, we launched the European Prognostic Factors Project (E.P.F.P.). Within this project, our special interest will be dedicated to patient groups who might also benefit from a bone marrow transplantation.","['Hasford, J', 'Ansari, H', 'Pfirrmann, M', 'Hehlmann, R']","['Hasford J', 'Ansari H', 'Pfirrmann M', 'Hehlmann R']","['Biometrisches Zentrum fur Therapiestudien (BZT), Munchen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Genes, abl', 'Germany/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging/methods', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1996 May;17 Suppl 3:S49-54.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eighty-one patients with a median age of 50.5 y (17-70) were given IFN-alpha (5 x 10(6)/sqm/day, s.c.). The median interval between diagnosis and IFN-alpha was 45 days (0-160). IFN-alpha doses were adjusted to maintain the white blood cell (WBC) count between 1.5 and 5 x 10(9)/l and the platelet count between 50 and 100 x 10(9)/l. At diagnosis, Sokal's criteria were used to classify patients into three groups: low (n = 39), intermediate (n = 32) and high risk (n = 10). A complete hematological response (CHR) was achieved in 66 cases (81.5%). Cytogenetic response was evaluated in these 66 responders. Thirty-six patients (44.4%) achieved a major cytogenetic response (MCR) (> or = 65% Ph-negative cells), 31 of them having a complete cytogenetic response. The 5-y transformation-free survival (TFS) of the 81 patients was 77 +/- 14% (95% CI) and was statistically influenced by the CHR rate at three months (p = 0.008) and the achievement of MCR or CCR (p < 0.0009 and p < 0.0005, respectively). Moreover, we found that the MCR or CCR were significantly influenced by the obtaining of CHR at three months (p < 0.001 and p < 0.0001, respectively). These results show that IFN-alpha can induce high rates of hematological and cytogenetic responses when administered in doses leading to myelosuppression. The achievement of CHR within three months could be useful to identify early those patients who will not respond to IFN-alpha and who need alternative treatments such as allogeneic or autologous stem cell transplantation.","['Mahon, F X', 'Faberes, C', 'Montastruc, M', 'Si-Mour, S', 'Boiron, J M', 'Marit, G', 'Bilhou-Nabera, C', 'Cony-Makhoul, P', 'Pigneux, A', 'Bernard, P', 'Broustet, A', 'Reiffers, J']","['Mahon FX', 'Faberes C', 'Montastruc M', 'Si-Mour S', 'Boiron JM', 'Marit G', 'Bilhou-Nabera C', 'Cony-Makhoul P', 'Pigneux A', 'Bernard P', 'Broustet A', 'Reiffers J']","['Department of Hematology, CHU Bordeaux, Hopital Haut-Leveque, Pessac, France.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Drug Tolerance', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/mortality/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Survival Rate']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1996 May;17 Suppl 3:S33-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""Broken"" V(D)J coding ends accumulate in scid lymphocyte precursors as a consequence of a mutation in DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK). The ensuing failure to rearrange efficiently antigen receptors arrests lymphoid development. Here we show that scid thymocytes express high levels of p53 protein, attributable to recombinase activating gene (RAG)-dependent generation of DSB adjacent to V, D, and J gene segments. To examine the functional importance of p53 expression in vivo, we bred p53-/- scid mice. The absence of p53 facilitated production of in-frame V(D)Jbeta coding joints and developmental progression of scid thymocytes, in addition to a dramatic accumulation of pro-B cells. All mice developed disseminated pro-B or immature T cell lymphoma/leukemia by 7-12 weeks of age. We present evidence that p53 deficiency prolongs the survival of scid lymphocyte precursors harboring broken V(D)J coding ends, allowing the accumulation of aneuploid cells. These results demonstrate that a p53-mediated DNA damage checkpoint contributes to the immune deficiency characteristic of the scid mutation and limits the oncogenic potential of DSBs generated during V(D)J recombination.","['Guidos, C J', 'Williams, C J', 'Grandal, I', 'Knowles, G', 'Huang, M T', 'Danska, J S']","['Guidos CJ', 'Williams CJ', 'Grandal I', 'Knowles G', 'Huang MT', 'Danska JS']","['Division of Immunology and Cancer, Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Survival', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'Gamma Rays', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte', '*Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', '*Genes, p53', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics', 'Lymphoma/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Mice, SCID/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*genetics', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'T-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Thymus Gland', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/radiation effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*deficiency/physiology']",1996/08/15 00:00,1996/08/15 00:01,['1996/08/15 00:00'],"['1996/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1101/gad.10.16.2038 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Dev. 1996 Aug 15;10(16):2038-54. doi: 10.1101/gad.10.16.2038.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, other neuropeptides (neuropeptide Y, somatostatin, substance P, peptide YY, neurokinin A, calcitonin gene-related peptide, chole-cystokinin octapeptide, and beta-endorphin) were ineffective. Moreover, VIP-induced enhancement was specifically blocked by VIP receptor antagonist. Among the various cytokines, IL-6, GH, and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) also enhanced Ig production and thymidine uptake in plasma cells.

DESIGN: Non-randomised phase II study in an unselected population. SETTING: 20 centres in the Netherlands and Belgium. METHODS: Response to treatment was evaluated in 23 patients with a minimum follow-up of 6 months. All patients had proven HCL, were untreated or pretreated with splenectomy and (or) IFN alpha, and had at least one of the following criteria: Hb < 7.3 mmol/l, neutrophils < 1.0 x 10(9)/l, platelets < 100 x 10(9)/l, systemic symptoms or symptomatic splenomegaly. Patients with an active infection were ineligible. Treatment consisted of one cycle of 2-CDA (2-hour i.v. infusion days 1-5, dosage 0.1 mg/kg/day). RESULTS: Sixteen patients had received no prior treatment. At the 4-week evaluation, most patients (17/23) had improvement in one or two haematological parameters. After 6 months, 6/23 (26%) patients were in haematological remission and 13/23 (57%) were in complete remission. No patient developed progressive disease. Febrile neutropenia developed in 12/23 (52%) patients, with documented infection in three of them. A generalised rash was seen in 9/23 (39%) patients. CONCLUSION: 2-CDA appears to be the treatment of choice in patients with HCL.

Regarding the gp51 envelope glycoprotein, the BLV-12 variant showed: 1. A high extent of conservation, which included potential glycosylation sites and cysteine residues; 2. Three unique amino acid residues not present in any of the other BLV strains analysed; and 3. Some variability at the level of one (G) of the three (F, G and H) conformational epitopes, which is probably important in the process of infection.

The study is an examination of morphological changes and marker behavior in peripheral and bone marrow cells in AML and APL during treatment both with all-transretinoic acid (ATRA) alone and in association with chemotherapy and G-CSF. The same treatment was carried out in a patient who had been diagnosed with Vaquez's disease 15 years earlier and currently presented a bone marrow and peripheral picture of AML (80% myeloblasts) with thrombocytopenia. We observed that treatment with ATRA, alone or in association with chemotherapy, was followed by a remission of AML and especially of APL, with amelioration of the general condition of the patients. The addition of G-CSF to ATRA at the end of chemotherapy, during consequent pancytopenia, produced a rapid increase in mature peripheral granulocytes and an apparent medullary complete remission, which was more prolonged in APL than in AML; there was no increase in peripheral blasts. Discontinuation of G-CSF was followed by a relapse in the patient with AML. A patient with Vaquez's disease, in remission for 15 years and presenting a progressive increase in bone marrow and peripheral myeloblasts, did not have a positive response to the administration of ATRA; however, the association of G-CSF to ATRA was followed by a complete remission. The morphological changes observed in bone marrow and peripheral granulocytes (with changes in the main cellular markers: CD11b, CD13, CD14, CD15, CD34) seemed to express progressive modification of the single elements towards differentiation, with progressive bone marrow reduction and peripheral disappearance of blasts.

Therefore we evaluated in vitro sensitivity to these drugs and cross-resistance of purine analogs. In addition, we correlated the in vitro data with the main clinico-hematological variables and surface markers. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty CLL samples obtained from 63 untreated and 17 treated CLL patients were tested in vitro with the MTT assay. Lethal dose (LD)50 values were calculated to determine sensitivity to CLB, 2-CDA and FAMP. RESULTS: Samples were clustered either for a one-log increase of LD50 values or for LD50 threshold values of 3 microM for FAMP, 0.3 microM for 2-CDA and 7 microM for CLB, which correspond to the therapeutically achievable plasmatic levels of these drugs. A higher number of samples sensitive to 2-CDA were identified by the first approach; with the second method the relative order of sensitivity was FAMP > 2-CDA > CLB. Concerning 2-CDA and FAMP cross-resistance, out of 61 samples resistant to 2-CDA, 29.5% were sensitive to FAMP. Conversely, 13.9% out of 43 samples resistant to FAMP were sensitive to 2-CDA. No correlation was found between the main clinico-hematological features and the LD50 values of each drug either considering the whole series or only the untreated cases. In vitro drug sensitivity was also evaluated during the steady-state of the disease and at disease progression in six untreated cases. We observed a mean increase in the LD50 values of about 13, 38 and 22 times for CLB, FAMP and 2-CDA, respectively. Among the treated cases, the LD50 values of both purine analogs and CLB correlated with bone marrow histology. CLL cells expressing CD14, CD11c, CD11b, and FMC7 were more resistant in vitro to purine analogs but not to CLB. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that i) the purine analogs exert a greater cytotoxic effect on CLL cells; ii) 2-CDA and FAMP are not cross-resistant in vitro in a percentage of CLL samples, iii) a possible change in LD50 values may be related to modification of the disease status, and iv) the expression of certain surface markers, which are CLL-unrestricted, identifies samples with higher in vitro resistance to purine analogs.","['Morabito, F', 'Stelitano, C', 'Callea, I', 'Filangeri, M', 'Oliva, B', 'Sculli, G', 'Callea, V', 'Nobile, F', 'Brugiatelli, M']","['Morabito F', 'Stelitano C', 'Callea I', 'Filangeri M', 'Oliva B', 'Sculli G', 'Callea V', 'Nobile F', 'Brugiatelli M']","['Dipartimento di Emato-Oncologia, Azienda Ospedaliera Bianchi-Melacrino-Morelli, Reggio Calabra, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes/*drug effects', 'Chlorambucil/therapeutic use', 'Cladribine/therapeutic use', 'Hematologic Tests', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1996 May-Jun;81(3):224-31.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This marker permits minimal residual disease follow-up after bone marrow transplantation (BMT) through cytogenetic or molecular analysis. Although the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method is largely employed, the clinical value and impact of a positive RT-PCR as a herald of hematological relapse has not yet been definitively ascertained. METHODS: In order to verify the frequency of bcr-abl positivity in CML patients who underwent alloBMT, we performed serial two-step RT-PCR on 63 peripheral blood and bone marrow specimens obtained at different times after non T-cell-depleted BMT from 16 CML patients treated in our Institution. After amplification, RT-PCR products were always checked by liquid hybridization with a specific probe. Median molecular follow-up after BMT was 38 months (range 2-144 months). RESULTS: None of the patients studied presented clinical hematological relapse after BMT. Six out of sixteen patients were found to be positive for bcr-abl. PCR positivity appeared in 4/6 patients more than one year post-BMT and in 2/6 patients within one year post BMT. In both instances PCR was an isolated finding in 5/6 patients and reverted to negativity in subsequent analysis; only one case was PCR-positive twice. It is noteworthy that RT-PCR positivity appeared in five patients presenting acute or chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD) and in one patient who had received MUD-BMT.

METHODS: We investigated the profile of interleukin-8 (IL-8) expression and release by leukemic cells obtained at diagnosis from 42 untreated adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia of various FAB subtypes (2 M0, 7 M1, 6 M2, 6 M3, 10 M4 and 11 M5). IL-8 transcripts were evaluated by Northern blot and densitometric analysis. IL-8 release by myeloid blasts was evaluated by a specific ELISA either in sera at diagnosis or in supernatants (SN) obtained from cultured leukemic cells. RESULTS: In basal conditions, Northern blot analysis revealed detectable IL-8 transcripts in 15/29 cases, eleven of which were classified as M4-M5 and 4 as FAB M0-M3. Densitometric analysis of IL-8 transcript bands showed higher expression in M4-M5 than in M0-M3 cases (mean values +/- SD: 16.5 +/- 21 and 0.77 +/- 1.36 densitometric units, respectively; p = 0.012). Higher IL-8 serum levels were observed in leukemic patients as opposed to normal controls (mean values +/- SD: 0.53 +/- 0.75 vs 0.003 +/- 0.014 ng/mL, respectively; p = 0.006). Furthermore, a trend (though not of statistical significance) towards higher IL-8 serum values was observed in M4-M5 as opposed to M0-M3 subtypes. After 24 hours of culture, the majority of myeloid blasts (95%) spontaneously released detectable amounts of IL-8 into SN. However, M4-M5 released substantially higher amounts of IL-8 than M0-M3 blasts (mean +/- SD: 68 +/- 46 and 8.5 +/- 12 ng/mL, respectively; p < 0.001). This difference between M0-M3 and M4-M5 blasts was already observed after 6 hours of culture and increased over 72 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm and further support the preferential release of high levels of IL-8 by myeloid blasts showing monocytic differentiation.","['Vinante, F', 'Rigo, A', 'Tecchio, C', 'Patuzzo, C', 'Ricetti, M M', 'Morosato, L', 'Cassatella, M A', 'Chilosi, M', 'Pizzolo, G']","['Vinante F', 'Rigo A', 'Tecchio C', 'Patuzzo C', 'Ricetti MM', 'Morosato L', 'Cassatella MA', 'Chilosi M', 'Pizzolo G']","['Department of Hematology, Verona University School of Medicine, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,['0 (Interleukin-8)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-8/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/*cytology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1996 May-Jun;81(3):195-200.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, prevalence of invasive mould infections at the School of Medicine of the Leipzig University between 1992 and 1994 was investigated. The diagnosis of invasive mould infection was suspected on clinical, mycological, and radiological findings. The definitive diagnosis was obtained by identification of characteristic mould hyphae on stained smears, and/or positive culture, and/or the detection of Aspergillus antigen (Pastorex) in serum, bronchial secretion, or bronchoalveolar fluid, and confirmed by histopathology. In altogether 21 patients the definitive diagnosis invasive mould infection was recorded, among them 20 invasive aspergilloses.

Only one peptide inhibited binding of Sam68 to the p85alpha SH3 domain, whereas several peptides inhibited binding of Sam68 to c-src SH3 domain, suggesting that Sam68 uses different proline-rich motifs to bind to different SH3 domains. A peptide derived from residues 32-44 of Sam68 which fits the class II SH3 domain binding consensus sequence inhibited binding of Sam68 to both p85alpha SH3 domain and c-src SH3 domain, but with differential potency, suggesting a differential affinity of these SH3 domains for this proline-rich motif.","['Finan, P M', 'Hall, A', 'Kellie, S']","['Finan PM', 'Hall A', 'Kellie S']","['Yamanouchi Research Institute, Littlemore Hospital, Oxford, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,FEBS Lett,FEBS letters,0155157,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)', 'EC 1.6.3.1 (neutrophil cytosolic factor 1)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins pp60(c-src))', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.1.4.3 (Phospholipase C gamma)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'B-Lymphocytes/*chemistry/pathology/virology', 'Binding Sites', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/chemistry/metabolism', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NADPH Oxidases', 'Peptides/chemical synthesis/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases', 'Phospholipase C gamma', 'Phosphoproteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/chemistry/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins pp60(c-src)/chemistry/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Type C Phospholipases/chemistry/metabolism', '*src Homology Domains']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0014-5793(96)00552-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0014-5793(96)00552-2 [doi]']",ppublish,FEBS Lett. 1996 Jul 1;389(2):141-4. doi: 10.1016/0014-5793(96)00552-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clinical symptoms occur from the release of chemical mediators and the pathologic infiltration of cells. Three major groups of patients with mastocytosis can be distinguished: i) cutaneous mastocytosis, ii) mastocytosis involving the skin and one or more extracutaneous organ(s), and iii) visceral mastocytosis without involvement of the skin. Groups ii) and iii) account for approximately 15-20% of all cases and have been referred to as systemic mastocytosis. Cutaneous mastocytosis typically presents as urticaria pigmentosa or diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis. These patients usually have a benign course. In contrast, systemic mastocytosis is a diffuse hematologic process with an increased risk to develop aggressive disease. In these patients, additional hematologic abnormalities or a second hematologic process, such as a myeloproliferative or myelodysplastic syndrome, or acute leukemia, may develop. Malignant mastocytosis and mast cell leukemia are rare forms of mastocytosis and characterized by uncontrolled and progressive proliferation and infiltration of mast cells in diverse organs. These patients often present without cutaneous lesions and have a very unfavorable prognosis. Because of the immature morphology of the cells it is often difficult to establish the diagnosis in such patients. However, the use of antibodies to mast cell antigens has recently improved the diagnostic efficiency in patients with suspected mast cell disease. No effective therapy for patients with malignant mastocytosis is known, although some patients may benefit from corticosteroid and interferon alpha treatment. The present article gives an overview of current knowledge about the biology, heterogeneity and treatment of human mastocytosis.","['Valent, P']",['Valent P'],"['Department of Internal Medicine I, University of Vienna.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Austria,Wien Klin Wochenschr,Wiener klinische Wochenschrift,21620870R,,IM,"['Cell Division/physiology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/pathology', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Mast-Cell/classification/*pathology/therapy', 'Mast Cells/pathology', 'Mast-Cell Sarcoma/classification/*pathology/therapy', 'Mastocytosis/classification/*pathology/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Urticaria Pigmentosa/classification/pathology/therapy']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Wien Klin Wochenschr. 1996;108(13):385-97.,,106,,,,,,,,,,,,

Numerous studies have investigated the expression of the MDR1 gene product, P-glycoprotein, in leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma. Studies in myelogenous leukemia and myeloma have so far provided best evidence for a significant correlation between P-glycoprotein expression and response to chemotherapy, although large discrepancies in the proportion of positive cells limit any definite conclusion. Differences in P-glycoprotein detection techniques and methodology may account for the divergent results thus emphasizing the necessity for standardized methods of detection. Despite this, encouraging clinical results have been obtained using MDR modulators in combination with conventional chemotherapy to inhibit the activity of the P-glycoprotein pump.

Haemoglobin concentration and platelet count were at the lower limits of normal, white cell count within the normal range. Differential count: 60 erythroblasts per 100 leukocytes and 33.5 blast cells. Two skin biopsies revealed massive oedema in the upper corium and focal erythrocyte extravasations. There were perivascular and perifollicular inflammatory infiltrates in the deeper layers and elastosis of the corium. There was no leukocytoclastic vasculitis. These findings established the diagnosis of Sweet syndrome and erythroleukaemia.

A tri- or tetrapeptide linkage (e.g. Gly-Phe-Ala-Leu) between pHEG and the aziridine nitrogen of MMC can combine good hydrolytic stability with rapid cleavage by lysosomal enzymes, releasing free MMC. The conjugates showed decreased systemic toxicity and could be administered to mice at a total MMC dose of 15 mg/kg i.v., compared with just 6 mg/kg for free MMC. Conjugates also showed better activity against animal models of established tumours, achieving up to 77% increased life span (ILS) against solid P388 leukaemia, compared with only 23% for free MMC, and up to 121% ILS against solid C26 colorectal carcinoma, compared with no activity for the free drug.

We have examined the action of flt3/flk2 ligand (FL) on physiologic suppression of self-renewal during growth factor-induced differentiation of M1 leukemic cells. Unstimulated M1 cells expressed high levels of flt3 receptor mRNA and protein, with approximately 20,000 molecules present at the cell surface. Consistent with data obtained from normal macrophage populations, expression of both mRNA and protein for flt3 receptor was suppressed as cells were induced to differentiate into mature macrophages in response to leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Although FL alone had no detectable action on unstimulated M1 cells, an effect was revealed during LIF-induced differentiation. FL overcame LIF-induced suppression in clonal cultures of M1 cells, prevented morphologic changes associated with macrophage differentiation and interfered with the LIF-induced responsiveness of M1 cells to macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). This action of FL was evident on both parental M1 cells and M1 cells whose differentiation program was perturbed by enforced expression of the transcription factor SCL. The action of FL was most striking in clone transfer experiments in which FL rescued M1 cells from LIF-induced suppression of self-renewal. The ability of FL to maintain self-renewal characteristics satisfies one of the criteria predicted for a stem-cell-active molecule and contrasts with the action of FL in stimulating proliferation and differentiation of normal hematopoietic cells.","['Begley, C G', 'Rasko, J E', 'Curtis, D', 'Takagi, K', 'Metcalf, D', 'Hilton, D', 'Roberts, B', 'Nicola, N A', 'Rossner, M T']","['Begley CG', 'Rasko JE', 'Curtis D', 'Takagi K', 'Metcalf D', 'Hilton D', 'Roberts B', 'Nicola NA', 'Rossner MT']","['Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (flt3 ligand protein)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'DNA Primers', 'Fetus', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Liver/metabolism', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Membrane Proteins/*biosynthesis/physiology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Templates, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1996 Aug;24(10):1247-57.,,,['GENBANK/L23636'],,,,,,,,,,,

HDMP administration has also been shown to accelerate the recovery of leukocytes and increase bone marrow hematopoietic CD34+ progenitor cells in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In the present study, we evaluated the effect of short-course (4-day) HDMP treatment on peripheral blood (PB) CD34+ cells in patients with acute leukemia (AL). Fourteen children with AL who were receiving maintenance therapy were enrolled in this study. Methyl-prednisolone was given orally as a single daily dose of 30 mg/kg for only 4 days to nine children (three AML, six ALL) in whom chemotherapy-induced leukopenia (< 2 x 10(9)/L) was observed. Circulating CD34+ progenitor cells were determined by flow cytometry before (day 0) and 4 and 7 days after HDMP treatment. On days 4 and 7 after initiation of HDMP treatment, the number of PB CD34+ cells increased significantly (p < 0.05). Hematopoietic CD34+ progenitor cells were also determined in five patients with AL (two AML, three ALL) and chemotherapy-induced leukopenia who did not receive HDMP. The number of CD34+ cells was found to be significantly (p < 0.05) higher in the patients who received HDMP than in those who did not. Along with PB CD34+ progenitor cells, white blood cells (WBC), polymorphonuclear cells (PMN), and monocytes also increased significantly (p < 0.05) in patients treated with short-course HDMP. In conclusion, short-course HDMP treatment can be used to shorten the chemotherapy-induced leukopenic period in patients with AL, possibly by increasing the number of hematopoietic progenitor cells.

Here, we investigated whether or not (a) treatment with ADR promotes apoptosis and represses the expression of two COX genes (one nuclear and one mitochondrial) in human K-562 cells in the absence and presence of hemin, and (b) injection of hemin preserves bone-marrow cellularity in ADR-myelosuppressed rats. Cultured K-562 cells were incubated with varying concentrations of ADR.HCl (0.2 microM to 5 microM) in the presence and absence of hemin (30 microM) and assessed for DNA degradation, as well as for expression of mitochondrial COXII and nuclear COXIV genes by RNA Northern blot hybridization analysis. In parallel, we investigated whether or not hemin injected i.p. in myelosuppressed rats affected ADR-induced bone-marrow cytotoxicity. These studies have shown the following: (a) ADR caused a dose- and time-dependent DNA fragmentation, characteristic of apoptosis, in K-562 cells; (b) hemin reduced the frequency of cell death caused by ADR: this effect was specific for ADR, because hemin failed to prevent apoptosis induced by methotrexate (MTX) in these cells; (c) ADR suppressed expression of COXIV and COXII genes, and exposure of ADR-treated K-562 cells to hemin did not reverse this suppression; and (d) i.p. injection of hemin in ADR-myelosuppressed rats improved bone-marrow cellularity, promoted colony formation (CFU-GM and CFU-F), and stromal cell outgrowth; moreover, hemin increased WBC counts depressed 12 days after ADR treatment. These studies indicate that hemin is a selective inhibitor of ADR-induced apoptosis of human leukemia cells and preserves bone-marrow cellularity in rats injected with ADR.","['Papadopoulou, L C', 'Tsiftsoglou, A S']","['Papadopoulou LC', 'Tsiftsoglou AS']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Macedonia, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 1.9.3.1 (Electron Transport Complex IV)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/antagonists & inhibitors/*toxicity', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/antagonists & inhibitors/*toxicity', 'Electron Transport Complex IV/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/*drug effects', 'Hemin/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mitochondria/enzymology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/09/13 00:00,1996/09/13 00:01,['1996/09/13 00:00'],"['1996/09/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/13 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/13 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(96)00349-8 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(96)00349-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1996 Sep 13;52(5):713-22. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(96)00349-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lack of evidence for influx route-specific effects.,703-12,"We previously described a methotrexate-resistant L1210 cell line (MTXrA) that lacks a functional reduced folate carrier and does not appreciably express the folate receptor. In the present study, we utilized MTXrA cell lines stably transfected with cDNAs encoding either the folate receptor or the reduced folate carrier to investigate the influence of the route of folate influx on the rate and extent of methotrexate polyglutamylation. At an extracellular methotrexate concentration of 0.1 microM, influx in the folate receptor transfectant (MTXrA-TF1) and in the reduced folate carrier transfectant (MTXrA-R1) was equal and methotrexate polyglutamates accumulated at an identical rate, but the onset was delayed until dihydrofolate reductase was saturated with the monoglutamate (approxmately 3 hr). The onset of polyglutamate formation was immediate and identical among the lines in cells pretreated with the lipophilic dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor trimetrexate to block methotrexate binding to dihydrofolate reductase. The spectra of individual methotrexate polyglutamates that accumulated were similar, with the tetraglutamate present as the predominant form. A 100-fold higher methotrexate concentration was required to detect methotrexate uptake and polyglutamylation in the transport defective parent MTXrA line, demonstrating that diffusion or an unidentified low affinity route also supports polyglutamylation. Since the folate receptor and the reduced folate carrier achieve nearly identical rates of polyglutamylation despite very different mechanisms of methotrexate delivery, the data suggest that transport-mediated substrate channeling to folylpolyglutamate synthetase is unlikely to play a role in tetrahydrofolate metabolism. This study supports the notion that it is the intracellular concentration of methotrexate achieved within the cell that drives polyglutamylation irrespective of its route of entry.","['Spinella, M J', 'Brigle, K E', 'Freemantle, S J', 'Sierra, E E', 'Goldman, I D']","['Spinella MJ', 'Brigle KE', 'Freemantle SJ', 'Sierra EE', 'Goldman ID']","['Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Medical College of Virginia, Richmond 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Reduced Folate Carrier Protein)', '0 (Slc19a1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Slc19a2 protein, mouse)', '25513-46-6 (Polyglutamic Acid)', '82334-40-5 (methotrexate polyglutamate)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (Peptide Synthases)', 'EC 6.3.2.17 (folylpolyglutamate synthetase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Carrier Proteins/*physiology', 'Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored', 'Leukemia L1210/enzymology/*metabolism/pathology', '*Membrane Proteins', '*Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Methotrexate/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Peptide Synthases/metabolism', 'Polyglutamic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', '*Receptors, Cell Surface', 'Reduced Folate Carrier Protein', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/09/13 00:00,1996/09/13 00:01,['1996/09/13 00:00'],"['1996/09/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/13 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/13 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(96)00347-4 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(96)00347-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1996 Sep 13;52(5):703-12. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(96)00347-4.,"['F32 CA009349/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5F32-CA09349/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'OIG-CA39807/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to investigate the ability of one of the compounds, AC394, and its enantiomers to potentiate the antitumor activity of adriamycin against colon cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: The effects of AC394 on potentiation of adriamycin cytotoxicity and enhancement of its accumulation were evaluated using colon 26, HCT-15 and MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, the activities of AC394 and its enantiomers were compared. We also studied the combined effects of (+)-AC394 and adriamycin on subcutaneously (s.c.)-implanted and liver metastasis tumor models. RESULTS: AC394 potentiated the cytotoxicity of adriamycin and enhanced its accumulation in colon cancer cells (colon 26 and HCT-15), which are known to express P-GP (P-glycoprotein) intrinsically. Enhancement of adriamycin accumulation by AC394 was found in s.c.-implanted colon 26 cells in vivo. Although both enantiomers of AC394 showed equal activity in vitro, (+)-AC394 was more effective than (-)-AC394 given orally. (-)-AC394 was found to be cleared more rapidly from the plasma than (+)-AC394. Thus, (+)-AC394 was evaluated for further study. Administration of (+)-AC394 significantly potentiated the antitumor activities of adriamycin in human colon cancer HCT-15 cells implanted s.c. Furthermore, in the liver metastasis model using colon 26 cells, a model completely resistant to adriamycin, the combination therapy of adriamycin with (+)-AC394 produced superior antitumor effects over adriamycin alone. CONCLUSIONS: A newly synthesized N-alkylated 1,4-dihydropyridine derivative, (+)-AC394, showed superior effects on the potentiation of adriamycin antitumor and antimetastatic activities in vivo. These results suggest that this combination may have therapeutic efficacy not only against primary colon cancers but also against metastatic liver cancer.","['Ohishi, K', 'Morinaga, Y', 'Ohsumi, K', 'Nakagawa, R', 'Suga, Y', 'Tsuji, T', 'Akiyama, Y', 'Tsuruo, T']","['Ohishi K', 'Morinaga Y', 'Ohsumi K', 'Nakagawa R', 'Suga Y', 'Tsuji T', 'Akiyama Y', 'Tsuruo T']","['Central Research Laboratories, Ajinomoto Co., Inc., Kawasaki, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (AC 394)', '0 (Dihydropyridines)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/analysis/*pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Colon/chemistry', 'Colonic Neoplasms/chemistry/*drug therapy', 'Dihydropyridines/blood/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/analysis', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/secondary', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002800050509 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1996;38(5):446-52. doi: 10.1007/s002800050509.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DSB-120 was shown to be a potent cytotoxic agent in vitro against a panel of human colon carcinomas [50% growth-inhibitory concentration (IC50) 42 +/- 7.9 nM, mean +/- SE, n = 7] and two rodent tumours (L1210 and ADJ/PC6). Antitumour activity was assessed in the bifunctional alkylating-agent-sensitive murine plasmacytoma ADJ/PC6 using a variety of administration protocols. The maximal antitumour effects were observed following a single i.v. dose but the therapeutic index was only 2.6. DSB-120 was less effective when given i.p. either singly or by a daily x 5 schedule. After a single i.v. dose at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD, 5 mgkg-1) the plasma elimination was biphasic, with a short distribution phase (t1/2 alpha 4 min) being followed by a longer elimination phase (t1/2 beta 38 min). Peak plasma concentrations were 25 micrograms ml-1, the clearance was 1.3 ml g-1 h-1 and the AUC0-infinity was 230 micrograms ml-1 min. Concentrations of DSB-120 in ADJ/PC6 tumours were very low, showing a peak of 0.4 micrograms g-1 at 5 min. The steady-state tumour/plasma ratio was about 5% and the AUC was only 2.5% of that occurring in the plasma. DSB-120 appeared to be unstable in vivo, with only 1% of an administered dose being recovered unchanged in 24-h urine samples. Plasma protein binding was extensive at 96.6%. In conclusion, the poor antitumour activity of DSB-120 may be a consequence of low tumour selectivity and drug uptake as a result of high protein binding and/or extensive drug metabolism in vivo.","['Walton, M I', 'Goddard, P', 'Kelland, L R', 'Thurston, D E', 'Harrap, K R']","['Walton MI', 'Goddard P', 'Kelland LR', 'Thurston DE', 'Harrap KR']","['CRC Centre for Cancer Therapeutics, Institute of Cancer Research, Belmont, Surrey, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzodiazepinones)', '0 (DSB 120)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Benzodiazepinones/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Stability', 'Female', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Plasmacytoma/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002800050507 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1996;38(5):431-8. doi: 10.1007/s002800050507.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the pharmacokinetics of KRN8602, a new morpholino anthracycline, in comparison with ADM in mice bearing colon26 adenocarcinoma. After intravenous administration, both drugs disappeared triexponentially from the plasma and KRN8602 was eliminated faster than ADM. The rate of elimination of KRN8602 from tissues was also faster than than of ADM. The relative order of the area under the curve (AUC) of KRN8602 was spleen > tumor > small intestine > lung > kidney > heart > liver > brain > plasma, while that of ADM was spleen > kidney > lung > liver > heart > small intestine > tumor > plasma. ADM was not detectable in the brain. The AUC of KRN8602 was higher than that of ADM in the tumor and brain, but it was lower in other tissues. The tissue-to-plasma concentration ratio (KPapp) of KRN8602 was higher than that of ADM in the tumor, spleen, small intestine and brain. KRN8602 was metabolized to several metabolites. The concentrations of M1 and M2 (glycoside-type metabolites) was relatively high in the spleen. M3 (aglycone-type metabolite) showed a very high AUC ratio in the liver (34%). In tumor, M1 and M2 concentrations were low and M3 was not detected. KRN8602 had a greater activity than ADM and M2 had a cytotoxic activity similar to KRN8602 against colon26 cells in an MTT assay. These results suggest that the strong antitumor effect of KRN8602 against colon26 is due not only to its strong cytotoxic activity but also to its marked transferability into tumors. KRN8602 shows better selective toxicity than ADM, because KRN8602 is more selective for tumors than ADM and less is transferred to normal tissues.","['Shinkai, H', 'Takahashi, H', 'Miyamoto, K', 'Uchida, T', 'Tokiwa, T']","['Shinkai H', 'Takahashi H', 'Miyamoto K', 'Uchida T', 'Tokiwa T']","['Pharmaceutical Development Laboratory, Kirin Brewery Co.

Fukuoka Bone Marrow Transplantation Group.,S115-9,"Peripheral blood stem and progenitor cells (PBSC and PBPC), which circulate at very low levels during steady-state hematopoiesis, show a transient but marked increase during hematologic recovery from marrow-suppressive chemotherapy. To ensure rapid and sustained hematologic engraftment after autologous PBSC transplantation, sufficient PBSC or PBPC must be infused. To confirm the utility of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in chemotherapy-induced PBSC mobilization, we investigated the effect of G-CSF on PBSC mobilization in leukemia and lymphoma patients. The study design was such that PBSC mobilization with and without G-CSF was assessed in the same patients. The results indicate that PBSC mobilization can be enhanced significantly when G-CSF is given during the recovery phase postchemotherapy. Interestingly, progenitor cells of different lineages could be mobilized by G-CSF. We subsequently investigated the effect of increasing G-CSF dose on PBSC mobilization during steady-state hematopoiesis in healthy adult donors. The results indicate that not only committed but also primitive progenitor cells are mobilized into the circulation in a dose-and time-dependent manner when G-CSF at 5, 10, or 15 micrograms/kg was given on each of 5 days and leukapheresis was performed on day 6. From our data we estimate that sufficient PBSC for engraftment after allogeneic PBSC transplantation can be collected on day 5 of administration of G-CSF at 10 micrograms/kg and by 10-1 leukapheresis on days 5 and 6. Furthermore, we found that some G-CSF-mobilized PBSC retained their self-renewal capability. These observations suggest that hematopoietic stem cells for allogeneic PBSC transplantation can be mobilized by short-term administration of relatively high-dose G-CSF.","['Harada, M', 'Teshima, T', 'Fujisaki, T', 'Mizuno, S', 'Miyamoto, T', 'Takamatsu, Y', 'Kubota, A', 'Ohno, Y', 'Kuroiwa, M', 'Takenaka, K', 'Eto, T', 'Akashi, K', 'Gondo, H', 'Okamura, T', 'Inaba, S', 'Niho, Y']","['Harada M', 'Teshima T', 'Fujisaki T', 'Mizuno S', 'Miyamoto T', 'Takamatsu Y', 'Kubota A', 'Ohno Y', 'Kuroiwa M', 'Takenaka K', 'Eto T', 'Akashi K', 'Gondo H', 'Okamura T', 'Inaba S', 'Niho Y']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Okayama University Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,['143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002800051051 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1996;38 Suppl:S115-9. doi: 10.1007/s002800051051.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro, it enhances the growth of early progenitors and promotes megakaryocytopoiesis and erythropoiesis. In healthy animals, IL-11 administration stimulates megakaryocyte maturation and increases peripheral platelet counts. IL-11 accelerates the recovery of peripheral neutrophil, erythrocyte, and platelet counts in mice that have undergone cytoablative treatment. Therefore, IL-11 may be useful clinically as an agent promoting recovery from hematopoiesis. However, its clinical use in patients with hematological malignancies may be restricted because IL-11 has been reported to stimulate some leukemia and myeloma cells. In the United States, phase I trials have shown that IL-11 accelerates recovery from chemotherapy-induced or bone-marrow transplantation (BMT)-induced thrombocytopenia. In Japan, phase II trials studying the thrombopoietic effect of IL-11 in patients with solid tumors postchemotherapy, in patients undergoing BMT, and in patients with aplastic or refractory anemia are now under way. Recently, thrombopoietin (TPO) has been cloned, and its thrombopoietic effect and accelerating effect on platelet count recovery in thrombopoietic states have been demonstrated in animal models. The physiological effect of TPO is restricted to hematopoiesis; therefore, it may have fewer side effects than IL-11. However, in addition to its hematopoietic effect, IL-11 administration to mice that have undergone cytoablative therapy significantly decreases morbidity and mortality due to chemotherapy-related endogenous infections caused by gut microorganisms. Therefore, IL-11 can be used in patients postchemotherapy and post-BMT not only to promote platelet recovery but also to prevent life-threatening infections. The use of in-vitro-expanded hematopoietic stem cells for BMT or as target cells for gene therapy is one of the most exciting areas in the field of medicine. Since IL-11 can expand hematopoietic progenitor-cell populations when used in combination with other cytokines, it may be useful as an ex vivo hematopoietic progenitor-cell-amplifying agent.","['Teramura, M', 'Kobayashi, S', 'Yoshinaga, K', 'Iwabe, K', 'Mizoguchi, H']","['Teramura M', 'Kobayashi S', 'Yoshinaga K', 'Iwabe K', 'Mizoguchi H']","[""Department of Hematology, Tokyo Women's Medical College, Japan.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,['0 (Interleukin-11)'],IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic/drug therapy', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-11/*pharmacology', 'Megakaryocytes/*drug effects', 'Thrombocytopenia/etiology/*therapy']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002800051048 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1996;38 Suppl:S99-102. doi: 10.1007/s002800051048.,,27,,,,,,,,,,,,

These findings suggest that in four of eight animal models in which cancer cachexia syndrome developed, LIF, IL-6, or possibly IL-11 produced by cancer cells may be toxohormones, but in the remaining four cancer cell lines the mechanism responsible for cachexia syndrome remains unknown.","['Kajimura, N', 'Iseki, H', 'Tanaka, R', 'Ohue, C', 'Otsubo, K', 'Gyoutoku, M', 'Sasaki, K', 'Akiyama, Y', 'Yamaguchi, K']","['Kajimura N', 'Iseki H', 'Tanaka R', 'Ohue C', 'Otsubo K', 'Gyoutoku M', 'Sasaki K', 'Akiyama Y', 'Yamaguchi K']","['Growth Factor Division, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.1.1.34 (Lipoprotein Lipase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cachexia/*etiology/metabolism', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lipoprotein Lipase/metabolism', 'Lymphokines/*biosynthesis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*complications/genetics/metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002800051038 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1996;38 Suppl:S48-52. doi: 10.1007/s002800051038.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this work the growth promoting effects of Primatone RL are described in more detail using different mouse hybridomas, a mouse myeloma cell line, and human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells. The positive effects on cell growth induced by Primatone were observed in the presence of serum but were even more pronounced in serum-free culture. In addition the adaptation time from high serum to low (1%) or serum-free growth in the presence of Primatone is also significantly reduced. Primatone RL, when added to HL and DHI medium, improves cell growth under low serum or serum-free conditions by increasing the maximum cell numbers and in particular the viability of the culture. The observed decrease in cell death (apoptosis) induction leads to a significant improvement in antibody (recombinant protein) production by increasing the volumetric yields during long-term batch culture.

The molecular basis for this immunosuppression remains unclear. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isolated from patients show markedly decreased interleukin (IL)-2 secretion but unaffected or even increased T helper (Th)2 cytokine production. T cell functional defects were recently reported to correlate more with T cell receptor (TcR) signaling, whereas signals provided by ligation of co-receptors CD27 and CD28 appeared to be preserved. Among the various mechanisms proposed to be involved in HIV-1-induced T cell dysfunction, we and others have reported that the nef gene product exhibited significant immunosuppressive activity. By using an inducible stably integrated nef gene, we demonstrated that Nef specifically down-regulated IL-2 and interferon (IFN)-gama produced upon TcR triggering. Here, using the same experimental system, we extended our initial observations to additional mitogenic signals, and investigated the co-stimulatory function of CD28. Nef down-regulated IL-2, but not IL-4 produced upon induction by combinations of mitogens that mimicked TcR signals together with CD28 mAb or CD28's natural ligand (CD80 and CD86). However, the co-signals provided by CD28 to up-regulate IL-2 induction were unaffected by Nef, since IL-2 produced by nef-transfected cells was proportionally enhanced to the same extent as that of control cells, either upon stimulation by the CD28 mAb or CD80 and CD86. In addition, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase recruitment induced upon CD28 triggering was also found to be unaltered by nef expression. Together with the observation that similar levels of the Nef protein were detected in nef-transfected cells and upon infection of PBMC, these data suggest a selective immunosuppression induced by nef in human T cells by altering TcR signaling without detectable impact on CD28 co-receptor function. These data agree with the T cell defects observed in PBMC isolated from HIV-infected individuals.","['Collette, Y', 'Mawas, C', 'Olive, D']","['Collette Y', 'Mawas C', 'Olive D']","['INSERM, Unite 119, Marseilles, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (Gene Products, nef)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (nef Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))']",IM,"['CD28 Antigens/*immunology/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/immunology', 'Gene Products, nef/metabolism', 'Genes, nef/*physiology', 'HIV-1/*genetics', 'Humans', '*Immune Tolerance', 'Interleukin-2/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-4/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, T-Cell', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/immunology/virology', 'Ligands', 'Lymphocyte Activation/genetics', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/metabolism', 'Protein Binding/immunology', 'Signal Transduction/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/enzymology/*immunology/metabolism', 'Transfection/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation/genetics/immunology', 'nef Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.1830260819 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1996 Aug;26(8):1788-93. doi: 10.1002/eji.1830260819.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using cultured autologous dendritic cells pulsed with these peptides, CTL lines were induced from peripheral blood lymphocytes that displayed reactivity with HLA-A2+, Melan-A/MART-1+ melanoma cells. CTL reactivity against the immunodominant epitope could be induced with the nonamer epitope alone, but not with the decamer variant. CTL clones generated from an (EAAGIGILTV + AAGIGILTV)-induced CTL line recognize the appropriate melanoma cells and normal melanocytes. Upon further characterization of one of these CTL clones, it was found to be of surprisingly high affinity considering that it is directed against a self antigen. This study demonstrates that immunogenic peptides can be selected based on stability (half-life) of peptide/HLA binding.

In this paper we further investigated the mechanism of the dysfunction of DC. DC from infected animals did not cause anergy of T cells during coculture for 3 or 6 days. They did not release a substantial amount of soluble factors which could suppress T cell responses. The low T cell responses on stimulation using RLV-infected DC could be overcome by the addition of control DC. Pretreatment of these control DC with monoclonal antibody against MHC class II molecules completely blocked their ability to restore stimulation of T cells in the presence of infected DC. However, antibody against MHC class I or mismatched MHC class II molecules did not prevent restoration of function. The reduced labeling of surface MHC class II molecules previously reported was shown to reflect a loss in total class II molecules within the cells; MHC class I levels were unaltered by exposure to the virus. In DC from RLV-infected mice biosynthesis of MHC class II was decreased by around 50% at the transcriptional level in comparison with beta-actin. Thus, the down-regulation of surface class II molecules observed in DC following RLV infection is a consequence of a specific block in its biosynthesis and the failure of DC to stimulate T cells may be a direct consequence of the reduced class II levels. Since reduced stimulation by DC is also seen in HIV-1 infection in humans we speculate that a similar mechanism might operate in retroviral infection in man.","['Gabrilovich, D I', 'Patterson, S', 'Timofeev, A V', 'Harvey, J J', 'Knight, S C']","['Gabrilovich DI', 'Patterson S', 'Timofeev AV', 'Harvey JJ', 'Knight SC']","['Antigen Presentation Group, Imperial College of Science, Technology, and Medicine, Middlesex, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Immunol Immunopathol,Clinical immunology and immunopathology,0356637,['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology/metabolism/virology', 'Down-Regulation/immunology', 'Female', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/biosynthesis', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Rauscher Virus/*immunology', 'Retroviridae Infections/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/virology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*immunology']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0090122996901075 [pii]', '10.1006/clin.1996.0107 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Immunol Immunopathol. 1996 Aug;80(2):139-46. doi: 10.1006/clin.1996.0107.,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The marked compensatory increase in extracellular polyamine influx may be a reason for the unsatisfactory clinical chemotherapeutic effect of polyamine synthesis blockers like difluoromethylornithine (DFMO). In this study, a polymeric conjugate of SPM (poly-SPM) that blocks the import of polyamines into mammalian cells was used to test the potential therapeutic exploitation of the polyamine transport system in anticancer therapy. Our results indicate that a temperature-dependent polyamine transport system is expressed in two human cancer cell lines, MES-SA uterine sarcoma cells, K562 leukemic cells and their respective multiple drug resistance (MDR) positive counterparts, Dx5 and K562/R7 cells. The V(max) values for 14C-PUT and 14C-SPD uptake were significantly higher in MES-SA than in Dx5 cells, whereas the respective Km values were significantly lower. Addition of 20 microM poly-SPM reduced both the uptake of 14C-polyamines and the cellular polyamine contents in both cancer cell lines. In addition, the poly-SPM conjugate evoked a concentration-dependent cytotoxicity in MES-SA and K562 cells and their MDR-positive variants. Presence of aminoguanidine, an amine oxidase blocker, failed to alter the IC50 values generated with poly-SPM, which indicates that this polymer is not a substrate for amine oxidase. Moreover, coadministration of 25 microM SPD reversed the cytotoxic effect exerted by poly-SPM on both the MES-SA and Dx5 cells as reflected by an increase in their IC50 values. Relative to parental cells, the MDR-positive variants exhibited a lower 14C-polyamine uptake rate and were more resistant to the cytotoxic effect of poly-SPM. Pretreatment with 1 mM DFMO for 24 hr significantly increased polyamine transport, but failed to reduce intracellular SPM contents or exert a cytotoxic effect in both cancer cell lines. On other hand, the combination of DFMO and poly-SPM produced a greater depletion of polyamine content accompanied by a higher cytotoxicity than either agent alone. These results provide the first direct evidence that pharmacologic interruption of polyamine uptake may be an effective approach to cancer therapy. In addition, it appears that expression of MDR influences polyamine transport and renders cells more resistant to the cytotoxic effects of SPM polymer.","['Aziz, S M', 'Gillespie, M N', 'Crooks, P A', 'Tofiq, S F', 'Tsuboi, C P', 'Olson, J W', 'Gosland, M P']","['Aziz SM', 'Gillespie MN', 'Crooks PA', 'Tofiq SF', 'Tsuboi CP', 'Olson JW', 'Gosland MP']","['Division of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, College of Pharmacy, A.B.

Sequences flanking PPPPYV motif can be deleted without any effect on budding. Defects caused by L-domain deletions can be rescued by placing a wild-type copy of the sequence at several other positions in RSV Gag. A proline-rich P(S/T)APP motif is found in many retroviral Gag polyproteins; the motif found in the p6 region of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 has been implicated in late functions of the virus. Substitution of the RSV L domain with this motif in a 10-amino-acid sequence derived from visna leukemia virus results in wild-type release of virus particles from cells.

SL3-3 (SL3) is a murine leukemia virus that induces T-cell lymphomas. The LTR enhancer of this virus contains two binding sites for the transcription factor CBF (also called AML1 and PEBP2) that flank binding sites for c-Myb and the Ets family of factors. Using cotransfection assays in P19 cells, we report here that CBF and c-Myb cooperatively stimulate transcription from the SL3 LTR. By itself, c-Myb had no stimulatory effect on transcription. However, when cotransfected with a cDNA encoding one form of the alpha subunit of CBF called CBFalpha2-451, a level of transactivation higher than that seen with CBFalpha2-451 alone was detected. The negative regulatory domain near the carboxyl terminus of c-Myb did not affect this activity. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated that CBF and c-Myb bind to DNA independently. Therefore, it appears that the cooperative stimulation of transcription by these factors occurs at a step in the process of transcription after the two factors are bound to the enhancer. Sequences near the carboxyl terminus of CBFalpha2-451 were important for cooperativity with c-Myb, consistent with previous reports that this region contains an activation domain. However, CBFalpha2-451 failed to activate transcription from a version of the SL3 LTR in which the enhancer was replaced with five tandem CBF-binding sites. Thus, it appears that transcriptional activation of the SL3 enhancer by CBF requires that an appropriate heterologous transcription factor be bound to a neighboring site in the regulatory sequences.","['Zaiman, A L', 'Lenz, J']","['Zaiman AL', 'Lenz J']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York 10461, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Core Binding Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Core Binding Factors', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic/*genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Transcriptional Activation/*genetics']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.70.8.5618-5629.1996 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1996 Aug;70(8):5618-29. doi: 10.1128/JVI.70.8.5618-5629.1996.,"['CA44822/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA55337/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM7288/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,PMC190522,,,,,,,

The N terminus of v-Myb functions as the DNA-binding domain, and multiple central and C-terminal regions of this protein have been reported to function in transcriptional activation of model reporter genes. We showed previously that a C-terminal domain (amino acids 296 to 371) is required for transcriptional activation and transformation of primary chicken myelomonocytic cells. In this study, we have now analyzed a series of C-terminal mutants of v-Myb to further investigate this domain. A strong correlation was observed between transcriptional activation and leukemic transformation by this series of mutants. Furthermore, deletion analyses demonstrate that the C-terminal 41 amino acids of v=MybAMV (amino acids 331 to 371 of the Myb portion) are nonessential whereas further deletion of amino acids 321 to 330 (EFAETLQLID) results in a nonfunctional protein. Hence, we defined a 10-amino-acid subregion (the ""FAETL"" motif) required for transcriptional activation and oncogenic transformation by v-Myb Amv. The FAETL region is part of a putative leucine zipper structure and lies near a cluster of phosphorylation sites. Our analysis of mutants with substitutions of the zipper leucines or multiple adjacent phosphorylation sites demonstrates that the function of the FAETL motif is not dependent on an intact leucine zipper structure or adjacent phosphorylation sites. The study of GAL4-Myb fusions suggests that this region is important in maintaining a fully functional conformation of v-Myb. The putative leucine zipper structure has previously been proposed to exert inhibitory effects on c-Myb because its mutation caused increased transcriptional transactivation and transformation. Interestingly, our results show that this region is essential for the functions of v-Myb without requiring a heptad leucine repeat.","['Fu, S L', 'Lipsick, J S']","['Fu SL', 'Lipsick JS']","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University, California 94305-5324, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins v-myb)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/*virology', 'Avian Myeloblastosis Virus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Transformation, Viral/*genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chickens', 'Leucine Zippers/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis', 'Oncogene Proteins v-myb', 'Retroviridae Infections/*virology', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/*genetics', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.70.8.5600-5610.1996 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1996 Aug;70(8):5600-10. doi: 10.1128/JVI.70.8.5600-5610.1996.,['R01 CA43592/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,PMC190520,,,,,,,

We have developed retrovirus packaging cell lines based on 10A1 virus to take advantage of this dual receptor utilization to improve gene transfer rates in somatic cells of animals and humans, in which the relative levels of the two receptors are not always known. Optimization of the Env expression vector allowed the generation of packaging lines that produce helper-free vector titers up to 10(7)/ml. By interference analysis, we found that a 10A1 pseudotype retroviral vector can utilize Ram-1 for efficient entry into mouse, rat, and human cells and can utilize Glvr-1 for entry into mouse and human cells but not for entry into rat cells. The 10A1 pseudotype vector efficiently enters mouse cells by using Glvr-1, while entry into human cells is much less efficient. Thus, the 10A1 pseudotype packaging cells may be advantageous compared with the standard amphotropic packaging cells because vectors produced by the cells can use an additional receptor for cell entry. These packaging cells will also be useful to further explore the complicated pattern of receptor usage conferred by the 10A1 viral surface protein.","['Miller, A D', 'Chen, F']","['Miller AD', 'Chen F']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington 98109, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Receptors, Virus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Virus/*genetics', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Virus Assembly/*genetics']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.70.8.5564-5571.1996 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1996 Aug;70(8):5564-71. doi: 10.1128/JVI.70.8.5564-5571.1996.,"['DK47754/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL36444/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL53750/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,"['GENBANK/U51729', 'GENBANK/U51730']",,,,PMC190516,,,,,,,

A. Benton, J. W. Murphy, and R. E. Lloyd Virology 213:7-18, 1995). It is well documented that hemin induces the differentiation of K562 cells and alters the expression of several host proteins. We report here that growth of K562 cells in hemin prior to poliovirus infection results in a dose-dependent increase in virus-induced cell lysis and thereby alters the normally persistent outcome of infection to a more lytic phenotype. K562 cells infected after hemin treatment displayed increased host translation shutoff, p220 cleavage, viral protein synthesis, and viral RNA accumulation compared with nontreated cells. Since hemin treatment of K562 cells also induced the increased expression of several heat shock proteins (Hsp70, Hsc70, Hsp90, and cohort p60), we tested the hypothesis that their increased expression may play a role in altering poliovirus infection in hemin-treated K562 cells.

Rex-mediated regulation correlates with specific binding to a cognate RNA recognition element which overlaps the 5' splice site in the viral long terminal repeat. It has been unclear whether Rex directly affects splicing or only nuclear-to-cytoplasmic transport of viral mRNA. We demonstrate that HTLV-2 Rex is a potent inhibitor of splicing in vitro at an early step in spliceosome assembly. Inhibition requires phosphorylation of Rex and the ability of Rex to bind to the Rex response element. Direct inhibition of early spliceosome assembly by Rex may account for differential accumulation of unspliced transcripts and represents a novel mechanism of retroviral gene regulation.,"['Bakker, A', 'Li, X', 'Ruland, C T', 'Stephens, D W', 'Black, A C', 'Rosenblatt, J D']","['Bakker A', 'Li X', 'Ruland CT', 'Stephens DW', 'Black AC', 'Rosenblatt JD']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, UCLA School of Medicine, California 90024-1678, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, rex)', '0 (RNA Precursors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Products, rex/*genetics/pharmacology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA Precursors/*genetics', 'RNA Splicing/*drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/drug effects/*genetics', 'RNA, Viral/drug effects/genetics', 'Spliceosomes/drug effects/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/ultrastructure/*virology']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.70.8.5511-5518.1996 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1996 Aug;70(8):5511-8. doi: 10.1128/JVI.70.8.5511-5518.1996.,"['CA53632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K11CA01566/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R29CA 61545/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,PMC190509,,,,,,,

Conclusive evidence for the role of Tax in the HTLV malignant process has been impeded by the inability to mutate tax in the context of an infectious virus and dissociate viral replication from cellular transformation. To circumvent this problem we constructed a mutant of HTLV type 2 (HTLV-2) that replicates by a Tax-independent mechanism. For these studies, the Tax response element in the viral long terminal repeat was replaced with the cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter enhancer (C-enh). Transcription of the chimeric HTLV-2 (HTLVC-enh) was efficiently directed by this heterologous promoter. Also, the chimeric virus transformed primary human T lymphocytes with an efficiency similar to that of wild-type HTLV-2. A tax-knockout virus, termed HTLVC-enhDeltaTax, was constructed to directly assess the importance of Tax in cellular transformation. Transfection and infection studies indicated that HTLVC-enhDeltaTax was replication competent; however, HTLVC-enhDeltaTax failed to transform primary human T lymphocytes. We conclude that Tax is essential for HTLV-mediated transformation of human T lymphocytes.

By measuring infectivities, encapsidation and splicing efficiencies, and endogenous reverse transcription levels of motif A, B, C, and D deletion mutants, we identified mutations which affect replication at the encapsidation step. In particular, deletion of all four motifs in a single mutant eliminated encapsidation of viral RNA, while deletion of individual elements moderately reduced the encapsidation efficiencies. Through analysis of different deletion combinations, we found that deletion of the first two motifs (A plus B) reduced both encapsidation and reverse transcription efficiencies, while deletion of the 3' motifs (C plus D) eliminated encapsidation. Interestingly, the C and D motifs both contain a GACG loop sequence and are highly conserved among murine type C retroviruses. Our results indicate that M-MuLV motifs C and D are necessary for efficient encapsidation, and the presence of at least one of these two stem-loops is crucial to encapsidation and virus replication.","['Mougel, M', 'Zhang, Y', 'Barklis, E']","['Mougel M', 'Zhang Y', 'Barklis E']","['Vollum Institute for Advanced Biomedical Research, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland 97201-3098, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Point Mutation', 'RNA Splicing/genetics', 'RNA, Viral/*genetics', 'Virus Replication/genetics']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.70.8.5043-5050.1996 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1996 Aug;70(8):5043-50. doi: 10.1128/JVI.70.8.5043-5050.1996.,['1R01 GM52914-01/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,PMC190458,,,,,,,

We have characterized the effects of three such compounds on Moloney murine leukemia virus (MuLV). We find that, as with HIV-1, the compounds inactivate cell-free MuLV particles and induce disulfide cross-linking of NC in these particles. The killed MuLV particles were found to be incapable of synthesizing full-length viral DNA upon infection of a new host cell. When MuLV particles are synthesized in the presence of one of these compounds, the normal maturational cleavage of the Gag polyprotein does not occur. The compounds have no effect on the infectivity of human foamy virus, a spumaretrovirus lacking zinc fingers in its NC protein. The resistance of foamy virus supports the hypothesis that the zinc fingers are the targets for inactivation of MuLV and HIV- I by the compounds. The absolute conservation of the zinc finger motif among oncoretroviruses and lentiviruses and the lethality of all known mutations altering the zinc-binding residues suggest that only the normal, wild-type structure can efficiently perform all of its functions. This possibility would make the zinc finger an ideal target for antiretroviral agents.","['Rein, A', 'Ott, D E', 'Mirro, J', 'Arthur, L O', 'Rice, W', 'Henderson, L E']","['Rein A', 'Ott DE', 'Mirro J', 'Arthur LO', 'Rice W', 'Henderson LE']","['Retroviral Genetics Section, ABL-Basic Research Program, SAIC-Frederick, National Cancer Institute, Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, Maryland 21702-1201, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,['0 (Antiviral Agents)'],IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/metabolism/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Capsid/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy/*virology', 'Mice', 'Retroviridae Infections/drug therapy/*virology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/drug therapy/*virology', 'Zinc Fingers/*drug effects']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.70.8.4966-4972.1996 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1996 Aug;70(8):4966-72. doi: 10.1128/JVI.70.8.4966-4972.1996.,,,,,,,PMC190449,,,,,,,

Since HTLV-1 is a persistent virus, an efficient vaccine will probably require a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response in addition to the production of antibodies. To identify potential CTL epitopes, we have selected, within all of the HTLV-1 proteins, nonapeptides containing anchor residues required for association with HLA-A2 molecules (residues at positions 2 and 9), which is the most frequently occurring A allele in all human populations. A set of 111 peptides was synthetized and tested in vitro in two assembly assays using processing-defective T2 cells. Anchor motifs selected were those containing two major anchor residues (L2/M2/12-V9/L9/I9) (one letter amino-acid code) and those including tolerated anchor residues (V2/A2/T2 and/or A9/M9/T9). The analysis of the binding capacity of the peptides confirms the high efficiency of the L2-V9 anchor motif and shows that a systematic research of potential binding peptides should exclude peptides containing known detrimental residues rather than select only peptides with known favored residues. We show that 39 peptides representative of all the HTLV-1 proteins are able to bind to HLA-A2 molecules. Strong binder peptides which are very likely good CTL epitopes were identified in three HTLV-1 proteins, Tax, envelope, and polymerase. Three of the strong binder peptides correspond to previously described HLA-A2-restricted CTL epitopes in the Tax protein, and two others are localized in a domain of the viral envelope recognized by natural neutralizing antibodies.

A few such patients, however, enjoy long-term survival. The objective of this study was to identify clinical characteristics of patients with hematologic malignancy and respiratory failure that are predictive of outcome. METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of all patients who required mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory failure while on the leukemia or bone marrow transplantation units at the Johns Hopkins Oncology Center between January 1985 and October 1991 (n = 157). RESULTS: Overall hospital mortality was 83%. Major organ system dysfunction, as measured by the acute physiology score (APS) of the APACHE III prognostic system, was significantly (P < 0.05) related to hospital mortality. Three disease-specific clinical characteristics were predictive of mortality: 1) stage beyond first complete remission, 2) duration of neutropenia greater than 30 days, and 3) treatment with bone marrow transplantation, especially if HLA-mismatched. None of the 15 (10%) patients with neutropenia greater than 30 days or the four patients who underwent HLA-mismatched transplantation survived to discharge. Age was also a significant predictor of hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Overall outcome of patients with hematologic malignancy and acute respiratory failure is poor. A larger prospective study will be required to confirm the relative value of disease-specific variables identified in this study when combined with established predictive variables. In the future, it may be possible to develop a predictive instrument that is specifically tailored for patients with hematologic malignancy who develop respiratory failure.","['Epner, D E', 'White, P', 'Krasnoff, M', 'Khanduja, S', 'Kimball, K T', 'Knaus, W A']","['Epner DE', 'White P', 'Krasnoff M', 'Khanduja S', 'Kimball KT', 'Knaus WA']","['Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Baltimore, MD, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Investig Med,Journal of investigative medicine : the official publication of the American Federation for Clinical Research,9501229,,IM,"['APACHE', 'Adult', 'Baltimore/epidemiology', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications/mortality/*therapy', 'Lymphoma/complications/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', '*Respiration, Artificial', 'Respiratory Insufficiency/etiology/mortality/therapy', 'Survivors/statistics & numerical data', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Investig Med. 1996 Jun;44(5):254-60.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, the shape of the oxygen dependence curves and the K(m) values for radiation-induced SBs and DPCs were measured by alkaline elution for two human leukaemia cell lines, CEM and CEM/VM-1, whose nuclear matrix-associated topoisomerase II varied substantially in quantity, activity and binding properties.

The azide radical (generated radiolytically) reacted with HOG to produce a carbon-centred radical which in the absence of oxygen decays by a first-order process (k = 3.2 x 10(3) s-1) to yield nitric oxide (NO) and urea. Although the HOG radical reacts rapidly with oxygen (rate constant for O2 addition, k = 4.2 x 10(8) dm3 mol-1 s-1) this neither prevented the elimination of NO. nor generated alternative nitrogen oxides (e.g. peroxynitrite) capable of contributing to cellular oxidative stress. The detection of NO. in HL60 cells corroborated mechanistic studies that oxidative denitrification of HOG does not require catalysis by nitric oxide synthase. Quantitation of NO. by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy (utilising a NO. -selective probe) shows higher amounts of NO. under anoxic conditions, reflecting competition for NO. with molecular oxygen in oxic cells. Inhibition of cytochrome P450 and myeloperoxidase activity decreased NO. production thereby identifying these enzyme systems as capable of oxidizing HOG in vitro. A correlation exists between the intracellular levels of NO. with both the cytotoxic and cytostatic effects of HOG within HL60 cells. A higher toxicity was observed with hypoxic than with oxic cells. The lower levels of NO. associated with aerobic conditions caused a G1 --> S block in the cell cycle which under anoxia potentiated NO. -induced apoptotic cell death.","['Everett, S A', 'Smith, K A', 'Patel, K B', 'Dennis, M F', 'Stratford, M R', 'Wardman, P']","['Everett SA', 'Smith KA', 'Patel KB', 'Dennis MF', 'Stratford MR', 'Wardman P']","['Gray Laboratory Cancer Research Trust, Mount Vernon Hospital, Northwood, Middlesex, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer Suppl,The British journal of cancer.

The second patient was also pale with hematoma on his legs so that AL could be rapidly recognised. An initial diagnosis of Scheuermann disease was proposed for the third patient in whom hemogram was performed due to worsening of his general condition.

A questionnaire of the daily activities of a child according to Lickert's criteria was done. A pilot survey was performed in patients without a chronic or disabling disease in order to assess its validity. The impression of the medical attendance of each pediatric patient with leukemia, of their daily performance, was compared with the results of the instrument. A trained nurse applied the questionnaire to 60 mothers of patients (29 female/31 male) as outpatients during the clinical review. Fifteen questionnaires were applied twice to evaluate its consistency. According to the results, 77% of the patients were in remission. 15% in relapse, and 8% during induction to remission. The mean age of the patients was 9 = 3.6 years, ranging from 2-16 years. One hundred percent of the patients obtained a satisfactory grade greater than 35 points. In conclusion, the questionnaire identified adequately the level of the daily performance in addition to the specific affected areas of the patients with leukemia. Our findings are that their level of performance is satisfactory and is not affected because of the disease or the phase of the treatment.","['Arias-Gomez, J', 'Hernandez-Hernandez, D', 'Benitez-Aranda, H', 'Villasis-Keever, M A', 'Bernaldez-Rios, R', 'Martinez-Garcia, M C']","['Arias-Gomez J', 'Hernandez-Hernandez D', 'Benitez-Aranda H', 'Villasis-Keever MA', 'Bernaldez-Rios R', 'Martinez-Garcia MC']","['Servicio de Escolares y Adolescenies, Hospital de Pediatria Centro Medico Nacional Siglo XXI, Mexico D.F.']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Mexico,Gac Med Mex,Gaceta medica de Mexico,0010333,,IM,"['*Activities of Daily Living', 'Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', '*Leukemia/psychology', 'Male', 'Pilot Projects', '*Quality of Life', '*Surveys and Questionnaires']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Gac Med Mex. 1996 Jan-Feb;132(1):19-28.,,,,,,,,Un instrumento para medir la calidad de vida por medio del desempeno diario en pacientes pediatricos con leucemia.,,,,,,

METHODS: The study population comprised 32 patients with AML in remission, followed for a median of 18 months. A mean of four studies was carried out per patient. Three patterns of in vitro growth based on the number of CFU-GM in normal bone marrow were defined: 1 = normal (normal number of CFU-GM and a cluster:colony ratio < 2); 2 = hypoplastic (low number of CFU-GM and a cluster:colony ratio < 2); 3 = anomalous (low or normal number of CFU-GM and a cluster:colony ratio > 2). RESULTS: Eleven patients relapsed, all of whom had previously displayed an abnormal CFU-GM pattern: anomalous in nine and hypoplastic in two. The remaining 25 patients were in complete remission at the time of writing, 16 of whom had a normal growth pattern. The other nine had anomalous (eight patients) or hypoplastic (one patient) growth. The latter may be false positive results. The in vitro growth pattern was not constant during follow up analysis. All 15 patients in whom the growth pattern switched from abnormal to normal remain in complete remission. By contrast, of the five cases in whom the pattern changed from normal to abnormal, three have relapsed and the other two had other indicators of relapse. The growth pattern remained unchanged in the remaining 16 patients. CONCLUSION: The present data show that the sequential investigation of the CFU-GM growth pattern may be of value in predicting relapse in patients with AML.","['del Canizo, M C', 'Mota, A', 'Orfao, A', 'Galende, J', 'Caballero, M D', 'Garcia Marcos, M A', 'San Miguel, J F']","['del Canizo MC', 'Mota A', 'Orfao A', 'Galende J', 'Caballero MD', 'Garcia Marcos MA', 'San Miguel JF']","['Departamento de Medicina, Universidad de Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,,IM,"['Bone Marrow/*pathology', '*Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Recurrence']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/jcp.49.6.450 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 1996 Jun;49(6):450-2. doi: 10.1136/jcp.49.6.450.,,,,,,,PMC500531,,,,,,,

There has been a considerable increase in recent years in its use in prophylaxis of aspergillosis in neutropenic patients. A total of 74 trough concentrations of itraconazole+active metabolite were retrospectively analysed at steady state in 16 patients admitted to hospital for acute myeloid leukaemia (12) or malignant lymphoma (4). The minimum therapeutic concentration (itraconazole+hydroxyitraconazole = 1000 ng/ml) was never reached in 31 per cent of patients (5/16) and a constant efficient plasma concentration was obtained in only 19 per cent (3/16) with a daily regimen of 400-600 mg. The plasma levels of patients at the same daily dose differed up to 15-fold. This study confirms the pronounced inter-patient variability of unchanged itraconazole concentrations previously found in volunteers and patients. The plasma levels in six patients during successive chemotherapy treatments also varied greatly. Intra-individual differences were more accurately examined in six patients given 600 mg itraconazole/day during their first chemotherapy treatment. The trough plasma concentrations on day 15 and day 25 varied from -53 to +245 per cent. These results indicate that the plasma itraconazole concentration of neutropenic patients must be monitored to ensure that each individual is given a clinically effective dose.","['Poirier, J M', 'Berlioz, F', 'Isnard, F', 'Cheymol, G']","['Poirier JM', 'Berlioz F', 'Isnard F', 'Cheymol G']","['Department of Pharmacology, Saint-Antoine Hospital, Paris, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],France,Therapie,Therapie,0420544,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '304NUG5GF4 (Itraconazole)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Antifungal Agents/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Aspergillosis/prevention & control', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Individuality', 'Itraconazole/administration & dosage/*blood/therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/complications', 'Time Factors']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Therapie. 1996 Mar-Apr;51(2):163-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Morphologically they are large granular lymphocytes, and phenotypically they commonly express CD16 and CD56 antigens, without expressing cell surface CD3. Although the developmental pathway of NK cells is not fully understood, they arise from CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells and, at least in part, differentiate in the bone marrow. They gain byctoplasmic CD3 gamma delta epsilon zeta antigens during maturation, and lose cytoplasmic CD3 gamma delta epsilon thereafter until the terminal maturation. Lymphoproliferative disorders of NK cells include NK cell-lineage granular lymphocyte-proliferative disorders (NK-GLPD), NK-cell lymphoma, and acute leukemia of NK-cell lineage. NK-GLPD are relatively rare. Most patients exhibit a chronic indolent clinical course, and do not require specific treatment. However, some patients exhibit an aggressive clinical course, and die of the disease despite extensive chemotherapy. This aggressive type NK-GLPD is caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Patients with NK-cell lymphoma are rare, and often exhibit necrotic lesion and angiocentric morphology. This tumor is mainly found in the nasal tract, but the true incidence of NK-cell lymphoma in nasal lymphomas is not known. Probably many lymphomas arising from the nasal cavity, but not from paranasal sinuses, are of NK-cell lineage. NK-cell lymphoma is also caused by EBV, and is resistant to combination chemotherapy. Acute leukemia of NK-cell lineage is very rare. Several cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and a single case of blast crisis of chronic myelogenous leukemia have been documented to have leukemic blasts characteristic of NK cells.

Our results demonstrated a rapid rate of both proliferation as well as apoptosis.

High levels of TNF-alpha were found to correlate with high levels of apoptosis in 83 MDS patients (P = 0.0045). We propose a dual role for TNF-alpha (or other cytokines) in the pathogenesis of MDS. On the one hand, TNF-alpha induces apoptosis in the maturing cells causing pancytopenia while on the other, it stimulates the proliferation of the primitive progenitors accounting for the hypercellular BM frequently seen in MDS. A new model for MDS is presented. The initial abnormality probably affects a primitive hemopoietic progenitor which acquires a growth advantage leading to monoclonal hemopoiesis, which in turn makes these cells susceptible towards acquiring additional mutations and appearance of cytogenetically marked (or unmarked) clones. Cytokines such as TNF-alpha whose source is presently unknown, then contribute towards the clinical syndrome of pancytopenia and hypercellularity.","['Raza, A', 'Mundle, S', 'Shetty, V', 'Alvi, S', 'Chopra, H', 'Span, L', 'Parcharidou, A', 'Dar, S', 'Venugopal, P', 'Borok, R', 'Gezer, S', 'Showel, J', 'Loew, J', 'Robin, E', 'Rifkin, S', 'Alston, D', 'Hernandez, B', 'Shah, R', 'Kaizer, H', 'Gregory, S']","['Raza A', 'Mundle S', 'Shetty V', 'Alvi S', 'Chopra H', 'Span L', 'Parcharidou A', 'Dar S', 'Venugopal P', 'Borok R', 'Gezer S', 'Showel J', 'Loew J', 'Robin E', 'Rifkin S', 'Alston D', 'Hernandez B', 'Shah R', 'Kaizer H', 'Gregory S']","[""Rush Cancer Institute, Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center, Chicago, IL 60612, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/analysis', '*Apoptosis', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Division', 'Cytokines/*physiology', 'DNA Replication', 'Disease Progression', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/blood/physiology', 'Leukemia/etiology', 'Models, Biological', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/blood/physiology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/analysis/physiology']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0925571096004550 [pii]', '10.1016/0925-5710(96)00455-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 1996 Jun;63(4):265-78. doi: 10.1016/0925-5710(96)00455-0.,,52,,,,,,,,,,,,

The RBL 2H3 cells, a rat basophilic leukaemia cell line, which express both transporters were used for comparison. The choriocarcinoma cells JAr and BeWo were found to possess the plasma membrane serotonin transporter as assessed by the presence of serotonin transport activity in intact cells that was Na(+)-dependent and was sensitive to inhibition by tricyclic and non-tricyclic antidepressants. The activity of the vesicular monoamine transporter in these cells was determined by measuring serotonin transport in digitonin-permeabilized cells. The transport in permeabilized cells was very slow, was not stimulated by ATP and was insensitive to inhibition by reserpine. Under similar conditions, the vesicular monoamine transporter activity was demonstrable in RBL cells, which was stimulated by ATP and was inhibitable by reserpine, bafilomycin A1 (an inhibitor of the V-type H(+)-pump) and carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxy phenylhydrazone (a protonophore which dissipates transmembrane H+ gradients). In corroboration with these findings, mRNA transcripts hybridizable to the vesicular monoamine transporter cDNA probe were detectable in RBL cells but not in JAr choriocarcinoma cells. Similarly, there was no evidence for the expression of the vesicular monoamine transporter as assessed by Northern blot analysis in normal trophoblasts which were maintained in culture to differentiate to form multinucleated syncytial cells.

We detected BCL-1 translocations in eight of eight patients with clinical and immunological features of mantle cell lymphoma, suggesting that the t(11;14) translocation is a critical event in the pathogenesis of MCL and may be a primary element for the diagnosis.

To investigate the site and nucleotide interactions involved in this process, a 531 bp DNA fragment encompassing sequences up- and downstream of the splice donor in human T cell leukaemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) was inserted into a plasmid vector under the control of the SP6 promoter. RNA transcripts generated in vitro from this template formed dimers which could be dissociated by heating at 60-80 degrees C for 3 min. The physical properties of the dimeric RNA were not consistent with either Watson-Crick base pairing or guanine tetrad formation as being solely responsible for the interaction. Deletion mutagenesis identified a 32 nt sequence required for dimerisation. Computer modelling was carried out in order to identify putative RNA secondary structures within this essential region. A stem-loop structure was identified, the stem of which was conserved among different sequenced isolates of HTLV-1. This sequence also contains a 15 nt palindrome.

The classical form of MDR is caused by a plasma-membrane protein currently named P-glycoprotein or P-170 encoded by the human mdr-1 gene in its functional isoform. In vitro cell lines expressing P-170 usually also present phenotypic and functional alterations. In the present study we report that the cytotoxicity mediated by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) in MDR variants of the human T-lymphoblastoid CEM cell line is associated with apoptosis (programmed cell death). Susceptibility of MDR cells to apoptosis was increased upon cycloheximide + TNF alpha sequential treatment, whereby the impairment of protein synthesis due to the former agent was followed by the effect of cytokine exposure. Massive apoptosis of P-170-positive cells, but not of controls, was also obtained by depletion of nutrients (i.e., serum starvation). In contrast, TNF-alpha exerted a similar apoptotic effect in epithelial (MCF-7) or myeloma (S8226) drug-sensitive/ -resistant cell pairs. However, the MDR variant of myeloma S8226 was more sensitive to the cytostatic effect of TNF alpha than the parental drug-sensitive cell line. These results suggest that the presence of the MDR phenotype may be associated with increased histotype-dependent cell susceptibility to specific, protein-synthesis-independent, apoptotic pathways.","['Malorni, W', 'Rainaldi, G', 'Tritarelli, E', 'Rivabene, R', 'Cianfriglia, M', 'Lehnert, M', 'Donelli, G', 'Peschele, C', 'Testa, U']","['Malorni W', 'Rainaldi G', 'Tritarelli E', 'Rivabene R', 'Cianfriglia M', 'Lehnert M', 'Donelli G', 'Peschele C', 'Testa U']","['Department of Ultrastructures, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*analysis', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Division', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Phenotype', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",1996/07/17 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/07/17 00:00'],"['1996/07/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/07/17 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19960717)67:2<238::AID-IJC15>3.0.CO;2-7 [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19960717)67:2<238::AID-IJC15>3.0.CO;2-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1996 Jul 17;67(2):238-47. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19960717)67:2<238::AID-IJC15>3.0.CO;2-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The combination of splenectomy and underlying immunosuppression may render these patients particularly susceptible to postsplenectomy infection, and thus we undertook a prospective trial of nonoperative management of the ruptured pathologic spleen. METHODS: Hemodynamically stable patients with preexisting pathologic splenomegaly and isolated splenic disruptions diagnosed by computed tomographic (CT) scan (American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) grades 1-4) requiring 2 or less units blood transfusion were prospectively studied. Patients were monitored in a critical care setting, and resolution of splenic disruption was followed by serial CT examinations. RESULTS: Nonoperative management was successful in all 11 patients (eight, HIV/AIDS; one each, acute leukemia, infectious mononucleosis, sickle cell anemia). The mean transfusion requirement was 0.7 units; the mean length of stay was 16 days. CONCLUSIONS: The pathologic spleen can heal after parenchymal disruption. While not appropriate for all patients, a subset of hemodynamically stable patients can be successfully managed nonoperatively using CT diagnosis, close clinical monitoring, and minimal transfusions.","['Guth, A A', 'Pachter, H L', 'Jacobowitz, G R']","['Guth AA', 'Pachter HL', 'Jacobowitz GR']","['Bellevue Hospital Center, New York University Medical Center, New York, New York 10016, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Trauma,The Journal of trauma,0376373,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'HIV Seropositivity/complications', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Rupture, Spontaneous', 'Splenic Rupture/etiology/*therapy', 'Splenomegaly/*complications/therapy', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Trauma Centers', 'Wounds, Nonpenetrating/complications/*therapy']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00005373-199608000-00003 [doi]'],ppublish,J Trauma. 1996 Aug;41(2):214-8. doi: 10.1097/00005373-199608000-00003.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These results have confirmed that the DNA deletion in the beta-globin gene cluster is the cause of persistent active expression of the G gamma globin gene in the Yunnanese mutant.","['Zhang, J', 'Qiao, J', 'Song, W', 'Qiu, Z']","['Zhang J', 'Qiao J', 'Song W', 'Qiu Z']","['Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, School of Basic Medicine, Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Sci China C Life Sci,"Science in China.

TAL1 encodes a bHLH protein that exhibits sequence-specific DNA binding activity when it forms dimers with another bHLH protein such as E2A. We show that ectopic expression of TAL1 blocks the ability of the bHLH gene myogenin to induce myotube differentiation in C3H10T1/2 cells. Cotransfection of TAL1 with either myogenin or E2-5 suppresses the transcriptional activation function of each gene on its respective reporter constructs. TAL1 was as effective as Id in both transcriptional suppression and inhibition of differentiation. Deletion of the C-terminal domain of TAL1 reduces or eliminates its ability to suppress transcription while preserving the bHLH domain that determines the sequence-specificity of DNA binding. These data suggest that the C-terminal domain of TAL1 may directly mask the transactivation domain of E2A-related proteins. Since E2A-related genes are involved in lymphocyte differentiation, the dominant inhibition of E2A-related proteins may be the primary mechanism by which the TAL1 oncogene promotes leukemia.","['Hofmann, T J', 'Cole, M D']","['Hofmann TJ', 'Cole MD']","['Department of Molecular Biology, Princeton University, New Jersey 08544-1014, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Myog protein, mouse)', '0 (Myogenin)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Fibroblasts/physiology', '*Helix-Loop-Helix Motifs', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Muscles/*cytology/physiology', 'Mutation', 'Myogenin/genetics/*physiology', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'TATA Box', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/physiology', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1996 Aug 1;13(3):617-24.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If no precise function has been assigned to any of these molecules, there are some indications that they could be involved in cell adhesion and cell migration, as well as malignant progression. The CD9 antigen is associated with surface proteins such as VLA integrins or HB-EGF precursor. Transfection of CD9 in melanoma cells reduces tumor growth and metastasis. The heterogenous distribution of the CD9 antigen suggests a complex regulation of its expression. We have previously characterized the CD9 gene and shown that transcription could be initiated at several sites in the TATA-less 5'-flanking region. We show here, using as a model two human leukemic cell lines with erythromegakaryocytic potential, HEL and K562, that the [-205, -154] region supports a promoter activity when cloned ahead of a CAT reporter gene. Mutagenesis analysis suggested the presence of a positive element located within the [-170, -154] region.

Between P0 and P7, kidneys from bcl-2 (-/-) and bcl-2 (+/+) mice undergo a comparable increase in weight and have similar histological appearances. However, during the next 2 wk of life, weight gain in kidneys from bcl-2 (-/-) mice is reduced compared with that in kidneys from bcl-2 (+/+) animals, and cysts develop in tubules with staining characteristics of proximal tubule, distal tubule/medullary thick ascending limb of Henle's loop, and collecting duct. Unaffected glomeruli and proximal tubules in kidneys of bcl-2 (-/-) mice undergo compensatory growth. Cystogenesis is accompanied by enhanced incorporation of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine in cells within cortex and medulla and apoptosis of cells within cysts and in the renal interstitium. Bax protein is expressed in the distal tubule in kidneys of bcl-2 (+/+) and bcl-2 (-/-) mice and in some, but not all cysts.

With a median follow-up of 73 months, the median disease-free survival (DFS) duration of all CR patients and the probability of CR at 6 years were 17 months and 29%. In multivariate analysis the only factor associated with an increased DFS duration was a normal karyotype. The median event-free survival (EFS) duration for all evaluable patients and the median overall survival duration for all eligible patients were respectively 7 and 12 months without any difference between induction arms. The study shows that in patients aged 50-65 idarabicin is more effective than zorubicin for remission induction. However, the type of anthracycline did not influence overall survival duration. Using a unique consolidation course, we observed a prolonged DFS which compares favourably with results obtained with more prolonged consolidation therapy or maintenance treatment.","['Pignon, B', 'Witz, F', 'Desablens, B', 'Leprise, P Y', 'Francois, S', 'Linassier, C', 'Berthou, C', 'Caillot, D', 'Lioure, B', 'Cahn, J Y', 'Casassus, P', 'Sadoun, A', 'Audhuy, B', 'Guyotat, D', 'Briere, J', 'Vilque, J P', 'Baranger, L', 'Polin, V', 'Berthaud, P', 'Hurteloup, P', 'Herve, P', 'Harousseau, J L']","['Pignon B', 'Witz F', 'Desablens B', 'Leprise PY', 'Francois S', 'Linassier C', 'Berthou C', 'Caillot D', 'Lioure B', 'Cahn JY', 'Casassus P', 'Sadoun A', 'Audhuy B', 'Guyotat D', 'Briere J', 'Vilque JP', 'Baranger L', 'Polin V', 'Berthaud P', 'Hurteloup P', 'Herve P', 'Harousseau JL']","[""Unite d'Hematologie Clinique, Hopital R.

By using an IFN alpha antiviral neutralization bioassay, the frequency of nIFN alpha 2a Abs was evaluated in 67Ph+ CML patients during IFN alpha 2a therapy at doses ranging from 6 to 9 MU/d. 15 patients (22%) developed nIFN alpha 2a Abs (titre ranging from 1:40 to 1:20480) and 11/15 (73%) were haematologically and/or karyotypically unresponsive to treatment. 52 patients did not develop antibodies and 11 of them (21%) were unresponsive. The negative relationship between the positivity for nIFN alpha 2a Abs and the response to treatment was highly significant (P = 0.0001). In nine nIFN alpha 2a Abs positive patients, treatment was changed from recombinant IFN alpha 2a to lymphoblastoid IFN alpha (IFN alpha-ly), at the same dose and schedule. After 9 months of IFN alpha-ly treatment a haematological response was achieved in 4/7 cases who were non-responsive to prior IFN alpha 2a therapy and was maintained in the other two patients previously responsive to IFN alpha 2a. However, no karyotypic response was observed. This data shows that a significant proportion of Ph+ CML patients receiving treatment with IFN alpha 2a can develop neutralizing antibodies and that these antibodies are associated with a loss of IFN alpha 2a efficacy. Changing the patients to treatment with lymphoblastoid IFN alpha may restore haematological response but it is not likely to induce a karyotypic response.","['Russo, D', 'Candoni, A', 'Zuffa, E', 'Minisini, R', 'Silvestri, F', 'Fanin, R', 'Zaja, F', 'Martinelli, G', 'Tura, S', 'Botta, G', 'Baccarani, M']","['Russo D', 'Candoni A', 'Zuffa E', 'Minisini R', 'Silvestri F', 'Fanin R', 'Zaja F', 'Martinelli G', 'Tura S', 'Botta G', 'Baccarani M']","['Department of Clinical and Morphologic Research, University Hospital Udine, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies/*analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/*immunology/therapeutic use', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Treatment Outcome']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.d01-1790.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1996 Aug;94(2):300-5. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.d01-1790.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Electromobility shift analysis revealed heat shock transcription factor (HSF1)-DNA binding when HeLa S3 and Jurkat cells were exposed to exogenous PLA2. Although PLA2-inducible HSF1-DNA binding was comparable to thermal stress, it did not induce maximal heat shock gene expression. PLA2-induced HSF1 was not hyperphosphorylated relative to the heat-inducible form, thus suggesting that exogenous PLA2 affects the signal for HSF1 multimerization but not its phosphorylation. Because inflammation often involves elevated temperatures, the effect of PLA2 on thermal regulation of HSF1-DNA binding activity was examined. PLA2 exposure altered the thermal threshold for HSF1 activation, and pore-gradient gel analysis indicated that either conformational changes or other modifications of HSF1 are being induced when cells are treated by PLA2, thus creating a synergistic environment for HSF1 activation into its DNA-bound state. Surprisingly, the monocyte-like cell line, U-937, was insensitive to the action of exogenous PLA2. Neither HSF1-DNA binding or lowering of the temperature threshold for HSF1 activation was observed in PLA2-treated U-937 cells. These data suggest that inflammatory mediators such as PLA2 partially affect transcriptional switches mediating thermal stress in some cell types but not others. The purpose of HSF1 activation during inflammation and its differential induction are discussed relative to these observations.","['Jurivich, D A', 'Pangas, S', 'Qiu, L', 'Welk, J F']","['Jurivich DA', 'Pangas S', 'Qiu L', 'Welk JF']","['Department of Veterans Affairs, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (HSF1 protein, human)', '0 (Heat Shock Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.1.1.32 (Phospholipases A)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Phospholipases A2)']",IM,"['Arachidonic Acid/pharmacology', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/chemistry/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'HeLa Cells', 'Heat Shock Transcription Factors', '*Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'Inflammation', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/pathology', 'Monocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Organ Specificity', 'Phospholipases A/*pharmacology', 'Phospholipases A2', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Stress, Physiological/*genetics/physiopathology', 'Transcription Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/08/15 00:00,1996/08/15 00:01,['1996/08/15 00:00'],"['1996/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1996 Aug 15;157(4):1669-77.,['AR30692/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Activation of the monocytic cell line THP-1, or freshly isolated peripheral blood monocytes with IFN-gamma, but not IL-3, GM-CSF, IL-6, or TNF-alpha, greatly sensitized the cells toward G28-5 sFv-PE40, lowering the EC50 value from > 10 micrograms/ml to 80 ng/ml. This sensitization could not be explained simply by the two- to threefold increase in cell surface CD40 expression induced by IFN-gamma since TNF-alpha or the combination of TNF-alpha and IL-6 gave similar increases in CD40 expression but did not sensitize the cells to the immunotoxin. Internalization of G28-5 sFv-PE40 after IFN-gamma activation was also increased threefold, reflective of the increase in CD40 expression. IFN-gamma-treated but not -untreated THP-1 cells produced IL-6 and TNF-alpha following incubation with G28-5 sFv-PE40, indicating an association between CD40 signaling, which induces cytokine production, and sensitivity to the immunotoxin.

The alpha subunit was overexpressed in a cultured mast cell line (RBL-2H3) known to contain G alpha z. In stimulated cells, overexpression of G alpha z significantly enhanced the production of TNF-alpha. This effect of G alpha z appeared to be restricted in that constitutive synthesis of the cytokine, TGF-beta, and Ag-stimulation of the phosphoinositide-dependent secretory pathway were not significantly affected.

Nevertheless, forskolin also inhibits PKC downstream events, such as c-jun expression, which is critical for the activation process of T cells. To further analyze potential cross points between positively and negatively regulating signaling pathways in T cells, we tested the effects of activators of the adenylate cyclase or PKA on two parallel mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways mediated by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase. Using a PKC-specific inhibitor, GF109203X, or PKC-depleted T cells, we found that a large part of the anti-CD3-induced ERK activation is PKC dependent. Both PKC-dependent and -independent activation of ERK were sensitive to inhibition by forskolin or a cell-permeable cAMP analogue, dbcAMP. Furthermore, the effect of 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate and ionomycin, which synergized to fully activate c-Jun N-terminal kinase, was also sensitive to inhibition by forskolin. Our results suggest that PKA inhibits T cell activation by interfering with multiple events along the two signaling pathways operating downstream of the TCR and the CD28 co-receptor molecules.","['Tamir, A', 'Granot, Y', 'Isakov, N']","['Tamir A', 'Granot Y', 'Isakov N']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Maleimides)', '0 (Mitogens)', '0 (Muromonab-CD3)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '1F7A44V6OU (Colforsin)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck))', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 4.6.1.1 (Adenylyl Cyclases)', 'L79H6N0V6C (bisindolylmaleimide I)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Adenylyl Cyclases/metabolism', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Bucladesine/pharmacology', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Colforsin/pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP/*pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'ErbB Receptors/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Isoenzymes/metabolism', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*drug effects', 'Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck)', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/pathology', 'Maleimides/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Mitogens/*pharmacology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Muromonab-CD3/pharmacology', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*metabolism', 'Peptide Fragments/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/*drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/immunology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/08/15 00:00,1996/08/15 00:01,['1996/08/15 00:00'],"['1996/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1996 Aug 15;157(4):1514-22.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tyrphostin A9, an inhibitor of the kinase activity of the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor, dramatically impaired the sustained elevation of cytosolic calcium concentration, induced by either CD3 mAbs, thapsigargin, ionomycin at low (10(-7) M) concentration, or passive depletion of intracellular stores; other tested tyrphostins, lavendustin, genistein, and compound 5 lacked significant effect. Tyrphostin A9, added during the plateau phase, was able to return cytosolic calcium to resting concentration. Likewise, it abrogated manganese entry in cells stimulated by CD3 or thapsigargin, measured by the quenching of the fluorescence of Indo-1. However, it did not measurably modify kinetics of intracellular calcium releases monitored in the absence of extracellular calcium, nor did it reverse the inhibition of phosphatidylserine that occurs as a consequence of emptying intracellular stores. Analyses of tyrosine phosphorylations demonstrated that A9 inhibited the phosphorylation of proteins, which occurred every time that internal calcium stores were depleted. These phosphorylations were not impaired by chelation of external Ca2+, nor by La3+ that inhibits calcium release-induced calcium entry. We concluded that their inhibition was not a consequence, but may be a cause, of the blockade of calcium release-activated channel by tyrphostin A9.","['Marhaba, R', 'Mary, F', 'Pelassy, C', 'Stanescu, A T', 'Aussel, C', 'Breittmayer, J P']","['Marhaba R', 'Mary F', 'Pelassy C', 'Stanescu AT', 'Aussel C', 'Breittmayer JP']","[""INSERM Unit 343, l'Archet Hospital, Nice, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Calcium Channels)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Ionophores)', '0 (Isoflavones)', '0 (Muromonab-CD3)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phenols)', '0 (Phosphatidylserines)', '0 (Terpenes)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '3Y0G32G2RV (lavendustin A)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', '67526-95-8 (Thapsigargin)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calcium Channels/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Depression, Chemical', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Extracellular Space/metabolism', 'Genistein', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Fluid/metabolism', 'Ionomycin/pharmacology', 'Ionophores/pharmacology', 'Isoflavones/pharmacology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*pathology', 'Muromonab-CD3/pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Phenols/pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylserines/biosynthesis', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Phosphotyrosine/biosynthesis', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/*drug effects', 'Terpenes/pharmacology', 'Thapsigargin', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1996/08/15 00:00,1996/08/15 00:01,['1996/08/15 00:00'],"['1996/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1996 Aug 15;157(4):1468-73.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Possible role in the recycling of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide metabolites.",1381-8,"The human leukocyte surface Ag CD38 was recently identified as a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)(+)-glycohydrolase ecto-enzyme, degrading NAD into nicotinamide and ADP-ribose. We show here that expression of CD38 is increased in the Jurkat T cell line after treatment with agents that augment intracellular cAMP, with the permeant cAMP analogue dibutyryl-cAMP (db-cAMP), and also with PMA, which activates protein kinase C. Treatment of human PBL T cells with db-cAMP or submitogenic doses of PMA also increased CD38 expression. Two other nucleotide-hydrolyzing activities were induced on the T cell surface concomitantly with CD38: the human PC-1 molecule, a nucleotide phosphodiesterase/pyrophosphatase that produces AMP from NAD or ADP-ribose, and a nucleotidase that produces adenosine from AMP, but which may be distinct from the CD73 5'-nucleotidase. All three enzymes were up-regulated after stimulation of human peripheral blood T cells with PHA. The coordinated regulation of these ecto-enzymes suggested that, besides a possible signaling function, they may recycle extracellular NAD by degrading it to adenosine and nicotinamide, which can be taken up by cells. In support of this hypothesis, db-cAMP-treated Jurkat cells could degrade extracellular NAD for de novo synthesis of purines, while untreated cells could not. Activated lymphocytes are often located in tissues in which cell death is common. It is suggested that the coordinated expression of these enzymes may allow activated T cells to re-use NAD and nucleotides from dead cells.","['Deterre, P', 'Gelman, L', 'Gary-Gouy, H', 'Arrieumerlou, C', 'Berthelier, V', 'Tixier, J M', 'Ktorza, S', 'Goding, J', 'Schmitt, C', 'Bismuth, G']","['Deterre P', 'Gelman L', 'Gary-Gouy H', 'Arrieumerlou C', 'Berthelier V', 'Tixier JM', 'Ktorza S', 'Goding J', 'Schmitt C', 'Bismuth G']","['Laboratory of Cellular Immunology, Hospital Pitie-Salpetriere Group, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0U46U6E8UK (NAD)', '87299V3Q9W (Azaserine)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.4.1 (ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase phosphodiesterase 1)', 'EC 3.2.2.- (N-Glycosyl Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (NAD+ Nucleosidase)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Pyrophosphatases)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', '*Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*metabolism', 'Azaserine/pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'N-Glycosyl Hydrolases/*metabolism', 'NAD/metabolism', 'NAD+ Nucleosidase/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Nucleotides/*metabolism', '*Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases', '*Pyrophosphatases', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*enzymology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/08/15 00:00,1996/08/15 00:01,['1996/08/15 00:00'],"['1996/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1996 Aug 15;157(4):1381-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The amino acid residues introduced are glycine (Gly), lysine (Lys), and tryptophan (Trp), the latter two in both the L- and D-configurations. The peptidyl anthraquinones maintain the ability of intercalating efficiently into DNA, even though the orientation within the base-pair pocket may change somewhat with reference to the parent drugs mitoxantrone (MX) and ametantrone (AM). The interaction constants of the mono-, di-, and triglycyl derivatives are well comparable to those found for AM but 5-10 times lower than the value reported for MX. On the other hand, the glycyl-lysyl compounds bind DNA to the same extent as (L-isomer) or even better than (D-isomer) MX. As for the parent drugs without peptidyl chains, the new compounds prefer alternating CG binding sites, although to different extents. The bis-Gly-Lys derivatives are the least sensitive to base composition, which may be due to extensive aspecific charged interactions with the polynucleotide backbone. As far as redox properties are concerned, all peptidyl anthraquinones show a reduction potential very close to that of AM and 60-80 mV less negative than that of MX; hence, they can produce free-radical-damaging species to an extent similar to the parent drugs. The biological activity has been tested in human tumor and murine leukemia cell lines. Most of the test anthraquinones exhibit cytotoxic properties close to those of AM and considerably lower than those of MX. Stimulation of topoisomerase-mediated DNA cleavage is moderately present in representatives of the glycylanthraquinone family, whereas inhibition of the background cleavage occurs when Lys is present in the peptide chain. For most of the test anthraquinones, the toxicity data are in line with the DNA affinity scale and the topoisomerase II stimulation activity. However, in the lysyl derivatives, for which lack of cytotoxicity cannot be related to poor binding to DNA, the steric and electronic properties of the side-chain substituent must impair an effective recognition of the cleavable complex.","['Gatto, B', 'Zagotto, G', 'Sissi, C', 'Cera, C', 'Uriarte, E', 'Palu, G', 'Capranico, G', 'Palumbo, M']","['Gatto B', 'Zagotto G', 'Sissi C', 'Cera C', 'Uriarte E', 'Palu G', 'Capranico G', 'Palumbo M']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Padova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Anthraquinones)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Intercalating Agents)', '0 (Peptides)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anthraquinones/*chemical synthesis/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Circular Dichroism', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intercalating Agents/chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mitoxantrone/analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Structure', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Peptides/*chemical synthesis/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Thermodynamics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/08/02 00:00,1996/08/02 00:01,['1996/08/02 00:00'],"['1996/08/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/02 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/02 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1021/jm950924a [doi]', 'jm950924a [pii]']",ppublish,J Med Chem. 1996 Aug 2;39(16):3114-22. doi: 10.1021/jm950924a.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MMP-9 is transcriptionally induced in multiple cell types by exposure to the inflammatory mediators bacterial endotoxin, interleukin-1 (IL-1) or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). CT-2519, (1-(5-isothiocyanatohexyl)-3,7-dimethylxanthine), a synthetic small molecule from an anti-inflammatory compound library, was evaluated for its effect on endotoxin and cytokine-induced MMP-9 synthesis by a monocytic leukemic cell line, THP-1, and a monocyte/macrophage line, RAW 264.7. CT-2519 dose-dependently inhibited endotoxin and cytokine-induced synthesis of MMP-9 by these cells. Furthermore, both MMP-9 secretion and matrix invasion by cells of a human fibrosarcoma cell line, HT-1080, were inhibited by CT-2519 in a dose-dependent manner. Northern blot analyses and studies utilizing MMP-9 promoter constructs indicated that the inhibitory action of CT-2519 occurs at the level of transcriptional suppression. Given the observation that cellular activation by endotoxin, IL-1 and TNF-alpha may be mediated, at least in part, through induction of certain species of phosphatidic acid (PA), the effect of CT-2519 on lipid levels was analyzed. CT-2519 effectively reduced endotoxin-mediated increases in particular cellular lipid levels. Pharmacologic modulation of cytokine-dependent gene products, such as MMP-9, may offer an important therapeutic approach to the treatment of neoplastic and inflammatory disorders.","['McMillan, J I', 'Weeks, R', 'West, J W', 'Bursten, S', 'Rice, G C', 'Lovett, D H']","['McMillan JI', 'Weeks R', 'West JW', 'Bursten S', 'Rice GC', 'Lovett DH']","['Department of Medicine, San Francisco VAMC/UCSF 94121, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (1-(5-isothiocyanatohexyl)-3,7-dimethylxanthine)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Isothiocyanates)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Phosphatidic Acids)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Xanthines)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Collagenases)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Collagenases/*biosynthesis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects', 'Fibrosarcoma', 'Humans', 'Inflammation', 'Interleukin-1/*pharmacology', 'Isothiocyanates/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*pharmacology', 'Macrophages', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9', 'Mice', 'Monocytes', '*Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Phosphatidic Acids/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Salmonella', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Xanthines/*pharmacology']",1996/08/07 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/08/07 00:00'],"['1996/08/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/08/07 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19960807)67:4<523::AID-IJC11>3.0.CO;2-8 [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19960807)67:4<523::AID-IJC11>3.0.CO;2-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1996 Aug 7;67(4):523-31. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19960807)67:4<523::AID-IJC11>3.0.CO;2-8.,"['5T32DK 07219/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK 39766/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,
