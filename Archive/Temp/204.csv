Here, we have performed a deletion analysis to mechanistically dissect Op18 with respect to (a) modulation of tubulin GTP hydrolysis and exchange, (b) tubulin binding in vitro, and (c) tubulin association and MT-regulating activities in intact cells. The data reveal distinct types of region-specific Op18 modulation of tubulin GTP metabolism, namely inhibition of nucleotide exchange and stimulation or inhibition of GTP hydrolysis. These regulatory activities are mediated via two-site cooperative binding to tubulin by multiple nonessential physically separated regions of Op18. In vitro analysis revealed that NH(2)- and COOH-terminal truncations of Op18 have opposite effects on the rates of tubulin GTP hydrolysis. Transfection of human leukemia cells with these two types of mutants result in similar decrease of MT content, which in both cases appeared independent of a simple tubulin sequestering mechanism. However, the NH(2)- and COOH-terminal-truncated Op18 mutants regulate MTs by distinct mechanisms as evidenced by morphological analysis of microinjected newt lung cells. Hence, mutant analysis shows that Op18 has the potential to regulate tubulin/MTs by more than one specific mechanism.","['Larsson, N', 'Segerman, B', 'Howell, B', 'Fridell, K', 'Cassimeris, L', 'Gullberg, M']","['Larsson N', 'Segerman B', 'Howell B', 'Fridell K', 'Cassimeris L', 'Gullberg M']","['Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, University of Umea, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,"['0 (Microtubule Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Polymers)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (STMN1 protein, human)', '0 (Stathmin)', '0 (Tubulin)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP Phosphohydrolases)', 'SH1WY3R615 (Nocodazole)']",IM,"['Allosteric Site', 'Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dimerization', 'GTP Phosphohydrolases/metabolism', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis/drug effects', 'K562 Cells', 'Kinetics', '*Microtubule Proteins', 'Microtubules/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Nocodazole/pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphoproteins/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Polymers', 'Protein Binding', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Salamandridae', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Stathmin', 'Tubulin/*metabolism']",PMC2156119,1999/09/24 00:00,1999/09/24 00:01,['1999/09/24 00:00'],"['1999/09/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1083/jcb.146.6.1289 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biol. 1999 Sep 20;146(6):1289-302. doi: 10.1083/jcb.146.6.1289.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Increasing evidence suggests a connection between histone acetylation and the development of cancer and leukemia.

Examination of gene expression, by differential display, in cells induced to monocytes with 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) or neutrophils with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) identified a number of clones with altered patterns of expression over the period of differentiation. One of these clones was the mitochondrial gene NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4 (ND4) which showed a differential pattern of expression between the neutrophil and monocyte lineages. The potential of mitochondrial inhibitors to induce differentiation was investigated by treating the HL60 cells with either the NADH dehydrogenase inhibitor, Rotenone, the complex III inhibitor, Antimycin A, or the highly specific mitochondrial ATP-synthase inhibitor, Oligomycin. Although functional assays of differentiation did not produce any positive results, all the inhibitors resulted in a dramatic increase in CD14 expression at day 1, with CD38 markers not observed until day 3. The increased expression of CD14 was accompanied by a decrease in viability and all CD14 positive cells were also positive for Annexin V, a marker of apoptosis. These results suggest that inhibition of the components of the mitochondrial pathways may lead to the marking of some cells, via CD14, for cell death, whilst allowing commitment to differentiation to occur in the surviving population.","['Mills, K I', 'Woodgate, L J', 'Gilkes, A F', 'Walsh, V', 'Sweeney, M C', 'Brown, G', 'Burnett, A K']","['Mills KI', 'Woodgate LJ', 'Gilkes AF', 'Walsh V', 'Sweeney MC', 'Brown G', 'Burnett AK']","['Department of Haematology, University of Wales College of Medicine, Cardiff, Heath Park, United Kingdom. whgkim@cardiff.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Oligomycins)', '0 (Uncoupling Agents)', '03L9OT429T (Rotenone)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '642-15-9 (Antimycin A)', 'EC 1.6.99.3 (NADH Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (NAD+ Nucleosidase)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)', 'EC 3.6.3.14 (Proton-Translocating ATPases)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Annexin A5/biosynthesis', '*Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, Differentiation/biosynthesis', 'Antimycin A/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Calcitriol/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'HL-60 Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy', 'Leukocytes/*cytology/drug effects', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/*biosynthesis', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects', 'Monocytes/cytology', 'NAD+ Nucleosidase/biosynthesis', 'NADH Dehydrogenase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Neutrophils/cytology', 'Oligomycins/pharmacology', 'Proton-Translocating ATPases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Rotenone/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Uncoupling Agents/pharmacology']",,1999/09/24 00:00,1999/09/24 00:01,['1999/09/24 00:00'],"['1999/09/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/24 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/bbrc.1999.1356 [doi]', 'S0006-291X(99)91356-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1999 Sep 24;263(2):294-300. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.1999.1356.,['Copyright 1999 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

These sequences represent typical type 1 (-aromatic*Pro-) and type 2 (-hydrophobic* hydrophobic-) cleavage site sequences, respectively. While in the type 1 sequence context, the preference for P2' Glu over Ile or Gln was found to be strongly dependent on the ionic strength and the residues being outside the P2-P2' region of the substrate, it remained preferable in the type 2 substrates when typical type 1 substrate sequence residues were substituted into the outside regions. The pH profile of the specificity constants suggested a lower pH optimum for substrates having P2' Glu in contrast to those having uncharged residues, in both sequence contexts. The very low frequency of P2' Glu in naturally occurring retroviral cleavage sites of various retroviruses including equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) and murine leukemia virus (MuLV) suggests that such a residue may not have a general regulatory role in the retroviral life cycle.

The authors suggest that the allotransplantation of hair can aid patients who have undergone bone marrow transplantation as to correct hematologic disorders. In such patients, autotransplantation of hair may be unsatisfactory because of insufficient donor hair. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether allogeneic hair grafts from bone marrow donors can grow in the bone marrow transplant recipient. METHODS: The authors performed a standard hair transplant using minigrafts. The patient, who presented a large bald area, had undergone bone marrow transplant due to acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The authors transplanted the patient with hair taken from the same bone marrow donor. RESULTS: The hair had very good growth and the results, according to the authors, are comparable to those of hair autotransplantation. CONCLUSION: Chemotherapy and radiation treatments can often lead to widespread, permanent hair loss. Allotransplantation of hair usually proves unsatisfactory, because skin is strongly antigenic. Bone marrow transplant patients can undergo an allotransplant of hair from the same bone marrow donor if their own donor area is inadequate.","['Rosati, P', 'Bergamo, A']","['Rosati P', 'Bergamo A']","['Ferrara University, Ferrara, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Dermatol Surg,Dermatologic surgery : official publication for American Society for Dermatologic Surgery [et al.],9504371,,IM,"['Adult', 'Alopecia/surgery', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', 'Hair/*transplantation', 'Humans', 'Living Donors', 'Postoperative Complications/*surgery', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,1999/09/22 09:00,2000/08/19 11:00,['1999/09/22 09:00'],"['1999/09/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/08/19 11:00 [medline]', '1999/09/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['dsu99004 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1524-4725.1999.99004.x [doi]']",ppublish,Dermatol Surg. 1999 Aug;25(8):664-5. doi: 10.1046/j.1524-4725.1999.99004.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The extent of apoptosis was determined by detecting and counting the relative and absolute numbers of apoptotic cells and bodies using in situ 3 -end labelling of the apoptotic DNA. The extent and intensity of expression of the bcl-2, bax, bak and mcl-1 proteins were studied by immunohistochemistry. Also the relative volume density of necrosis was evaluated and correlated with the other parameters. Finally, all the parameters were evaluated as prognostic markers and correlated with data on the survival of the patients. Relatively high apoptotic indices were seen in both tumor types (average for both 2.53%, range 0.09 27.01%). Significantly higher bcl-2 and bak indices were detected more often in LCNECs than in LCNNECs. Immunohistochemically detected bax, bcl-2 and bak expression was independent of apoptotic index in both tumor types, while there was a statistically significant positive association between mcl-1 expression and apoptotic index in LCNNEC but not in LCNEC. There was a statistically significant association between high apoptotic index and shortened survival in LCLC. However, no association was found between tumor stage and apoptosis. The patients with LCNEC and low bcl-2 protein expression had a significantly shorter survival time than those with high bcl-2 indices. There was also a clear association between shortened survival and necrotic LCNNEC. LCLCs show relatively high apoptotic activity, which is associated with shortened survival. The expression of bcl-2, bak and mcl- 1 is associated with neuroendocrine differentiation in LCLC.

Whereas the virus-infected T cells expressed higher levels of HLA-DR, CD25, CD80, and CD86 Ags than apoptosis-resistant PHA-blasts, the T cell apoptosis was enhanced by addition of exogenous IL-2. Furthermore, in this apoptosis, monocytes played an important role because T cells infected in the absence of monocytes were resistant to the death signals. The apoptosis-sensitive T cells responded to TCR signaling more strongly by proliferating than those apoptosis-resistant cells. Monocytes weakly affected the expression levels of viral Ags on T cells. However, HTLV-I-infected monocytes primed T cells to die by subsequent TCR signaling. T cells primed with the monocytes, subsequently infected in the absence of monocytes, were killed by TCR signaling. These observations suggest that primed and infected T cells could be killed by activation-induced cell death.","['Wakamatsu, S', 'Makino, M', 'Tei, C', 'Baba, M']","['Wakamatsu S', 'Makino M', 'Tei C', 'Baba M']","['Division of Human Retroviruses, Center for Chronic Viral Diseases, First Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kagoshima University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (fas Receptor)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology/virology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*immunology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/physiology', 'Monocytes/*immunology/virology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology/*virology', 'Time Factors', 'fas Receptor/physiology']",,1999/09/22 00:00,1999/09/22 00:01,['1999/09/22 00:00'],"['1999/09/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/22 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/22 00:00 [entrez]']",['ji_v163n7p3914 [pii]'],ppublish,J Immunol. 1999 Oct 1;163(7):3914-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We directly tested the impact of shed gangliosides on the in vivo antitumor immune response in a syngeneic fully autochthonous system (FBL-3 erythroleukemia cells, C57BL/6 mice, and highly purified FBL-3 cell gangliosides). The major FBL-3 ganglioside was identified as GM1b by mass spectrometry. Substantial ganglioside shedding (90 pmol/108 cells/h), a requisite for their inhibition of the immune function of tumor-infiltrating leukocytes, was detected. Immunosuppression by FBL-3 gangliosides was potent; 5-20 microM inhibited the tumor-specific secondary proliferative response (80-100%) and suppressed the generation of tumor-specific CTLs (97% reduction of FBL-3 cell lysis at an E:T ratio of 100:1). In vivo, coinjection of 10 nmol of FBL-3 gangliosides with a primary FBL-3 cell immunization led to a reduced response to a secondary challenge (the increase in the draining popliteal lymph node mass, cell number, and lymphocyte thymidine incorporation were lowered by 70, 69, and 72%, respectively). Coinjection of gangliosides with a secondary tumor challenge led to a 61, 74, and 42% reduction of the increase in lymph node mass, cell number, and thymidine uptake and a 63-74% inhibition of the increase of draining lymph node T cells (CD3+), B cells (CD19+), and dendritic cells/macrophages (Mac-3+). Overall, the clear conclusion that tumor-derived gangliosides inhibit syngeneic antitumor immune responses implicates these molecules as a potent factor in promoting tumor formation and progression.","['McKallip, R', 'Li, R', 'Ladisch, S']","['McKallip R', 'Li R', 'Ladisch S']","[""Glycobiology Program, Center for Cancer and Transplantation Biology, Children's National Medical Center, Department of Pediatrics, George Washington University School of Medicine, Washington, DC 20010, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Gangliosides)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '37758-47-7 (G(M1) Ganglioside)', '57576-20-2 (ganglioside M1b)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects/immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Female', 'G(M1) Ganglioside/analogs & derivatives/immunology/isolation & purification/physiology', 'Gangliosides/*immunology/physiology', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*immunology/metabolism/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Lymph Nodes/cytology/drug effects/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/cytology/drug effects/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/drug effects/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/immunology/metabolism']",,1999/09/22 00:00,1999/09/22 00:01,['1999/09/22 00:00'],"['1999/09/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/22 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/22 00:00 [entrez]']",['ji_v163n7p3718 [pii]'],ppublish,J Immunol. 1999 Oct 1;163(7):3718-26.,,,['CA42361/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

The TAL1 proteins contain a basic helix - loop - helix (bHLH) motif characteristic of a large family of transcription factors that control transcription from an E box target element as heterodimers with the E2A- and HEB-encoded gene products. Gene knockout studies in mice indicate that this transcription factor is required for embryonic and adult hematopoiesis, and considerable evidence suggests it has specific functions in terminal erythroid differentiation. We investigated whether the broadly expressed nuclear protein p300, known to function as a coactivator for other bHLH proteins involved in cellular differentiation, also interacts with TAL1. p300 was found to coimmunoprecipitate with Tal1 in extracts from murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells induced to differentiate with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), and p300 and Tal1 were observed in a common E box DNA-binding complex in extracts from differentiating MEL cells. p300 also interacted with Tal1 in protein pulldown assays, suggesting this was a direct interaction. Finally, p300 augmented transcription by Tal1 from an E box-containing promoter and by a GAL4-Tal1 fusion from a promoter containing the GAL4 DNA-binding element. Deletion analysis identified the bHLH domain of Tal1 and amino-terminal sequences of p300 as necessary for p300-stimulated transactivation and Tal1-p300 interaction in vitro. These results indicate that recruitment of the transcriptional coactivator p300 can positively regulate TAL1-directed gene expression. The dependence of their interaction in MEL cells on addition of a differentiation inducer suggests, further, that this TAL1-p300 complex may have an important role in terminal erythroid differentiation.","['Huang, S', 'Qiu, Y', 'Stein, R W', 'Brandt, S J']","['Huang S', 'Qiu Y', 'Stein RW', 'Brandt SJ']","['Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, TN 37232, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (E1A-Associated p300 Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Ep300 protein, mouse)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'DNA/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Dimerization', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'E1A-Associated p300 Protein', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Binding', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Response Elements/genetics', 'Sequence Deletion', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Trans-Activators/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', '*Transcription Factors', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/09/22 00:00,1999/09/22 00:01,['1999/09/22 00:00'],"['1999/09/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/22 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/22 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1202889 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1999 Sep 2;18(35):4958-67. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1202889.,,,"['R01 DK55091/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL49118/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

E2a-Pbx1 causes T cell and myeloid leukemia in mice, blocks differentiation of cultured myeloid progenitors, and transforms fibroblasts through a mechanism accompanied by aberrant expression of tissue-specific and developmentally-regulated genes. Here we investigate whether aberrant gene expression also occurs specifically in the t(1;19)-containing subset of pre-B cell ALL in man. Two new genes, EB-1 and EB-2, as well as Caldesmon were transcriptionally activated in each of seven t(1;19) cell lines. EB-1 expression was extremely low in marrow from patients having pre-B ALL not associated with the t(1;19), and elevated more than 100-fold in marrow from patients with pre-B ALL associated with the t(1;19). Normal EB-1 expression was strong in brain and testis, the same tissues exhibiting the highest levels of PBX1 expression. EB-1 encodes a signaling protein containing a phosphotyrosine binding domain homologous to that of dNumb developmental regulators and two SAM domains homologous to those in the C-terminal tail of Eph receptor tyrosine kinases. We conclude that aberrant expression of tissue-specific genes is a characteristic of t(1;19) pre-B ALL, as was previously found in fibroblasts transformed by E2a-Pbx1. Potentially, EB-1 overexpression could interfere with normal signaling controlling proliferation or differentiation.","['Fu, X', 'McGrath, S', 'Pasillas, M', 'Nakazawa, S', 'Kamps, M P']","['Fu X', 'McGrath S', 'Pasillas M', 'Nakazawa S', 'Kamps MP']","['Department of Pathology, University of California, San Diego, California, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Adenomatous Polyposis Coli Protein)', '0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '146150-85-8 (E2A-Pbx1 fusion protein)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adenomatous Polyposis Coli Protein', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'B-Lymphocytes/enzymology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/pathology', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/chemistry/*genetics', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Fetus/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Organ Specificity', 'Phosphotyrosine/metabolism', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/enzymology/*genetics/pathology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/chemistry/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stem Cells/enzymology/*metabolism/pathology', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics']",,1999/09/22 00:00,1999/09/22 00:01,['1999/09/22 00:00'],"['1999/09/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/22 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/22 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1202874 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1999 Sep 2;18(35):4920-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1202874.,,['GENBANK/AF145204'],"['2P01 CA50528/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA56876/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

This cleavage usually inhibits the function of the target protein or generates peptides that actively contribute to the death process. In the present study, we demonstrate that the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1 is cleaved by caspases in human leukemic cells exposed to apoptotic stimuli. We have shown recently that p27Kip1 overexpression delayed leukemic cell death in response to cytotoxic drugs. In transient transfection experiments, the p23 and the p15 N-terminal peptides generated by p27Kip1 proteolysis demonstrate an anti-apoptotic effect similar to that induced by the wild-type protein, whereas cleavage-resistant mutants have lost their protective effect. Moreover, stable transfection of a cleavage-resistant mutant of p27Kip1 sensitizes leukemic cells to drug-induced cell death. Altogether, these results indicate that proteolysis of p27Kip1 triggered by caspases mediates the anti-apoptotic activity of the protein.","['Eymin, B', 'Sordet, O', 'Droin, N', 'Munsch, B', 'Haugg, M', 'Van de Craen, M', 'Vandenabeele, P', 'Solary, E']","['Eymin B', 'Sordet O', 'Droin N', 'Munsch B', 'Haugg M', 'Van de Craen M', 'Vandenabeele P', 'Solary E']","[""INSERM U517, Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy, 7 Boulevard Jeanne d'Arc, 21033 Dijon Cedex, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Leupeptins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (benzoylcarbonyl-aspartyl-glutamyl-valyl-aspartyl-fluoromethyl ketone)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', '110044-82-1 (acetylleucyl-leucyl-norleucinal)', '110115-07-6 (calpain inhibitor 2)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', '2225PI3MOV (Thimerosal)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2-CDC28 Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Calpain)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 6)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Base Sequence', '*CDC2-CDC28 Kinases', 'Calpain/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 6', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/drug effects/*metabolism', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leupeptins/pharmacology', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Thimerosal/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,1999/09/22 00:00,1999/09/22 00:01,['1999/09/22 00:00'],"['1999/09/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/22 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/22 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1202860 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1999 Aug 26;18(34):4839-47. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1202860.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two Philadelphia-positive clones were identified at relapse. One clone displayed an additional chromosomal abnormality most likely induced by radio-chemotherapy and therefore arising in a single cell. This cell displays the characteristics of a stem cell, since it was able to support 20% of Ph-positive hemopoiesis for 5 months. If the progeny of a single Ph-positive stem cell account for 20% of hemopoiesis, a very low number of leukemic stem cells may sustain relapse after allogeneic BMT. This is in keeping with two observations: (1) at relapse, long-term culture initiating cells (LTC-IC) were all donor-derived and Ph-negative; (2) on average, the pace of the disease is very slow after relapse following allogeneic-BMT.

This trial was based on the results in a rodent model, in which cyclosporine given after ABMT induces an autoimmune syndrome (autologous GVHD) identical to allogeneic GVHD. Further, this autologous GVHD is associated with a graft-versus-tumor effect augmented by interferon that upregulates MHC class II expression on normal and tumor cells, the target of the cytolytic T cells in autologous GVHD. In this trial, cyclosporine 1 mg/kg/day was given from the day of bone marrow reinfusion until the completion of the interferon and gamma-interferon. Gamma-interferon at 0.025 mg/m2 every other day was started when the total white cell count was >200 cells/ml for 2 consecutive days and continued for a total of 10 doses after ABMT. The preparative regimens were busulfan and cyclophosphamide, or cyclophosphamide with total body irradiation. All patients received 4HC-purged marrow grafts. Median age was 45 years (range 19-68). The diagnoses included chemo-resistant non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (10), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (two), chemo-resistant Hodgkin's disease (two), acute myeloid leukemia (one), and multiple myeloma (one).

The distribution of prognostic factors was similar in both groups. Hemopoietic reconstitution was adequate and did not differ in the two groups.

Using the yeast two-hybrid system and human cell culture coimmunoprecipitation experiments, we show here that HRX proteins interact directly with the GADD34 protein. We have found that transfected cells overexpressing GADD34 display a significant increase in apoptosis after treatment with ionizing radiation, indicating that GADD34 expression not only correlates with apoptosis but also can enhance apoptosis. The amino-terminal third of the GADD34 protein was necessary for this observed increase in apoptosis. Furthermore, coexpression of three different HRX fusion proteins (HRX-ENL, HRX-AF9, and HRX-ELL) had an anti-apoptotic effect, abrogating GADD34-induced apoptosis. In contrast, expression of wild-type HRX gave rise to an increase in apoptosis. The difference observed here between wild-type HRX and the leukemic HRX fusion proteins suggests that inhibition of GADD34-mediated apoptosis may be important to leukemogenesis. We also show here that GADD34 binds the human SNF5/INI1 protein, a member of the SNF/SWI complex that can remodel chromatin and activate transcription. These studies demonstrate, for the first time, a gain of function for leukemic HRX fusion proteins compared to wild-type protein. We propose that the role of HRX fusion proteins as negative regulators of post-DNA-damage-induced apoptosis is important to leukemia progression.","['Adler, H T', 'Chinery, R', 'Wu, D Y', 'Kussick, S J', 'Payne, J M', 'Fornace, A J Jr', 'Tkachuk, D C']","['Adler HT', 'Chinery R', 'Wu DY', 'Kussick SJ', 'Payne JM', 'Fornace AJ Jr', 'Tkachuk DC']","['VA Puget Sound Health Care System, Seattle, Washington 98108, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (SMARCB1 Protein)', '0 (SMARCB1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (PPP1R15A protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 1)']",IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation', '*Apoptosis', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Gamma Rays', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/radiation effects', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Phosphatase 1', 'Proteins/*metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'SMARCB1 Protein', 'Sequence Deletion', '*Transcription Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques']",PMC84700,1999/09/22 09:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1999/09/22 09:00'],"['1999/09/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1999/09/22 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.19.10.7050 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1999 Oct;19(10):7050-60. doi: 10.1128/MCB.19.10.7050.,,,"['P30 CA068485/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 68485/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA73969/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

The fusion of Bcr sequences to Abl constitutively activates the Abl protein tyrosine kinase. We have recently shown that expression of Bcr-Abl in bone marrow cells by retroviral transduction efficiently induces in mice a myeloproliferative disease resembling human CML and that Abl kinase activity is essential for Bcr-Abl to induce a CML-like myeloproliferative disease. However, it is not known if activation of the Abl kinase alone is sufficient to induce a myeloproliferative disease. In this study, we examined the role of the Abl SH3 domain of Bcr-Abl in induction of myeloproliferative disease and tested whether c-Abl activated by SH3 deletion can induce a CML-like disease. We found that Bcr-Abl with an Abl SH3 deletion still induced a CML-like disease in mice. In contrast, c-Abl activated by SH3 deletion induced only lymphoid malignancies in mice and did not stimulate the growth of myeloid colonies from 5-fluorouracil-treated bone marrow cells in vitro. These results indicate that Bcr sequences in Bcr-Abl play additional roles in inducing myeloproliferative disease beyond simply activating the Abl kinase domain and that functions of the Abl SH3 domain are either not required or redundant in Bcr-Abl-induced myeloproliferative disease. The results also suggest that the type of hematological neoplasm induced by an abl oncogene is influenced not only by what type of hematopoietic cells the oncogene is targeted into but also by the intrinsic oncogenic properties of the particular abl oncogene. In addition, we found that DeltaSH3 c-Abl induced less activation of Akt and STAT5 than did Bcr-Abl, suggesting that activation of these pathways plays a critical role in inducing a CML-like disease.","['Gross, A W', 'Zhang, X', 'Ren, R']","['Gross AW', 'Zhang X', 'Ren R']","['Rosenstiel Basic Medical Sciences Research Center, Department of Biology, Brandeis University, Waltham, Massachusetts 02454-9110, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/mortality', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*genetics/mortality', 'Mice', '*Milk Proteins', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics/mortality', 'Phosphorylation', 'Pleural Effusion, Malignant', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/*genetics', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Signal Transduction', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', '*src Homology Domains']",PMC84687,1999/09/22 00:00,1999/09/22 00:01,['1999/09/22 00:00'],"['1999/09/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/22 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/22 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.19.10.6918 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1999 Oct;19(10):6918-28. doi: 10.1128/MCB.19.10.6918.,,,"['R01 CA068008/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA68008/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

Here we describe the structure of the histone deacetylase catalytic core, as revealed by the crystal structure of a homologue from the hyperthermophilic bacterium Aquifex aeolicus, that shares 35.2% identity with human HDAC1 over 375 residues, deacetylates histones in vitro and is inhibited by TSA and SAHA. The deacetylase, deacetylase-TSA and deacetylase-SAHA structures reveal an active site consisting of a tubular pocket, a zinc-binding site and two Asp-His charge-relay systems, and establish the mechanism of HDAC inhibition. The residues that make up the active site and contact the inhibitors are conserved across the HDAC family.

This short commentary presents those new findings in the light of the many and diverse epidemiological investigations of first generation malignancies following parental exposure, the majority of which indicate no real evidence to support the concept that patterns of lympho-myeloid malignancy reflect levels of PPI. Other experimental work supporting PPI are considered against unsuccessful attempts to reproduce them.

These compounds were designed to act as double prodrugs that would serve as a depot to release two active drugs that act through different mechanisms. Thus, a nucleotide derivative of FDU or DFDU could act as a competitive inhibitor for thymidylate synthase, whereas retinoic acid and butyric acid would be expected to induce cell differentiation. The in vitro anticancer activities for these prodrugs were determined against a panel of nine tumor types (leukemia, non-small cell lung, colon, CNS, melanoma, ovarian, renal, prostate, breast) that encompassed about 60 human tumor cell lines. Structure-activity relationships indicate that O-butanoyl esters of FDU are approximately equipotent to FDU, the O-butanoyl esters of DFDU are less active than FDU, and the retinoyl and bis(2,2,2-trichloroethyl)phosphate derivatives of FDU exhibit comparable activity to FDU. In addition to their cytotoxic effect, 3'-O-retinoyl-FDU (12) and 3'-O-butanoyl-5'-O-bis(2,2,2-trichloroethyl)phosphoryl-FD U (16) also induced in vitro cell differentiation of promyelocytic leukemia HL60 cells. These combined cytotoxic and cell differentiation effects exhibited by 12 and 16 produced greater morphological drug-induced granulation and neutrophil vacuolation, and more cell apoptosis, than observed upon exposure to either retinoic acid or sodium butanoate. Dose-escalation studies in mice showed that 12 or 16 did not induce any acute or chronic toxicity, change in plasma clinical chemistry parameters, or gross histapathological changes at 60 days following an initial dosage regimen of 0.013 mmol/kg i.p. for 7-consecutive days. The in vivo growth delay response of murine mammary EMT6 solid tumors suggests that 3'-O-retinoyl-FDU (12) delays tumor growth relative to the other prodrugs investigated, sodium butyrate, retinoic acid, FDU, or a combination of retinoic acid and FDU. These preliminary results suggest that 3'-O-retinoyl-FDU (12) warrants further in vivo investigation to determine its tissue biodistribution and pharmacokinetic parameters that would be of value in assessing its potential usefulness as an anticancer prodrug.","['Xia, Z', 'Wiebe, L I', 'Miller, G G', 'Knaus, E E']","['Xia Z', 'Wiebe LI', 'Miller GG', 'Knaus EE']","['Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Germany,Arch Pharm (Weinheim),Archiv der Pharmazie,0330167,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Prodrugs)', '039LU44I5M (Floxuridine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Floxuridine/*analogs & derivatives', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Prodrugs/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects']",,1999/09/18 00:00,1999/09/18 00:01,['1999/09/18 00:00'],"['1999/09/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/18 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/18 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1521-4184(19998)332:8<286::AID-ARDP286>3.0.CO;2-9 [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1521-4184(19998)332:8<286::aid-ardp286>3.0.co;2-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Pharm (Weinheim). 1999 Aug;332(8):286-94. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1521-4184(19998)332:8<286::aid-ardp286>3.0.co;2-9.,,,,43,,,,,,,,,

However, MS and P6 specifically induced in situ DNA digestion in cultured P388/VCR cells from 30 minutes onward. After 3 days of incubation with MS or P6, DNA degradation coincided with complete killing of P388/VCR. In situ fluorescent labeling of fragmented DNA revealed that P6 induced apoptosis of P388/VCR cells, occurring as early at 1.5 hours. By day 3, all the P6-treated leukemia cells were apoptotic. In contrast, P6 caused neither in situ DNA digestion, nor apoptosis in the untransformed BL8L cells. Whether the DNase-like action of P6 is independent of or responsible for triggering the intrinsic endonuclease activity in the leukemia cell, thus leading to apoptosis, remains an object for further research. Nevertheless, the specificity of the apoptotic action of P6 on P388/VCR cells indicates its potential role in the development of an anticancer agent.","['Ding', 'Fung', 'Ng', 'Chou']","['Ding JL', 'Fung FM', 'Ng GW', 'Chou LM']","['Marine Biotechnology Laboratory, Department of Biological Sciences, National University of Singapore, 10 Kent Ridge Crescent, Singapore 119260']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mar Biotechnol (NY),"Marine biotechnology (New York, N.Y.)",100892712,,,,,1999/09/18 00:00,1999/09/18 00:01,['1999/09/18 00:00'],"['1999/09/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/18 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/18 00:00 [entrez]']","['MBT40 [pii]', '10.1007/pl00011782 [doi]']",ppublish,Mar Biotechnol (NY). 1999 Jul;1(4):328-336. doi: 10.1007/pl00011782.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Vector particles are generated by packaging cell lines, which supply the structural proteins gag, pol and env needed to package the retroviral vector RNA. The most efficient way to introduce the vector genome into the packaging cell line is cross-infection with a retroviral vector. Since the infection of a packaging cell line by the produced virus is blocked due to the down regulation of the retrovirus receptor by the envelope glycoprotein, the vector genome should be introduced by a virus with a host tropism different from the one of the packaging cell line. The murine ecotropic retrovirus receptor was expressed in the human amphotropic packaging cell line FLYA13 to generate a cell line which can be infected by murine ecotropic retroviruses. Vector transfer can now be facilitated by cross-infection with the appropriate ecotropic retroviral vectors and provides a simple and efficient method for the generation of amphotropic packaging lines.","['Gerstmayer, B', 'Groner, B', 'Wels, W', 'Schnierle, B S']","['Gerstmayer B', 'Groner B', 'Wels W', 'Schnierle BS']","['MEMOREC Stoffel GmbH, Koln, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,J Virol Methods,Journal of virological methods,8005839,"['0 (DNA, Recombinant)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (ecotropic murine leukemia virus receptor)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'DNA, Recombinant/*genetics', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Virus/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Retroviridae/*genetics/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Virion/*genetics', 'Virus Assembly/*genetics']",,1999/09/17 00:00,1999/09/17 00:01,['1999/09/17 00:00'],"['1999/09/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/17 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/17 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0166-0934(99)00053-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s0166-0934(99)00053-1 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol Methods. 1999 Aug;81(1-2):71-5. doi: 10.1016/s0166-0934(99)00053-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Membrane CD14 (mCD14) is predominantly expressed on monocytes, macrophages and granulocytes. The source of soluble CD14 (sCD14) is as yet unclear. Previous investigation using monocytes has shown that sCD14 can be derived either from the shedding of mCD14 or from direct secretion by monocytes. Whether the monocyte is the sole or even the major source of sCD14 is as yet uncertain. Clearance of LPS from the bloodstream is thought to be primarily mediated by the liver. Production of CD14 by hepatocytes would potentially provide a powerful mechanism by which the liver could clear LPS, and therefore we examined the ability of human hepatocytes to produce CD14. METHODS: Human hepatocytes were isolated using collagenase perfusion. RESULTS: Human hepatocytes were found to have CD14 mRNA by Northern blot analysis. Western blot analysis and immunohistochemical staining confirmed CD14 protein in primary hepatocyte cultures. Further studies showed that a liver epithelial-like cell line AKN-1 is capable of producing CD14. Comparisons of the size of hepatocyte-derived CD14 protein with the sCD14 protein from the human monocytic leukemia cell line HL60 suggested that a slightly larger form of CD14 is expressed by human liver cells. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to demonstrate production of CD14 by human hepatocytes.","['Su, G L', 'Dorko, K', 'Strom, S C', 'Nussler, A K', 'Wang, S C']","['Su GL', 'Dorko K', 'Strom SC', 'Nussler AK', 'Wang SC']","['Department of Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor 48109-0666, USA. gsu@umich-edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,J Hepatol,Journal of hepatology,8503886,"['0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Epithelial Cells/immunology', 'Humans', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/*biosynthesis', 'Lipopolysaccharides/blood', 'Liver/cytology/*immunology', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Solubility']",,1999/09/17 00:00,1999/09/17 00:01,['1999/09/17 00:00'],"['1999/09/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/17 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/17 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0168-8278(99)80034-8 [pii]', '10.1016/s0168-8278(99)80034-8 [doi]']",ppublish,J Hepatol. 1999 Sep;31(3):435-42. doi: 10.1016/s0168-8278(99)80034-8.,,,"['AI01030/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'DK02210/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'GM54911/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

Little is known about PAD of hemopoietic cells. We found that PAD activity in human myeloid leukemia HL-60 cells was induced with the granulocyte-inducing agents retinoic acid and dimethyl sulfoxide and with the monocyte-inducing agent 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3). We cloned and characterized a PAD cDNA from retinoic acid-induced cells. The cDNA was 2,238 base pairs long and encoded a 663-amino acid polypeptide. The HL-60 PAD had 50-55% amino acid sequence identities with the three known enzymes and 73% identity with the recently cloned keratinocyte PAD. The recombinant enzyme differs in kinetic properties from the known enzymes. Immunoblotting and Northern blotting with an antiserum against the enzyme and the cDNA, respectively, showed that a protein of approximately 67 kDa increased concomitantly with increase of mRNA of approximately 2.6 kilobases during granulocyte differentiation. During monocyte differentiation the same mRNA and protein increased as in granulocyte differentiation. Neither the enzyme activity nor the protein was found in macrophage-induced cells. These results suggested that expression of the PAD gene is tightly linked to myeloid differentiation.","['Nakashima, K', 'Hagiwara, T', 'Ishigami, A', 'Nagata, S', 'Asaga, H', 'Kuramoto, M', 'Senshu, T', 'Yamada, M']","['Nakashima K', 'Hagiwara T', 'Ishigami A', 'Nagata S', 'Asaga H', 'Kuramoto M', 'Senshu T', 'Yamada M']","['Graduate School of Integrated Science, Yokohama City University, 22-2, Seto, Kanazawa-ku, Yokohama 236-0027, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Sulfuric Acid Esters)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.- (Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.5.3.15 (PADI4 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.3.15 (Protein-Arginine Deiminase Type 4)', 'EC 3.5.3.15 (Protein-Arginine Deiminases)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'JW5CW40Z50 (dimethyl sulfate)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'DNA Primers', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Gene Library', 'Granulocytes/cytology/enzymology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrolases/*biosynthesis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Keratinocytes/enzymology', 'Kinetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein-Arginine Deiminase Type 4', 'Protein-Arginine Deiminases', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sulfuric Acid Esters/pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",,1999/09/17 00:00,1999/09/17 00:01,['1999/09/17 00:00'],"['1999/09/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/17 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/17 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.274.39.27786 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)52186-X [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1999 Sep 24;274(39):27786-92. doi: 10.1074/jbc.274.39.27786.,,['GENBANK/AB017919'],,,,,,,,,,,

The CENP-H transcripts were relatively scarce but were detectable in most tissues and embryos at various stages of development. Immunofluorescence stainings of mouse fibroblast cells with anti-CENP-H-specific antibody demonstrated that the CENP-H is specifically and constitutively localized in kinetochores throughout the cell cycle; this was also confirmed by stainings with anti-centromere-specific antibody.

It is demonstrated that by entering the cell species, the approximate MW and pI range as determined by 2-D gel electrophoresis, and the tryptic peptide map into the database a unique match for identification of the protein generally results.

Lumbar spine (L2-L4) and femoral neck bone mineral densities (grams per cm2) were measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry in 28 children (age, 2.9-16.0 yr; median, 8.0 yr; 10 acute lymphoblastic leukemias, 18 solid tumors) at diagnosis and after a 1-yr follow-up. Apparent volumetric density (grams per cm3) was calculated to minimize the effect of bone size on BMD. Serum levels of osteocalcin (OC), type I collagen carboxyl-terminal propeptide (PICP), and type I collagen carboxyl-terminal telopeptide were measured serially during the study. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), and IGF-binding protein-3 were analyzed at diagnosis and at 1-yr follow-up. A significant decrease in femoral bone mineral density and apparent volumetric density was observed during the year after diagnosis [(mean (SD), -10.1% (8.8%) and -11.3% (8.1%) respectively; P < 0.01], whereas age- and sex-matched controls showed annual increments of +5.4% (7.7%; P < 0.01) and +0.7% (5.7%; P = NS) respectively. The markers of bone formation (PICP and OC) were significantly decreased at diagnosis. By the end of the follow-up, PICP and OC were normalized, whereas the marker of bone resorption (type I collagen carboxyl-terminal telopeptide) was significantly increased. Reduced levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, and IGF-binding protein-3 were observed during the study. To conclude, increased bone resorption and impaired development of femoral bone density were observed in children with cancer during chemotherapy. Deficient accumulation of bone mass may lead to impaired development of peak bone mass and predispose children with cancer to increased risk of osteoporosis and diminished skeletal resistance to fractures later in life.","['Arikoski, P', 'Komulainen, J', 'Riikonen, P', 'Voutilainen, R', 'Knip, M', 'Kroger, H']","['Arikoski P', 'Komulainen J', 'Riikonen P', 'Voutilainen R', 'Knip M', 'Kroger H']","['Department of Pediatrics, Kuopio University Hospital, Finland. arikoski@messi.uku.fi']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,0375362,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Procollagen)', '0 (procollagen type I carboxy terminal peptide)', '104982-03-8 (Osteocalcin)', '1406-16-2 (Vitamin D)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)']",IM,"['Absorptiometry, Photon', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', '*Bone Density', '*Bone Development', '*Bone Remodeling', 'Bone Resorption', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3/blood', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/metabolism', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*complications/drug therapy', 'Osteocalcin/blood', 'Peptide Fragments/blood', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/drug therapy', 'Procollagen/blood', 'Vitamin D/blood']",,1999/09/16 00:00,1999/09/16 00:01,['1999/09/16 00:00'],"['1999/09/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/16 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/jcem.84.9.5968 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 1999 Sep;84(9):3174-81. doi: 10.1210/jcem.84.9.5968.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Vaccination histories were compared in 439 children (ages 0-14) diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in nine Midwestern and Mid-Atlantic states (USA) between 1 January 1989 and 30 June 1993 and 439 controls selected by random-digit dialing and individually matched to cases on age, race and telephone exchange. Among matched pairs, similar proportions of cases and controls had received at least one dose of oral poliovirus (98%), diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (97%), and measles-mumps-rubella (90%) vaccines. Only 47% of cases and 53% of controls had received any Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine (relative risk (RR) = 0.73; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50-1.06). Although similar proportions of cases (12%) and controls (11%) received the polysaccharide Hib vaccine (RR = 1.13; 95% CI 0.64-1.98), more controls (41%) than cases (35%) received the conjugate Hib vaccine (RR = 0.57; 95% CI 0.36-0.89). Although we found no relationship between most infant vaccinations and subsequent risk of childhood ALL, our findings suggest that infants receiving the conjugate Hib vaccine may be at reduced risk of subsequent childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Further studies are needed to confirm this association and, if confirmed, to elucidate the underlying mechanism.","['Groves, F D', 'Gridley, G', 'Wacholder, S', 'Shu, X O', 'Robison, L L', 'Neglia, J P', 'Linet, M S']","['Groves FD', 'Gridley G', 'Wacholder S', 'Shu XO', 'Robison LL', 'Neglia JP', 'Linet MS']","['Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7244, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Chickenpox Vaccine)', '0 (Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis Vaccine)', '0 (Haemophilus Vaccines)', '0 (Haemophilus influenzae type b polysaccharide vaccine)', '0 (Measles Vaccine)', '0 (Measles-Mumps-Rubella Vaccine)', '0 (Mumps Vaccine)', '0 (Polysaccharides, Bacterial)', '0 (Rubella Vaccine)', '0 (Vaccines, Combined)', '0 (Viral Vaccines)', '0 (measles, mumps, rubella, varicella vaccine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bacterial Capsules', 'Chickenpox Vaccine', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis Vaccine/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Haemophilus Vaccines/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Humans', '*Immunization Schedule', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Measles Vaccine/adverse effects/therapeutic use', '*Measles-Mumps-Rubella Vaccine', 'Mumps Vaccine/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Polysaccharides, Bacterial/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology/etiology/prevention & control', 'Risk Factors', 'Rubella Vaccine/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Vaccines, Combined/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Viral Vaccines/adverse effects/therapeutic use']",PMC2374362,1999/09/16 00:00,1999/09/16 00:01,['1999/09/16 00:00'],"['1999/09/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/16 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bjc.6690668 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1999 Sep;81(1):175-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6690668.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, these compounds were found to induce apoptotic cell death in human acute myeloid leukemia HL-60 cells. Apoptosis induced by the antidepressants was identified by electron microscopy and conventional agarose gel electrophoresis and was quantitated by propodium iodide staining and the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) via flow cytometry. Treatment with apoptosis-inducing concentrations of the antidepressants (80 microM imipramine, 35 microM clomipramine, or 220 microM citalopram) caused induction of caspase-3/caspase-3-like activity, which was monitored by the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), the loss of the 32 kD caspase-3 (CPP32) precursor, and the cleavage of the fluorescent CPP32-like substrate PhiPhiLux. Pretreatment with a potent caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl-ketone (zVAD-fmk) inhibited antidepressant-induced CPP32/CPP32-like activity and apoptosis. Furthermore, activation of caspase induced by the antidepressants was preceded by the hypergeneration of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). These results suggested that the antidepressants may induce apoptosis via a caspase-3-dependent pathway, and induction of apoptosis by the antidepressants may provide a clue for the mechanism of their antineoplastic effects.","['Xia, Z', 'Bergstrand, A', 'DePierre, J W', 'Nassberger, L']","['Xia Z', 'Bergstrand A', 'DePierre JW', 'Nassberger L']","['Department of Biochemistry, Wallenberg Laboratory, Stockholm University, Sweden. xia@tuborg.biokemi.su.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biochem Mol Toxicol,Journal of biochemical and molecular toxicology,9717231,"['0 (Antidepressive Agents)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0DHU5B8D6V (Citalopram)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'NUV44L116D (Clomipramine)', 'OGG85SX4E4 (Imipramine)']",IM,"['Antidepressive Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Citalopram/pharmacology', 'Clomipramine/pharmacology', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells/*drug effects/enzymology/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Imipramine/pharmacology', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",,1999/09/16 09:00,2000/08/12 11:00,['1999/09/16 09:00'],"['1999/09/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/08/12 11:00 [medline]', '1999/09/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1099-0461(1999)13:6<338::AID-JBT8>3.0.CO;2-7 [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1099-0461(1999)13:6<338::aid-jbt8>3.0.co;2-7 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biochem Mol Toxicol. 1999;13(6):338-47. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1099-0461(1999)13:6<338::aid-jbt8>3.0.co;2-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we show that astrocytes spontaneously emerge in vitro without exogenously added LIF and BMP2 in the culture of neuroepithelial cells for a much longer period. This spontaneous astrocyte differentiation is completely impaired when neuroepithelial cells deficient for gp130, a signal transducing receptor component for LIF, are used. We also show that LIF and BMP2 as well as related cytokines and respective receptor molecules are expressed in fetal mouse brain and cultured neuroepithelial cells. Taken together with our previous finding that prenatal mouse brain deficient for gp130 exhibits a severe reduction of astrocytes, it is suggested that LIF acts cooperatively with BMP2 in vivo to induce astrocyte differentiation in mouse developing brain.","['Nakashima, K', 'Yanagisawa, M', 'Arakawa, H', 'Taga, T']","['Nakashima K', 'Yanagisawa M', 'Arakawa H', 'Taga T']","['Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,FEBS Lett,FEBS letters,0155157,"['0 (Bmp2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Proteins)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Lamp1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Lysosome-Associated Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Astrocytes/*physiology', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2', 'Bone Morphogenetic Proteins/*physiology', 'Brain/embryology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein/metabolism', 'Growth Inhibitors/*physiology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*physiology', 'Lysosome-Associated Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time Factors', '*Transforming Growth Factor beta']",,1999/09/16 00:00,1999/09/16 00:01,['1999/09/16 00:00'],"['1999/09/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/16 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/16 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-5793(99)00997-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0014-5793(99)00997-7 [doi]']",ppublish,FEBS Lett. 1999 Aug 20;457(1):43-6. doi: 10.1016/s0014-5793(99)00997-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In previous studies, we identified an approximately 1-Mb segment in 5q31 that was deleted in all patients examined. As part of a positional cloning project to identify transcribed sequences in this region, we identified and characterized the TTID gene. This gene contains 10 exons that extend over 19 kb. The composite cDNA is approximately 2.3 kb and encodes a protein of 498 amino acids, with a predicted molecular mass of 55 kDa. The C-terminal half of this putative protein contains an internally repeated domain of 43 amino acids, which resembles the N-terminal half of an immunoglobulin domain from the immense skeletal muscle protein titin. The TTID gene is expressed in multiple muscle tissue types as well as in thyroid gland and bone marrow. We evaluated the gene as a candidate tumor suppressor gene by searching for mutations in malignant myeloid disorders with abnormalities of chromosome 5. However, we detected no inactivating mutations. A single nucleotide change (G to A) was identified at nucleotide position 1889 in the untranslated region of the mRNA, which may represent a polymorphism.

Previous cytogenetic analysis from our group has shown that chromosome abnormalities involving the 5q13 band are common in HCL, occurring in approximately 1/3 of patients. The data suggest that the 5q13.3 band is likely to harbor a gene involved in the transformational events of this disease. We have recently found two cosmids flanking the 5q13.3 breakpoint in patients with HCL, and the distance between them is approximately 35 kb, as analyzed by fiber-FISH. The two cosmids have been located between the markers SGC34998 and WI-15505/WI-6897 by radiation hybrid mapping. Five of 11 patients with HCL had a hemizygous deletion of the two cosmids, indicating that the function of a tumor suppressor gene may be lost. With the aim of delineating the critical region of 5q13.3 loss in patients with HCL, we have constructed an integrated contig of YAC, BAC, PAC, P1, and cosmid clones that covers the region.

Our previous studies of integrin expression and function in CLL have shown that the abnormal cells are relatively nonadhesive and nonmotile on the protein ligands of these receptors. Here we show that CLL cells adhere to a non-protein ligand, hyaluronan (HA), and become motile (as assessed by both Boyden chamber migration and time-lapse video microscopy) on this ligand when stimulated with interleukin (IL) 8. The combined presence of HA and IL-8 was essential for this motility because IL-8 did not stimulate movement on other surfaces. Blocking antibodies showed that this motility is mediated by the receptor for HA-mediated motility (RHAMM), without the involvement of CD44. Moreover, confocal microscopy showed a polarized distribution of RHAMM and F-actin, but not CD44, in cells which had become motile on HA in the presence of IL-8. Immunohistochemical studies of nodes and spleen demonstrated an abundant reticular network of HA-containing fibers throughout diseased nodes and in splenic white pulp. The splenic red pulp and the luminal surface of high endothelial venules lacked HA. IL-8 was ubiquitously present in these tissues. CLL cells were shown to move spontaneously on fibroblast monolayers derived from lymphoid tissue; this movement was largely blocked by hyaluronidase or anti-RHAMM or anti-IL-8 antibodies. These studies indicate that IL-8-induced motility on HA is likely to be important for CLL cell migration through lymphoid tissue.","['Till, K J', 'Zuzel, M', 'Cawley, J C']","['Till KJ', 'Zuzel M', 'Cawley JC']","['Department of Haematology, University of Liverpool, United Kingdom. k.j.till@liv.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Extracellular Matrix Proteins)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-8A)', '0 (hyaluronan-mediated motility receptor)', '9004-61-9 (Hyaluronic Acid)']",IM,"['Actins/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Endothelium, Vascular/pathology', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins/physiology', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/analysis/physiology', 'Hyaluronic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-8/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Lymphoid Tissue/*pathology', 'Receptors, Interleukin/analysis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-8A', 'Spleen/pathology']",,1999/09/15 00:00,1999/09/15 00:01,['1999/09/15 00:00'],"['1999/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1999 Sep 1;59(17):4419-26.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The IC50 values of LIC against the tumor cells ranged from 0.1 to 1000 ng/ml. LIC had strong cytotoxic effects on malignant cells of epithelial and fibroblastic origin from various tissues and was also effective against Adriamycin-resistant tumor cells. LIC did not significantly affect the growth of lymphoma cells, leukemia cells, normal diploid fibroblasts, or primary liver cells at concentrations up to 10 microg/ml. The mechanism of the antiproliferative effect of LIC against malignant cells was the induction of apoptosis. LIC induced the fragmentation of nuclear DNA and the degradation of rRNA in tumor cells. The DNA fragmentation occurred within 1-5 h after the addition of LIC, and both the fragmentation and the inhibition of cancer-cell growth were suppressed by a nuclease inhibitor. In contrast, caspase inhibitors did not affect the antiproliferative activity of LIC. These results suggest that LIC induced apoptosis in malignant cells through the direct activation of nucleases and not through the activation of caspases. LIC reduced the incidence and the size of metastatic liver-cancer tumors in two different mouse metastatic liver-cancer models using human colon carcinoma cells. Histochemical analysis revealed that the KM12-HX cells in the tumor nodules were undergoing apoptosis; therefore, LIC also induced the apoptosis of tumor cells in vivo. In these animal models, LIC caused no observed changes in normal hepatocytes.","['Hirabayashi, K', 'Yano, J', 'Inoue, T', 'Yamaguchi, T', 'Tanigawara, K', 'Smyth, G E', 'Ishiyama, K', 'Ohgi, T', 'Kimura, K', 'Irimura, T']","['Hirabayashi K', 'Yano J', 'Inoue T', 'Yamaguchi T', 'Tanigawara K', 'Smyth GE', 'Ishiyama K', 'Ohgi T', 'Kimura K', 'Irimura T']","['Discovery Research Laboratories, Nippon Shinyaku Co., Ltd., Kyoto, Japan. k.hirabayashi@po.nippon-shinyaku.co.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (RNA, Ribosomal)', 'O84C90HH2L (Poly I-C)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Liposomes', 'Liver Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Microinjections', 'Poly I-C/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Ribosomal/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/09/15 00:00,1999/09/15 00:01,['1999/09/15 00:00'],"['1999/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1999 Sep 1;59(17):4325-33.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These features are considered to be results of secondary rearrangements after malignant transformation or emergence of new tumor clones. In the present study we analyzed the IgH gene rearrangement status in 18 cases with relapsing pre-B ALL using variable heavy chain (V(H)) gene family specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and single stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. Clonal IgH rearrangements were displayed in all leukemias but one, and altered rearrangement patterns occurred in five cases (29%), which were selected for detailed nucleotide sequence analysis. In one case, multiple subclones at diagnosis were suggested to be derived from a progenitor clone through joining of different V(H) germline gene segments to a pre-existing D-J(H) complex (V(H) to D-J(H) joining). Evidence for V(H) gene replacement with identical N-sequences at the V(H)-D junction and a common D-J(H) region was observed in one case. Diversification at the V(H)-D junction consisting of heterogeneous N-sequences were observed in one case. This molecular modification of the V(H)-D region could fit a hypothesized ""open-and-shut"" mechanism. Nevertheless, despite these ongoing events at least one IgH rearrangement remained unchanged throughout the disease in most patients, indicating that the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus can be a suitable marker for detection of minimal residual disease (MRD).","['Rosenquist, R', 'Thunberg, U', 'Li, A H', 'Forestier, E', 'Lonnerholm, G', 'Lindh, J', 'Sundstrom, C', 'Sallstrom, J', 'Holmberg, D', 'Roos, G']","['Rosenquist R', 'Thunberg U', 'Li AH', 'Forestier E', 'Lonnerholm G', 'Lindh J', 'Sundstrom C', 'Sallstrom J', 'Holmberg D', 'Roos G']","['Department of Pathology, Umea University, Sweden. richard.rosenquist@pathol.umu.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/chemistry/genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid']",,1999/09/15 00:00,1999/09/15 00:01,['1999/09/15 00:00'],"['1999/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1999.tb01765.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1999 Sep;63(3):171-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1999.tb01765.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the mechanisms of this defect by determining the response of the aplastic CD34+ clonogenic precursors to proliferative signals induced by hematopoietic growth factors and comparing their results with those of a control population. Light density bone marrow mononuclear cells were lymphocyte and monocyte depleted and enhanced for the CD34+ progenitors by immunomagnetic selection. Selected progenitors were then cultured in the mixed colony assay with incremental concentrations of combinations containing erythropoietin (Epo), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-3 (IL-3) and c-kit ligand. Bone marrow from aplastic patients had significantly fewer light density cells displaying the CD34 antigen (mean 0.65%, SD 0.35 vs. 1.62%, SD 1.4; p=0.002). Dose response studies on aplastic CD34+ cells demonstrated that at low concentrations of Epo, IL-3 and GM-CSF, clonogenic growth was significantly impaired but achieved normal values at concentrations giving plateau growth in control cultures. However, for all colony types, responses to effective concentrations of c-kit ligand corresponded with those of controls.

We report here the cytogenetic evolution of 52 cases of Philadelphia (Ph)-positive myelogenous leukemia (CML) receiving interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) therapy compared with that of 59 Ph-positive CML cases treated with busulfan (BU) or hydroxyurea (HY). Twenty-one percent of the CML patients receiving IFN-alpha displayed unusual secondary abnormalities, among which alteration of the long arm of chromosome 3, del(7), and del(9) were recurrent. The frequency of these unusual secondary changes was significantly higher than in CML cases after Bu or Hy treatment (P = 0.02). Three of the 11 IFN-alpha-treated CML patients displayed cytogenetic evolution in the chronic phase and, in two cases, the cytogenetic findings were transient, inasmuch as they disappeared upon withdrawal of IFN-alpha. In addition, a majority of cytogenetic abnormalities involved chromosome 3 at bands 3q21 and 3q26, which corresponds to the locus of EVI1, a gene implicated in the development or progression of human myeloid leukemias. Possible explanations include: toxicity of IFN-alpha by effect on bone marrow stroma, immune-modulating effects of IFN-alpha, and mutagenic effects of IFN-alpha. The mechanisms underlying these cytogenetic changes remain to be elucidated. However, our data suggest that IFN-alpha induces additional cytogenetic abnormalities even in the chronic phase through its immune-modulating effects and that these unusual cytogenetic abnormalities do not alter the history of CML.","['Maloisel, F', 'Uettwiller, F', 'Laplace, A', 'Lioure, B', 'Herbrecht, R', 'Mark, M', 'Dufour, P']","['Maloisel F', 'Uettwiller F', 'Laplace A', 'Lioure B', 'Herbrecht R', 'Mark M', 'Dufour P']","[""Service d'Onco-Hematologie, Hopitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg, Hopital de Hautepierre, France.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/therapeutic use', 'Busulfan/therapeutic use', 'Chromosome Aberrations/*chemically induced/diagnosis/genetics', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/*drug effects', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3/*drug effects/genetics', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/therapeutic use', 'Interferon-alpha/*adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",,1999/09/15 00:00,1999/09/15 00:01,['1999/09/15 00:00'],"['1999/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0165460899000266 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-4608(99)00026-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1999 Sep;113(2):172-6. doi: 10.1016/s0165-4608(99)00026-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we describe the first case of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) with a terminal 9q deletion as a sole abnormality. Chromosome analysis of the bone marrow cells showed 46,XX,del(9)(q22) in all 20 metaphases. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis with painting probes of chromosomes 15, 17, and 9 revealed only two normal chromosomes 15 and 17, normal chromosome 9, and del(9)(q22). FISH with cosmid DNA probes flanking the breakpoints of t(15;17) did not show the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RAR alpha)/PML fusion signal usually generated on the der(17) t(15;17). However, rearrangement of the RAR alpha gene and expression of the PML/RAR alpha chimeric transcript were identified by Southern blot and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analyses, respectively. These results suggested that the PML/RAR alpha fusion gene was generated by submicroscopic interstitial insertion of the RAR alpha gene into the PML gene. Therefore, 9q- was interpreted as a secondary aberration following the PML/RAR alpha rearrangement. The patient died during induction therapy because of intracerebral hemorrhage. Considering other reported cases of APL with 9q-, 9q- may be an adverse prognostic factor in APL as observed in AML with t(8;21).","['Yamamoto, K', 'Hamaguchi, H', 'Kobayashi, M', 'Tsurukubo, Y', 'Nagata, K']","['Yamamoto K', 'Hamaguchi H', 'Kobayashi M', 'Tsurukubo Y', 'Nagata K']","['Department of Hematology, Musashino Red Cross Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,1999/09/15 00:00,1999/09/15 00:01,['1999/09/15 00:00'],"['1999/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0165460899000151 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-4608(99)00015-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1999 Sep;113(2):120-5. doi: 10.1016/s0165-4608(99)00015-1.,,,,3,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we employed a newly developed technology termed spectral karyotyping to delineate chromosomal rearrangements in this cell line. Our study revealed a derivative of chromosome 7 that resulted from translocations of chromosome arms 5q and 16q to 7q; that is, der(7)t(5;7)(?;q?)t(5;16)(?;q?). Interestingly, both chromosomes 5 and 7 were also involved in translocations with chromosome 16 in der(16) t(5;16)(q?;q?22-24) and der(16)t(7;16)(?;q?22-24), respectively. Other notable chromosomal abnormalities that were not previously reported in the HL-60 included an insertion of chromosome 8 in the q arm of chromosome 11, a translocation between chromosomes 9 and 14, and a translocation between chromosomes 14 and 15. In an attempt to define the loss of the 5q31.1 region in HL-60, we performed fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis by utilizing bacterial artificial chromosomes BAC1 and BAC2 that spanned the IL9 and EGR1 gene interval, which was previously shown to be a critical region of loss in AML. We showed that a copy of both BAC1 (spanning the D5S399 locus) and BAC2 (spanning the D5S393 locus centromeric to BAC1) were present in the normal chromosome 5, but a second copy of BAC1 was lost and a second copy of BAC2 was inserted in the der(16)t(7;16) chromosome. Thus, not only was this study the first to use the new 24-color karyotyping technique to identify several novel chromosomal rearrangements in HL-60, but it also narrowed the 5q31.1 critical region of deletion to the region represented by BAC1.","['Liang, J C', 'Ning, Y', 'Wang, R Y', 'Padilla-Nash, H M', 'Schrock, E', 'Soenksen, D', 'Nagarajan, L', 'Ried, T']","['Liang JC', 'Ning Y', 'Wang RY', 'Padilla-Nash HM', 'Schrock E', 'Soenksen D', 'Nagarajan L', 'Ried T']","['Section of Cytogenetics, University of Texas M.

These were obtained from Brazilians of various ethnic origins, such as Japanese immigrants, whites, blacks and mulattos. We amplified and sequenced proviral DNAs of a part of the long terminal repeats. Phylogenetic trees revealed that all but 6 of the new isolates were not only similar to each other but also similar to HTLV-ls of other South American countries, including those from Amerindians. However, the isolates differed from the HTLV-ls of Africa and Japan. The other six isolates were from Japanese immigrants and were phylogenetically almost identical to HTLV-ls in Japan but different from the majority of South American HTLV-ls, including the other new Brazilian HTLV-ls. These findings indicate that the recent introduction of HTLV-1 from Japan is limited to Japanese immigrants. In addition, the results do not support the prevailing hypothesis that HTLV-ls in South America were introduced by blacks who were brought from Africa as slaves. Rather, these results suggest that the majority of HTLV-1s prevailing in South America have spread from Amerindians, some of whom are likely to have possessed this human retrovirus from the beginning of their settlement in South America.","['Yamashita, M', 'Veronesi, R', 'Menna-Barreto, M', 'Harrington, W J Jr', 'Sampio, C', 'Brites, C', 'Badaro, R', 'Andrade-Filho, A S', 'Okhura, S', 'Igarashi, T', 'Takehisa, J', 'Miura, T', 'Chamone, D', 'Bianchini, O', 'Jardim, C', 'Sonoda, S', 'Hayami, M']","['Yamashita M', 'Veronesi R', 'Menna-Barreto M', 'Harrington WJ Jr', 'Sampio C', 'Brites C', 'Badaro R', 'Andrade-Filho AS', 'Okhura S', 'Igarashi T', 'Takehisa J', 'Miura T', 'Chamone D', 'Bianchini O', 'Jardim C', 'Sonoda S', 'Hayami M']","['Laboratory of Viral Pathogenesis, Institute for Virus Research Kyoto University, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan. myamashi@virus.kyuoto-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,,IM,"['Adult', 'Africa', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Base Sequence', 'Brazil/epidemiology', 'Emigration and Immigration', 'Ethnicity', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Infections/*epidemiology/*virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Japan/ethnology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Phylogeny', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences/genetics']",,1999/09/15 09:00,2000/02/26 09:00,['1999/09/15 09:00'],"['1999/09/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/02/26 09:00 [medline]', '1999/09/15 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Virology. 1999 Aug 15;261(1):59-69.,,"['GENBANK/AF014644', 'GENBANK/AF014645', 'GENBANK/AF014646', 'GENBANK/AF014647', 'GENBANK/AF014648', 'GENBANK/AF014649', 'GENBANK/AF014650', 'GENBANK/AF014651', 'GENBANK/AF014652', 'GENBANK/AF014653', 'GENBANK/AF014654', 'GENBANK/AF014655', 'GENBANK/AF014656', 'GENBANK/AF014657', 'GENBANK/AF014658', 'GENBANK/AF014659', 'GENBANK/AF014660', 'GENBANK/AF014661', 'GENBANK/AF014662', 'GENBANK/AF014663', 'GENBANK/AF014664', 'GENBANK/AF014665', 'GENBANK/AF014666', 'GENBANK/AF014667', 'GENBANK/AF014668', 'GENBANK/AF014669', 'GENBANK/AF014670']",,,,,,,,,,,

Criteria have been established for the diagnosis of polycythaemia vera which should be strictly observed in order to distinguish between this disease, spurious polycythaemia, essential thrombocythaemia and secondary erythrocytosis. The goal of treatment is the prevention of thromboembolic complications and of myeloid metaplasia. The initial treatment always consists of phlebotomies until a hematocrit < 45% is achieved. The decision regarding maintenance therapy is difficult. While hydroxyurea or radiophosphorus is the treatment of choice in older patients (> 70 years of age), it is more difficult to select the appropriate therapy for younger patients (< 60 years), since recent studies have indicated that hydroxyurea treatment might increase the risk of leukemia.

Surface marker analysis with a flow cytometer revealed that only 21% and 11% of the blasts, respectively, were positive for CD41 and CD42b. Treatment with a permeabilizing agent apparently increased the reactivity of the blasts with anti-CD41 monoclonal antibody (MoAb), which can recognize IIb independently of IIIa. However no significant differences were observed in reactivity with anti-CD41 MoAb (which recognizes the IIb/IIIa complex) anti-CD61 MoAb and anti-CD42b MoAb before or after fixation.

A peculiar feature of the study was the collection of PBPC after prolonged tumor debulking. Our method included a stem cell enrichment phase followed by cell incubation with anti-B cell MoAbs (anti-CD19, CD20, CD22, CD23), addition of immunobeads, and then positive cell removal by passage on a Max-Sep (Baxter Immunotherapy) cell separator. Engraftment was rapid and stable. Hematological values were assessed 1 and 2 years after the autograft. Purging efficacy was molecularly assessed in a panel of 11 patients who showed persistence of PCR-detectable lymphoma cells on PBPC harvests despite intensified chemotherapeutic debulking. PCR-negativity was obtained in vitro and persisted in vivo after autograft in three FL patients; five more FL patients, whose purged PBPC were PCR+, converted to stable (3 patients) or fluctuating (two patients) PCR negativity after autograft.

Multivariate analysis of a series of prognostic factors, including the five used to calculate the IPI, showed that the serum sFas level was an independent prognostic factor for the overall survival.

Under these xenogenic coculture conditions, the numbers of CD34high+ cells and primitive progenitor cells, such as CD34high+ CD38(low/-) cells and high proliferative potential colony-forming cells (HPP-CFCs), increased dramatically by a factor of 102.1, 66.5 and 104.9, respectively.

However, it is not yet clear whether ATRA truly increases the risk of extramedullary recurrence and what are the risk factors. In this study, three of 13 patients with recurrent APL after prior treatment of ATRA were found to have extramedullary involvement, compared with none in 11 recurrent patients previously treated with chemotherapy alone (estimated relative risk 2.100, 95% confidence interval 1.341-3.289). Furthermore, in the former group of patients, the development of retinoic acid (RA) syndrome during prior induction treatment was significantly associated with extramedullary involvement at relapse (three in five patients with RA syndrome vs none in eight without the syndrome, estimated relative risk 5.000, 95% confidence interval 1.448-17.271).

We established a novel cell line, designated MDS-KZ, from a patient with MDS in blastic transformation, and further investigated the effects of VK2 using this novel cell line. MDS-KZ shows complex chromosomal anomaly including -4, 5q-, -7, 13q+, 20q-, consistent with that seen in the original patient. Culture of MDS-KZ cells in RPMI1640 medium containing 10% FBS lead to steady but very slow proliferation with a doubling time of 14 days. However, the cellular growth rate was significantly accelerated in the presence of various growth factors such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, stem cell factor, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interleukin-3, and thrombopoietin. Most of the cultured cells show the morphological features of myeloblasts. They are positive for CD7, CD33, CD34, CD45, CD117, and HLA-DR. However, about 10% of the cells are more mature metamyelocytes and neutrophils with various dysplastic characteristics such as pseudo-Pelger nuclear anomaly and hypersegmentation, suggesting a potential for differentiation in this cell line. As previously reported for cultured primary leukemia cells, exposure to VK2, but not to VK1, resulted in induction of apoptosis of MDS-KZ cells in a dose-dependent manner (IC50: 5 microM). In addition, VK2 treatment induced down-regulation of BCL-2 and up-regulation of BAX protein expression with concomitant activation of caspase-3 (CPP32).

A multiparameter flow cytometry method was developed which allows simultaneous quantitative measurement of total cellular fluorescence and the amount of anthracyclines intercalated into the DNA. Anthracycline DNA intercalation was measured by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between Hoechst 33342 and anthracyclines. Daunorubicin and idarubicin accumulation were studied and compared in established cell lines expressing Pgp and MRP1. The data demonstrate that daunorubicin DNA intercalation is affected by both Pgp and MRP1 whereas idarubicin DNA intercalation is affected only by MRP1. MRP1 and Pgp function could be blocked completely by 5 microM PAK 104P, while higher concentrations of verapamil, PSC 833 and cyclosporin A were necessary to attain complete blocking of MRP1 compared to Pgp. Daunorubicin DNA intercalation correlates better with cell survival and is more sensitive at physiological MDR expression as observed in hematopoietic progenitors than daunorubicin levels measured by total cellular fluorescence. In conclusion, idarubicin DNA intercalation is reduced by MRP1 but not by Pgp. PAK-104P is an effective modulator for both Pgp and MRP1 and may further improve idarubicin efficacy.","['Smeets, M E', 'Raymakers, R A', 'Vierwinden, G', 'Pennings, A H', 'Boezeman, J', 'Minderman, H', 'de Witte, T M']","['Smeets ME', 'Raymakers RA', 'Vierwinden G', 'Pennings AH', 'Boezeman J', 'Minderman H', 'de Witte TM']","['Division of Hematology and Central Hematology Laboratory, University Hospital Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Intercalating Agents)', '0 (MSH3 protein, human)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (MutS Homolog 3 Protein)', '0 (Rhodamines)', 'P976261J69 (bisbenzimide ethoxide trihydrochloride)', 'Y49M64GZ4Q (multidrug resistance-associated protein 1)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*physiology', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/metabolism/*pharmacology', '*Base Pair Mismatch', 'Benzimidazoles', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Daunorubicin/metabolism', 'Energy Transfer', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Intercalating Agents/*pharmacology', '*Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins', 'MutS Homolog 3 Protein', 'Rhodamines', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence/methods', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/09/14 00:00,1999/09/14 00:01,['1999/09/14 00:00'],"['1999/09/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/14 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401496 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Sep;13(9):1390-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401496.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Either variant could be detected specifically from cDNA from a single K562 (b3a2) and BV173 (b2a2) cell with the respective TaqMan probe. Bcr-abl expression was normalized by comparison with GAPDH expression, and samples were quantitated using standard cDNA dilutions from K562 or BV173 cells. In a retrospective analysis 13 patients with CML after allogeneic (n = 10) or autologous (n = 3) SCT including patients with relapsed or persistent CML were analyzed by both real-time and conventional nested RT-PCR. In addition chimerism was monitored by FISH analysis of sex chromosomes in three patients with relapsed disease. The bcr-abl/GAPDH ratio dropped at least 1000-fold in all seven patients evaluable prior to and after allogeneic SCT as estimated by real-time RT-PCR, and conventional RT-PCR became negative in 6/7 patients. In five patients with relapsed or persistent disease after allogeneic SCT the bcr-abl/GAPDH ratio eventually increased again, and real-time RT-PCR was as sensitive as conventional RT-PCR for detection of bcr-abl. Donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) were given to all five patients, and the bcr-abl/GAPDH ratio dropped to undetectable levels in two patients both remaining in continuing molecular remission. In contrast, in three other patients the bcr-abl/GAPDH ratio decreased only or did not change significantly after DLI. In three patients undergoing autologous SCT the bcr-abl/GAPDH ratio dropped only 1.1 to 30-fold, and the patients were tested positive with real-time RT-PCR at all time points.

FL has a strong capacity to boost production of dendritic and natural killer cells in vivo, thereby providing a new and promising tool for anti-cancer immunotherapy. Intracellular FLT3 signaling involves tyrosine phosphorylation of several cytoplasmic proteins including SHC. We have found that upon FLT3 activation SHC phosphorylation occurs at tyrosine 239/240 and 313. SHC possesses two phosphotyrosine-binding domains: an amino-terminal phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) and a carboxy-terminal Src Homology 2 (SH2) domain. Neither is required for SHC phosphorylation, but the PTB domain is necessary and sufficient for SHC binding to the SH2 containing inositol phosphatase (SHIP). Overexpression of SHC increases the level of SHIP phosphorylation on tyrosines in response to FLT3 activation, suggesting that SHC availability is a limiting step for SHIP phosphorylation. This effect is observed only if the SHC PTB domain is functional. Interestingly, SHC overexpression in FLT3-activatable Ba/F3 cells limits FLT3-dependent cell growth and this effect requires tyrosine 313. Taken together, the present data show that SHC can antagonize cell proliferation induced by FLT3 stimulation and regulate phosphorylation of the SHIP negative regulator. In addition, our study provides the structural bases for SHC phosphorylation and formation of the SHC/SHIP complex.","['Marchetto, S', 'Fournier, E', 'Beslu, N', 'Aurran-Schleinitz, T', 'Dubreuil, P', 'Borg, J P', 'Birnbaum, D', 'Rosnet, O']","['Marchetto S', 'Fournier E', 'Beslu N', 'Aurran-Schleinitz T', 'Dubreuil P', 'Borg JP', 'Birnbaum D', 'Rosnet O']","[""Laboratoire d'Oncologie Moleculaire, INSERM U119, Marseille, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Shc Signaling Adaptor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.3.86 (INPPL1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.86 (Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-Trisphosphate 5-Phosphatases)']",IM,"['*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', '*Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Genes, myc', 'Genetic Code', 'Kinetics', 'Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-Trisphosphate 5-Phosphatases', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proteins/*metabolism', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Shc Signaling Adaptor Proteins', '*src Homology Domains']",,1999/09/14 00:00,1999/09/14 00:01,['1999/09/14 00:00'],"['1999/09/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/14 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401527 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Sep;13(9):1374-82. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401527.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Kasumi-3 cells with t(3;7)(q26;q22) highly expressed a 6 kb transcript of EVI1, which is located on chromosome 3q26. Therefore, we further characterized the chromosomal breakpoint by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis near EVI1. We identified and isolated the chromosomal breakpoint at approximately 80 kb upstream from the 5' end of EVI1. Sequence analysis of the breakpoint revealed that the whole Vbeta region from T cell receptor beta (TCRbeta) at 7q35 was translocated to the upstream of EVI1. A 1.0 kb TCRbeta transcript was expressed in the Kasumi-3 cells, suggesting that TCRbeta rearrangement occurred as Dbeta-Jbeta joining events. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis revealed that the inverted chromosome 7q22-q35 segment between TCRbeta and the region proximal to the erythropoietin gene at 7q22 was translocated to the region distal to EVI1 in der(3). Since the telomeric region of chromosome 8 q was also translocated to the inverted chromosome 7q22-q35 segment in der(3), the chromosomal abnormalities of der(3) were defined as being der(3)t(3;7;8)(3pter-3q26::7q35-7q22::8q22 -8qter).

We have previously shown that Axl, a novel RTK, is mainly expressed in leukemias of myeloid origin, and that its expression may be associated with cells of monocytic origin. Since expression of certain RTKs in cancer may be associated with different biology and survival, we investigated whether the expression of Axl is associated with clinical characteristics and survival in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). RNA from 54 patients with AML treated in a cooperative group trial was analyzed in a retrospective and blinded manner using a semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction-based assay with primers specific for the Axl gene. Axl expression was found in 19 out of the 54 cases (35%). Axl expression was not detected more frequently in patients of older age, specific FAB categories, or cases with extramedullary disease. However, there existed a correlation between Axl and bcl-2 expression levels. AML cells with high bcl-2 expression showed higher Axl expression (r = 0.32; P = 0.02), and furthermore, Axl transcript numbers were also higher in AML with high CD34 expression (n = 38, r = 0.42; P = 0.008). No significant difference between leukemias expressing and not expressing Axl was found with regard to complete remission rate. However, quantitative Axl expression was associated with worse progression-free and overall survival. Higher Axl levels had worse prognosis for progression-free (beta: 0.68, s.e.: 0.28, P = 0.015) and overall survival (beta: 0.61, s.e.: 0.31, P = 0.05) using multivariate Cox models adjusted for age, Auer rods and leukocyte counts. In conclusion, in this retrospective analysis, no difference with regard to clinical characteristics at diagnosis was found between AML patients whose leukemia cells show Axl expression vs patients whose cells are Axl negative. The association between Axl and bcl-2 and Axl and CD34 expression in de novo AML needs further investigation.

We compared the characteristics of these 10 cases with those of the 30 cyclin D1 negative CLD. Despite non-distinctive cytological and phenotypic features, the 10 cyclin D1 positive patients exhibited a strikingly uniform clinical presentation with elevated leukocytosis, massive spleen enlargement and no superficial lymphadenopathy. Their outcome was very poor with a median survival of 10 months, contrasting with the prolonged survival of the cyclin D1 negative patients. The cytological features of tumor cells from these 10 patients with cyclin D1 positive unclassified leukemic CLD were similar to those of the circulating lymphoid cells from 15 patients with histologically proven mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and primary or secondary blood involvement. Therefore, cyclin D1 expression allowed identification among the unclassified CLD, a subset of aggressive disorders which represent a leukemic counterpart of MCL (mantle cell leukemia).

Among lymphoid malignancies, cyclin D1 overexpression was exclusively detected in B cell malignancies accompanied by a genetic event consisting of 11q13 chromosomal translocation, consisting of 13 of 19 (68%) patients with mantle cell lymphoma, two of 11 (18%) with B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and one of six (17%) with multiple myeloma. The cyclin D2 expression was significantly higher in T cell malignancies than in B cell malignancies (P = 0.003 for cell lines and P < 0.0001 for patient samples, respectively). In the T cell malignancies, cyclin D2 overexpression was predominantly recognized in those with mature phenotype. Furthermore, cyclin D2 expression was upregulated by phytohemagglutinin (PHA) stimulation of normal T-lymphocytes, suggesting that this simply represents the proliferation status of mature T cells. Although cyclin D3 was ubiquitously expressed, its expression was reduced in lymphoid malignancies with cyclin D1 or D2 overexpression. In myeloid leukemias, although three D-type type cyclins were differentially expressed, no preference for particular D-type cyclins was found. This selective usage of D-type cyclins in lymphoid malignancies suggests an existence of a regulatory mechanism among three D-type cyclins.","['Suzuki, R', 'Kuroda, H', 'Komatsu, H', 'Hosokawa, Y', 'Kagami, Y', 'Ogura, M', 'Nakamura, S', 'Kodera, Y', 'Morishima, Y', 'Ueda, R', 'Seto, M']","['Suzuki R', 'Kuroda H', 'Komatsu H', 'Hosokawa Y', 'Kagami Y', 'Ogura M', 'Nakamura S', 'Kodera Y', 'Morishima Y', 'Ueda R', 'Seto M']","['Laboratory of Chemotherapy, Aichi Cancer Center, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (CCND2 protein, human)', '0 (CCND3 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin D2)', '0 (Cyclin D3)', '0 (Cyclins)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)']",IM,"['Cell Lineage', 'Cyclin D1/*genetics', 'Cyclin D2', 'Cyclin D3', 'Cyclins/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*physiology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/09/14 00:00,1999/09/14 00:01,['1999/09/14 00:00'],"['1999/09/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/14 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401485 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Sep;13(9):1335-42. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401485.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whereas at least two regions of minimal deletion have been established, one in 6q21-q23 and another in 6q25-q27, no tumor suppressor gene that might be involved in the pathogenesis of lymphoid malignancies has been so far identified from these segments. For B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) conflicting data have been reported regarding the incidence and prognostic significance of 6q deletions. In the current study we have used two YAC clones mapping to deletion regions in bands 6q21 and 6q27 as probes for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in a large series of B-CLL cases to analyze the incidence, localization and clinical significance of 6q aberrations. Among 285 patients with B-CLL studied we identified 21 cases (7%) with 6q deletions. All deletions were found with the probe mapping to 6q21 while the 6q27 region was deleted only in a third of these cases. Analysis of the clinical characteristics and laboratory parameters showed that the patients with 6q deletions had higher white blood cell counts and more extensive lymphadenopathy. However, the overall survival and the treatment-free intervals were similar in the two groups. We conclude that deletions in 6q21 occur in 7% of B-CLL and identify a subgroup of patients characterized by a larger tumor mass but no inferior outcome.","['Stilgenbauer, S', 'Bullinger, L', 'Benner, A', 'Wildenberger, K', 'Bentz, M', 'Dohner, K', 'Ho, A D', 'Lichter, P', 'Dohner, H']","['Stilgenbauer S', 'Bullinger L', 'Benner A', 'Wildenberger K', 'Bentz M', 'Dohner K', 'Ho AD', 'Lichter P', 'Dohner H']","['Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik V, University of Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (DNA Probes)'],IM,"['*Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6', 'DNA Probes', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis']",,1999/09/14 00:00,1999/09/14 00:01,['1999/09/14 00:00'],"['1999/09/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/14 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401499 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Sep;13(9):1331-4. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401499.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recombinant human IL-11 (rhIL-11) is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Escherichia coli. Both in vitro and in vivo, rhIL-11 has shown effects on multiple hematopoietic cell types. Its predominant in vivo hematopoietic activity is the stimulation of peripheral platelet counts in both normal and myelosuppressed animals. This activity is mediated through effects on both early and late progenitor cells to stimulate megakaryocyte differentiation and maturation. rhIL-11 has been approved for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia. The hematopoietic effects of rhIL-11 are most likely direct effects on progenitor cells and megakaryocytes in combination with other cytokines or growth factors. rhIL-11 also induces secretion of acute phase proteins (ferritin, haptoglobin, C-reactive protein, and fibrinogen) from the liver. The induction of heme oxidase and inhibition of several P450 oxidases have been reported from in vitro studies. In vivo, rhIL-11 treatment decreases sodium excretion by the kidney by an unknown mechanism and induces hemodilution. rhIL-11 also exhibits anti-inflammatory effects in a variety of animal models of acute and chronic inflammation, including inflammatory bowel disease, inflammatory skin disease, autoimmune joint disease, and various infection-endotoxemia syndromes. rhIL-11 has trophic effects on non-transformed intestinal epithelium under conditions of mucosal damage. The mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of rhIL-11 has been extensively studied. rhIL-11 directly affects macrophage and T cell effector function. rhIL-11 inhibits tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha), interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta), interleukin 12 (IL-12), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and nitric oxide (NO) production from activated macrophages in vitro. The inhibition of cytokine production was associated with inhibition of nuclear translocation of the transcription factor, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB). The block to NF-kappaB nuclear translocation correlates with the ability of rhIL-11 to maintain or enhance production of the inhibitors of NF-kappaB, IkappaB-alpha and IkappaB-beta. In addition to effects on macrophages, rhIL-11 also reduces CD4+ T cell production of Th1 cytokines, such as IFN gamma induced by IL-12, while enhancing Th2 cytokine production. rhIL-11 also blocks IFN gamma production in vivo. The molecular effects of rhIL-11 have also been studied in a clinical trial. Molecular analysis of skin biopsies of patients with psoriasis before and during rhIL-11 treatment demonstrates a decrease in mRNA levels of TNF alpha, IFN gamma and iNOS. These activities suggest that in addition to its thrombopoietic clinical use, rhIL-11 may also be valuable in the treatment of inflammatory diseases. The clinical utility of the anti-inflammatory properties of rhIL-11 is being investigated in patients with Crohn's disease, psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis. These diseases are believed to be initiated and maintained by activated CD4+ Th1 cells in conjunction with activated macrophages.","['Schwertschlag, U S', 'Trepicchio, W L', 'Dykstra, K H', 'Keith, J C', 'Turner, K J', 'Dorner, A J']","['Schwertschlag US', 'Trepicchio WL', 'Dykstra KH', 'Keith JC', 'Turner KJ', 'Dorner AJ']","['Genetics Institute, Cambridge, MA 02140, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (IL11RA protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (Interleukin-11 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-11)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Acute-Phase Reaction', 'Adjuvants, Immunologic/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Epithelium/drug effects', 'Gene Expression', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-11/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-11 Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Receptors, Interleukin/genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-11', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology']",,1999/09/14 00:00,1999/09/14 00:01,['1999/09/14 00:00'],"['1999/09/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/14 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401514 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Sep;13(9):1307-15. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401514.,,,,98,,,,,,,,,

The mean cell dose of CD34+ cells was 3.3 +/- 3.51 x 10(5)/kg, and of CD34+/CD41+ cells was 3.94 +/- 3.99 x 10(4)/kg.

Until May 1994 ABMT was performed; from June 1994, if PBSC collection was adequate, PBSCT was performed. Out of 88 evaluable patients, 73 obtained a complete remission (CR) and 15 were resistant. Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation was performed in 16 patients. Forty-four (50%) were given autologous stem cell transplantation. ABMT was performed in 21 cases; twenty-nine patients were given G-CSF mobilization after NOVIA administration. An adequate number of PBSC was obtained in 23/29 (79%) cases, which were then re-infused. Median times to both neutrophil and platelet recovery from transplant were significantly shorter for the PBSC group (17 vs 36 days to 500 PMN/microl, P < 0.01; 20 vs 150 days to 20000 platelets/microl, P < 0.02; 37 vs 279 days to 50000 platelets/microl, P < 0.03), as were days of hospitalization after the reinfusion (18 vs 33, P < 0.03) and median days to transfusion independence. Toxicity was not significant in either group. After a minimum follow-up for live patients of 24 months (longer than the mean time for relapse observed for the PBSC series - 14 months) the percentage of relapses was similar: 11 of 21 (52.4%) and 12 of 23 (52.1%) in the ABMT and PBSC groups, respectively. Our results indicate that autologous PBSC transplantation, performed after an intensive chemotherapy regimen, is not inferior to ABMT in terms of disease-free survival and allows faster recovery times and reduced need for transfusion support.","['Visani, G', 'Lemoli, R', 'Tosi, P', 'Martinelli, G', 'Testoni, N', 'Ricci, P', 'Motta, M', 'Gherlinzoni, F', 'Leopardi, G', 'Pastano, R', 'Rizzi, S', 'Piccaluga, P', 'Isidori, A', 'Tura, S']","['Visani G', 'Lemoli R', 'Tosi P', 'Martinelli G', 'Testoni N', 'Ricci P', 'Motta M', 'Gherlinzoni F', 'Leopardi G', 'Pastano R', 'Rizzi S', 'Piccaluga P', 'Isidori A', 'Tura S']","[""Institute of Haematology and Medical Oncology, 'Seragnoli', Bologna University, Bologna, Italy.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ICE protocol 4', 'NOAC protocol']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Blood Cells/*transplantation', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization/methods', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Leukapheresis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Remission Induction', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",,1999/09/14 00:00,1999/09/14 00:01,['1999/09/14 00:00'],"['1999/09/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/14 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1701920 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1999 Sep;24(5):467-72. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1701920.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Evans blue uptake by the forebrain and cerebellum was significantly increased between 8-12 weeks post inoculation. Immunohistochemistry revealed foci of albumin, transferrin, alpha(2)-macroglobulin and IgG transudation around blood vessels particularly in the cerebral cortex and cerebellar vermis. These leaks were often associated with astrocytosis and apoptotic cells. Unlike the other serum proteins, IgG immunoreactivity extended from the circumventricular organs and disseminated throughout the brain parenchyma, accumulating on the plasma membranes of hippocampal and cortical neurons. Consistent with the chronic elevation of free glutamate levels in LP-BM5 infected mice, the increase in Evans blue uptake into the forebrain was completely reversed following dizocilpine administration. Thus, the chronic increase in free glutamate levels in LP-BM5 infected mouse brain contributes to BBB disruption. Furthermore, the CNS accumulation of serum proteins, particularly IgG, observed in these mice may increase osmotic load, impair neuronal function, and cause white matter pallor. Administration of NMDA receptor antagonists may prove useful in managing BBB permeability in those neuropathologies, such as HIV-associated dementia/cognitive/motor complex, having a glutamatergic component.","['Kustova, Y', 'Grinberg, A', 'Basile, A S']","['Kustova Y', 'Grinberg A', 'Basile AS']","['Laboratory of Bio-Organic Chemistry, Building 8, Room 1A15, NIDDK, NICHD, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892-0008, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Brain Res,Brain research,0045503,"['0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Coloring Agents)', '0 (Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate)', '3KX376GY7L (Glutamic Acid)', '45PG892GO1 (Evans Blue)', '6LR8C1B66Q (Dizocilpine Maleate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Proteins/metabolism', 'Blood-Brain Barrier/*physiology', 'Brain Diseases/*physiopathology', 'Coloring Agents', 'Dizocilpine Maleate/pharmacology', 'Evans Blue', 'Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists/pharmacology', 'Glutamic Acid/physiology', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Prosencephalon/drug effects/metabolism', 'Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Retroviridae Infections/*physiopathology']",,1999/09/14 00:00,1999/09/14 00:01,['1999/09/14 00:00'],"['1999/09/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/14 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/14 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-8993(99)01734-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-8993(99)01734-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Brain Res. 1999 Aug 21;839(1):153-63. doi: 10.1016/s0006-8993(99)01734-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been postulated that template switching occurs after pauses in the action of reverse transcriptase. Hence factors which affect pausing, such as polymerization rate, may affect the frequency of template switching. To address the hypothesis that increasing the time required to complete reverse transcription increases the frequency of template switching, we established conditions that lengthened the time required to complete a single round of intracellular Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcription approximately threefold. Under these conditions, which resulted from intracellular nucleotide pool imbalances generated with hydroxyurea, we examined template switching frequency using a lacZ-based tandem repeat deletion assay. We observed that the frequency of deletion during reverse transcription in hydroxyurea-treated cells was approximately threefold higher than that in untreated control cells.

Previously, we demonstrated that interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-12, and gamma interferon increased in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from animals with early disease and decreased in PBMCs from animals with late disease stages of bovine leukemia virus (BLV) infection. In contrast, IL-10 increased with disease progression. To examine the effects of these cytokines on BLV expression, BLV tax and pol mRNA and p24 protein were quantified by competitive PCR and immunoblotting, respectively. IL-10 inhibited BLV tax and pol mRNA levels in BLV-infected PBMCs; however, the inhibitory effect of IL-10 was prevented in PBMCs depleted of monocytes and/or macrophages (monocyte/macrophages). To determine whether these factors were secreted or monocyte/macrophage associated, monocyte/macrophage-depleted PBMCs were cultured with isolated monocyte/macrophages in transwells where contact between monocyte/macrophages and nonadherent PBMCs was blocked. BLV tax and pol mRNA levels increased in transwell cultures similar to cultures containing nonseparated cells, and IL-10 addition inhibited the increase of BLV tax and pol mRNA. These results suggest that monocyte/macrophages secrete soluble factor(s) that increases BLV mRNA levels and that secretion of these soluble factor(s) could be inhibited by IL-10. In contrast, IL-2 increased BLV tax and pol mRNA and p24 protein production. Thus, IL-10 production by BLV-infected animals with late stage disease may serve to control BLV mRNA levels, while IL-2 may increase BLV mRNA in the early disease stage. To determine a correlation between cell proliferation and BLV expression, the effect of IL-2 and IL-10 on PBMC proliferation was tested. As anticipated, IL-2 stimulated while IL-10 suppressed antigen-specific PBMC proliferation. The present study, combined with our previous findings, suggests that increased IL-10 production in late disease stages suppresses BLV mRNA levels, while IL-2-activated immune responses stimulate BLV expression by BLV-infected B cells.","['Pyeon, D', 'Splitter, G A']","['Pyeon D', 'Splitter GA']","['Department of Animal Health and Biomedical Sciences, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin 53706, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, pol)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/*drug effects', 'Gene Products, pol/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Gene Products, tax/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Interleukin-10/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis']",PMC112861,1999/09/11 00:00,1999/09/11 00:01,['1999/09/11 00:00'],"['1999/09/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.73.10.8427-8434.1999 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1999 Oct;73(10):8427-34. doi: 10.1128/JVI.73.10.8427-8434.1999.,,,['R01 CA59127/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

Some ""full-length"" DNA copies of the viral genome were synthesized in mutant virus-infected cells. The CCCC and CCHH mutants produced these DNA copies at greatly reduced levels. Circle junction fragments, amplified from two-long-terminal-repeat viral DNA (vDNA) by PCR, were cloned and characterized. Remarkably, it was discovered that vDNA isolated from cells infected with mutant virions had a wide variety of abnormalities at the site at which the two ends of the linear precursor had been ligated to form the circle (i.e., the junction between the 5' end of U3 and the 3' end of U5). In some molecules, bases were missing from regions corresponding to the U3 and U5 linear vDNA termini; in others, the viral sequences extended either beyond the U5 sequences into the primer-binding site and 5' leader or beyond the U3 sequences into the polypurine tract into the env coding region. Still other molecules contained nonviral sequences between the linear vDNA termini. Such defective genomes would certainly be unsuitable substrates for integration. Thus, strict conservation of the CCHC structure in NC is required for infection events prior to and possibly including integration.","['Gorelick, R J', 'Fu, W', 'Gagliardi, T D', 'Bosche, W J', 'Rein, A', 'Henderson, L E', 'Arthur, L O']","['Gorelick RJ', 'Fu W', 'Gagliardi TD', 'Bosche WJ', 'Rein A', 'Henderson LE', 'Arthur LO']","['AIDS Vaccine Program, SAIC Frederick, National Cancer Institute, Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, Frederick, Maryland 21702-1201, USA. gorelick@avpaxp1.ncifcrf.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,,IM,"['Animals', 'Capsid/*genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', '*Point Mutation', 'Retroviridae Infections/*virology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*virology', 'Virus Replication/*genetics', 'Zinc Fingers']",PMC112836,1999/09/11 00:00,1999/09/11 00:01,['1999/09/11 00:00'],"['1999/09/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.73.10.8185-8195.1999 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1999 Oct;73(10):8185-95. doi: 10.1128/JVI.73.10.8185-8195.1999.,,,"['N01-CO-46000/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CO-56000/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

Previously we developed BLV SGV that constitutively expresses BLV gag, pol, and env and related cis-acting sequences but lacks tax, rex, RIII, and GIV and most of the BLV long terminal repeat sequences, including the cis-acting Tax and Rex response elements. The novel SGV virus is replication competent and replicates a selectable vector to a titer similar to that of the parental BLV in cell culture. The overall goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that infection with BLV SGV is nonpathogenic in rabbits. BLV infection of rabbits by inoculation of cell-free BLV or cell-associated BLV typically causes an immunodeficiency-like syndrome and death by 1 year postinfection. We sought to evaluate whether in vivo transfection of BLV provirus recapitulates pathogenic BLV infection and to compare BLV and BLV SGV with respect to infection, immunogenicity, and clinical outcome. Three groups of rabbits were subjected to in vivo transfection with BLV, BLV SGV, or negative control DNA. The results of our 20-month study indicate that in vivo transfection of rabbits with BLV recapitulates the fatal BLV infection produced by cell-free or cell-associated BLV. The BLV-infected rabbits exhibited sudden onset of clinical decline and immunodeficiency-like symptoms that culminated in death. BLV and BLV SGV infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells and induced similar levels of seroconversion to BLV structural proteins. However, BLV SGV exhibited a reduced proviral load and did not trigger the immunodeficiency-like syndrome. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that BLV SGV is infectious and immunogenic and lacks BLV pathogenicity in rabbits, and they support the use of this modified proviral vector delivery system for vaccines against complex retroviruses like BLV.","['Kucerova, L', 'Altanerova, V', 'Altaner, C', 'Boris-Lawrie, K']","['Kucerova L', 'Altanerova V', 'Altaner C', 'Boris-Lawrie K']","['Cancer Research Institute, Slovak Academy of Sciences, SK-833 91 Bratislava, Slovakia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Viral Structural Proteins)', '0 (Viral Vaccines)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/immunology/*prevention & control', '*Genes, Viral', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*genetics/*immunology', 'Rabbits', 'Viral Structural Proteins/*genetics/*immunology', '*Viral Vaccines/genetics/immunology']",PMC112833,1999/09/11 00:00,1999/09/11 00:01,['1999/09/11 00:00'],"['1999/09/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.73.10.8160-8166.1999 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1999 Oct;73(10):8160-6. doi: 10.1128/JVI.73.10.8160-8166.1999.,,,"['P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 TW001217/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States', 'AI40851/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P30CA16058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

In the presence of Rex, the total amount of steady-state viral RNA was increased fourfold. Rex significantly up-regulated the level of incompletely spliced RNAs by increasing RNA stability and was associated with a twofold down-regulation of the completely spliced tax/rex RNA. PCR analysis of subcellular RNA fractions, isolated from transfected cells, indicated that the level of gag/pol and env cytoplasmic RNAs were increased 7- to 9-fold in the presence of Rex, whereas Gag protein production was increased 130-fold.

Deletion or substitution of a putative NF-kappaB binding site identified in the bcl-x promoter significantly decreased Tax-induced transactivation. This NF-kappaB-like element was able to form a complex with NF-kappaB family proteins in vitro. Furthermore, Tax-induced transactivation of the bcl-x promoter was also diminished by the mutant IkappaBalpha, which specifically inhibits NF-kappaB activity.

The effect of distance between direct repeats on the rate of deletion was determined for 16 murine leukemia virus (MLV)-based vectors containing a 701-bp direct repeat of overlapping fragments of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene (HTK). The direct repeats were separated by spacer fragments of various lengths (0.1 to 3.5 kb). Southern analysis of infected cells after one replication cycle indicated that all vectors in which the distance between homologous sequences was >1,500 bp deleted at very high rates (>90%). In contrast, vectors containing <1,500 bp between homologous sequences exhibited lower frequencies of deletion (37 to 82%). To analyze the pattern of locations at which RT switched templates, restriction site markers were introduced to divide the downstream direct repeat into five regions. RT switched templates within all five regions of the 701-bp direct repeat and the frequency of template switching was greater within the 5' regions in comparison to the 3' regions. The probability of RT switching templates within the 5' regions doubled when the MLV packaging sequence (Psi) was placed between the 701-bp direct repeats. However, Psi did not increase the rate of template switching for shorter direct repeats.

From these data, melittin-mediated activation/inhibition of major phospholipases in U937 cells was related to pore formation, permeabilization and cytolysis as determined by light microscopy. Also, the effect of melittin on acylhydrolase activity in the cell-free sonicated lysates of U937 cells was examined. Here we report that synthetic melittin (1 microM) caused cytolysis of U937 cells within 10-15 min. Cellular hypertrophy (5 min) and aggregation (1 min) preceded cytolysis. TLC analysis of these lipids showed that total levels (cellular + medium) of diacylglycerol (DAG), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) decreased, while that of arachidonic acid (AA) increased continuously (5-30 min). However, levels of phosphatidylethanol (PEt) phosphatidic acid (PA) and phosphatidylserine (PS) were increased transiently at 5-10 min being maximal at 5 min. Taken together, the combined levels of PEt and PA (an end product of phopholipase D, PLD) were about 42-fold higher than the level of AA at 5-10 min. Enhancement of AA levels appeared to result from in vitro reactions of various acylhydrolases and their phospholipid substrates (free/membrane bound) liberated into the medium during pore formation/cell lysis. Incubation of sonicated cell lysates also enhanced release of AA, which decreased upon addition of melittin, indicating that melittin inhibited these acylhydrolases. A consistent decrease in the level of DAG showed that phospholipase C was unaffected. Hence, transient activation of PLD bymelittin at the point of initiation of cytolysis, suggested a role for PLD in melittin-mediated membrane disruption/cytolysis by an uncharacterized signal transduction mechanism.","['Saini, S S', 'Chopra, A K', 'Peterson, J W']","['Saini SS', 'Chopra AK', 'Peterson JW']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston 77555-1070, USA. sssaini@utmb.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Toxicon,Toxicon : official journal of the International Society on Toxinology,1307333,"['0 (Indicators and Reagents)', '0 (Lipids)', '20449-79-0 (Melitten)', 'EC 3.1.4.4 (Phospholipase D)']",IM,"['Chromatography, Thin Layer', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*enzymology', 'Lipids/chemistry', 'Melitten/*pharmacology', 'Phospholipase D/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/09/11 00:00,1999/09/11 00:01,['1999/09/11 00:00'],"['1999/09/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/11 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0041-0101(99)00110-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s0041-0101(99)00110-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicon. 1999 Nov;37(11):1605-19. doi: 10.1016/s0041-0101(99)00110-5.,,,['AI 21463/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

Antibody-based therapeutics targeting tumor cell surface antigens such as B-cell idiotypes, CD20 on malignant B cells, CD33 on leukemic blasts, and HER2/neu on breast cancer cells have shown efficacy in clinical trials. Multiple antibody-based strategies have shown promising efficacy in recent clinical trials. Unconjugated immunoglobulins directed against CD20 induce partial and complete responses in up to 50% of patients with advanced, indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma When such antibodies are conjugated to appropriate radionuclides and administered in therapeutic doses, the proportions of complete and overall responses increase considerably. Conjugates composed of anti-CD33 antibodies and the chemotherapy agent, calicheamicin, show promising activity in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myelogenous leukemia. Treatment of patients with advanced breast cancer using the anti-HER2/neu antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin; Genentech, San Francisco) leads to objective responses in some patients whose tumors overexpress the HER2/neu oncoprotein.

The malignant diseases included squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), adult T lymphotrophic leukemia (ATL), mycosis fungoides, malignant melanoma and malignant lymphoma, and the nonmalignant diseases included severe treatment-resistant atopic dermatitis (AD), psoriasis vulgaris, verruca vulgaris, and others. The percentage of PCNA-positive cells (the labeling index, LI) was highest for the malignant diseases (56.5+/-7.1%). The LIs for severe treatment-resistant AD, psoriasis, and verruca vulgaris were also significantly higher than those for the normal control or nonlesional skin of the patients. The PCNA LIs were, however, not significantly elevated in eczema and contact dermatitis. The high PCNA LIs in severe AD and psoriasis vulgaris were considerably lower in the skin improved by treatment. Labeling with Ki67, a nuclear protein expressed in cycling cells, was also performed in skin from subsets of each patient group. The results were very similar to those found with PCNA labeling. PCNA-positive cells were found throughout the dermis as well as the basal layer in the malignant diseases, whereas they were found only in the basal layer in the nonmalignant diseases. The results suggest that in human skin diseases, the extent of staining for PCNA, which is a cofactor of DNA polymerase-delta and is essential for cell proliferation, correlates with the extent to which the disease is treatment-resistant. In addition, our findings suggest that the PCNA LI and distribution of PCNA-positive cells in the skin may be helpful in the early diagnosis of skin malignancies.","['Kawahira, K']",['Kawahira K'],"['Tosashimizu Hospital, Tosashimizu, Kochi-ken, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Arch Dermatol Res,Archives of dermatological research,8000462,"['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)', '0 (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen)']",IM,"['Administration, Topical', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Adult', 'Drug Resistance', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry/methods', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen/*metabolism', 'Reference Values', 'Skin Diseases/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Skin Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'Staining and Labeling', 'Tissue Distribution']",,1999/09/11 00:00,1999/09/11 00:01,['1999/09/11 00:00'],"['1999/09/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s004030050431 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Dermatol Res. 1999 Jul-Aug;291(7-8):413-8. doi: 10.1007/s004030050431.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: 27 patients with blood diseases were studied. 22 of them had acute respiratory insufficiency and 5 had unclear lung affection. The data from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), lung biopsy, serum tests for IgG, IgM anti-PC-antibodies were used for diagnosis of PC-pneumonia. RESULTS: PC-pneumonia was diagnosed in 8 of 27 patients. Clinical manifestations characteristic for PC-pneumonia were not found. In 5 patients the diagnosis was made on the evidence provided by BAL. Lymphocyte count in BAL was elevated to 27.7 +/- 8.7%. Open biopsy of the lung and transbronchial biopsy diagnosed PC-pneumonia in 2 and 1 patients, respectively. Previous BAL examinations failed to detect PC-pneumonia in 2 of them. In all the patients PC-pneumonia was associated with another infection (bacterial, cytomegaloviral). Histologically, the picture of the disease was determined by the severity of the lung affection or its complications. 5 of 8 patients failed treatment with trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole and died. Marked respiratory insufficiency was registered at PC-pneumonia diagnosis in all the lethal cases. CONCLUSION: Clinical and x-ray pictures of PC-pneumonia in hemoblastosis patients are not specific.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: 26 patients with AL and 24 ones with CML (29 males and 21 females) were subjected to ABMT within 10 last years. Median of age in AL and CML was 24.5 and 25.5 years, median of the time since the diagnosis was 9 and 13 months, respectively. Follow-up since the ABMT made up 67.5 months (31-107) and 38 months (6-108), respectively. Conditioning was made with cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg) plus total radiation of the body (12 Gy) in 16 patients, myelosan (mileran) in a dose 16 mg/kg plus cyclophosphane (120 mg/kg) in 34 patients. The marrow was taken from HLA-identical sibs, enzygotic twins (5 recipients). Cytogenetic investigations were made in CML. The retention of the transplant was controlled by immunological and molecular tests. RESULTS: Among AL patients 50% are still alive. Probability of 80-month survival reached 55%, 110 months--42%. Probable recurrence-free survival was 78%. All the patients are in a complete clinico-hematological remission. Among CML patients 75% are still alive. Of them 89% had a complete hematological remission, 72% are in a complete hematological and cytogenetic remission. Probable 110 month survival equals 75%, probability to survive without recurrence--52%. Early lethality (100 days) of toxic and infectious complications was as low as 10 and 6%, respectively. Frequency of lethal acute secondary disease was under 8%. CONCLUSION: ABMT made in AL patients during the first complete remission and in CML patients in the chronic phase brings about very good results which are much better than after routine cytostatic chemotherapy.","['Liubimova, L S', 'Savchenko, V G', 'Mendeleeva, L P', 'Kliasova, G A', 'Gribanova, E O', 'Demidova, I A', ""Gal'tseva, I V"", ""Kuz'mina, L A"", 'Momotiuk, K S', 'Kuliev, R G']","['Liubimova LS', 'Savchenko VG', 'Mendeleeva LP', 'Kliasova GA', 'Gribanova EO', 'Demidova IA', ""Gal'tseva IV"", ""Kuz'mina LA"", 'Momotiuk KS', 'Kuliev RG', 'et al.']",,['rus'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Russia (Federation),Ter Arkh,Terapevticheskii arkhiv,2984818R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/mortality/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Remission Induction', 'Time Factors', '*Transplantation Conditioning', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",,1999/09/11 00:00,1999/09/11 00:01,['1999/09/11 00:00'],"['1999/09/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/11 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ter Arkh. 1999;71(7):27-32.,,,,,,Effektivnost' transplantatsii allogennogo kostnogo mozga u bol'nykh ostrymi leikozami v faze polnoi remissii i u bol'nykh khronicheskim mieloleikozom v khronicheskoi faze.,,,,,,,

Conventional immunological markers were used, either associated to or specific for B, T, myelo-monocytic or megakaryocytic-platelet cell populations. RESULTS: Five major immunologic subtypes were disclosed, showing a series of specific surface markers: null-ALL, 5%; early pre-B, 7.5%; common, 74.6%; B-cell, 3.5%, and T-cell, 9.4%. A net predominance of B-cell precursor CD10- ALL was found in children under one year of age, and of CD10+ B-cells beyond that age.

The leukostasis is produced by the mechanical obstruction of vascular bed by blast cells, which can be induced by the spontaneous tumor lysis or as a side effect of cytotoxic drugs. So, hyperleukocytic leukemias require early and vigorous measures to decrease the white blood cell count, using leukapheresis and/or chemotherapy, before pulmonary failure exists.

To identify coactivators that mediate long-range transactivation by this locus control region (LCR), we assessed the influence of E1A, an inhibitor of the CBP/p300 histone acetylase, on LCR function. E1A strongly inhibited transactivation of Agamma- and beta-globin promoters by the HS2, HS2-HS3, and HS1-HS4 subregions of the LCR in human K562 and mouse erythroleukemia cells. Short- and long-range transactivation mediated by the LCR were equally sensitive to E1A. The E1A sensitivity was apparent in transient and stable transfection assays, and E1A inhibited expression of the endogenous gamma-globin genes. Only sites for NF-E2 within HS2 were required for E1A sensitivity in K562 cells, and E1A abolished transactivation mediated by the activation domain of NF-E2. E1A mutants defective in CBP/p300 binding only weakly inhibited HS2-mediated transactivation, whereas a mutant defective in retinoblastoma protein binding strongly inhibited transactivation. Expression of CBP/p300 potentiated HS2-mediated transactivation. Moreover, expression of GAL4-CBP strongly increased transactivation of a reporter containing HS2 with a GAL4 site substituted for the NF-E2 sites. Thus, we propose that a CBP/p300-containing coactivator complex is the E1A-sensitive factor important for LCR function.","['Forsberg, E C', 'Johnson, K', 'Zaboikina, T N', 'Mosser, E A', 'Bresnick, E H']","['Forsberg EC', 'Johnson K', 'Zaboikina TN', 'Mosser EA', 'Bresnick EH']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Wisconsin Medical School, Madison, Wisconsin 53706, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Adenovirus E1A Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (NF-E2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (NF-E2 Transcription Factor, p45 Subunit)', '0 (NFE2 protein, human)', '0 (Nfe2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'EC 2.3.1.- (Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (E1A-Associated p300 Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Ep300 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Histone Acetyltransferases)']",IM,"['Acetyltransferases/metabolism', 'Adenovirus E1A Proteins/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'E1A-Associated p300 Protein', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Histone Acetyltransferases', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/metabolism', '*Locus Control Region', 'Mice', 'NF-E2 Transcription Factor', 'NF-E2 Transcription Factor, p45 Subunit', 'Nuclear Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins', 'Trans-Activators/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/09/10 00:00,1999/09/10 00:01,['1999/09/10 00:00'],"['1999/09/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/10 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.274.38.26850 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)55100-6 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1999 Sep 17;274(38):26850-9. doi: 10.1074/jbc.274.38.26850.,,,['DK50107/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

Results of previous epidemiological studies have been inconsistent. METHODS: During 1992-1997 a large case-control study on childhood cancers and a variety of potential risk factors was conducted in Germany. Cases were ascertained by the German Childhood Cancer Registry. Each case was matched to a population-based control of the same age and gender, sampled from the district where the case lived at the date of diagnosis. For the analyses, 2358 cases and 2588 controls were available. RESULTS: Risk of childhood acute leukaemia increased with maternal age < or =20 years at time of delivery (odds ratio [OR] = 1.9, 95% CI: 1.1-3.2), lower (<2500 g: OR = 1.7, 95% CI: 1.1-2.8) and higher birthweight (>4000 g: OR = 1.4, 95% CI: 1.0-1.8, P < 0.05), and hormonal treatment because of infertility (OR = 1.6, 95% CI: 1.0-2.5, P < 0.05). No associations were seen for parental smoking habits, maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy and fetal losses. Parity was associated only with subgroups of acute leukaemias. Regarding non-Hodgkin's lymphoma we observed an elevated OR for lower birthweight and heavy maternal smoking during pregnancy (>20 cigarettes/day) and a decreased OR for children with one or two siblings. Only a few significant findings were seen for the different groups of solid tumours. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, only weak associations were identified and the evaluated risk factors operating during the neonatal and prenatal period account at most for only a small proportion of childhood cancers.","['Schuz, J', 'Kaatsch, P', 'Kaletsch, U', 'Meinert, R', 'Michaelis, J']","['Schuz J', 'Kaatsch P', 'Kaletsch U', 'Meinert R', 'Michaelis J']","['Institut fur Medizinische Statistik und Dokumentation der Johannes Gutenberg-Universitat Mainz, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Int J Epidemiol,International journal of epidemiology,7802871,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Birth Weight', 'Bone Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Germany/epidemiology', 'Hormone Replacement Therapy/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Maternal Age', 'Maternal Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Odds Ratio', 'Parity', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Pregnancy', '*Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Smoking/adverse effects', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology']",,1999/09/10 00:00,1999/09/10 00:01,['1999/09/10 00:00'],"['1999/09/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ije/28.4.631 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Epidemiol. 1999 Aug;28(4):631-9. doi: 10.1093/ije/28.4.631.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These genetic lesions frequently are associated with the disruption of putative transcription factors and the production of hybrid transcripts that are implicated in leukemogenesis. Epidemiologic evidence suggests that some, but not all, individuals with a history of gamma-irradiation exposure are at increased risk of developing chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). CML is characterized by the Philadelphia chromosome and transcription of the resulting hybrid BCR-ABL gene. Utilizing the leukemia-associated BCR-ABL p210 transcript as a marker, we sought differences in the induction of illegitimate genetic recombination following high-dose gamma-irradiation of karyotypically normal lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) derived from individuals with and without a history of myeloid leukemias. Six LCL [4 leukemia patient derived [2 acute myeloid leukemia and 2 CML] and 2 from normal individuals were analyzed with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for BCR-ABL under stringent conditions following exposure to 0, 50, or 100 Gy of LET gamma-irradiation delivered via a Varian linear accelerator at 4 MV. Transcripts identical to disease-associated b2a2 and b3a2 transcripts were detected both spontaneously (background illegitimate genetic recombination) and following gamma-irradiation. Background BCR-ABL positivity was demonstrable in 4 of the 6 LCL, with no significant difference in detection between leukemic- and nonleukemic-derived LCL. Overall, increasing gamma-irradiation dose resulted in an increased frequency of BCR-ABL transcript detection (0 Gy vs 50 Gy vs 100 Gy,p = 0.0023, Chi-square test). Within the leukemic- but not the nonleukemic-derived LCL there was significantly greater BCR-ABL positivity after gamma-irradiation compared to unirradiated equivalents. Furthermore, the BCR-ABL positivity of both the AML- and CML-derived LCL after gamma-irradiation was significantly greater than that of the nonleukemic-derived LCL after gamma-irradiation. We speculate that this difference in the detection of illegitimate after gamma-irradiation recombination may be due to aberrant DNA double strand break repair mechanisms in individuals predisposed to the development of myeloid leukemias.","['Spencer, A', 'Granter, N']","['Spencer A', 'Granter N']","['Hunter Leukaemia & Lymphoma Research Group, Hunter Area Pathology Service, Mater Misericordiae Hospital, Waratah, NSW, Australia. andrew.spencer@netspace.com.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/radiation effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosomes, Human/radiation effects', 'DNA Damage', '*DNA Repair', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Gamma Rays', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*radiation effects', 'Genes, abl/radiation effects', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/etiology/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology/genetics/*pathology', 'Linear Energy Transfer', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism/*radiation effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/etiology/genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Particle Accelerators', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Recombination, Genetic/*radiation effects', 'Risk', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/radiation effects']",,1999/09/10 00:00,1999/09/10 00:01,['1999/09/10 00:00'],"['1999/09/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/10 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(99)00082-X [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(99)00082-x [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1999 Sep;27(9):1397-401. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(99)00082-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The BCR/ABL oncogene has several potential interactions with cytoskeletal elements that are important for normal integrin signaling. In the present study, we evaluated whether abnormalities in beta1 integrin-cytoskeletal interactions were present in primary CML progenitors and contributed to defective integrin function. beta1 integrin-cytoskeletal interactions were studied in CML and normal CD34+ primary hematopoietic progenitors as well as BCR/ABL-transfected or mock-transfected M07e cells. In normal CD34+ progenitors, antibody-mediated cross-linking of beta1 integrins resulted in their redistribution into caps via a process requiring receptor-cytoskeletal interactions. CML CD34+ cells demonstrated significantly impaired beta1 integrin capping. This defect was related to the presence of the BCR/ABL gene, because capping also was impaired in BCR/ABL-transfected M07e cells. Defective receptor capping was not seen for non-integrin receptors. In addition, CML CD34- and M07eBCR/ABL cells also demonstrated increased actin polymerization and altered actin cytoskeletal organization. Further studies suggested that impaired beta1 integrin capping and defective integrin-mediated adhesion and proliferation inhibition in CML cells were related to abnormally enhanced integrin-cytoskeletal association and restricted receptor mobility.

Blasts from patients with ALL were evaluated for MTX uptake, formation of long-chain MTX polyglutamates (MTX-Glu5+6), cytotoxicity and thymidylate synthase inhibition by MTX and compared to blasts from patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). METHODS: Radioactively labeled MTX-Glu(n) were analyzed by means of HPLC. Thymidylate synthase activity was measured by a tritium-release assay. Cytotoxicity was determined by trypan blue exclusion. RESULTS: In most ALL blasts (n = 9) large amounts of MTX-Glu5+6 (1.06-7.03 pmol/10(7) cells) and high cytotoxicity (43.5% 92.7%) were found, while in others small amounts of MTX-Glu5+6 (0.0-0.39 pmol/10(7) cells) caused only weak cytotoxicity (6.0% 27.9%) (n = 5, 2 relapsed patients). Resistance to MTX in blasts from AML patients (n = 5) was also caused by reduced synthesis of MTX-Glu5s+6 (0.0-0.42 pmol/10(7) cells). In contrast, some ALL blasts (n = 7, 4 relapsed patients) were able to survive MTX treatment despite large amounts of MTX-Glu5+6 (1.5-5.05 pmol/10(7) cells) and extensive thymidylate synthase inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: Since the majority of ALL patients were examined at first diagnosis, an inherent mechanism of resistance seems most likely. We propose a mechanism based on the switch of thymidylate synthesis to the salvage pathway.","['Weigand, M', 'Frei, E', 'Graf, N', 'Buchholz, B', 'Wolfrom, C', 'Breuer, A', 'Wiessler, M']","['Weigand M', 'Frei E', 'Graf N', 'Buchholz B', 'Wolfrom C', 'Breuer A', 'Wiessler M']","['German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg. m.weigand@dkfz-heidelberg.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Recurrence', 'Thymidylate Synthase/*antagonists & inhibitors']",,1999/09/10 00:00,1999/09/10 00:01,['1999/09/10 00:00'],"['1999/09/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s004320050310 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 1999 Aug-Sep;125(8-9):513-9. doi: 10.1007/s004320050310.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the factor(s) regulating medulloblastoma growth has not yet been well characterized. Leukemia-inhibitory factor (LIF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) play different roles in the formation/progression of various embryonic and pediatric tumors, but their biological effects on medulloblastoma cells are less well known. Therefore, in vivo and in vitro expression of LIF, IL-6 and their signal transducer genes encoding LIF receptor (LIFR), IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) and gp130 in human medulloblastoma cells were investigated by multiple cellular and molecular biology approaches. The results revealed that LIF expression could be found in 26 out of 28 tumors/cell line and over 90% of the samples expressed LIFR, IL-6R and gp130. In contrast, none of the samples showed IL-6 expression. An established medulloblastoma cell line, Med-3, was used to evaluate the potential effects of LIF and IL-6 on the proliferation of medulloblastoma cells. The growth of Med-3 cells was efficiently inhibited either by anti-LIF antibody or by antisense LIF oligonucleotide. Addition of exogenous human recombinant IL-6 could dramatically enhance Med-3 cell outgrowth. Our data thus for the first time demonstrated the important role of LIF as an autocrinal and IL-6 as a paracrinal growth factor in the proliferation of medulloblastoma cells.","['Liu, J', 'Li, J W', 'Gang, Y', 'Guo, L', 'Li, H']","['Liu J', 'Li JW', 'Gang Y', 'Guo L', 'Li H']","['Division of Molecular Biology, Shenyang Medical College, P.R.

However, constitutive expression of TF can be found in myelomonocytic cells and in haematopoietic cells arrested at an early stage of differentiation. In this paper we show that TF expression is down-regulated during the monocyte/granulocyte differentiation process, using the human monoblastic U-937 and the acute promyelocytic leukaemia NB4 cell lines as models. Expression of TF mRNA, protein and procoagulant activity (PCA) was constitutively high in untreated cells. Exposure of U-937 cells to 1alpha,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (VitD3) and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) resulted in down-regulation of TF expression and PCA. In NB4 cells induction by ATRA, but not VitD3, resulted in the down-regulation of TF expression and PCA. Consistent with this, induction of terminal differentiation, as confirmed by the expression of differentiation associated antigens and cell cycle arrest, was inversely correlated to TF expression in U-937 and NB4 cells. Moreover, terminally differentiated U-937 cells retained the capacity to respond to inflammatory mediators, i.e. lipopolysaccharide and interferon-gamma, by a rapid increase in TF expression. In conclusion, we show that not only ATRA but also VitD3 is a potent suppressor of monocytic TF expression and thus might have potential clinical use for the treatment of coagulopathies.","['Tenno, T', 'Oberg, F', 'Nilsson, K', 'Siegbahn, A']","['Tenno T', 'Oberg F', 'Nilsson K', 'Siegbahn A']","['Department of Medical Sciences, University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '9035-58-9 (Thromboplastin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cholecalciferol/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/pharmacology', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-1/*pharmacology', 'Ionomycin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Thromboplastin/*biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/drug effects', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology', 'U937 Cells/cytology/*drug effects']",,1999/09/10 00:00,1999/09/10 00:01,['1999/09/10 00:00'],"['1999/09/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1999.tb01124.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1999 Aug;63(2):112-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1999.tb01124.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent observations in adult patients with acute leukaemia suggest that wt1 gene expression is a poor prognostic factor. In childhood acute leukaemia, the clinical role of wt1 gene expression has not been established. We have therefore investigated bone marrow samples from 50 children with acute lymphocytic leukaemia at the time of diagnosis for the presence of wt1 transcripts to determine whether wt1 gene expression is associated with specific characteristics of leukaemic cells and whether it is predictive of response to treatment. All patients were treated according to the ALL-BFM 90 protocol. The median observation time was 30 months. Wt1 transcripts were detected by RT-PCR in 60% of the diagnostic samples. Wt1 PCR positive patients showed a higher median leukocyte and peripheral blast cell count than wt1 negative patients. High and intermediate risk patients more frequently displayed wt1 transcripts than low risk patients. No correlation between wtl gene expression and FAB type, immunophenotype, co-expression of myeloid antigens or karyotype has been observed. Furthermore, there was no correlation between wt1 gene expression at diagnosis and achievement of complete remission (CR) and no difference in disease-free survival (DFS) or overall survival (OS) between wt1 positive and negative patients (p > 0.1). These data indicate that (1) wt1 gene expression at diagnosis is detected more frequently in patients with high leukocyte and peripheral blast cell counts, but is not associated with specific characteristics of leukaemic cells, (2) wt1 gene expression is not an independent prognostic factor for CR, DFS or OS in childhood ALL treated by an intensive therapy protocol.","['Gaiger, A', 'Linnerth, B', 'Mann, G', 'Schmid, D', 'Heinze, G', 'Tisljar, K', 'Haas, O A', 'Gadner, H', 'Lion, T']","['Gaiger A', 'Linnerth B', 'Mann G', 'Schmid D', 'Heinze G', 'Tisljar K', 'Haas OA', 'Gadner H', 'Lion T']","['First Department of Medicine, University of Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'AIEOP acute lymphoblastic leukemia protocol']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Bone Marrow/chemistry', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Genes, Wilms Tumor', 'Humans', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics/*mortality', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Remission Induction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage', 'WT1 Proteins']",,1999/09/10 00:00,1999/09/10 00:01,['1999/09/10 00:00'],"['1999/09/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1999.tb01121.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1999 Aug;63(2):86-93. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1999.tb01121.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Seventeen candidemias developed during azoles prophylaxis. One month after the diagnosis of candidemia, 26 patients died. In 19 cases, death was attributable to candidemia. The case-control study demonstrated, at univariate analysis, that the colonization with Candida. spp. (p=0.004), antimycotic prophylaxis (p=0.01), presence of central venous catheter (p=0.01), neutropenia (p=0.002), and the use of glycopeptide (p=0.0001) increased the risk of candidemia. Using multivariate regression analysis only colonization with Candida spp. and the previous therapy with glycopeptide were associated with a significantly increased risk. Acute mortality, expressed by a cumulative probability of survival at 30 d from diagnosis of candidemia, was 0.67 (95% C.I. 0.55-0.77) and was significantly reduced in patients with neutrophils <1 x 10(9)/l when compared to those with neutrophils >1 x 10(9)/l (p at Mantel-Cox=0.029). Overall cumulative probability of survival at 1 yr was 0.38 (95% C.I. 0.27-0.49) and only the treatment with Amfotericin B significantly reduced the risk of death.","['Pagano, L', 'Antinori, A', 'Ammassari, A', 'Mele, L', 'Nosari, A', 'Melillo, L', 'Martino, B', 'Sanguinetti, M', 'Equitani, F', 'Nobile, F', 'Carotenuto, M', 'Morra, E', 'Morace, G', 'Leone, G']","['Pagano L', 'Antinori A', 'Ammassari A', 'Mele L', 'Nosari A', 'Melillo L', 'Martino B', 'Sanguinetti M', 'Equitani F', 'Nobile F', 'Carotenuto M', 'Morra E', 'Morace G', 'Leone G']","['Istituto di Semeiotica Medica, Universita Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Glycopeptides)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Amphotericin B/therapeutic use', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antifungal Agents/therapeutic use', 'Candidiasis/drug therapy/*epidemiology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Catheterization, Central Venous', 'Female', 'Fungemia/drug therapy/*epidemiology', 'Glycopeptides', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/blood/*complications', 'Humans', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/complications', 'Parenteral Nutrition, Total', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Regression Analysis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Superinfection', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",,1999/09/10 00:00,1999/09/10 00:01,['1999/09/10 00:00'],"['1999/09/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1999.tb01120.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1999 Aug;63(2):77-85. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1999.tb01120.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanism responsible for this phenomenon is still unresolved. METHODS: In 88 B-CLL patients (RAI II-IV) the relationship between immunoregulatory T cells and PHA induced lymphoproliferative response (LPR) was analysed before and after the therapy. The number of peripheral blood CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes was determined by indirect immunofluorescence assay using monoclonal antibodies. LPR was estimated in whole blood culture method. RESULTS: The absolute number of CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ cells in untreated CLL patients was much higher than in healthy controls (n = 26), but the percentages of these subpopulations, CD4/CD8 ratio and LPR to PHA were significantly (p < 0.00001) decreased. The chemotherapy induced a significant rise of CD3+ and CD4+ percentages (p < 0.006 < p < 0.022 respectively) in comparison to baseline levels, but their levels remained significantly (p < 0.00001) lower than the controls. The CD4/CD8 ratio was also elevated after the therapy (p < 0.048) but remained below the normal value as well. The absolute number of CD3+ and CD4+ T cells were normalized after treatment, while the CD8+ cells were still higher (p < 0.044) than controls. The increase of LPR has been registered after treatment, but it failed to reach the control values. We could not find any correlation between the number of immunoregulatory T cells and induced LPR (r = 0.07, for CD4+; r = 0.09 for CD8+ cells). CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate some profound lymphoid cell defect in CLL patients affecting CD8+ proliferation as well as LPR.","['Milosevic, D', 'Marinkovic, M', 'Colovic, M', 'Jelic, S']","['Milosevic D', 'Marinkovic M', 'Colovic M', 'Jelic S']","['Institute for Oncology and Radiology of Serbia, Belgrade, Yugoslavia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Panminerva Med,Panminerva medica,0421110,['0 (Phytohemagglutinins)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'CD4-CD8 Ratio/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*immunology/pathology', '*Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Count/drug effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phytohemagglutinins/immunology/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/*immunology']",,1999/09/10 00:00,1999/09/10 00:01,['1999/09/10 00:00'],"['1999/09/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/10 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Panminerva Med. 1999 Jun;41(2):93-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prior studies have shown MCP-1 expression is modulated by a variety of ligands that act through extracellular receptors. In the current study, we show 9-cis retinoic acid (RA), a ligand for the nuclear hormone receptor retinoid X receptor (RXR) and retinoic acid receptor (RAR), markedly induces the expression of MCP-1. In human THP-1 monocytic leukemia cells cultured with RA (0.05 to 500 nmol/L), MCP-1 expression was induced rapidly, significantly, and dose-dependently by as much as 165-fold. MCP-1 RNA level was also increased in RA-treated cells. Expression of PPARgamma, a heterodimer partner of RXR, is also markedly induced by RA in THP-1 cells. However, BRL49653, a PPARgamma ligand, failed to induce MCP-1 secretion either alone or to modify the expression level induced by RA. In contrast, BRL49653 significantly increased MCP-1 (biotinylated MCP-1) binding to THP-1 cells, whereas RA had no effect. Other peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) ligands, 15d-PGJ(2) and troglitazone (PPARgamma), Wy14,643 (PPARalpha), and PD195599 (PPARbeta) inhibited the induction of MCP-1 by RA. RA's effect on MCP-1 expression in human elutriated monocytes were similar to that observed in the THP-1 cells. These studies identify RA as a nuclear signal for MCP-1 induction in undifferentiated human monocytic cells. These studies also suggest monocyte MCP-1 expression induced through RA may modulate cell migration.","['Zhu, L', 'Bisgaier, C L', 'Aviram, M', 'Newton, R S']","['Zhu L', 'Bisgaier CL', 'Aviram M', 'Newton RS']","['Department of Vascular and Cardiac Diseases Parke-Davis Pharmaceutical Research, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol,"Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",9505803,"['0 (Chemokine CCL2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '0 (Thiazolidinediones)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '05V02F2KDG (Rosiglitazone)', '1UA8E65KDZ (Alitretinoin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Alitretinoin', 'Blood Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Chemokine CCL2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Monocytes/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/metabolism', 'Rosiglitazone', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology', '*Thiazolidinediones', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/09/10 00:00,1999/09/10 00:01,['1999/09/10 00:00'],"['1999/09/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1161/01.atv.19.9.2105 [doi]'],ppublish,Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol. 1999 Sep;19(9):2105-11. doi: 10.1161/01.atv.19.9.2105.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Serum sCD23 was elevated in those subjects who developed lymphoma, compared to AIDS, HIV+, and HIV- controls (P = 0.001). Serum IL6 was significantly elevated in subjects who developed Burkitt's/small noncleaved cell lymphoma (BL/SNC, P = 0.01), but not in those subjects who developed large cell, immunoblastic, or central nervous system lymphomas, compared to CD4-matched AIDS controls who did not have lymphoma.

As described earlier in a murine model, interleukin 1 (IL-1) induced LIF mRNA and protein expression. We utilized the murine cell line +/+-1.LDA11 to further define regulatory mechanisms of LIF expression in bone marrow stromal cells. The production of LIF mRNA is stimulated by IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, and the cAMP analogue 8-bromoadenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (8BrcAMP). LIF mRNA expression is controlled at the transcriptional level. Different fragments from -542 to -45 bp 5' upstream of the transcriptional start site of the murine LIF gene were fused to the luciferase gene. All LIF-promoter luciferase constructs exhibited constitutive luciferase activity under serum free conditions. The level of luciferase activity decreased with LIF-promoter constructs of less than 249 bp (pLIF249) in size. When tested with the 314 bp LIF-promoter construct, incubation of stromal cells with IL-1beta (500 U/ml) resulted in a 1.57-fold stimulation, with TNF-alpha (500 U/ml) in 2.06-fold stimulation, and with 8BrcAMP (0.5 mM) in a 3. 42-fold stimulation of luciferase activity. By testing different deletion mutants we could narrow the IL-1 and TNF-alpha responsive promoter areas to the region -249 to -145 bp and the 8BrcAMP responsive area from -145 to -82 bp. Mobility shift experiments revealed that nuclear proteins from stromal cells form a DNA-protein complex by binding to the region from -249 to -145 bp of the LIF promoter.","['Gollner, G', 'Bug, G', 'Rupilius, B', 'Peschel, C', 'Huber, C', 'Derigs, H G']","['Gollner G', 'Bug G', 'Rupilius B', 'Peschel C', 'Huber C', 'Derigs HG']","['III.

Their synthesis was carried out by the reaction of 6-amino-8,11-dihydroxy-7H-benzo[e]perimidin-7-one (5) or 6,8, 11-trihydroxy-7H-benzo[e]perimidin-7-one (10) with a number of respective (alkylamino)alkylamines. The dihydroxybenzoperimidine derivatives exhibited in vitro cytotoxic activity against murine leukemia L1210 and human leukemia HL60 cell lines comparable to that of mitoxantrone. These compounds also exhibited a range of in vitro activity against the human MDR-type resistant leukemia K562R cell line with the MDR phenotype. The most active compound of this series, namely 6a, exhibited potent in vitro cytotoxic activity against a panel of human cell lines. Furthermore, in contrast to both mitoxantrone and doxorubicin, it displayed little cross-resistance in cell lines characterized by a MDR phenotype. Cell cycle analysis in the sensitive HT-29 and mitoxantrone-resistant HT-29/Mx (not identified resistance mechanism) cell lines has revealed that both mitoxantrone and 6a induce a G2/M block. However, while the proportion of apoptotic cells after mitoxantrone treatment is similar for both sensitive and resistant cell lines, it is much lower for 6a. Compound 6a tested against P388 murine leukemia in vivo displayed a significant antitumor effect (%T/C 196 at an optimal dose of 10 mg/kg). The property of overcoming the cross-resistance was maintained also in in vivo efficacy studies, where no difference was observed in the antitumor activity of compound 6a against the A2780 human tumor xenograft and its MDR A2780/Dx subline. We conclude that benzoperimidines, if properly substituted, constitute a novel class of compounds that can overcome multidrug resistance.","['Stefanska, B', 'Dzieduszycka, M', 'Bontemps-Gracz, M M', 'Borowski, E', 'Martelli, S', 'Supino, R', 'Pratesi, G', 'De Cesare, M', 'Zunino, F', 'Kusnierczyk, H', 'Radzikowski, C']","['Stefanska B', 'Dzieduszycka M', 'Bontemps-Gracz MM', 'Borowski E', 'Martelli S', 'Supino R', 'Pratesi G', 'De Cesare M', 'Zunino F', 'Kusnierczyk H', 'Radzikowski C']","['Institute of Immunology and Experimental Therapy, Polish Academy of Sciences, 12 R.

In the G1 and G2 phases, the DNA is so tightly packed in the nucleus that it appears opaque to infrared radiation.

In particular, the analogues included the mono- and di-O'-methyl derivatives of dC, dU and dA, syntheses of which are described. In general, purine nucleosides with modified sugar rings were feebler substrates than the corresponding cytosine analogues. Sugar-modified analogues of dU were also relatively poor substrates of TK1 and TK2, but were reasonably good inhibitors, with generally lower Ki values vs TK2 than TK1. An excellent discriminator between TK1 and TK2 was 3'-hexanoylamino-2',3'-dideoxythymidine, with a Ki of approximately 600 microM for TK1 and approximately 0.1 microM for TK2. 3'-OMe-dC was a superior inhibitor of dCK to its 5'-O-methyl congener, consistent with possible participation of the oxygen of the (3')-OH or (3')-OMe as proton acceptor in hydrogen bonding with the enzyme. Surprisingly alpha-dT was a good substrate of both TK1 and TK2, with Ki values of 120 and 30 microM for TK1 and TK2, respectively; and a 3'-branched alpha-L-deoxycytidine analogue proved to be as good a substrate as its alpha-D-counterpart. Several 5'-substituted analogues of dC were good non-substrate inhibitors of dCK and, to a lesser extent, of TK2.

They are the second commonest type of cancer seen in childhood, after leukemia. A significant proportion of paediatric cerebral tumours (> 50%) are intratentorial. OBJECTIVE: To find the frequency and clinicopathological behavior of posterior fossa tumours in children seen at our hospital. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From the hospital records, a descriptive, retrospective study was made of 112 children with tumours of the posterior fossa who were attended at the Institute of Neurology and Neurosurgery between January 1980 and December 1997. The variables: age, sex, clinical findings, site and extent of the tumour and its histological description were recorded. The mean, standard deviation, frequency distribution and chi-squared test were used, depending on the type of variable to be analyzed. RESULTS: The age of the patients when the diagnosis was made was between 8 months and 15 years (mean = 8.32 years). The male/female ratio was 59/53 (1.1/1). The commonest site of the tumours was the cerebellum (58.9%). The predominant histological types were medulloblastoma (33.92%) and astrocytoma (19.64%) in the cerebellum, glioma in the brain stem (10.71%) and ependymoma in the i.v. ventricle (8.09%). CONCLUSIONS: Endocranial hypertension and the cerebellar syndrome were the predominant clinical findings in medulloblastoma, cerebellar astrocytoma and ependymoma. In brainstem gliomas there was often involvement of several cranial nerves and long tracts.","['Sardinas, N', 'Marcos, R', 'Pestana, E M', 'Vargas, J', 'Chi-Ramirez, D', 'Rojas, E', 'Esteban, E M', 'Zarrabeitia, L']","['Sardinas N', 'Marcos R', 'Pestana EM', 'Vargas J', 'Chi-Ramirez D', 'Rojas E', 'Esteban EM', 'Zarrabeitia L']","['Servicio de Neurologia Infantil, Instituto de Neurologia y Neurocirugia, La Habana, Cuba.']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Spain,Rev Neurol,Revista de neurologia,7706841,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Brain Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cuba/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies']",,1999/09/09 00:00,1999/09/09 00:01,['1999/09/09 00:00'],"['1999/09/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/09 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Rev Neurol. 1999 Jun 16-30;28(12):1153-8.,,,,,,Tumores de fosa posterior en el nino.,,,,,,,

This approach utilizes standard permeabilization/fixation solutions to reliably detect intracellular antigens with minimal alterations in the light scatter properties of the analyzed cells. In contrast to other described methods, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-TdT antibody is added to previously analyzed and permeabilized cells after a leukemic cell population has been identified using characteristic surface staining patterns. The method eliminates the need for additional sample preparation or cumbersome permeablization steps and can easily be incorporated into any clinical laboratory's existing flow cytometry panels. Sixty-eight cases were analyzed with this method, including 31 acute myelogenous leukemias, 30 acute lymphoblastic leukemias, and 7 chronic lymphoproliferative disorders. To confirm the validity of the method, parallel immunoperoxidase staining and microscopic evaluation of cytocentrifuge test sample preparations were performed. Statistical analysis of the results reveals the method to be highly sensitive and specific, demonstrating exact correlation to the microscopic method. The ease and expeditiousness of this new procedure allows TdT testing to be routinely incorporated into the immunophenotyping repertoire of a busy clinical laboratory. In addition, the method should be readily adaptable to analyze a variety of other clinically relevant intranuclear and intracytoplasmic antigens.","['Roma, A O', 'Kutok, J L', 'Shaheen, G', 'Dorfman, D M']","['Roma AO', 'Kutok JL', 'Shaheen G', 'Dorfman DM']","[""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,"['EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)', 'I223NX31W9 (Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Cell Nucleus/*enzymology', 'Chronic Disease', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/*analysis', '*Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*enzymology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*enzymology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*enzymology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Statistics as Topic/methods', 'Time Factors']",,1999/09/09 00:00,1999/09/09 00:01,['1999/09/09 00:00'],"['1999/09/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ajcp/112.3.343 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1999 Sep;112(3):343-8. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/112.3.343.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Noncancer mortality: 1950-1990.",374-89,"This report updates the data on noncancer mortality for 86,572 atomic bomb survivors with dose estimates in the Radiation Effects Research Foundation's Life Span Study cohort. The primary analyses are based on more than 27,000 noncancer disease deaths that occurred in the cohort between October 1, 1950, and December 31, 1990, 30% more than in the previous report. The present analyses strengthen earlier findings of a statistically significant increase in noncancer disease death rates with radiation dose. Increasing trends are observed for diseases of the circulatory, digestive and respiratory systems. Rates for those exposed to 1 Sv are elevated about 10%, a relative increase that is considerably smaller than that for cancer. However, estimates of the number of radiation-related noncancer deaths in the cohort to date (140 to 280) are 50 to 100% of the number for solid cancer. The data do not yet clarify the shape of the dose response. There is no significant evidence against linearity, but the data are statistically consistent with curvilinear dose-response functions that posit essentially zero risk for doses below 0.5 Sv. Similarly, while the data are consistent with substantial variation in the excess relative risk with age at exposure or attained age, there is no statistically significant dependence on these factors. In view of the small relative risks and the lack of understanding of biological mechanisms, we emphasize consideration of whether the findings could be explained by misclassification, confounding or selection effects. Based on available data, we conclude that such factors are unlikely to fully explain the observed dose response. A significant dose response is also seen for deaths from blood diseases with an excess relative risk that is several times greater than that seen for solid cancer. Particular attention is paid to the possibility that this apparent effect is a consequence of the attribution of leukemia or other cancer deaths to noncancer blood diseases. We find that misclassification does not explain this excess risk. As in earlier reports, suicide rates tend to decrease with increasing dose.","['Shimizu, Y', 'Pierce, D A', 'Preston, D L', 'Mabuchi, K']","['Shimizu Y', 'Pierce DA', 'Preston DL', 'Mabuchi K']","['Department of Epidemiology, Radiation Effects Research Foundation, 5-2 Hijiyama Park, Minami-ku, Hiroshima, 732-0815, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,,IM,"['*Cause of Death', 'Confounding Factors, Epidemiologic', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Humans', 'Japan/epidemiology', '*Nuclear Warfare', 'Risk Factors', 'Survivors']",,1999/09/09 00:00,1999/09/09 00:01,['1999/09/09 00:00'],"['1999/09/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/09 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Radiat Res. 1999 Oct;152(4):374-89.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Additionally, when tested intravenously against a solid lung tumor (A549) model, some conjugated analogs were equivalent to the podophyllotoxin/intralipid emulsion, while those compounds demonstrating slower rates of plasma hydrolysis (in vitro) appeared to cause greater toxicity. There appeared to be an overall correlation between the in vivo antitumor activity of the conjugate and its rate of hydrolysis in vitro, with those showing faster release possessing greater antitumor activity.

Further studies may be warranted to assess the PEG-conjugates pharmacokinetics and therapeutic indices in leukemic models.","['Greenwald, R B', 'Conover, C D', 'Pendri, A', 'Choe, Y H', 'Martinez, A', 'Wu, D', 'Guan, S', 'Yao, Z', 'Shum, K L']","['Greenwald RB', 'Conover CD', 'Pendri A', 'Choe YH', 'Martinez A', 'Wu D', 'Guan S', 'Yao Z', 'Shum KL']","['Department of Organic and Medicinal Chemistry, Research and Development, Enzon, Inc., 20 Kingsbridge Road, Piscataway, NJ 08854, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,J Control Release,Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,8607908,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '059QF0KO0R (Water)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', 'L36H50F353 (Podophyllotoxin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*administration & dosage/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Drug Carriers', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular', 'Podophyllotoxin/*administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Polyethylene Glycols/*administration & dosage/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Solubility', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Water']",,1999/09/09 00:00,1999/09/09 00:01,['1999/09/09 00:00'],"['1999/09/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/09 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0168365999001534 [pii]', '10.1016/s0168-3659(99)00153-4 [doi]']",ppublish,J Control Release. 1999 Sep 20;61(3):281-94. doi: 10.1016/s0168-3659(99)00153-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several groups, including ours, have shown that 0.5 to 1 micromol/L As(2)O(3) induces apoptosis in APL-derived NB4 cells, whereas other leukemic cells are resistant to As(2)O(3) or undergo apoptosis only in response to greater than 2 micromol/L As(2)O(3). In this report, we show that the ability of As(2)O(3) to induce apoptosis in leukemic cells is dependent on the activity of the enzymes that regulate cellular H(2)O(2) content. Thus, NB4 cells have relatively low levels of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase and have a constitutively higher H(2)O(2) content than U937 monocytic leukemia cells. Glutathione-S-transferase pi (GSTpi), which is important for cellular efflux of As(2)O(3), is also low in NB4 cells. Moreover, As(2)O(3) further inhibits GPX activity and increases cellular H(2)O(2) content in NB4 but not in U937 cells. Selenite pretreatment of NB4 cells increases the activity of GPX, lowers cellular H(2)O(2) levels, and renders NB4 cells resistant to 1 micromol/L As(2)O(3). In contrast, concentrations of As(2)O(3) that alone are not capable of inducing apoptosis in NB4 cells induce apoptosis in the presence of the GPx inhibitor mercaptosuccinic acid. Similar effects are observed by modulating the activity of catalase with its inhibitor, aminotriazol. More important from a therapeutic point of view, U937 and HL-60 cells, which require high concentrations of As(2)O(3) to undergo apoptosis, become sensitive to low, clinically acceptable concentrations of As(2)O(3) when cotreated with these GPx and catalase inhibitors. The induction of apoptosis by As(2)O(3) involves an early decrease in cellular mitochondrial membrane potential and increase in H(2)O(2) content, followed by cytochrome c release, caspase 3 activation, DNA fragmentation, and the classic morphologic changes of apoptosis.","['Jing, Y', 'Dai, J', 'Chalmers-Redman, R M', 'Tatton, W G', 'Waxman, S']","['Jing Y', 'Dai J', 'Chalmers-Redman RM', 'Tatton WG', 'Waxman S']","['Rochelle Belfer Chemotherapy Foundation Laboratory, Division of Neoplastic Diseases, Department of Medicine, Mount Sinai Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Thiomalates)', '94239W5L4H (2-thiomalic acid)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'EC 1.11.1.9 (Glutathione Peroxidase)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)', 'ZF80H5GXUF (Amitrole)']",IM,"['Amitrole/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Catalase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cytochrome c Group/metabolism', 'Cytosol/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Glutathione Peroxidase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*metabolism', 'Intracellular Membranes/drug effects/*physiology', 'K562 Cells', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/*physiology', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Thiomalates/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells']",,1999/09/09 00:00,1999/09/09 00:01,['1999/09/09 00:00'],"['1999/09/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)48918-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 Sep 15;94(6):2102-11.,,,['5RO1CA59936-03-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

Immunohistochemistry studies on the skin lesions demonstrated that the infiltrating cells were of the CD3(+)/CD8(+) phenotype. Two primary transformed CD8(+) T-cell lines were obtained from cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and skin, and, with time, both cell lines became interleukin-2-independent and acquired the constitutive activation of STAT proteins. Polymerase chain reaction analysis of the DNA from the cell lines and tissues from the lymphomatous animal demonstrated the presence of a 536-bp DNA fragment that was 90% identical to EBV polymerase gene sequences, whereas the same DNA was consistently negative for STLV-I/II sequences. Electron microscopy performed on both cell lines, after sodium butyrate treatment, showed the presence of a herpes-like virus that was designated HV(MNE) according to the existing nomenclature. In situ hybridization studies using EBV Epstein-Barr viral-encoded RNA probes showed viral RNA expression in both CD8(+) T-cell lines as well as in the infiltrating CD8(+) T cells of skin-tissue biopsies. Phylogenetic analysis of a 465-bp fragment from the polymerase gene of HV(MNE) placed this virus within the Lymphocryptovirus genus and demonstrated that HV(MNE) is a distinct virus, clearly related to human EBV and other EBV-like herpesviruses found in nonhuman primates.","['Rivadeneira, E D', 'Ferrari, M G', 'Jarrett, R F', 'Armstrong, A A', 'Markham, P', 'Birkebak, T', 'Takemoto, S', 'Johnson-Delaney, C', 'Pecon-Slattery, J', 'Clark, E A', 'Franchini, G']","['Rivadeneira ED', 'Ferrari MG', 'Jarrett RF', 'Armstrong AA', 'Markham P', 'Birkebak T', 'Takemoto S', 'Johnson-Delaney C', 'Pecon-Slattery J', 'Clark EA', 'Franchini G']","['National Cancer Institute, Basic Research Laboratory, Bethesda, MD; the Leukaemia Research Fund Virus Centre, Department of Veterinary Pathology, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'DNA, Viral/chemistry/genetics', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*classification/genetics', 'Humans', 'Lymphocryptovirus/*classification/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Macaca nemestrina/*virology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mycosis Fungoides/immunology/pathology/*veterinary/virology', '*Phylogeny', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Primate Diseases/immunology/pathology/*virology', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Skin/immunology/pathology/virology', 'Skin Neoplasms/immunology/pathology/*veterinary/virology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",,1999/09/09 00:00,1999/09/09 00:01,['1999/09/09 00:00'],"['1999/09/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)48917-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 Sep 15;94(6):2090-101.,,,['RR00166/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

The chromosome 11 breakpoint was mapped to the region between D11S470 and D11S860. The nucleoporin 98 gene (NUP98), which is rearranged in several acute myeloid leukemia translocations, is located within this region. Analysis of somatic cell hybrids segregating the translocation chromosomes showed that the chromosome 11 breakpoint occurs within NUP98. The fusion partner of NUP98 was identified as the RAP1GDS1 gene using 3' RACE. RAP1GDS1 codes for smgGDS, a ubiquitously expressed guanine nucleotide exchange factor that stimulates the conversion of the inactive GDP-bound form of several ras family small GTPases to the active GTP-bound form. In the NUP98-RAP1GDS1 fusion transcript (abbreviated as NRG), the 5' end of the NUP98 gene is joined in frame to the coding region of the RAP1GDS1 gene. This joins the FG repeat-rich region of NUP98 to RAP1GDS1, which largely consists of tandem armadillo repeats. NRG fusion transcripts were detected in the leukemic cells of 2 other adult T-ALL patients. One of these patients had a variant translocation with a more 5' breakpoint in NUP98. This is the first report of an NUP98 translocation in lymphocytic leukemia and the first time that RAP1GDS1 has been implicated in any human malignancy.","['Hussey, D J', 'Nicola, M', 'Moore, S', 'Peters, G B', 'Dobrovic, A']","['Hussey DJ', 'Nicola M', 'Moore S', 'Peters GB', 'Dobrovic A']","['Department of Haematology-Oncology, University of Adelaide, The Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Woodville, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (nuclear pore complex protein 98)', '0 (ras Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rap GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Child', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'Female', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Genetic Markers', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics/immunology', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Organ Specificity', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'rap GTP-Binding Proteins', 'ras Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors']",,1999/09/09 00:00,1999/09/09 00:01,['1999/09/09 00:00'],"['1999/09/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)48915-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 Sep 15;94(6):2072-9.,,"['GENBANK/AF133331', 'GENBANK/AF133333']",,,,,,,,,,,

To isolate such cells, we first used Hoechst 33342 and Pyronin Y staining to obtain viable G(0) and G(1)/S/G(2)/M fractions of CD34(+) cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) from 6 chronic-phase CML patients' samples and confirmed the quiescent and cycling status of the 2 fractions by demonstration of expected patterns of Ki-67 and D cyclin expression. Leukemic (Ph(+)/BCR-ABL(+)) cells with in vitro progenitor activity and capable of engrafting immunodeficient mice were identified in the directly isolated G(0) cells. Single-cell reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis showed that many leukemic CD34(+) G(0) cells also expressed BCR-ABL mRNA. CD34(+) from 8 CML patients were also labeled with carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl diester (CFSE) before being cultured (with and without added growth factors) to allow viable cells that had remained quiescent (ie, CFSE(+)) after 4 days to be retrieved by FACS. Leukemic progenitors were again detected in all quiescent populations isolated by this second strategy, including those exposed to a combination of flt3-ligand, Steel factor, interleukin-3, interleukin-6, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor.

The aim of the current study was to determine whether acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells could be induced to differentiate into DC. CD34(+) AML-M2 cells with chromosome 7 monosomy were cultured in the presence of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), and interleukin-4 (IL-4). After 3 weeks of culture, 35% of the AML-M2 cells showed DC morphology and phenotype. The DC phenotype was defined as upmodulation of the costimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 and the expression of CD1a or CD83. The leukemic nature of the DC was validated by detection of chromosome 7 monosomy in sorted DC populations by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). CD34(+) leukemic cells from 2 B-ALL patients with the Philadelphia chromosome were similarly cultured, but in the presence of CD40-ligand and IL-4. After 4 days of culture, more than 58% of the ALL cells showed DC morphology and phenotype. The leukemic nature of the DC was validated by detection of the bcr-abl fusion gene in sorted DC populations by FISH. In functional studies, the leukemic DC were highly superior to the parental leukemic blasts for inducing allogeneic T-cell responses.

OCZF was found to be rat homologue of mouse leukemia/lymphoma-related factor (LRF). Northern blot and in situ hybridization analysis showed OCZF mRNA at a high level in osteoclasts and kidney cells. OCZF had a nuclear targeting sequence and was localized in the nucleus of transfected cells. In addition, OCZF specifically bound to the guanine-rich consensus sequences of Egr-1 and c-Krox. Transient transfection assays indicate that OCZF can repress transcription activity like other POZ domain proteins. Furthermore, antisense but not sense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) for OCZF cDNA suppressed the formation of osteoclast-like multinucleated cells (MNCs) in bone marrow culture, whereas the same ODNs did not significantly affect the formation of macrophage polykaryons and mononuclear preosteoclast-like cells (POCs).

Although normal cellular trafficking of growth factor receptors may play a critical role in the modulation of receptor function, the mechanisms that regulate the distribution of c-Kit on the cell surface and the internalization of c-Kit have not been fully defined. We investigated whether signal transduction via Src family kinases is required for normal c-Kit trafficking. Treatment of the SCF-responsive human hematopoietic cell line MO7e with the inhibitor of Src family kinases PP1 blocked SCF-induced capping of c-Kit and internalization of c-Kit. c-Kit was able to associate with clathrin in the presence of PP1, suggesting that entry of c-Kit into clathrin-coated pits occurs independently of Src family kinases. SCF-induced internalization of c-Kit was also diminished in the D33-3 lymphoid cell line in which expression of Lyn kinase was disrupted by homologous recombination. These results indicate that Src family kinases play a role in ligand-induced trafficking of c-Kit.","['Broudy, V C', 'Lin, N L', 'Liles, W C', 'Corey, S J', ""O'Laughlin, B"", 'Mou, S', 'Linnekin, D']","['Broudy VC', 'Lin NL', 'Liles WC', 'Corey SJ', ""O'Laughlin B"", 'Mou S', 'Linnekin D']","['Divisions of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA. vcbroudy@u.washington.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (4-amino-5-(4-methylphenyl)-7-(tert-butyl)pyrazolo(3,4-d)pyrimidine)', '0 (Clathrin)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",IM,"['Cell Membrane/physiology', 'Chemotaxis/drug effects/physiology', 'Clathrin/metabolism', 'Coated Pits, Cell-Membrane/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Pyrazoles/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'src-Family Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism']",,1999/09/09 00:00,1999/09/09 00:01,['1999/09/09 00:00'],"['1999/09/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)48905-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 Sep 15;94(6):1979-86.,,,"['CA31615/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK43719/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK44194/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,

A previous study of patients with CLL found an association between lack of somatic mutation and trisomy 12 and, therefore, possibly with a less favorable prognosis. We have sequenced the Ig V(H) genes of the tumor cells of 84 patients with CLL and correlated our findings with clinical features. A total of 38 cases (45.2%) showed >/= 98% sequence homology with the nearest germline V(H) gene; 46 cases (54.8%) showed >2% somatic mutation. Unmutated V(H) genes were significantly associated with V1-69 and D3-3 usage, with atypical morphology; isolated trisomy 12, advanced stage and progressive disease. Survival was significantly worse for patients with unmutated V(H) genes irrespective of stage. Median survival for stage A patients with unmutated V(H) genes was 95 months compared with 293 months for patients whose tumors had mutated V(H) genes (P =.0008).

The cases were categorized based on V gene mutation status and CD38 expression and analyzed for treatment history and survival. The B-CLL cases could be divided into 2 groups. Those patients with unmutated V genes displayed higher percentages of CD38(+) B-CLL cells (>/=30%) than those with mutated V genes that had lower percentages of CD38(+) cells (<30%). Patients in both the unmutated and the >/=30% CD38(+) groups responded poorly to continuous multiregimen chemotherapy (including fludarabine) and had shorter survival. In contrast, the mutated and the <30% CD38(+) groups required minimal or no chemotherapy and had prolonged survival. These observations were true also for those patients who stratified to the Rai intermediate risk category. In the mutated and the <30% CD38(+) groups, males and females were virtually equally distributed, whereas in the unmutated and the >/=30% CD38(+) groups, a marked male predominance was found. Thus, Ig V gene mutation status and the percentages of CD38(+) B-CLL cells appear to be accurate predictors of clinical outcome in B-CLL patients. These parameters, especially CD38 expression that can be analyzed conveniently in most clinical laboratories, should be valuable adjuncts to the present staging systems for predicting the clinical course in individual B-CLL cases.

To define the sensitivity and reproducibility with which the engraftment of different AML cells can be detected, 61 different samples from patients with newly diagnosed AML representing a variety of cytogenetic and French-American-British (FAB) subtypes were injected into NOD/SCID mice. Eight weeks after intravenous injection of 10(7) AML cells, the average percent of human cells in mouse bone marrow was 13.3%, with 70% of samples showing easily detectable engraftment of CD45(+) cells. AML samples with cytogenetic changes associated with a poor clinical prognosis tended to engraft to higher levels than those with changes associated with a good prognosis. Cells with FAB subtypes M3 and, to a lesser extent, M2, engrafted more poorly (P =.002 and.06, respectively) than those from other subtypes. Intraperitoneal injection of human interleukin-3 and Steel factor thrice weekly for 4 weeks did not enhance the levels of AML cell engraftment. However, AML samples that showed cytokine-independent colony growth in methylcellulose assay or expressed growth-factor mRNA in malignant blasts achieved significantly higher levels of engraftment than those which were cytokine dependent in culture or failed to express cytokine message (P <.03 and P <.02, respectively). In 6 patient samples, the frequency of NOD/SCID leukemia-initiating cells (NOD/SL-IC) varied from 0.7 to 45 per 10(7) cells, which was 200- to 800-fold lower than the frequency of AML long-term culture-initiating cells (AML LTC-IC) in the same samples. Each NOD/SL-IC will produce more than 10(6) leukemic blasts as well as many AML-CFC and AML LTC-IC as detected 8 weeks postinjection into mice. Serial transplant experiments showed the ability of NOD/SL-IC to maintain their own numbers over at least 3 to 4 weeks in vivo. The ability of these progenitors to self-renew combined with their potential to differentiate to produce large numbers of more mature progenitors and leukemic blasts suggests that the NOD/SL-IC assay identifies leukemic 'stem cells' that may maintain the malignant clone in human patients. The further use of this assay should facilitate studies of AML stem cell biology and the evolution of novel therapeutic strategies.","['Ailles, L E', 'Gerhard, B', 'Kawagoe, H', 'Hogge, D E']","['Ailles LE', 'Gerhard B', 'Kawagoe H', 'Hogge DE']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Female', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology']",,1999/09/09 00:00,1999/09/09 00:01,['1999/09/09 00:00'],"['1999/09/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)48874-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 Sep 1;94(5):1761-72.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The addition of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) to purified CD34(+) thy-1(+) cells on AC6.21 stroma, a murine bone marrow-derived stromal cell line, caused expansion of cells with CD34(+) thy-1(+) phenotype. Addition of other cytokines, including interleukin-3 (IL-3), IL-6, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and stem cell factor, to LIF in the cultures caused a 150-fold expansion of cells retaining the CD34(+) thy-1(+) phenotype. The ex vivo-expanded CD34(+) thy-1(+) cells gave rise to multilineage differentiation, including myeloid, T, and B cells, when transplanted into SCID-hu mice. Both murine LIF (cannot bind to human LIF receptor) and human LIF caused expansion of human CD34(+) thy-1(+) cells in vitro, suggesting action through the murine stroma. Furthermore, another human HSC candidate, CD34(+) CD38(-) cells, shows a similar pattern of proliferative response.

We analyzed 201 such cases (11%) in 1,839 children with newly diagnosed ALL treated between 1989 and 1995 on risk-adjusted protocols of the Children's Cancer Group (CCG). The majority of patients (131; 65%) with a 9p abnormality were classified as higher risk. Nearly all patients had complex karyotypes; most cases had deletions of 9p, add/der(9p), a dicentric involving chromosome arm 9p, and/or balanced translocations and inversions involving 9p. Event-free survival (EFS) estimates at 6 years for patients with and without a 9p aberration were 61% (standard deviation [SD] = 5%) and 76% (SD = 2%; P <.0001). In addition, patients with a 9p abnormality had an increased cumulative incidence of both marrow (P =.04) and central nervous system (P =.0001) relapses. Overall survival also was significantly worse for patients with an abnormal 9p (P <.0001). These effects were most pronounced in standard-risk patients (age 1 to 9 years with white blood cell count <50,000/microL): 6-year EFS of 61% (SD = 9%) versus 80% (SD = 2%; P <.0001). Also, a 9p aberration was an adverse risk factor for B-lineage, but not T-lineage patients. The effect of 9p status on EFS was attenuated, but maintained in a multivariate analysis of EFS after adjustment for Philadelphia chromosome status, age, white blood cell (WBC) count, sex, race, and ploidy group (P =.01). Thus, abnormalities of chromosome arm 9p identify a subgroup of standard-risk patients with increased risk of treatment failure.","['Heerema, N A', 'Sather, H N', 'Sensel, M G', 'Liu-Mares, W', 'Lange, B J', 'Bostrom, B C', 'Nachman, J B', 'Steinherz, P G', 'Hutchinson, R', 'Gaynon, P S', 'Arthur, D C', 'Uckun, F M']","['Heerema NA', 'Sather HN', 'Sensel MG', 'Liu-Mares W', 'Lange BJ', 'Bostrom BC', 'Nachman JB', 'Steinherz PG', 'Hutchinson R', 'Gaynon PS', 'Arthur DC', 'Uckun FM']","['Department of Genetics, Hughes Institute, St Paul, MN, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/physiopathology', 'Risk Factors']",,1999/09/09 00:00,1999/09/09 00:01,['1999/09/09 00:00'],"['1999/09/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)48849-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 Sep 1;94(5):1537-44.,,,"['R25 CA092049/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-60437/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

Observational studies of rIFN-alpha suffer from numerous biases including sample size, variations in study populations, definitions of hematologic and cytogenetic remissions, and dose. That rIFN-alpha is more efficacious than chemotherapy is demonstrated by 6 prospective randomized trials. For patients with favorable clinical features in chronic phase, compared to HU and BUS, rIFN-alpha improves survival by a median of about 20 months. Most evidence suggests that rIFN-alpha is most effective when combined with other drugs and when given during the earliest stage of the chronic phase. Adding cytarabine to rIFN-alpha adds further survival benefit but increases toxicity. Limitations for evaluating the long-term benefits of allogeneic BMT include the retrospective nature of most studies, incomplete documentation of the clinical characteristics of the patients, paucity of the details on patient selection, lack of control groups, and limitations of survival calculations. Survival curves for BMT show that at least half of the patients transplanted remain alive 5 to 10 years after treatment, whereas similar curves for rIFN-alpha show a continuous relapse rate over time with the curves crossing at about 7 to 8 years. Estimates of long-term survival may be confounded by the selection biases mentioned and the analytic methods used. The magnitude of the incremental increase in benefit with BMT must be weighed against the potential serious harm and death that may accompany the procedure in the short term. The best results with BMT have been obtained when it is performed within 1 to 2 years from diagnosis. Since each treatment option involves tradeoffs between benefit and harm, patient choice must be based on the examination of facts presented in an unbiased fashion. Newly diagnosed younger patients and older patients who are candidates for BMT should also be offered information about IFN-based regimens, the tradeoffs involved, and, if possible, share in the treatment decision. Hopefully this analysis will provide the stimulus for evaluation of other important aspects of CML.","['Silver, R T', 'Woolf, S H', 'Hehlmann, R', 'Appelbaum, F R', 'Anderson, J', 'Bennett, C', 'Goldman, J M', 'Guilhot, F', 'Kantarjian, H M', 'Lichtin, A E', 'Talpaz, M', 'Tura, S']","['Silver RT', 'Woolf SH', 'Hehlmann R', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Anderson J', 'Bennett C', 'Goldman JM', 'Guilhot F', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Lichtin AE', 'Talpaz M', 'Tura S']","['New York Presbyterian Hospital-Weill Medical College of Cornell University, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Busulfan/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', '*Evidence-Based Medicine', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Interferon-alpha/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,1999/09/09 00:00,1999/09/09 00:01,['1999/09/09 00:00'],"['1999/09/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)48848-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 Sep 1;94(5):1517-36.,,,,108,['Blood. 1999 Sep 1;94(5):1515-6.

To address this issue, the effects of human interleukin-3 (hIL-3) and human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (hGM-CSF) on hematopoietic development were investigated in hematopoietic progenitor cells. Murine multipotent factor-dependent cell-Paterson (FDCP)-mix cells, which can self-renew or differentiate, were transfected with the genes encoding the unique alpha and/or shared beta(c) human hIL-3 receptor (hIL-3 R) or hGM-CSF receptor (hGM R) subunits by retroviral gene transfer. Selective activation of hIL-3 Ralpha,beta(c) or hGM Ralpha,beta(c) transfects by hIL-3 and hGM-CSF promoted self-renewal and myeloid differentiation, respectively, over a range of cytokine (0.1 to 100 ng/mL) concentrations. These qualitatively distinct developmental outcomes were associated with different patterns of protein tyrosine phosphorylation and, thus, differential signaling pathway activation. The cell lines generated provide a model to investigate molecular events underlying self-renewal and differentiation and indicate that the alpha subunits act in combination with the hbeta(c) to govern developmental decisions. The role of the alpha subunit in conferring specificity was studied by using a chimeric receptor composed of the extracellular hIL-3 Ralpha and intracellular hGM Ralpha subunit domains. This receptor promoted differentiation in response to hIL-3. Thus, the alpha subunit cytosolic domain is an essential component in determining cell fate via specific signaling events.","['Evans, C A', 'Pierce, A', 'Winter, S A', 'Spooncer, E', 'Heyworth, C M', 'Whetton, A D']","['Evans CA', 'Pierce A', 'Winter SA', 'Spooncer E', 'Heyworth CM', 'Whetton AD']","['Department of Biomolecular Sciences, Leukaemia Research Fund Cellular Development Unit, Manchester, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*physiology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-3/*physiology', 'Retroviridae']",,1999/09/09 00:00,1999/09/09 00:01,['1999/09/09 00:00'],"['1999/09/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)48846-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 Sep 1;94(5):1504-14.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we have examined the effect of TNF-alpha on the proliferation of several CD34+/CD38+ (KG-1, TF-1) and CD34+/CD38- (KG-1a, TF-1a) myeloid leukemic progenitor cell lines. Our data show that TNF-alpha markedly inhibits the growth of these cells in both liquid and soft agar cultures. Addition of GM-CSF or IL-3 does not prevent TNF-alpha-induced growth inhibition. Flow cytometry analyses of propidium iodide-stained cells demonstrated cell death of all four cell lines, as judged by the presence of cells with hypodiploid DNA content after exposure of cells to TNF-alpha for 4 days. Annexin V assays detected apoptosis in TF-1, but not in TF-1a, KG-1, and KG-1a cells in terms of translocation of phosphatidylserine shortly after TNF-alpha treatment. Neutralizing anti-TNF receptor type I (TNFR-I; p55) Ab almost completely reversed TNF-alpha-induced growth inhibition in both liquid and soft agar cultures, whereas anti-TNFR-II (p75) Ab had only a marginal effect. TNF-alpha rapidly induced marked activation of nuclear transcription factor NF-kappa B in all 4 cell lines. The majority of this effect was abolished by the type I receptor Ab, whereas the type II receptor neutralizing Ab had no effect. Our data also show that TNF-alpha is incapable of inducing activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in these leukemic cell lines.","['Hu, X', 'Tang, M', 'Fisher, A B', 'Olashaw, N', 'Zuckerman, K S']","['Hu X', 'Tang M', 'Fisher AB', 'Olashaw N', 'Zuckerman KS']","['Division of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, University South Florida, Tampa 33612, USA. hu@moffitt.usf.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type II)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (NAD+ Nucleosidase)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Antigens, CD/*physiology', 'Antigens, CD34/*biosynthesis', 'Antigens, Differentiation/biosynthesis', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/immunology', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Clone Cells', 'Enzyme Activation/immunology', 'Growth Inhibitors/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'NAD+ Nucleosidase/biosynthesis', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Necrosis', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/*physiology', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type II', 'Signal Transduction/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*physiology']",,1999/09/08 00:00,1999/09/08 00:01,['1999/09/08 00:00'],"['1999/09/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/08 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/08 00:00 [entrez]']",['ji_v163n6p3106 [pii]'],ppublish,J Immunol. 1999 Sep 15;163(6):3106-15.,,,"['CA56072/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA76292/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

Role of a hematologic emergency unit.,814-9,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Increasing attention to quality of life and to health care costs has recently induced several cancer centers to change in-patient management into an out-patient setting even during high risk phases of disease. The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate feasibility and safety, as well as clinical characteristics, of out-hospital management of AML patients during their post-consolidation phase. DESIGN AND METHODS: All patients who were treated over a three year period by the three following protocols were included in the study: AML10 EORTC/GIMEMA for patients with AML, except for APL, aged </= 60 years; AML 13 EORTC/GIMEMA, for patients with AML, except for APL, aged >60 years; AIDA GIMEMA for APL patients. All patients submitted to the AML10 and AML13 protocols and those patients submitted to the AIDA protocol with difficult peripheral vein access had a central venous catheter (CVC) sited. Patients treated as in-patients were discharged at the end of consolidation chemotherapy provided they were in a good clinical condition. They were routinely evaluated on an out-patient basis twice weekly. In the event of any complication they were referred to the Emergency Unit of our Department dedicated to out-patients with hematologic diseases. RESULTS: One hundred and eleven patients with AML were eligible for intensive chemotherapy. After achievement of complete remission they received a total of 133 consolidation courses and in 127 instances they were followed on an out-patient basis during the aplastic phase. There were 69 cases (54%) of rehospitalization, 68 because of fever and only one because of severe anemia. Rehospitalization occurred in 90%,70% and 38% of courses in AML10, AML13 and AIDA protocols, respectively. Only one patient died: the cause of death was a brain hemorrhage. Coagulase negative staphylococci and viridans streptococci were the organisms most frequently isolated from blood. Most coagulase negative staphylococci were isolated in patients submitted to AML10 and AML13 protocols, who had an indwelling CVC. Empiric once-a-day antibacterial therapy with ceftriaxone and amikacin was effective in 75% of the cases and made early discharge possible in 28% of the cases with antibiotic therapy continued in an out-patient setting. Overall, patients were managed out of the hospital for 66% of the period of post-consolidation neutropenia (77%, 48% and 50% of the post-consolidation neutropenia period in patients treated with AIDA, AML10 and AML13 protocols, respectively). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Thanks to the availability of an emergency unit specifically dedicated to out-patients with hematologic diseases, selected out-hospital management of AML patients during post-consolidation cytopenia is a feasible, well accepted and cost-saving option, and can contribute to lower the risk of developing severe nosocomial infections. The empiric therapy with once-a-day ceftriaxone plus amikacin was effective, with the exception of staphylococcal infections, and made it possible to discharge patients early to continue treatment in an out-patient setting.","['Girmenia, C', 'Alimena, G', 'Latagliata, R', 'Morano, S G', 'Celesti, F', 'Coppola, L', 'Spadea, A', 'Tosti, S', 'Mecarocci, S', ""D'Elia, G M"", 'Tafuri, A', 'Cimino, G', 'Mandelli, F']","['Girmenia C', 'Alimena G', 'Latagliata R', 'Morano SG', 'Celesti F', 'Coppola L', 'Spadea A', 'Tosti S', 'Mecarocci S', ""D'Elia GM"", 'Tafuri A', 'Cimino G', 'Mandelli F']","['Dipartimento di Biotecnologie Cellulari ed Ematologia, University ""La Sapienza"", Via Benevento 6, 00161, Rome, Italy. girmenia@bce.med.uniroma1.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['75J73V1629 (Ceftriaxone)', '84319SGC3C (Amikacin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Ambulatory Care/*organization & administration', 'Amikacin/therapeutic use', 'Anemia/etiology/therapy', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Bacterial Infections/*drug therapy/epidemiology/etiology', 'Ceftriaxone/therapeutic use', 'Cerebral Hemorrhage/etiology', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Therapy, Combination/therapeutic use', '*Emergency Service, Hospital', 'Fever/etiology/therapy', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*complications/drug therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/etiology/therapy', 'Neutropenia/etiology', 'Staphylococcal Infections/drug therapy/epidemiology/etiology']",,1999/09/08 00:00,1999/09/08 00:01,['1999/09/08 00:00'],"['1999/09/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/08 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/08 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1999 Sep;84(9):814-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If the effects of this drug could be potentiated, it could be useful in order to obtain complete remissions. In this study we evaluated the effects of the combination of fludarabine and gemcitabine, a deoxycytidine analog that has shown both in vitro and in vivo activity against a variety of solid tumors. DESIGN AND METHODS: CLL cells from 10 patients were cultured in vitro in the presence of fludarabine (0.5-1,000 microg/mL) and gemcitabine (0.1-5,000 microg/mL), both alone and in different combinations. Cytotoxic activity was tested by the XTT colorimetric assay. Furthermore we evaluated BCL-2 protein expression and, subsequently, the induction of apoptosis at baseline and after exposing cells to different concentrations of fludarabine and gemcitabine. RESULTS: The IC(50) of fludarabine and gemcitabine on CLL cells was 550 and 1,100 microg/mL, respectively, in our series of samples; the cytotoxicity of either drug was not influenced by the percentage of BCL-2 positive cells in the same sample. The addition of gemcitabine increased fludarabine-induced cytotoxicity; however, isobologram analysis of the data showed synergism only when lower doses of gemcitabine were combined to fludarabine. Induction of apoptosis reflected this pattern of activity. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Gemcitabine was able to increase the activity of fludarabine only when low doses of the former were employed. As both compounds incorporate into DNA blocking chain elongation, our results could be explained by the drugs interfering at that level. The possibility of potentiating the effects of fludarabine with low doses of gemcitabine renders this combination promising in view of an in vivo use.","['Tosi, P', 'Pellacani, A', 'Zinzani, P L', 'Magagnoli, M', 'Visani, G', 'Tura, S']","['Tosi P', 'Pellacani A', 'Zinzani PL', 'Magagnoli M', 'Visani G', 'Tura S']","['Istituto di Ematologia ed Oncologia Medica ""L. e A.

A linear skeleton with a N-containing aromatic ring attached at C3 of the top A-ring, a central pyran B-ring and a six-membered bottom C-ring with no alkylation at C7 are required for the antitumor activities of the lead compounds, a 3-pyridyl benzopyran (code name H10) and its somewhat weaker 2-pyridyl regioisomer (code name H19). Increasing concentrations of H10 do not alter the binding of [3H]vinblastine and [3H]GTP to tubulin but mimic the ability of unlabeled colchicine (CLC) to reduce the amount of [3H]CLC bound to tubulin, suggesting that TPs may interact with the CLC binding site to inhibit tubulin polymerization. Exogenous Mg2+ cations absolutely required for the binding of GTP to tubulin and MT assembly cannot overcome the antitubulin action of H10. H10 reduces the viability of L1210 cells in vitro (IC50: 0.5 microM) but its antitumor activity may be related to its ability to inhibit tubulin polymerization and rapidly increase the mitotic index rather than to induce DNA cleavage and apoptosis. The anticancer potential of TPs in vivo is demonstrated by the fact that i.p. injections of the water-soluble H10-HCl decrease the growth of solid tumors in mice inoculated s.c. with Lewis lung carcinoma. A critical finding is that the antimitotic H10 is a bifunctional anticancer drug, which also blocks the cellular transport of nucleosides (IC50: 6 microM) to inhibit DNA synthesis. Since few CLC site-binding antimitotic agents are active in solid tumor models in vivo, the ability of these new MT destabilizing TPs to totally block nucleoside transport might be valuable in polychemotherapy to arrest tumor cells at several phases of their cycle, potentiate the action of antimetabolites and sensitize multidrug-resistant tumor cells.","['Perchellet, E M', 'Ladesich, J B', 'Magill, M J', 'Chen, Y', 'Hua, D H', 'Perchellet, J P']","['Perchellet EM', 'Ladesich JB', 'Magill MJ', 'Chen Y', 'Hua DH', 'Perchellet JP']","['Division of Biology, Kansas State University, Manhattan 66506-4901, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Nucleosides)', '0 (Pyrones)', '0 (Tubulin Modulators)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA/drug effects/metabolism', 'Female', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Microtubules/*drug effects', 'Mitosis/drug effects', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Nucleosides/*metabolism', 'Pyrones/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tubulin Modulators']",,1999/09/07 00:00,1999/09/07 00:01,['1999/09/07 00:00'],"['1999/09/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/07 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/07 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 1999 Jun;10(5):489-504.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Integrase (IN) is an essential retroviral enzyme, which has been a target for developing agents to inhibit virus replication. In previous studies, we showed that intracellular expression of single-chain variable antibody fragments (SFvs) that bind IN, delivered via retroviral expression vectors, provided resistance to productive HIV-1 infection in T-lymphocytic cells. In the current studies, we evaluated simian-virus 40 (SV40) as a delivery vehicle for anti-IN therapy of HIV-1 infection. Prior work suggested that delivery using SV40 might provide a high enough level of transduction that selection of transduced cells might be unnecessary. In these studies, an SV40 expression vector was developed to deliver SFv-IN (SV(Aw)). Expression of the SFv-IN was confirmed by Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining, which showed that > 90% of SupT1 T-lymphocytic cells treated with SV(Aw) expressed the SFv-IN protein without selection. When challenged, HIV-1 replication, as measured by HIV-1 p24 antigen expression and syncytium formation, was potently inhibited in cells expressing SV40-delivered SFv-IN. Levels of inhibition of HIV-1 infection achieved using this approach were comparable to those achieved using murine leukemia virus (MLV) as a transduction vector, the major difference being that transduction using SV40 did not require selection in culture whereas transduction with MLV did require selection. Therefore, the SV40 vector as gene delivery system represents a novel therapeutic strategy for gene therapy to target HIV-1 proteins and interfere with HIV-1 replication.","['BouHamdan, M', 'Duan, L X', 'Pomerantz, R J', 'Strayer, D S']","['BouHamdan M', 'Duan LX', 'Pomerantz RJ', 'Strayer DS']","['Dorrance H Hamilton Laboratories, Department of Medicine, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Gene Ther,Gene therapy,9421525,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Fragments)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (HIV Integrase)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Genetic Vectors/*administration & dosage', 'HIV Infections/*therapy', 'HIV Integrase/analysis/immunology', '*HIV-1', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fragments/administration & dosage/immunology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Simian virus 40/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Transfection/methods', 'Virus Replication']",,1999/09/07 00:00,1999/09/07 00:01,['1999/09/07 00:00'],"['1999/09/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/07 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/07 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.gt.3300864 [doi]'],ppublish,Gene Ther. 1999 Apr;6(4):660-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.gt.3300864.,,,"['AI38666/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI41399/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'RR13156/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,

Out of 15 cytokines tested for induction or enhancement of MCP-1 secretion, interleukin-3 (IL-3), IL-6, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and tumor necrosis factor (TNFalpha) were able to augment (twofold to 12-fold) the MCP-1 level in the culture medium of MONO-MAC-6 cells. While the antinflammatory cytokines IL-4, IL-10 and IL-13 failed to suppress MCP-1 secretion, the glucocorticoid dexamethasone strongly inhibited the MCP-1 production of unstimulated and stimulated MONO-MAC-6 cells. Thus, several regulatory elements are involved in MCP-1 secretion. Despite the quantitative differences of MCP-1 production among the cell lines analyzed, our results demonstrated a constitutive secretion in differentiation-arrested myelomonocytic leukemia cell lines and emphasize the usefulness of these malignant cell lines as models to study MCP-1 secretion and regulation.","['Steube, K G', 'Meyer, C', 'Drexler, H G']","['Steube KG', 'Meyer C', 'Drexler HG']","['Department of Human and Animal Cell Cultures, DSMZ-Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen, Braunschweig, Germany. kst@dsmz.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Chemokine CCL2)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Chemokine CCL2/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/chemically induced/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*pharmacology', 'Stimulation, Chemical', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/09/04 00:00,1999/09/04 00:01,['1999/09/04 00:00'],"['1999/09/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/04 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/04 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(99)00107-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(99)00107-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1999 Sep;23(9):843-9. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(99)00107-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are no randomized trials comparing these approaches and analyses of data from non-randomized studies are complex, contradictory without sufficient detail to allow subject-level treatment decisions. OBJECTIVE: Determine appropriateness of high-dose therapy and bone marrow transplants in persons with CML in chronic phase with specific features. Develop a treatment algorithm. PANELISTS: nine leukemia experts from diverse geographic sites and practice settings. EVIDENCE: Boolean MEDLINE searches of chronic myelogenous leukemia and chemotherapy and/or transplants. CONSENSUS PROCESS: We used a modified Delphi-panel group judgment process. Age, prognostic score, disease duration, and type of conventional therapy and response were permuted to define 90 clinical settings. Each panelist rated appropriateness of high-dose therapy and a transplant versus conventional therapy on a 9-point ordinal scale (1, most inappropriate, 9, most appropriate) considering three types of donors: (1) HLA-identical siblings; (2) alternative donors (HLA-matched related or unrelated people other than an HLA-identical sibling); and (3) autotransplants. An appropriateness index was developed based on median rating and amount of disagreement. Relationship of appropriateness indices to permuted clinical variables was considered by analysis of variance and recursive partitioning. Preference between donor types was analyzed by comparing mean appropriateness indices of similar settings and a treatment algorithm developed. CONCLUSIONS: In people with CML in chronic phase and an HLA-identical sibling donor and in those with an alternative donor (but no HLA-identical sibling), a transplant was rated appropriate in those with a < or = partial cytogenetic response to interferon and uncertain or inappropriate in all other settings. Autotransplants were rated uncertain or inappropriate in all settings. Most of the variance in appropriateness ratings between different clinical settings was accounted for by response to interferon: complete versus < or = partial response. An HLA-identical sibling donor, when available, was always preferred to an alternative donor or autotransplant. In people without an HLA-identical sibling, an alternative donor was favored over an autotransplant at higher appropriateness indices and the converse at lower appropriateness indices.","['Gale, R P', 'Park, R E', 'Dubois, R W', 'Herzig, G P', 'Hocking, W G', 'Horowitz, M M', 'Keating, A', 'Kempin, S', 'Linker, C A', 'Schiffer, C A', 'Wiernik, P H', 'Weisdorf, D J', 'Rai, K R']","['Gale RP', 'Park RE', 'Dubois RW', 'Herzig GP', 'Hocking WG', 'Horowitz MM', 'Keating A', 'Kempin S', 'Linker CA', 'Schiffer CA', 'Wiernik PH', 'Weisdorf DJ', 'Rai KR']","['Salik Health Care, Inc., Los Angeles, CA 90048-4520, USA. rgale@salick.com']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Algorithms', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Delphi Technique', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Tissue Donors']",,1999/09/04 00:00,1999/09/04 00:01,['1999/09/04 00:00'],"['1999/09/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/04 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/04 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212699000971 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(99)00097-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1999 Sep;23(9):817-26. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(99)00097-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the expression of 9-OAcSGs clearly serves as an index of treatment outcome, the assay has limitations in that it requires radioisotopes, i.e. [3H]-TdR. Therefore a colorimetric assay was developed as an alternative approach. The pre-treatment MLD, as measured by the colorimetric assay, was 0.15 +/- 0.02 microg which progressively increased during consolidation therapy (1.40 +/- 0.39 microg), maintenance therapy (4.20 +/- 1.60 microg) and in followed-up cases (5.20 +/- 0.43 microg) but sharply declined following relapse (0.25 +/- 0.02 microg). The colorimetric assay also showed a good correlation with radiometric assay (r = + 0.93) and their mean coefficient of inter-assay precision were also comparable (15.53% versus 14.86%).

Using the four IgH PCR systems together, clonality was detected in all samples of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemias, hairy cell leukemias, common acute lymphoblastic leukemias, and Burkitt-like B-cell lymphomas. Clonality was detected in all bone marrow aspirates with lymphoplasmacytoid immunocytoma, mantle cell lymphoma, marginal zone B-cell lymphoma, and unclassifiable low-grade B-cell lymphomas. The combined IgH gene PCR approach allowed clonality detection in 78.2% of myelomas, 75% of Burkitt lymphomas, 74.4% of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, 68.7% of follicular center lymphomas, 50% of posttransplant lymphomas, 28.6% of anaplastic large cell lymphomas, 29% of T-cell lymphomas, and 18.8% of Hodgkin diseases. The combination of the four IgH gene primer systems with the multiplex TRG gene PCR allowed detection of clonality in 84.2% of B-cell neoplasms, 92.1% of T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas, and 18.8% of Hodgkin diseases, which was much more efficient than single PCR protocols.","['Fodinger, M', 'Winkler, K', 'Mannhalter, C', 'Chott, A']","['Fodinger M', 'Winkler K', 'Mannhalter C', 'Chott A']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Diagn Mol Pathol,"Diagnostic molecular pathology : the American journal of surgical pathology, part B",9204924,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Genetic Markers)']",IM,"['Clone Cells', 'DNA Primers', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin/genetics', 'Genes, T-Cell Receptor gamma/genetics', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/*pathology', 'Lymphoma/genetics/*pathology', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prospective Studies', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",,1999/09/04 00:00,1999/09/04 00:01,['1999/09/04 00:00'],"['1999/09/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/04 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/04 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00019606-199906000-00004 [doi]'],ppublish,Diagn Mol Pathol. 1999 Jun;8(2):80-91. doi: 10.1097/00019606-199906000-00004.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The standard MLA, as well as other mammalian cell gene mutation assays, usually employs a short treatment period (3-6 h). Our previous report, however, suggested that such short treatments may be insufficient for detecting some clastogens and spindle poisons. For the present study, we introduced and evaluated a longer treatment (24 h) in the MLA. We examined 15 chemicals which were evaluated as negative or inconclusive in the short-term study. Cells were exposed to the chemical for 24 h without S9 mix, cultured for 2 days and then thymidine kinase-deficient mutants were selected in 96-well microtiter plates under trifluorothymidine. Eleven chemicals yielded positive responses in the 24 h treatment MLA. They included nucleoside analogs (2'-deoxycoformycin and dideoxycytidine), a base analog (1,3-dimethylxanthine) and spindle poisons (colchicine and vinblastine sulfate), all of which do not directly affect DNA, but bring about mutations and chromosome alterations through nucleoside metabolism and chromosome segregation. Because the mutagenicities of these non-DNA targeting chemicals appear to be cell cycle dependent, treatment extending over more than one cell cycle may be required for their effect. Combining results from the present and previous studies, 31 of 34 (91%) chromosome aberration-positive chemicals exhibited positive responses in the MLA, suggesting that the sensitivity of the MLA with 24 h treatment periods approaches that of the chromosome aberration test.","['Honma, M', 'Zhang, L Z', 'Sakamoto, H', 'Ozaki, M', 'Takeshita, K', 'Momose, M', 'Hayashi, M', 'Sofuni, T']","['Honma M', 'Zhang LZ', 'Sakamoto H', 'Ozaki M', 'Takeshita K', 'Momose M', 'Hayashi M', 'Sofuni T']","['Division of Genetics and Mutagenesis, National Institute of Health Sciences, Tokyo, Japan. honma@nihs.go.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mutagenesis,Mutagenesis,8707812,"['0 (Mutagens)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chromosomes/drug effects', 'Leukemia L5178/enzymology/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mutagenicity Tests/*methods', 'Mutagens/*pharmacology', 'Thymidine Kinase/genetics', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/09/04 00:00,1999/09/04 00:01,['1999/09/04 00:00'],"['1999/09/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/04 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/04 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/mutage/14.1.23 [doi]'],ppublish,Mutagenesis. 1999 Jan;14(1):23-9. doi: 10.1093/mutage/14.1.23.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined 40 chemicals; 33 were reportedly positive in the CA but negative in the bacterial reverse mutation assay, six were negative in both assays and one was positive in both. We assayed mutations of the thymidine kinase (TK) locus (tk) of L5178Y tk +/- mouse lymphoma cells using the microwell method. According to our standard protocol, cells were exposed to the chemical for 3 h, cultured for 2 days and TK-deficient mutants were expressed in 96-well plates under trifluorothymidine. Each chemical was coded and tested by two or three laboratories. Among the 34 CA-positive chemicals, positive MLA results were obtained for 20 and negative results were obtained for nine. The remaining five chemicals were inconclusive or equivocal because of discrepant inter-laboratory results or reproduced discrepant results, respectively. Among the six CA-negative chemicals, one was negative in the MLA, two were positive and three were inconclusive. Thus, the MLA could detect only 59% (20/34) of CA-positive chemicals. We concluded that the MLA was not as sensitive as the CA. Some MLA-negative chemicals evoked positive responses in the CA only after long continuous treatment. These might also be genotoxic in the MLA with long continuous treatment. Improvement of the MLA protocol, including alteration of the duration of the treatment, might render the MLA as sensitive as the CA.","['Honma, M', 'Hayashi, M', 'Shimada, H', 'Tanaka, N', 'Wakuri, S', 'Awogi, T', 'Yamamoto, K I', 'Kodani, N', 'Nishi, Y', 'Nakadate, M', 'Sofuni, T']","['Honma M', 'Hayashi M', 'Shimada H', 'Tanaka N', 'Wakuri S', 'Awogi T', 'Yamamoto KI', 'Kodani N', 'Nishi Y', 'Nakadate M', 'Sofuni T']","['Division of Genetics and Mutagenesis, National Institute of Health Sciences, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mutagenesis,Mutagenesis,8707812,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Mutagens)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chromosome Aberrations/*genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Leukemia L5178/*enzymology/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mutagenicity Tests/instrumentation/*methods', 'Mutagens/pharmacology', 'Thymidine Kinase/deficiency/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/09/04 00:00,1999/09/04 00:01,['1999/09/04 00:00'],"['1999/09/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/04 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/04 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/mutage/14.1.5 [doi]'],ppublish,Mutagenesis. 1999 Jan;14(1):5-22. doi: 10.1093/mutage/14.1.5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: A descriptive analysis of trends in incidence and mortality by age, sex, time period and leukemia subtype, using change-point modelling and log-linear regression. SETTING: Data from all provincial and territorial cancer registries. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Incidence and mortality rate per population of 100,000. RESULTS: The overall age-adjusted incidence rates for all males and females increased from 12.3 and 7.3 per 100,000 in 1970-1972 to 14.6 and 9.0 in 1979-1981, then decreased to 13.2 and 8.3 in 1991-1993, respectively. The overall age-adjusted mortality rates decreased from 9.1 and 5.7 per population of 100,000 in 1970-1972 to 8.3 and 4.8 in 1993-1995 for males and females, respectively. The incidence of acute leukemias decreased between 1970 and 1993. A sharp increase in the incidence of chronic leukemias from 1978 to 1980 was observed in the older age group. Mortality rates also showed a small increase from 1979 to 1989 in seniors. CONCLUSION: The increase in the incidence of chronic leukemias among older subjects was probably due to improvements in diagnosis and changes in registration practices, whereas the decrease in the incidence of acute leukemias was probably a real change attributable to environmental factors. Further investigation is needed to clarify whether and to what extent diagnostic practices contributed to the increased detection of chronic leukemias among elderly Canadians.","['Liu, S', 'Semenciw, R', 'Mao, Y']","['Liu S', 'Semenciw R', 'Mao Y']","['Laboratory Centre for Disease Control, Health Canada, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Canada,Cancer Prev Control,Cancer prevention & control : CPC = Prevention & controle en cancerologie : PCC,9709994,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Aged', 'Canada/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', ""*Practice Patterns, Physicians'"", 'Sex Distribution']",,1999/09/04 00:00,1999/09/04 00:01,['1999/09/04 00:00'],"['1999/09/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/04 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/04 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Prev Control. 1999 Jun;3(3):202-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: For easy identification of very small lymphoid infiltrates the chloroacetate esterase stain was applied as a screening procedure. This allowed the identification of 491 formalin fixed, paraffin wax embedded specimens with one or more lymphoid nodules. Examination of lymphoid infiltrates included such variables as histotopography, demarcation, cytology, reticulin fibres, and immunohistochemistry with a set of monoclonal antibodies (CD20, CD45R, CD45R0, CD3, CD43). Evaluation of clinical and morphological data was carried out independently. In case of malignant lymphomas, a correlation with corresponding lymph node findings was made. RESULTS: 352 patients had benign focal lymphoid aggregates usually associated with systemic autoimmune diseases, chronic myeloproliferative disorders, toxic myelopathy, and viral infections. Discrete nodular infiltrates of (small cell) malignant lymphomas (n = 93) simulating benign hyperplasia were found in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, germinal centre cell lymphomas (CB-CC), and lymphoplasmacytic/cytoid lymphomas (LPI). In addition to immunoreactivity, certain histological variables proved distinctive. These were: (1) histotopography, that is, localisation of the lymphoid aggregates within the bone marrow space; (2) relation to the surrounding tissue: margination or interstitial spillage of lymphoid cells; and (3) increase in reticulin fibres. CONCLUSIONS: A combined diagnostic procedure identifying several distinctive features, in particular histotopography and immunohistochemistry, provides a most promising way of discriminating reactive from neoplastic lymphoid nodules in the bone marrow.","['Thiele, J', 'Zirbes, T K', 'Kvasnicka, H M', 'Fischer, R']","['Thiele J', 'Zirbes TK', 'Kvasnicka HM', 'Fischer R']","['Institute of Pathology, University of Cologne, Germany. j.thiele@uni-koeln.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,,IM,"['Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Examination/*methods', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Hodgkin Disease/diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Hyperplasia', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*diagnosis', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/diagnosis']",PMC501336,1999/09/04 00:00,1999/09/04 00:01,['1999/09/04 00:00'],"['1999/09/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/04 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/04 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/jcp.52.4.294 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 1999 Apr;52(4):294-300. doi: 10.1136/jcp.52.4.294.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Comparison of the clinical presentation and outcome of infections by enterobacteria and non-glucose-fermenting gram-negative bacilli.,7-11,"To compare the characteristics of bacteremic infections by different aerobic gram-negative bacilli (GNB) in patients with hematologic malignancies, we studied 54 consecutive monomicrobial bacteremias by Enterobacteriaceae (EB), 15 by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 43 by other non-glucose-fermenting GNB (NGFGNB) and 11 by other GNB. Patients with EB and P. aeruginosa bacteremia usually developed the infection after intensive chemotherapy for leukemia or during a hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, while most infections in outpatients off therapy were due to NGFGNB. A significant proportion of bacteremias by EB (37%) and P. aeruginosa (40%) were accompanied by severe morbidity (septic shock, pneumonia or deep-seated organ infections) vs. only 7% of other NGFGNB (p < 0.01). Most infections by these latter bacteria were catheter-related bacteremias (80 vs. 2% of EB, p < 0.005), while most EB infections (61%) were uncomplicated bacteremias of unknown source (vs. 14% of other NGFGNB, p < 0.005). Appropriate antibiotics alone cured 98% of EB and 73% of P. aeruginosa bacteremias but only 26% of other NGFGNB (p < 0.005 for both differences), which were cured by catheter removal in 70%, usually after failure of antibiotic treatment. In conclusion, our results suggest that there are significant differences in the patient populations and clinical characteristics of bacteremic infections by the classic GNB (EB and P. aeruginosa) and the new NGFGNB in adults with hematologic malignancies.","['Martino, R', 'Santamaria, A', 'Munoz, L', 'Pericas, R', 'Altes, A', 'Prats, G', 'Sierra, J']","['Martino R', 'Santamaria A', 'Munoz L', 'Pericas R', 'Altes A', 'Prats G', 'Sierra J']","['Division of Clinical Hematology, Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain. rmartino@hsp.santpau.es']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,['IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bacteremia/*complications', 'Enterobacteriaceae Infections/*complications', 'Female', 'Fermentation', 'Glucose/metabolism', 'Gram-Negative Aerobic Bacteria/isolation & purification', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections/*complications', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*microbiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",,1999/09/04 00:00,1999/09/04 00:01,['1999/09/04 00:00'],"['1999/09/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/04 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/04 00:00 [entrez]']","['40960 [pii]', '10.1159/000040960 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 1999;102(1):7-11. doi: 10.1159/000040960.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This work aimed at studying the survival of polyploid cells formed after treatment with a nocodazole concentration sufficient to significantly decrease tubulin polymerization (0.1 microg/ml). First, normal primary lymphocytes were analysed and the following complementary chromosomal parameters were quantified: mitotic index, frequency of abnormal mitoses, polyploid metaphases and apoptotic cells. The results clearly indicate a positive correlation between abnormal mitotic figures, apoptosis and the induction of polyploidy. They therefore led to a single cell approach in which both apoptosis and polyploidy induction could be scored in the same cell. For this purpose, actively proliferating cells are required and two human leukaemic cell lines were used, KS (p53-positive) and K562 (p53-negative), which have a near-triploid karyotype. Cells were separated into an apoptotic and a viable fraction by means of annexin-V staining and flow cytometry. In KS, treatment with nocodazole induced a similar fraction of hexaploid cells in both the viable and apoptotic fraction, but no dodecaploid cells were ever observed. In contrast, a population of dodecaploid cells (essentially viable) was clearly observed in the K562 cell line. The results in KS, as compared with K562, confirm that wild-type p53 can prevent further cycling of polyploid cells by blocking rereplication. The most probable explanation for these data is that not only the mitotic spindle but also interphase microtubules are sensitive to nocodazole treatment. Our data thus strongly suggest that besides the G(1)/S checkpoint under the control of p53, the G(2)/M transition may be sensitive to depolymerization of microtubules, possibly under the control of Cdc2, Bcl-2, Raf-1 and/or Rho.","['Verdoodt, B', 'Decordier, I', 'Geleyns, K', 'Cunha, M', 'Cundari, E', 'Kirsch-Volders, M']","['Verdoodt B', 'Decordier I', 'Geleyns K', 'Cunha M', 'Cundari E', 'Kirsch-Volders M']","['Laboratory for Cell Genetics, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Pleinlaan 2, 1050 Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mutagenesis,Mutagenesis,8707812,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'SH1WY3R615 (Nocodazole)', 'Z01IVE25KI (Demecolcine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Demecolcine/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/genetics/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Nocodazole/*pharmacology', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', '*Polyploidy', 'Spindle Apparatus/*drug effects', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics']",,1999/09/03 00:00,1999/09/03 00:01,['1999/09/03 00:00'],"['1999/09/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/mutage/14.5.513 [doi]'],ppublish,Mutagenesis. 1999 Sep;14(5):513-20. doi: 10.1093/mutage/14.5.513.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been demonstrated that replacing all or part of the membrane-spanning domain of a viral fusion protein with sequences that encode signals for glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage attachment abrogates membrane fusion activity. It has been suggested, however, that the actual amino acid sequence of the membrane-spanning domain is not critical for the activity of viral fusion proteins. We have examined the function of Moloney murine leukemia virus envelope proteins with substitutions in the membrane-spanning domain. Envelope proteins bearing substitutions for proline 617 are processed and incorporated into virus particles normally and bind to the viral receptor. However, they possess greatly reduced or undetectable capacities for the promotion of membrane fusion and infectious virus particle formation. Our results imply a direct role for the residues in the membrane-spanning domain of the murine leukemia virus envelope protein in membrane fusion and its regulation. They also support the thesis that membrane-spanning domains possess a sequence-dependent function in other protein-mediated membrane fusion events.","['Taylor, G M', 'Sanders, D A']","['Taylor GM', 'Sanders DA']","['Department of Biological Sciences, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana 47907-1392, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Biol Cell,Molecular biology of the cell,9201390,"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '9DLQ4CIU6V (Proline)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Cell Fusion', 'Cell Line', 'Conserved Sequence/genetics', 'Gene Products, env/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Giant Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Glycoproteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', '*Membrane Fusion', 'Membrane Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics/growth & development/*metabolism', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Proline/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Receptors, Virus/metabolism', 'Virus Assembly']",PMC25519,1999/09/03 00:00,1999/09/03 00:01,['1999/09/03 00:00'],"['1999/09/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1091/mbc.10.9.2803 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Biol Cell. 1999 Sep;10(9):2803-15. doi: 10.1091/mbc.10.9.2803.,,,"['T32 GM008296/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM08296/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

In this report, we identify the KIX domain as a new p53 contact point on CBP. We show that both recombinant and endogenous forms of p53 specifically interact with KIX. We demonstrate that the activation domain of p53 participates in KIX binding and provide evidence showing that this interaction is critical for p53 transactivation function. The human T-cell leukemia virus, type-I-encoded oncoprotein Tax is a well established repressor of p53 transcription function. Like p53, Tax also binds to KIX. The finding that both transcription factors bind to a common region of CBP suggests that coactivator competition may account for the observed repression. We demonstrate reciprocal repression between Tax and p53 in transient transfection assays, supporting the idea of intracellular coactivator competition. We biochemically confirm coactivator competition by directly showing that both transcription factors bind to KIX in a mutually exclusive fashion. These data provide molecular evidence for the observed intracellular competition and suggest that Tax inhibits p53 function by abrogating a novel p53-KIX interaction. Thus, Tax competition for the p53-KIX complex may be a pivotal event in the human T-cell leukemia virus, type I transformation pathway.","['Van Orden, K', 'Giebler, H A', 'Lemasson, I', 'Gonzales, M', 'Nyborg, J K']","['Van Orden K', 'Giebler HA', 'Lemasson I', 'Gonzales M', 'Nyborg JK']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado 80523-1870, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREB-Binding Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREBBP protein, human)']",IM,"['Binding, Competitive', 'CREB-Binding Protein', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Gene Products, tax/metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*virology', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism']",,1999/09/03 00:00,1999/09/03 00:01,['1999/09/03 00:00'],"['1999/09/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/03 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.274.37.26321 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)55218-8 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1999 Sep 10;274(37):26321-8. doi: 10.1074/jbc.274.37.26321.,,,"['R01 CA055035/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA055035-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-55035/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

In vitro stimulation with PPD resulted in both proliferative responses and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) production in NP and PP (P < 0.02), with minimal proliferation and IFN-gamma production in the NN and PN groups. Further, PPD-specific interleukin 10 (IL-10) production was significantly reduced in the PN group (P < 0.01), while the other groups had comparable levels. Cytokine reconstitution experiments demonstrated that while addition of recombinant IL-12 (rIL-12) plus anti-IL-4 restored PPD-specific responses in the NN group, it had no effect in the PN group. However, addition of rIL-12 resulted in the increased production of IFN-gamma in both nonresponder groups (NN and PN), suggesting that the lack of IFN-gamma production was not responsible for the PPD anergy. We conclude that PPD-specific anergy in HTLV-1-infected individuals appears to be due in part to their inability to respond to rIL-12.","['Suzuki, M', 'Dezzutti, C S', 'Okayama, A', 'Tachibana, N', 'Tsubouchi, H', 'Mueller, N', 'Lal, R B']","['Suzuki M', 'Dezzutti CS', 'Okayama A', 'Tachibana N', 'Tsubouchi H', 'Mueller N', 'Lal RB']","['Retrovirus Disease Branch, Division of AIDS, STD, and TB Laboratory Research, National Centers for Infectious Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia 30333, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Diagn Lab Immunol,Clinical and diagnostic laboratory immunology,9421292,"['0 (Antigens, Bacterial)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (BCG Vaccine)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tuberculin)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Antigens, Bacterial/immunology', 'Antigens, Viral/immunology', 'BCG Vaccine/immunology', 'Cell Division/drug effects/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cohort Studies', 'HTLV-I Infections/*immunology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Humans', '*Immunologic Memory', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Interleukin-12/immunology/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/immunology/pharmacology', 'Mycobacterium bovis/immunology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Th1 Cells/cytology/*immunology/metabolism', 'Thymidine/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Tritium', 'Tuberculin/*immunology']",PMC95760,1999/09/03 00:00,1999/09/03 00:01,['1999/09/03 00:00'],"['1999/09/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/CDLI.6.5.713-717.1999 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Diagn Lab Immunol. 1999 Sep;6(5):713-7. doi: 10.1128/CDLI.6.5.713-717.1999.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patient population comprised 207 haematology patients divided into two groups: one for computing the population model (n = 134) and the other for validation (n = 73). A one-compartment model was used and the following covariates were tested for their influence on clearance and volume of distribution: age, gender, weight, parenteral nutrition, creatinine clearance, stage of antineoplastic treatment (induction, consolidation, intensification), number of weeks postchemotherapy, clinical diagnosis, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score, neutropenia, hypoalbuminaemia, concomitant medication (vancomycin and/or amphotericin B), overhydration, and autologous or allogenic bone marrow transplant. The nonlinear mixed-effect model (NONMEM) was used to assess the population pharmacokinetic model of amikacin in these patients. Apart from bodyweight and renal function, acute myeloblastic leukaemia and hypoalbuminaemia proved to be the most important covariates explaining the interindividual variability in amikacin pharmacokinetics in patients with haematological malignancies.

We have postulated that recombination may play a crucial role in this process. The human homologue of Rad51, (HsRad51), has homology to the RecA protein in Escherichia coli, which is implicated in recombination repair and induction of DNA repair enzymes. In this report, we have examined the expression and distribution of HsRad51 protein in lymphocytes from patients with B-CLL to see whether the expression of HsRad51 is associated with NM damage to the malignant B lymphocytes, specifically chlorambucil (CLB), which is the standard alkylating agent used to treat patients with B-CLL. We have analyzed the intracellular distribution of HsRad51 protein in these lymphocytes before and after treatment with CLB by immunofluorescence. In vitro CLB treatment induces Rad51 expression, as measured by increased immunopositive staining in all CLL samples. In the CLB-resistant CLL lymphocytes, there was a linear correlation between induction of Rad51 protein at 5.4 microM CLB and the in vitro LD50 dose of CLB. Surprisingly, although it has been reported that Rad51 is induced in S phase and only 10% of cells from cell lines expressed positive immunostaining for Rad51, our CLL lymphocytes, which were not subjected to in vitro drug exposure, were 90% positive for Rad51, despite their nonproliferative state, which suggests that there is chronic activation of the protein. Our results suggest that CLB activates HsRad51-directed recombination repair and that this process may be important in NM drug-induced cytotoxicity.","['Christodoulopoulos, G', 'Malapetsa, A', 'Schipper, H', 'Golub, E', 'Radding, C', 'Panasci, L C']","['Christodoulopoulos G', 'Malapetsa A', 'Schipper H', 'Golub E', 'Radding C', 'Panasci LC']","['Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, The Sir Mortimer B.

We studied Ikaros gene expression in leukemic cells from 18 children with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). In each of the 18 T-ALL cases as well as JK-E6-1 and MOLT-3 cell lines, we found high-level expression of dominant-negative isoforms of Ikaros with abnormal subcellular compartmentalization patterns. Nuclear extracts from these cells failed to bind to the IKAROS-specific binding sequence in DNA. PCR cloning and sequencing confirmed that JK-E6-1 and MOLT-3 cell lines as well as leukemic cells from 9 of 10 patients with T-ALL expressed dominant-negative Ikaros isoforms Ik-4, Ik-7, and Ik-8 that lack critical NH2-terminal zinc fingers. In 6 of 10 patients, we detected a specific mutation leading to an in-frame deletion of 10 amino acids (delta KSSMPQKFLG) upstream to the transcription activation domain and adjacent to the COOH-terminal zinc fingers of Ik-2, Ik-4, Ik-7, and Ik-8.

In study AML-BFM 87, 49 NR of 307 patients (16%) did not achieve remission until the end of intensive chemotherapy and were analysed to assess the specific contribution of prognostic factors, therapy realization and complications of therapy. THERAPY AND METHODS: Therapy started with an 8-day induction therapy followed by a 6-week consolidation and two 5-day intensification blocks with high-dose cytosine-arabinoside and VP-16. Maintenance therapy was given for a total duration of 1.5 years. To evaluate the impact of treatment intensity in NR, we compared the dose compliance (DC = dose given/intended dose), the dose intensity (DI = dose per time given), the treatment results, and toxicity of the individual therapy phases in responders (CR) and NR. RESULTS: In 19 of 49 NR therapy was stopped before starting intensification blocks. Twenty-six NR received at least one block of intensification, and seven patients between three and six intensification blocks. Six children entered maintenance therapy. Twelve patients received a bone marrow transplant (9 allogeneic, 3 autologous). Six (5 after bone marrow transplantation) of 49 NR are still alive for 64 to 108 months. In nearly all patients induction therapy could be applied according to protocol (mean DC: 98%, range 85%-100%), whereas therapy realization was more difficult in the 2nd phase of therapy (mean DC: 92%, range 12%-113%). Deviations from the protocol in the treatment blocks (changes of dose and/or schedule) were mainly attributable to persistence of blasts (n = 33) and septic complications (n = 24). The mean relative DI of 1.01 was according to protocol. Bleeding and infectious complications in the individual therapy phases varied from 7% to 61%. NR compared to CR patients suffered significantly more often from bleeding during the first and second part of consolidation and from infections during the second part of consolidation. Withdrawal from protocol in NR was mainly due to persistence of blasts (n = 16), followed by bone marrow transplantation or other therapies (n = 13), and sepsis (n = 11). CONCLUSIONS: It is difficult to discriminate between nonresponse associated with blast persistence followed by complications and subsequent discontinuation of therapy and nonresponse due to insufficient therapy in patients with complications. Our analyses revealed that therapy with 2 intensifications according to protocol was feasible in 13 NR. Patients' condition permitting, therapy should not be stopped prematurely, in order to sustain the option of BMT after blast cell reduction.","['Kallage, V', 'Muller, J E', 'Zimmermann, M', 'Beck, J D', 'Ritter, J', 'Creutzig, U']","['Kallage V', 'Muller JE', 'Zimmermann M', 'Beck JD', 'Ritter J', 'Creutzig U']","['Klinik und Poliklinik fur Kinderheilkunde, Padiatrische Hamatologie und Onkologie, Munster.']",['ger'],"['Clinical Trial', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/therapy', 'Male', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Failure']",,1999/09/03 00:00,1999/09/03 00:01,['1999/09/03 00:00'],"['1999/09/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2008-1043797 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 1999 Jul-Aug;211(4):250-9. doi: 10.1055/s-2008-1043797.,,,,,,"Prognose, Therapierealisierung und Komplikationen bei den Nonrespondern der Studie AML-BFM 87.",,,,,,,

In general, the literature and our preliminary data on in vitro cellular drug resistance in AML are promising in terms of clinical relevance. Cell biological features and clinical response to chemotherapy are related to in vitro drug resistance. However, a large study including multivariate analysis is required to more firmly establish the clinical value of cellular drug resistance testing in childhood AML, and the collaborative study will therefore be continued. Possible applications of cell culture assays include risk-group stratification, rational improvements of current treatment protocols for subgroups of patients based on specific drug resistance profiles, individualised tailored therapy, the study of cross-resistance patterns between drugs, the study of possibilities to modulate or circumvent drug resistance, the study of drug interactions, selection of patients for clinical phase II studies and drug screening.","['Kaspers, G J', 'Zwaan, C M', 'Veerman, A J', 'Rots, M G', 'Pieters, R', 'Bucsky, P', 'Domula, M', 'Gobel, U', 'Graf, N', 'Havers, W', 'Jorch, N', 'Kabisch, K', 'Spaar, H J', 'Ritter, J', 'Creutzig, U']","['Kaspers GJ', 'Zwaan CM', 'Veerman AJ', 'Rots MG', 'Pieters R', 'Bucsky P', 'Domula M', 'Gobel U', 'Graf N', 'Havers W', 'Jorch N', 'Kabisch K', 'Spaar HJ', 'Ritter J', 'Creutzig U']","['Dept. of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University Hospital Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. gjl.kaspers@azvu.nl']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Review']",Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Child', 'Down Syndrome/*complications', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/complications/*drug therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay/*methods']",,1999/09/03 00:00,1999/09/03 00:01,['1999/09/03 00:00'],"['1999/09/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2008-1043795 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 1999 Jul-Aug;211(4):239-44. doi: 10.1055/s-2008-1043795.,,,,41,,,,,,,,,

In spite of risk-adapted therapy, however, 20-30% of the patients suffer a relapse and may have profited from more intensive therapy. On the other hand a third of the patients is probably overtreated considering cure rates of 30% with less intensive therapies in the seventies. Additional prognostic criteria are therefore urgently needed. In a retrospective Dutch study in childhood ALL drug sensitivity testing with the MTT assay was identified as a new highly significant prognostic factor. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In study COALL-92 in 140 patients in vitro drug sensitivity was performed on initial bone marrow or blood samples and as in the Dutch study a score was derived from the sensitivity of the 3 drugs prednisolone, vincristine and asparaginase (PVA score). For each drug a score of 1 (highest) to 3 (lowest sensitivity) is given. A score of 3 therefore indicates the best, a score of 9 the worst sensitivity. RESULTS: Probability of event-free survival (pEFS) according to the PVA score was 0.94 for score 3 + 4, 0.80 for score 5-7, 0.35 for Score 8 + 9 (0.47 for score 7-9). For analysis within the low risk (LR) group (age 1-10 years, WBC < 25/nl, common or pre-B-ALL, remission day 28, no translocation 9;22 or 4;11) and high risk (HR) group 252 patients of the Dutch study and the COALL study were combined. In the LR group pEFS was 1.00 for score 3 + 4, 0.76 for score 5-7, 0.38 for score 8 + 9 (0.54 for score 7-9); in the HR group pEFS was 0.91 for score 3 + 4, 0.69 for score 5-7, 0.45 for score 8 + 9 (0.56 for score 7-9). Multivariate analysis identified the PVA score as independent prognostic factor. NEW STUDY COALL-97: In the new study COALL-97 patients are first stratified according to HR and LR criteria and then are stratified again according to the PVA score. LR and HR patients with a score of 3 + 4 receive less intensive treatment in reinduction therapy to reduce the cumulative dose of anthracyclines and to mitigate the high rate of infectious complications during this part of the protocol. LR patients with a score of 7-9 are treated according to the HR protocol; HR patients with a score of 8 + 9 receive BMT if an HLA identical family donor is available. In study COALL-97 the results of the minimal residual disease study and day 15 bone marrow will be compared with the PVA score. CONCLUSIONS: In vitro drug sensitivity testing is an independent prognostic factor which allows adjustment of therapy to the individual risk of relapse in addition to the traditional risk factors. It can be assumed that in patients with a favourable resistance profile therapy can be reduced without loss of efficacy and that patients with an unfavourable resistance profile might profit from more intensive therapy.","['Janka-Schaub, G E', 'Harms, D O', 'den Boer, M L', 'Veerman, A J', 'Pieters, R']","['Janka-Schaub GE', 'Harms DO', 'den Boer ML', 'Veerman AJ', 'Pieters R']","['Abt. fur padiatrische Hamatologie und Onkologie, Universitatskinderklinik Hamburg. janka@uke.uni-hamburg.de']",['ger'],"['Clinical Trial', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor/standards', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', '*Patient Selection', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prednisolone/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Risk', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",,1999/09/03 00:00,1999/09/03 00:01,['1999/09/03 00:00'],"['1999/09/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2008-1043794 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 1999 Jul-Aug;211(4):233-8. doi: 10.1055/s-2008-1043794.,,,,,,Die In-vitro-Zytostatika-Resistenz als unabhangiger prognostischer Faktor in Studie COALL-05-92 zur Behandlung der akuten lymphoblastischen Leukamie im Kindesalter: Basis fur eine Doppelstratifizierung nach traditionellen Risikokriterien und Resistenzprofil in Studie COALL-06-97.

HSC donors can be found in the family of the patient or in registries of unrelated donors. In the present study, the search procedure within the last two years for an allogeneic HSC donor at the University of Dusseldorf is analyzed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: During 1997 and 1998, an early search for a related HSC donor in the family was performed for 70 high risk pediatric patients. During the same period, the search for an unrelated HSC donor for 116 adult and pediatric patients was performed. Low resolution HLA-A and -B typing was performed by serology in combination with DNA-typing. High resolution typing of HLA-A, -B and -C was carried out by DNA-sequencing. Low resolution HLA-DRB- und HLA-DQB1-typing was done solely by DNA-typing and high resolution typing of these genes was performed by DNA-sequencing. MAIN RESULTS: For 51 of 70 high risk pediatric patients (73%), no family donor could be defined, 16 of 70 patients (23%) had a genotypically identical sibling and for three of 70 patients (4%) an HLA-acceptable donor in the extended family could be identified. The search for an unrelated HSC donor was successful in 74% of the adult and pediatric patients lacking such a family donor. Most noteworthy, nearly all of the HLA-acceptable donors were identified from that group of donors in the registries, which were not only HLA-A and HLA-B, but also HLA-DR pretyped. CONCLUSION: These data show, that a growing number of pediatric patients with high risk leukemia need an unrelated HSC donor and that HLA-ABDR-pretyped registries present the optimal prerequisite to identify an HSC donor for most of the patients. In addition, 25% of the patients with no family or unrelated HSC donor require HSC transplants from alternative donors like unrelated Cord Blood (CB) from high quality cord blood banks.","['Enczmann, J', 'Rinker, M', 'Kiesel, U', 'Kuhrober, A', 'Kogler, G', 'Nurnberger, W', 'Gobel, U', 'Wernet, P']","['Enczmann J', 'Rinker M', 'Kiesel U', 'Kuhrober A', 'Kogler G', 'Nurnberger W', 'Gobel U', 'Wernet P']","['Bone Marrow Donor Center with Eurocord Bank and Transplantation Immunology, Heinrich Heine University Medical Center, Dusseldorf, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],IM,"['Adult', '*Blood Donors', 'Child', 'Female', 'Germany', 'HLA Antigens/*immunology', 'Hematologic Diseases/*surgery', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Histocompatibility Testing/*methods', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Registries', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,1999/09/03 00:00,1999/09/03 00:01,['1999/09/03 00:00'],"['1999/09/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2008-1043792 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 1999 Jul-Aug;211(4):218-23. doi: 10.1055/s-2008-1043792.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, in other cohorts of ALL patients treated according to American protocols the incidence of severe thromboses was 2-11%. Most of the VT were not catheter related, but were atypical thromboses like sinus venous thromboses. In these patients hereditary thrombophilia risk factors seemed to play a major role. In a 6 year period including the COALL protocols -92 and -97 only 10/684 (1.5%) children presented with symptomatic VT, and 7/10 thromboses were catheter related. Every thrombotic event could be successfully treated either by heparin administration or fibrinolytic agents. 2/10 VT were secondary due to a septic event. 5 out of 8 primary VT occurred after asparaginase/dexamethasone application during the reinduction therapy. In conclusion, symptomatic thrombotic events are very rare in the COALL studies.

PROCEDURE: Treatment included glucocorticosteroids (GC), E. coli L-asparaginase (Asparaginase, Medac) or Erwinia L-asparaginase (Erwinase, Speywood), vincristine, anthracyclines and intrathecal methotrexate. The analysis of hemostatic proteins was performed during induction and re-induction therapy. RESULTS: At diagnosis, the plasma concentrations of fibrinogen, antithrombin III (AT), plasminogen and protein C were within normal limits, whereas the von Willebrand factor antigen (vWF:Ag) was elevated. After eight days of mono-therapy with GC the concentration of fibrinogen decreased to 59%, vWF:Ag decreased to 67%, AT increased to 124%, protein C increased to 201% of the initial value (mean all p < or = 0.01), while the concentration of plasminogen remained unchanged. During the re-induction phase, the concentrations of the hemostatic proteins, with exception of vWF:Ag, altered in a similar way in response to GC as observed during the induction phase. Administration of two doses of E. coli L-asparaginase (10,000 U/m2) during the induction therapy led to a significant decrease of AT (123 +/- 24 to 63 +/- 15%/mL), protein C (168 +/- 34 to 87 +/- 19%/mL), plasminogen (94 +/- 21 to 41 +/- 12%/mL) and fibrinogen (148 +/- 59 to 79 +/- 30 mg/dL, p < or = 0.01 for all parameters). In contrast, administration of two doses of Erwinia L-asparaginase (10,000 U/m2) during re-induction therapy did not lead to change in the concentration of AT, protein C or plasminogen, and the decrease in fibrinogen (162 +/- 17 to 121 +/- 24 mg/dL) was less pronounced.

METHODS: A population based dataset obtained from routinely collected death certificates involving 14,168 cancer deaths occurring before the age of 15 years registered in England and Wales between 1959-63 and 1970-90. Associations were assessed with the proportional cancer mortality ratio (PCMR), with all childhood cancer deaths forming the standard for comparison. The PCMRs were adjusted, by stratification, for age and year of death (in 1-year bands) and paternal social class (nine categories). Analyses were performed by estimated level of paternal occupational social contact (high, medium, and low) for all leukaemias, leukaemia subtype, age at death, year of death, and individual occupation. RESULTS: Out of 223 occupations, 36 (16%) were identified as having potentially high levels of social contact, and 27 (12%) as having potentially medium levels of social contact. No associations were found between paternal occupational social contact and death during childhood from leukaemia (high social contact: PCMR 94, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 87 to 102; medium social contact: 101, 95 to 106). No associations were found when the data were analysed by leukaemia subtype, age at death, year of death, or individual occupation. CONCLUSION: The findings presented here do not support the suggestion that childhood leukaemia is related to the amount of social contact that fathers experience at work.","['Fear, N T', 'Roman, E', 'Reeves, G', 'Pannett, B']","['Fear NT', 'Roman E', 'Reeves G', 'Pannett B']","['Leukaemia Research Fund, Centre for Clinical Epidemiology, University of Leeds, UK. nicola@lrf.leeds.ac.uk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Occup Environ Med,Occupational and environmental medicine,9422759,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Cause of Death', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'England/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*etiology/mortality', 'Male', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', '*Occupations', 'Paternal Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Risk Factors', 'Wales/epidemiology']",PMC1757766,1999/09/03 00:00,1999/09/03 00:01,['1999/09/03 00:00'],"['1999/09/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/oem.56.7.438 [doi]'],ppublish,Occup Environ Med. 1999 Jul;56(7):438-42. doi: 10.1136/oem.56.7.438.,,,,,['Occup Environ Med. 2000 Feb;57(2):144.

METHODS: The study dataset comprised registrations of cancer other than leukaemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma diagnosed in children aged under 15 in the period 1975-94. These were validated for completeness and accuracy and analysed in two groups: (a) tumours of the central nervous system and (b) other malignant tumours (excluding leukaemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma). Around each nuclear site observed cases (O) were enumerated and expected numbers (E) calculated with adjustment for age, sex, deprivation, and an urban-rural category. Stone's maximum likelihood ratio test (MLR) was used to determine whether there was any evidence of increased risk of these neoplasms among children living within 25 km of one of the nuclear sites investigated. The significance level of each MLR statistic was estimated by simulation. RESULTS: More tumours of the central nervous system were observed than expected within 25 km of Dounreay (O/E = 1.14), Hunterston (1.14), and Rosyth (1.22). These results were based on 2, 26, and 136 observed cases, respectively. The unconditional MLR was significant only for Rosyth (p = 0.006). The conditional application of the MLR test for Rosyth was not significant (p = 0.771). For the group of other malignant neoplasms, the unconditional MLR test was not significant for any of the seven sites. CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence for generally increased risk of either tumours of the central nervous system or other malignant tumours in children living near nuclear sites. The significant excess of tumours of the central nervous system around Rosyth is likely to be due to the high incidence of these tumours in east central Scotland. Further investigations in this area are warranted.","['Sharp, L', 'McKinney, P A', 'Black, R J']","['Sharp L', 'McKinney PA', 'Black RJ']","['Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, University of Aberdeen, Foresterhill, Scotland, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Occup Environ Med,Occupational and environmental medicine,9422759,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Brain Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Central Nervous System Diseases/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Hodgkin Disease/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Likelihood Functions', 'Medical Records, Problem-Oriented', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', '*Power Plants', 'Registries/statistics & numerical data', 'Risk', 'Scotland/epidemiology']",PMC1757739,1999/09/03 00:00,1999/09/03 00:01,['1999/09/03 00:00'],"['1999/09/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/oem.56.5.308 [doi]'],ppublish,Occup Environ Med. 1999 May;56(5):308-14. doi: 10.1136/oem.56.5.308.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are three Pbx family members, which bind DNA as heterodimers with both broadly expressed Meis/Prep1 homeo-domain proteins and specifically expressed Hox homeodomain proteins. These Pbx heterodimers can augment the function of transcriptional activators bound to adjacent elements. In heterodimers, a conserved tryptophan motif in Hox proteins binds a pocket on the surface of the Pbx homeodomain, while Meis/Prep1 proteins bind an N-terminal Pbx domain, raising the possibility that the tryptophan-interaction pocket of the Pbx component of a Pbx-Meis/Prep1 complex is still available to bind trypto-phan motifs of other transcription factors bound to flanking elements. Here, we report that Pbx-Meis1/Prep1 binds DNA cooperatively with heterodimers of E2a and MyoD, myogenin, Mrf-4 or Myf-5. As with Hox proteins, a highly conserved tryptophan motif N-terminal to the DNA-binding domains of each myogenic bHLH family protein is required for cooperative DNA binding with Pbx-Meis1/Prep1. In vivo, MyoD requires this tryptophan motif to evoke chromatin remodeling in the Myogenin promoter and to activate Myogenin transcription. Pbx-Meis/Prep1 complexes, therefore, have the potential to cooperate with the myogenic bHLH proteins in regulating gene transcription.","['Knoepfler, P S', 'Bergstrom, D A', 'Uetsuki, T', 'Dac-Korytko, I', 'Sun, Y H', 'Wright, W E', 'Tapscott, S J', 'Kamps, M P']","['Knoepfler PS', 'Bergstrom DA', 'Uetsuki T', 'Dac-Korytko I', 'Sun YH', 'Wright WE', 'Tapscott SJ', 'Kamps MP']","['Department of Basic Science, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98109, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MEIS1 protein, human)', '0 (Meis1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (Myogenic Regulatory Factors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PKNOX1 protein, human)', '0 (Pknox1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)', '8DUH1N11BX (Tryptophan)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', '*Allosteric Site', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Conserved Sequence/genetics', 'DNA/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Dimerization', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Myogenic Regulatory Factors/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Response Elements/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tryptophan/genetics/metabolism']",PMC148632,1999/09/03 00:00,1999/09/03 00:01,['1999/09/03 00:00'],"['1999/09/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/03 00:00 [entrez]']","['gkc552 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/27.18.3752 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 1999 Sep 15;27(18):3752-61. doi: 10.1093/nar/27.18.3752.,,,"['AG01228/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'AR45113/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA56876/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

We cloned the genes that complemented members of the new groups and identified two previously uncharacterized genes, which we named SAS4 and SAS5. Neither SAS4 nor SAS5 was required for viability. Null alleles of SAS4 and SAS5 restored SIR4-dependent silencing at HMR, establishing that each is a regulator of silencing. Null alleles of SAS4 and SAS5 bypassed the role of the Abf1p binding site of the HMR-E silencer but not the role of the ACS or Rap1p binding site.

Our study shows that a solution containing heparin and vancomycin administered by using an antibiotic-lock technique effectively prevents catheter hub colonization with gram-positive bacteria and subsequent bacteremia during chemotherapy-induced neutropenia in patients with hematologic malignancy.","['Carratala, J', 'Niubo, J', 'Fernandez-Sevilla, A', 'Juve, E', 'Castellsague, X', 'Berlanga, J', 'Linares, J', 'Gudiol, F']","['Carratala J', 'Niubo J', 'Fernandez-Sevilla A', 'Juve E', 'Castellsague X', 'Berlanga J', 'Linares J', 'Gudiol F']","[""Infectious Disease Service, Ciutat Sanitaria i Universitaria de Bellvitge, Institut Catala d'Oncologia, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain. jcarratala@csub.scs.es""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,0315061,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Anticoagulants)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '6Q205EH1VU (Vancomycin)', '9005-49-6 (Heparin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Anticoagulants/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Bacteremia/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Catheterization, Central Venous/*adverse effects', 'Colony Count, Microbial', 'Corynebacterium/isolation & purification', 'Corynebacterium Infections/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field', 'Female', 'Heparin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/complications', 'Staphylococcal Infections/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Staphylococcus epidermidis/*isolation & purification', 'Vancomycin/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use']",PMC89446,1999/09/03 00:00,1999/09/03 00:01,['1999/09/03 00:00'],"['1999/09/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/AAC.43.9.2200 [doi]'],ppublish,Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 1999 Sep;43(9):2200-4. doi: 10.1128/AAC.43.9.2200.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The CCND1 locus, located in 11q13, is amplified and cyclin-D1 protein is over-expressed in a wide range of human solid tumors. In some B-lymphoid malignancies, the t(11;14)(q13;q32) translocation joins the Ig heavy-chain locus to the CCND1 locus and leads to cyclin-D1 over-expression. In this study, a series of 127 patients presenting a B-chronic lymphoproliferative disorder (B-CLPD) was analyzed using a competitive RT-PCR designed to detect cyclin-D1-mRNA over-expression. Cyclin-D1 mRNA was expressed in patients with mantle-cell lymphoma (MCL; 10/10), hairy-cell leukemia (HCL; 3/5), B-chronic lymphoid leukemia (B-CLL; 4/111) and B large-cell lymphoma (BLCL; 1/1). Densitometric analysis of RT-PCR products and Western-blot autoradiograms, in addition to cytogenetic data, indicated that activation of the cyclin-D1 gene occurred independently of the t(11;14)(q13;q32) translocation in patients with HCL. Indeed, a normal-sized protein of 36 kDa exhibiting a level incompatible with gene activation by a translocation mechanism was detected in lymphoid cells with a normal karyotype. Moreover, we found a discrepancy between cyclin-D1 mRNA and protein levels in MCL and B-CLL, which suggested that some regulatory mechanisms acting at a post-transcriptional level persist in tumor cells.","['Sola, B', 'Salaun, V', 'Ballet, J J', 'Troussard, X']","['Sola B', 'Salaun V', 'Ballet JJ', 'Troussard X']","['UPRES-EA 2128, UFR de Medecine, Universite de Caen, Caen, France. sola@medecine.unicaen.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,['136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cyclin D1/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation']",,1999/09/02 00:00,1999/09/02 00:01,['1999/09/02 00:00'],"['1999/09/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/02 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/02 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19991008)83:2<230::AID-IJC14>3.0.CO;2-J [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(19991008)83:2<230::aid-ijc14>3.0.co;2-j [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1999 Oct 8;83(2):230-4. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(19991008)83:2<230::aid-ijc14>3.0.co;2-j.,"['Copyright 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

CNTF has recently been demonstrated to induce increased survival and neuronal differentiation of P19 embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects are still elusive. Here we report that CNTF and LIF, but not interleukin-6, activated signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)-reporter constructs in P19 EC cells. Supershift analysis revealed that the STAT-element binding complex contained the transcription factor Stat3. Binding of Stat3 was inhibited by protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors, but not by the broad serine/threonine protein kinase inhibitor, H7. However, H7 inhibited CNTF-induced Stat3 transactivation. Using a dominant-negative p21ras construct and a specific inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK; PD098059) we demonstrated that CNTF-induced Stat3 transactivation was independent of the p21ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, while CNTF-induced MAPK activation was p21ras- and MEK-dependent. Taken together, our results demonstrate the activation of the p21ras-MAPK and STAT signal transduction pathways in response to CNTF and LIF in P19 EC cells and reveal that there is no modulating crosstalk between these pathways. Furthermore, our data suggest that CNTF- and LIF-induced Stat3 activation in P19 EC cells involves an H7-sensitive p21ras/MAPK- and Ca(2+)-independent kinase.","['van Puijenbroek, A A', 'van der Saag, P T', 'Coffer, P J']","['van Puijenbroek AA', 'van der Saag PT', 'Coffer PJ']","['Hubrecht Laboratory, The Netherlands Institute for Developmental Biology, Uppsalalaan 8, Utrecht, 3584 CT, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Tyrphostins)', '84477-87-2 (1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)']",IM,"['1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Carcinoma, Embryonal', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/pharmacology', 'Neurons/*cytology', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction', 'Staurosporine/pharmacology', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrphostins/pharmacology']",,1999/09/02 00:00,1999/09/02 00:01,['1999/09/02 00:00'],"['1999/09/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/02 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/02 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/excr.1999.4576 [doi]', 'S0014-4827(99)94576-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1999 Sep 15;251(2):465-76. doi: 10.1006/excr.1999.4576.,['Copyright 1999 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we investigated whether the multimeric YIGSR peptide (Ac-Y16) has an antiproliferative effect and/or prevents the metastasis of human pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cells (NALM6) in severe combined immune deficient (SCID) mice. In in vitro studies, Ac-Y16 significantly inhibited leukaemic cell colony formation and the invasion of NALM6 cells in a Matrigel-based assay. The tumour growth and leukaemic infiltration in peripheral tissues were also analysed in SCID mice 9 weeks after NALM6, Matrigel and Ac-Y16 were subcutaneously co-injected. The weight of the subcutaneous tumours was significantly suppressed by Ac-Y16 in a dose-dependent manner. Flow cytometry analysis showed that the leukaemic infiltration was significantly inhibited in all organs with 1.5-2.0 mg of Ac-Y16. Leukaemic infiltrations in the brain were inhibited with 0.5 mg of Ac-Y16, and those in brain and bone marrow were also inhibited with 1.0 mg of Ac-Y16. With Ac-S16, a control-scrambled peptide, the only significant inhibition of the leukaemic infiltration was observed in bone marrow at a much higher dose. These data suggest that the multimeric YIGSR peptide can inhibit the tumour growth and metastasis of leukaemic cells and may be useful as a potential therapeutic reagent for leukaemic infiltrations.","['Yoshida, N', 'Ishii, E', 'Nomizu, M', 'Yamada, Y', 'Mohri, S', 'Kinukawa, N', 'Matsuzaki, A', 'Oshima, K', 'Hara, T', 'Miyazaki, S']","['Yoshida N', 'Ishii E', 'Nomizu M', 'Yamada Y', 'Mohri S', 'Kinukawa N', 'Matsuzaki A', 'Oshima K', 'Hara T', 'Miyazaki S']","['Department of Pediatrics, Saga Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Laminin)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '110590-64-2 (tyrosyl-isoleucyl-glycyl-seryl-arginine)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",IM,"['Actins/genetics', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD19/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Laminin', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness/prevention & control', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neprilysin/analysis', 'Oligopeptides/therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC2363142,1999/09/02 00:00,1999/09/02 00:01,['1999/09/02 00:00'],"['1999/09/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/02 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/02 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bjc.6690618 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1999 Aug;80(12):1898-904. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6690618.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the other hand, the apoptosis, as judged from PARP cleavage, DNA fragmentation and flow cytometric determination of cell population with sub-G1 DNA content, occurred after the cells were incubated in the acidic media for longer than 4 h. The PARP cleavage and DNA fragmentation in the cells exposed to an acidic environment could be effectively suppressed by inhibitors specific for ICE or CPP32, indicating that activation of these caspases is an essential step in acidic stress-induced apoptosis. It has been known that Bax is involved in the activation of caspases. Taken together, it appears that acidic stress first up-regulates Bax protein thereby activating caspases followed by PARP cleavage and DNA fragmentation. The observation that inhibition of either ICE or CPP32 could suppress acidic stress-induced apoptosis suggested that ICE activates pro-CPP32, which then cleaves PARP. Flow cytometric analysis indicated that acidic stress-induced apoptosis occurs mainly in G1 cells. The finding in the present study demonstrated that acidic intra-tumour environment may markedly perturb the tumour cell proliferation and tumour growth.","['Park, H J', 'Lyons, J C', 'Ohtsubo, T', 'Song, C W']","['Park HJ', 'Lyons JC', 'Ohtsubo T', 'Song CW']","['University of Minnesota Medical School, Department of Therapeutic Radiology--Radiation Oncology, Minneapolis 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Enzyme Precursors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.22.36 (Caspase 1)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Caspase 1/metabolism', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Culture Media', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Enzyme Precursors/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HL-60 Cells/*cytology/*physiology', 'Humans', '*Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Kinetics', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",PMC2363148,1999/09/02 00:00,1999/09/02 00:01,['1999/09/02 00:00'],"['1999/09/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/02 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/02 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bjc.6690617 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1999 Aug;80(12):1892-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6690617.,,,['CA13353/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

After selecting an energy healer based on his ability to influence this model, we assessed the effects of energy treatment compared to cells left at ambient temperature and to a control treatment consisting of a medical student mimicking the healer. A chi-square test comparing a medical student's and the practitioner's ability to inhibit tumor cell growth by 15% associates our practitioner with inhibition of tumor cell proliferation (p = 0.02). We also found that the magnitude of change was too close to the assay's intrinsic margin of error, thus making our quantitative data difficult to interpret. Although energy healing appears to influence several indices of growth in in vitro tumor cell proliferation, these assays are limited in their ability to define and prove the existence of this phenomenon.

Lymphoma Study Group.",340-8,"BACKGROUND: Patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and those with lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL) have overlapping clinical and immunophenotypic features and they have been treated with the same or very similar chemotherapy regimens. The goal of this multi-institutional phase II trial was to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of a short-term, six-drug chemotherapy regimen for adult patients with untreated ALL or LBL. METHODS: Forty-six eligible patients, 41 with ALL and five with LBL, were treated with a short-term (planned total therapy duration; 36-38 weeks), simplified chemotherapy program; two courses of VEPA-L (vincristine, cyclophosphamide, prednisolone, doxorubicin, I-asparaginase plus intrathecal methotrexate and prednisolone) followed by four courses of M-VEPA (methotrexate plus VEPA), without the traditional maintenance therapy using daily 6-mercaptopurine and weekly methotrexate. RESULTS: Thirty-six (78%; 95% confidence interval 64-89%) of the 46 eligible patients achieved complete remission (CR). Among the 36 patients who achieved CR, four (11%) died of treatment complications, 26 (72%) relapsed and six (17%) remain alive in continuous CR. The median survival for all 46 eligible patients is 14 months and the median disease-free survival (DFS) for the 36 patients who achieved CR is 11 months. The estimate of the proportion of survival at 7 years of all 46 eligible patients is 15% at a median follow-up time of 96 months and that of DFS of the 36 patients achieving CR is 17% at a median follow-up time of 93 months. Subgroup analysis showed that an elevated serum C-reactive protein (CRP) level, age of 30 years or older, the presence of B-symptom and T-cell phenotype were likely to be associated with shortened survival. Although the observed CR rate (78%) is within the range of satisfaction, the long-term survival rate (15%) is inferior to those of published programs incorporating maintenance therapy. CONCLUSIONS: A fraction of adult patients with ALL or LBL are curable with a short-term, six-drug chemotherapy regimen. However, this simplified therapy of shorter duration cannot be recommended.","['Kobayashi, T', 'Tobinai, K', 'Shimoyama, M', 'Mikuni, C', 'Konda, S', 'Kozuru, M', 'Araki, K', 'Sai, T', 'Fukuhara, S', 'Matsumoto, M', 'Aoki, I', 'Deura, K', 'Oyama, A', 'Hotta, T', 'Abe, T', 'Toki, H', 'Nagai, M', 'Fukuda, H', 'Niimi, M', 'Yamaguchi, N', 'Tajima, K', 'Shirakawa, S']","['Kobayashi T', 'Tobinai K', 'Shimoyama M', 'Mikuni C', 'Konda S', 'Kozuru M', 'Araki K', 'Sai T', 'Fukuhara S', 'Matsumoto M', 'Aoki I', 'Deura K', 'Oyama A', 'Hotta T', 'Abe T', 'Toki H', 'Nagai M', 'Fukuda H', 'Niimi M', 'Yamaguchi N', 'Tajima K', 'Shirakawa S']","['Mie University School of Medicine, Tsu, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Jpn J Clin Oncol,Japanese journal of clinical oncology,0313225,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'VEPA-L protocol', 'VEPA-M protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Prednisolone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",,1999/09/02 00:00,1999/09/02 00:01,['1999/09/02 00:00'],"['1999/09/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/02 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/02 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jjco/29.7.340 [doi]'],ppublish,Jpn J Clin Oncol. 1999 Jul;29(7):340-8. doi: 10.1093/jjco/29.7.340.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the case of erythroid differentiation of murine erythroleukemia cells (Friend cells) it has been previously shown that PLC beta 1, which is the major nuclear PLC, undergoes down-regulation upon treatment with DMSO or tiazofurin which act as differentiative agents. On the contrary, i.e., during IGF-I induced mitogenesis, it has been shown that PLC beta 1 is rapidly activated and this event is essential for the onset of DNA synthesis. Even though its key role in cell growth has been shown, both the mechanism by which nuclear PLC beta 1 is activated and the direct relationship with erythroid differentiation are still unknown. We have addressed the question if PLC beta 1 expression and activity in the nucleus are directly related or not to the establishment of the differentiated state and we have checked the two main ways of activation, i.e., via G-protein or via phosphorylation, in order to establish whether nuclear PLC beta 1 is regulated the same way as the one at the plasma membrane or not. The data reported here show that nuclear PLC beta 1 is responsible for a continuous recycling of Friend cells, acting as a negative regulator of differentiation and that its activation is dependent on the phosphorylation state.","['Cocco, L', 'Capitani, S', 'Barnabei, O', 'Gilmour, R S', 'Rhee, S G', 'Manzoli, F A']","['Cocco L', 'Capitani S', 'Barnabei O', 'Gilmour RS', 'Rhee SG', 'Manzoli FA']","['Institute of Anatomy, University of Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Adv Enzyme Regul,Advances in enzyme regulation,0044263,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Mitogens)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', '0 (RNA, Antisense)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.1.4.11 (Phospholipase C beta)', 'EC 3.1.4.11 (Plcb1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Erythropoiesis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/*pharmacology', 'Isoenzymes/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mitogens/pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositols/*metabolism', 'Phospholipase C beta', 'RNA, Antisense/genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Type C Phospholipases/genetics/*metabolism']",,1999/09/02 00:00,1999/09/02 00:01,['1999/09/02 00:00'],"['1999/09/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/02 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/02 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/s0065-2571(98)00025-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Enzyme Regul. 1999;39:287-97. doi: 10.1016/s0065-2571(98)00025-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The major mRNA species in human cells encodes the mitochondrial isoform but alternate translation initiation at a downstream in-frame ATG also generates the cytosolic isoform. Cytosolic FPGS may also be generated by use of alternate transcription initiation start sites 3' to the start ATG of the mitochondrial FPGS. Three additional human FPGS mRNAs differing in exon 1 have been identified. One of these is a major species in HEP-G2 cells and other tissue culture cells, and can encode a protein lacking the first 8 amino acids of cytosolic FPGS. A protein of the predicted size is observed in coupled transcription/translation systems. However, expression of this protein in E. coli does not generate an active enzyme. Mutagenesis studies indicate that Tyr-3 of the missing N terminal residues is required for enzyme activity. The major cellular folate pools are in the cytosol and mitochondria and FPGS activity is normally distributed in both compartments. Mitochondrial FPGS activity is required for mitochondrial folate accumulation, and cells lacking this isozyme are auxotrophic for glycine. Overexpression of cytosolic FPGS does not complement the lack of mitochondrial activity. Cells expressing FPGS activity solely in the mitochondria are glycine prototrophs, but also possess cytosolic folylpolyglutamates and are prototrophic for thymidine and purines, products of cytosolic one carbon metabolism. Although cytosolic folylpolyglutamates cannot enter the mitochondrion, mitochondrial folylpolyglutamates are released intact into the cytosolic compartment. Cellular accumulation of some antifolates and their cytotoxic efficacy is highly responsive to the level of FPGS activity. Polyglutamylation of methotrexate (MTX) has little affect on its affinity for dihydrofolate reductase, its target enzyme, but does affect the cellular accumulation of the drug. The sensitivity of model cells, expressing a range of FPGS activities similar to that observed in leukemia blasts, to MTX varied over four orders of magnitude. MTX toxicity was dependent on cytosolic FPGS activity as this drug does not enter the mitochondria, and cells expressing very high levels of FPGS solely in the mitochondria were resistant to MTX. The cytotoxic efficacy of other folate antagonists that are transported into the mitochondria was enhanced by mitochondrial FPGS activity, even when their loci of inhibition was a cytosolic enzyme. Mitochondrial metabolism of these drugs increased cytosolic drug levels. Compartmentalization of antifolate metabolism has to be considered in evaluating mechanisms for increased drug cytotoxicity and for the development of acquired resistance to these agents.","['Qi, H', 'Atkinson, I', 'Xiao, S', 'Choi, Y J', 'Tobimatsu, T', 'Shane, B']","['Qi H', 'Atkinson I', 'Xiao S', 'Choi YJ', 'Tobimatsu T', 'Shane B']","['Department of Nutritional Sciences, University of California, Berkeley 94720-3104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Adv Enzyme Regul,Advances in enzyme regulation,0044263,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (Peptide Synthases)', 'EC 6.3.2.17 (folylpolyglutamate synthetase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'CHO Cells', 'Cricetinae', 'Cytosol/enzymology', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Escherichia coli/genetics', 'Folic Acid/metabolism', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Isoenzymes/genetics/*metabolism', 'Methotrexate/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Mitochondria/enzymology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptide Synthases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transfection']",,1999/09/02 00:00,1999/09/02 00:01,['1999/09/02 00:00'],"['1999/09/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/02 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/02 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/s0065-2571(98)00023-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Enzyme Regul. 1999;39:263-73. doi: 10.1016/s0065-2571(98)00023-5.,,,"['CA41991/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK42033/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

Human pancreatic adenocarcinoma AsPC-1 cells were found to be resistant to apoptosis. So, we screened microbial culture filtrates and synthetic chemicals for their ability to induce apoptosis in AsPC-1 cells. Polyoxypeptin A was isolated from a Streptomyces culture broth as a potent inducer of apoptosis. Its cyclic hexadepsipeptide structure contains a simple but hitherto unreported amino acid, (2S,3R)-3-hydroxy-3-methylproline. Polyoxypeptin A induced early cell death, apoptotic morphology, and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation in AsPC-1 cells at low concentrations. Polyoxypeptin A can induce caspase 3 activation in human T cell leukemia Jurkat cells but not in AsPC-1 cells. The mechanism of apoptosis in AsPC-1 cells has not been elucidated yet. Less toxic derivatives of polyoxypeptin A are being prepared. A macrocyclic lactam called BE-14106 was also isolated from Streptomyces as an inducer of apoptosis in AsPC-1 cells. Histidine-pyridine-histidine-3 (HPH-3) is an oxygen-activating ligand derived from the structure of bleomycin, and it also induced apoptosis in AsPC-1 cells. Induction of apoptosis by HPH-3 was inhibited by zinc and copper ions, indicating that chelation with ferrous ion is responsible for induction of apoptosis, as is chelation by bleomycin to cleave DNA. Bleomycin A2 and its portion having no DNA-binding region, glycopeptide-3(GP-3), did not induce apoptosis in AsPC-1 cells.

RR is critical for the generation of the cytosine, adenine, and guanine deoxyribonucleotide 5'-triphosphate building blocks of DNA, which are present in cells as exceedingly small intracellular pools. Therefore, interference with the function of RR might well result in an agent with significant antineoplastic activity, particularly against rapidly proliferating tumor cells. HUr is the only inhibitor of RR in clinical usage; this agent, however, is a relatively poor inhibitor of the enzyme and has a short serum half-life. Consequently, HUr is a relatively weak anticancer agent.

In this study, the contribution of the nucleoside transport system to the transport of other anthracyclines, doxorubicin (DOX), daunorubicin (DNR) and idarubicin (IDA), in HL60 cells and MNCs was investigated. The experiments were performed after both types of cells had been pretreated with a metabolic inhibitor, 2,4-dinitrophenol, to deplete cellular ATP. The DOX uptake by HL60 cells was partially inhibited by inhibitors of equilibrative nucleoside transporters. In HL60 cells, moreover, the uptake of DOX depended on an inwardly directed Na(+)-gradient, and was inhibited by concentrative nucleoside transporters, but there was no change in the DNR or IDA uptake under any of these conditions. On the other hand, the uptake of the three drugs by MNCs was not affected by any inhibitors of the nucleoside transporters, and there was no dependence of the uptake on an Na(+)-gradient. These results suggested that DOX, but not DNR or IDA, was partially transported in HL60 cells via the nucleoside transport system, whereas in MNCs the system did not contribute to the uptake of any of these three drugs. Thus, nucleoside transport systems contributing to the transport of anthracyclines may be different among different derivatives and cell types.","['Nagasawa, K', 'Fumihara, T', 'Ohnishi, N', 'Yokoyama, T']","['Nagasawa K', 'Fumihara T', 'Ohnishi N', 'Yokoyama T']","['Department of Hospital Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kyoto Pharmaceutical University. nagasawa@mb.kyoto-phu.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Nucleoside Transport Proteins)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*metabolism', 'Biological Transport', 'Carrier Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Daunorubicin/metabolism', 'Doxorubicin/*metabolism', 'Drug Interactions', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/metabolism', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Nucleoside Transport Proteins', 'Sodium/metabolism']",PMC5926127,1999/09/02 00:00,1999/09/02 00:01,['1999/09/02 00:00'],"['1999/09/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/02 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/02 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0910505099801495 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.1999.tb00815.x [doi]']",ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 1999 Jul;90(7):781-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.1999.tb00815.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tamoxifen and its derivatives, clomiphene and nafoxidine, caused reduction of cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. These drugs showed differences in their potency following four days incubation, with nafoxidine being the most efficient inhibitor and tamoxifen the least active. Apoptosis was induced as assessed by the DNA ladder pattern and formation of pre G0/G1 population as detected by flow cytometry analysis of DNA. The effect of these drugs was abrogated by antioxidants: alpha-tocopherol was most effective in antagonizing the drugs' effect. N-acetyl L-cysteine reversed mainly the decrease in cell viability caused by the drugs, but was less active on induction of apoptosis. GF109203X, a protein kinase inhibitor, attenuated apoptosis induced by clomiphene in MOLT3 cells.

We investigated the expression of FasL, Fas and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor 1 (TNF-R1, CD120a) on cultured human lymphocytes and leukemic T and B cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Lymphocytes from six healthy individuals, from four patients with chronic lymphocytic T or B cell leukaemia, and leukemic Molt-4 cells were incubated with the apoptosis- inducing mistletoe lectins (ML I and ML III). RESULTS: Incubation of differentiated lymphocytes with the ML resulted in a significant upregulation of FasL in the surviving CD4+ T helper cells, CD8+ cells and CD19+ B cells. Similarly, the TNF receptor expression increased, while the Fas molecule decreased. In contrast, FasL was not induced in leukemic cells. CONCLUSIONS: Apart from a direct induction of apoptosis in response to an inhibition of protein synthesis by the enzymic ML A chain, ML treatment may indirectly induce apoptosis in Fas+ tumour cells through activated FasL+ lymphocytes.","['Bussing, A', 'Stein, G M', 'Pfuller, U', 'Schietzel, M']","['Bussing A', 'Stein GM', 'Pfuller U', 'Schietzel M']","['Department of Applied Immunology, University Witten/Herdecke, Communal Hospital, Germany.

DU-145 cells were actively resistant to compounds (cmpd) with all of these modifications, but when we removed C-19 (E, 1,25-Dihydroxy-23E-ene-26,27-hexafluoro-19-nor-20-cyclopropy l- cholecalciferol) an analog resulted that was inhibitory against all three prostate cell lines, breast and HL-60 cell lines. Further analysis showed that pulse exposure (3 days, 10(-7) M) to this analog was enough to inhibit clonal growth of PC-3 cell by 50%. Furthermore, cmpd E increased the number of PC-3 cells in G1 and decreased the number in S phase. 1,25(OH)2D3 mediates its biological activities through specific binding to the vitamin D3 receptor (VDR) and subsequent association with vitamin D3 response elements (VDRE) in genes modulated by 1,25(OH)2D3. Several novel vitamin D3 cmpds have recently been identified which have 5- to 1000-fold greater abilities to induce differentiation and to inhibit proliferation of prostate cancer, breast cancer and HL-60 leukemic blast cells as compared to the parental 1,25(OH)2D3. To clarify the mechanism by which nine of these vitamin D3 analogs mediate their remarkably potent biological activities, we have investigated their abilities in PC-3 prostate cancer cells to transactivate a chroramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) reporter gene containing a VDRE from the human osteocalcin gene attached to a thymidine kinase minimal promoter. Dose-response studies of Cmpd E showed that in serumless culture conditions, transactivation of the VDRE-CAT was stronger than cmpd J [1,25(OH)2D3]. Then, we investigated the effects of vitamin D3 cmpd J in mice. Our data showed the growth inhibitory action of the vitamin D3 cmpd E in prostate cancer cell line (PC-3) was stastically superior to the non-treatment group in terms of tumor size and tumor weight in mice. In summary, this is the first report of a potent series of 20-cyclopropyl-cholecalciferol vitamin D3 analogs with the ability to inhibit proliferation of LNCaP, PC-3, DU-145, MCF-7 and HL-60 cell lines. These cmpds may mediate their potent anti-proliferative activities through a cell cycle arrest pathway.","['Koike, M', 'Koshizuka, K', 'Kawabata, H', 'Yang, R', 'Taub, H E', 'Said, J', 'Uskokovic, M', 'Tsuruoka, N', 'Koeffler, H P']","['Koike M', 'Koshizuka K', 'Kawabata H', 'Yang R', 'Taub HE', 'Said J', 'Uskokovic M', 'Tsuruoka N', 'Koeffler HP']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, UCLA School of Medicine, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cdkn1a protein, mouse)', '0 (Cdkn1b protein, mouse)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', '1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Breast Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cholecalciferol/analogs & derivatives/chemistry/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Cyclins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Growth Inhibitors/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hypercalcemia/chemically induced/prevention & control', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Molecular Structure', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,1999/09/02 00:00,1999/09/02 00:01,['1999/09/02 00:00'],"['1999/09/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/02 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/02 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1999 May-Jun;19(3A):1689-97.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ISID and MISID exhibited 100- to 500-fold higher cytotoxicity as compared to HU against cell lines sensitive (CEM/0) or resistant to ara-C (CEM/ara-C/7A; CEM/dCk[-]). Both MISID and ISID showed significant inhibitory activity of ribonucleotide reductase (RR). Treatment of CEM/0 cells with 10 microM ISID showed a linear decrease in all the dNTPs leading to a complete depletion by 4 hours with no recovery of enzymatic activity of RR up to 48 hours in the presence of the drug, suggesting an irreversible inhibition of this enzyme. However, 10 microM MISID caused a significant time dependent, but reversible inhibition of RR in a whole cell assay in CEM/0 cells. Pretreatment of CEM/0 cells with 10 microM MISID for 1 hour increased cellular ara-CTP concentrations approximately 2-fold as compared to untreated controls. However, a reduction in intracellular ara-CTP concentration was observed following a commensurate depletion of ATP in these cells after 4 hrs of ISID pretreatment. Similarly, the ara-CTP concentration was augmented by 1.6-fold following pretreatment of CEM/0 cells with 10 microM MISID for 4 hours. Significant apoptotic cell death was detected in CEM/0 cells treated with ara-C, ISID or MISID alone or in combination. Ara-C treatment induced HMW (high molecular weight) DNA fragmentation at earlier times which subsequently led to oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation by 48 hrs. The sequential treatment of CEM/0 cells with MISID followed by ara-C resulted in increased DNA fragmentation in the 2.0 to 4.0 Kb range in comparison to those cells treated with either ara-C or MISID alone. The increased apoptotic cell death explained the synergistic cytotoxicity of the combination of ara-C and MISID against CEM/0 cells observed earlier. We conclude that the inhibition of RR by these agents induces leukemic cell apoptosis, a mechanism which is further potentiated when these RR inhibitors are combined with ara-C. Since new compounds do not require activation, as do other clinically useful RR inhibitors, further studies for their potential use against leukemias and solid tumors are warranted.","['Nandy, P', 'Lien, E J', 'Avramis, V I']","['Nandy P', 'Lien EJ', 'Avramis VI']","['Department of Pediatrics, USC School of Medicine, Childrens Hospital Los Angeles 90027, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (2-hydroxy-1(H)-isoindole-1,3-dione)', '0 (6-methyl-2-isopropylsulfonyloxy-1(H)-isoindole-1,3-dione)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Deoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Isoindoles)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '13191-15-6 (Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 1.17.4.- (Ribonucleotide Reductases)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate/analysis', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Deoxyribonucleotides/metabolism', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/pharmacology', 'Indoles/*pharmacology', 'Isoindoles', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Ribonucleotide Reductases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/09/02 00:00,1999/09/02 00:01,['1999/09/02 00:00'],"['1999/09/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/02 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/02 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1999 May-Jun;19(3A):1625-33.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model of doxorubicin (DOX) encapsulated into liposomes has been developed for mice and each parameter required for simulations was obtained in the peritoneally inoculated P388 leukemia model in mice. PK parameters, which describe the dispositions of free and liposomally encapsulated DOX, were obtained by kinetic analysis of experimental data in this study, as well as from literature. PD parameters, which describe the growth and death rate of cancer cells in vivo, were also determined. The PK/PD model developed in this study is capable of simulating the time course of the number of cancer cells quantitatively and evaluating the significance of each parameter on the carrier system for DOX. Simulations based on the PK/PD model predict the optimum rate of drug release from long circulating liposomes as 0.06 h(-1) for maximum anticancer effect. Thus, this simulation system provides useful information relative to the optimization of drug carriers for DOX.","['Tsuchihashi, M', 'Harashima, H', 'Kiwada, H']","['Tsuchihashi M', 'Harashima H', 'Kiwada H']","['Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, The University of Tokushima, 1-78-1 Shomachi, Tokushima City, Tokushima, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Control Release,Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,8607908,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Liposomes)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Drug Carriers', 'Leukemia P388/metabolism', 'Liposomes', 'Male', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Peritoneal Neoplasms/metabolism']",,1999/09/02 00:00,1999/09/02 00:01,['1999/09/02 00:00'],"['1999/09/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/02 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/02 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0168-3659(99)00103-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s0168-3659(99)00103-0 [doi]']",ppublish,J Control Release. 1999 Aug 27;61(1-2):9-19. doi: 10.1016/s0168-3659(99)00103-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine its role in replication, we introduced a series of deletion and alanine-scanning substitution mutations throughout the p12 coding region of a proviral DNA, and characterized the phenotypes of the resulting mutant viruses. Complete deletion of p12 and mutations affecting the PPPY motif caused substantial reduction in the yield of virions and a modest reduction in Gag processing. Proteolytic cleavage of the R-peptide from the cytoplasmic tail of the envelope protein TM was abolished in these mutants, suggesting that the PPPY motif is crucial for the viral protease to access the TM tail. The resulting virions were non-infectious, and unable to initiate DNA synthesis in infected cells. Mutants with alterations in both the N- and C-terminal portions of p12 exhibited a distinct phenotype. The production of virions and processing of Gag, Pol and Env precursors were normal. The viruses were able to direct synthesis of linear viral DNA, but there was almost no detectable circular DNAs or LTR-LTR junction.

Molecular consequences of 11q23 translocations are the formation of chimeric genes, all of them involving the MLL (mixed-lineage leukemia) gene. To evaluate the usefulness of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in detecting MLL rearrangements in AML, we analyzed 181 patients with an MLL-specific probe. Among them, we detected three patients with multiple FISH signals, reflecting genomic amplification of this chromosomal region. Extra copies of MLL have been reported previously in four patients, but did not correspond to a true gene amplification.

The resistance of Klebsiella infection in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-hyporesponsive mice is unclear. Female C3H/HeJ and C3H/HeN mice, 6-8 weeks old, were intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected with K. pneumoniae. The results showed that C3H/HeJ mice were 24 times more susceptible [lethal dose 50% (LD50) 250 colony-forming units] than C3H/HeN mice to K. pneumoniae infection. C3H/HeJ mice, uninfected or infected with K. pneumoniae, had higher liver interleukin (IL)-10 levels and IL-10 mRNA levels than C3H/HeN mice. Previously, pretreatment with IL-1beta and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) protected C3H/HeJ mice from lethal bacterial infection. Therefore the effects of pretreatment with IL-1beta and TNF-alpha or antimurine IL-10 antibody i.p. 1 hr before this infection in both strains of C3H mice were examined. Pretreatment with TNF-alpha or anti-IL-10 antibody enhanced the survival of both strains of mice. TNF-alpha, in combination with IL-1beta, enhanced the survival and bacterial clearance better than single pretreatment in C3H/HeJ mice. Anti-IL-10 antibody increased bacterial clearance and significantly reduced liver cytokine mRNA levels in C3H/HeJ mice more than it did in the controls during infection.

A distinctive property of IGFBP-6 is its preferential affinity for IGF-II relative to IGF-I. In order to obtain more insight into the clinical significance and regulation of circulating levels of IGFBP-6 we developed a specific radioimmunoassay (RIA) for this protein. DESIGN AND PATIENTS: Selected human biological fluids and plasma from 847 normal subjects were analysed. In addition, plasma samples from patients with different disorders (i.e. GH-deficiency, acromegaly, cancer, corticosteroid-treated children suffering from different kinds of severe illness and chronic renal failure) were investigated. MEASUREMENTS: The IGFBP-6 assay is competitive, utilizing a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against a synthetic peptide comprising amino acids 90-118 of the hIGFBP-6 sequence and an additional tyrosine residue. It is calibrated against recombinant human (rh)IGFBP-6. The 125I tracer is prepared by iodination of the synthetic peptide. There is no significant cross-reactivity with other IGFBPs and no interference with the IGFs. RESULTS: Extensive normative range values for IGFBP-6 were determined using 847 plasma samples from normal males and females, ranging from 0 to 75 years of age. IGFBP-6 levels increased gradually (about two-fold) with age. In childhood the plasma levels of IGFBP-6 in females tended to be slightly higher than those for males. For the adult population the reverse was observed. Overall, the mean +/- SD value for males was higher than that for females (149 +/- 57 vs. 139 +/- 45 micrograms/l, P < 0.004). GH status did not appear to influence IGFBP-6 level since normal levels were found for both untreated acromegalic patients and GH-deficient subjects. GH treatment of the latter group of patients did not alter IGFBP-6 in plasma. Pharmacological doses of glucocorticosteroids affected circulating IGFBP-6 levels only slightly. IGFBP-6 levels in plasma samples derived both from children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and from patients with various types of solid neoplasms were generally within the normal range. In contrast, plasma samples from four of six patients with non-islet cell tumour induced hypoglycaemia (NICTH) showed elevated concentrations of IGFBP-6 (SDS > 2.9). An excess of IGFBP-6 was also found in plasma of both dialysed and non-dialysed prepubertal growth retarded children with chronic renal failure (CRF) (mean SDS: 23.0 and 9.3, respectively). IGFBP-6 levels were inversely correlated with glomerular filtration rate. In a group of CRF patients who underwent renal transplantation circulating IGFBP-6 levels were markedly lower (mean SDS: 4.6). The presence of IGFBP-6 could also be demonstrated in several other human biological fluids. Low amounts were detected in saliva (3-12 micrograms/l) and breast milk (6-45 micrograms/l) while the levels in amniotic fluid and follicular fluid were comparable with those determined in normal plasma. The IGFBP-6 content of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) ranged between 25 and 87 micrograms/l, which is rather high in relation to the relatively low concentration of total protein in this body fluid. CONCLUSIONS: Measurements of IGFBP-6 have been shown so far to be of relatively minor clinical relevance. The exceptions are chronic renal failure patients and subjects with large tumours and non-islet cell tumour induced hypoglycaemia who may exhibit elevated circulating levels of this IGFBP. The physiological significance of this observation remains to be elucidated. The possibility of quantifying IGFBP-6 by specific RIA will facilitate further in vitro and in vivo studies of its regulation and function in man.","['Van Doorn, J', 'Ringeling, A M', 'Shmueli, S S', 'Kuijpers, M C', 'Hokken-Koelega, A C', 'van Buul-Offers, S C', 'Jansen, M']","['Van Doorn J', 'Ringeling AM', 'Shmueli SS', 'Kuijpers MC', 'Hokken-Koelega AC', 'van Buul-Offers SC', 'Jansen M']","[""Department of Paediatrics, Wilhelmina Children's Hospital/Utrecht University, The Netherlands.

Serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies were the main tool for following patients' response and activity of the fungal lesions in conjunction with clinical and laboratory parameters. Treatment with amphotericin B was continued until resolution of all clinical symptoms and signs attributable to HSC, obtaining negative blood cultures and the appearance of at least healed lesions on MRI. Amphotericin B was discontinued in four patients because of severe nephrotoxicity (two patients), or continuous fever and persistent fungal lesions on MRI (two patients). Amphotericin B lipid complex (ABELCET) was successfully used as salvage therapy for these refractory patients. Four patients died with evidence of HSC despite treatment and supportive measures. The response rate for treatment of HSC was 82%. The mean total dose of amphotericin B including empirical treatment was 4 g and the median duration of treatment for responding patients was 112 d.

High levels of telomerase activity have been demonstrated in almost all solid tumours; however, little data is available concerning its expression in chronic B-cell neoplasms. By using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction-based method we quantified telomerase activity in normal B lymphocytes, and in various B-cell malignancies, including chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and hairy cell leukaemia (HCL). Compared to normal B cells, which expressed very low levels of telomerase activity, malignant cells from most of the patients showed a significant increase in telomerase activity, with highest values observed in HCL samples. Moreover, among the CLL and HCL cases, significantly higher levels of telomerase activity were found in patients with progressive disease at 1 year follow-up versus patients with stable disease.

Following induction chemotherapy the number of BCR-ABL transcripts was reduced by a maximum of 2-3 logs. In most patients, additional chemotherapy did not lead to further reduction of BCR-ABL mRNA. In two patients, conventional chemotherapy plus autologous BMT in complete haematological remission resulted in a total reduction of the transcript level of more than 3 logs. In two other patients, allogeneic BMT caused a transient reduction of the BCR-ABL transcripts below the detection level of our method (<1 blast cell in 105 normal cells) for a period of 7 and 11 months, respectively. The achievement of PCR negativity did not guarantee sustained remission. Both patients relapsed and BCR-ABL transcript levels rose by more than 1 log prior to frank relapse.

In conclusion, the results indicate that lrp expression is associated with inferior response to chemotherapy in AML and that lrp expression increases after exposure to mitoxantrone.","['Xu, D', 'Arestrom, I', 'Virtala, R', 'Pisa, P', 'Peterson, C', 'Gruber, A']","['Xu D', 'Arestrom I', 'Virtala R', 'Pisa P', 'Peterson C', 'Gruber A']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Haematology, Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Vault Ribonucleoprotein Particles)', '0 (major vault protein)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/*therapeutic use', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vault Ribonucleoprotein Particles/*metabolism']",,1999/09/01 00:00,1999/09/01 00:01,['1999/09/01 00:00'],"['1999/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['bjh1611 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.1999.01611.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1999 Sep;106(3):627-33. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1999.01611.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we examined the capacity of malignant myeloid progenitor cells of patients in the chronic phase of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) to acquire characteristics of activated dendritic cells (DCs) after intracellular calcium mobilization, thereby bypassing a need for third-party antigen-presenting cells. Treatment of purified CD33(+) CML cells from 15 patients with calcium ionophore (CI) consistently resulted in de novo expression of the costimulatory molecules CD80 (B7.1) and CD86 (B7.2), CD40 and the DC-specific activation marker CD83, as well as marked up-regulation of MHC class I and II molecules and the adhesion molecule CD54. Most of these changes occurred within 24 hr of treatment. Morphologically, CI-treated CML cells developed long dendritic projections similar to those seen in mature DCs. Functionally, CI-treated CML cells provided stimulation of allogeneic T lymphocytes 10- to 20-fold that of untreated CML cells or untreated monocytes. Fluorescent in situ hybridization of CI-activated CML cells confirmed their leukemic origin by displaying the typical bcr/abl fusion signal. No difference in bcr/abl translocation percentages between untreated and CI-treated CML nuclei was observed. These observations indicate that calcium mobilization may constitute a valuable approach for rapidly and reliably generating CML-derived DCs for immunotherapy of CML.","['Engels, F H', 'Koski, G K', 'Bedrosian, I', 'Xu, S', 'Luger, S', 'Nowell, P C', 'Cohen, P A', 'Czerniecki, B J']","['Engels FH', 'Koski GK', 'Bedrosian I', 'Xu S', 'Luger S', 'Nowell PC', 'Cohen PA', 'Czerniecki BJ']","['Department of Surgery, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/biosynthesis/*blood', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/blood', 'Calcium/*physiology', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/immunology', 'Dendritic Cells/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/genetics/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",PMC17888,1999/09/01 00:00,1999/09/01 00:01,['1999/09/01 00:00'],"['1999/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.96.18.10332 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1999 Aug 31;96(18):10332-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.96.18.10332.,,,['CA-42232/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

It was recently demonstrated that EKLF is also required for the activity of the beta-globin locus control region (LCR) 5'HS3. Some evidence suggests that the LCR and the beta-globin promoter interact in adult erythroid cells, and the network of protein-protein interactions that exists between these two elements may regulate how EKLF is recruited to the LCR. In this report, we use the PIN*POINT assay to study the role of the promoter on the recruitment of EKLF to 5'HS2 and 5'HS3 of the LCR. We find that recruitment of EKLF to 5'HS2 requires the TATA box, but recruitment to 5'HS3 depends on the CACCC and TATA boxes of the beta-globin promoter. Furthermore, recruitment of EKLF to 5'HS3 only occurred in beta-globin-expressing murine erythroid leukemia cells, whereas recruitment of EKLF to 5'HS2 occurred in both gamma-globin-expressing K562 cells and murine erythroid leukemia cells. Unlike EKLF, Sp1, which also binds to CACCC boxes, is not recruited to 5'HS3. We have also examined how one 5'HS affects the recruitment of EKLF to another 5'HS. We have found that the recruitment of EKLF to 5'HS3 depends on the presence of 5'HS2 in cis, but the recruitment to 5'HS2 does not depend on 5'HS3. Based on these results, we present a model that illustrates how EKLF may be recruited to the beta-globin locus.","['Lee, J S', 'Lee, C H', 'Chung, J H']","['Lee JS', 'Lee CH', 'Chung JH']","['Molecular Hematology Branch, National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Codon)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (erythroid Kruppel-like factor)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Codon', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Erythrocytes/*metabolism', 'Globins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Introns', 'K562 Cells', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors', 'Leukemia, Experimental', '*Locus Control Region', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis', 'TATA Box', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Zinc Fingers']",PMC17840,1999/09/01 00:00,1999/09/01 00:01,['1999/09/01 00:00'],"['1999/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.96.18.10051 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1999 Aug 31;96(18):10051-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.96.18.10051.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Positive swab tests confirmed 47% of ALL cases with any infection and 46% of controls. This is consistent with the hypothesis that early exposure to infections may reduce the risk of childhood ALL. Asphyxia at birth significantly increased the risk of leukaemia, which was accounted for by ALL.

However, the clinical potential of dipyridamole has not been realized because of the avid binding of the drug to the plasma protein alpha1-acid glycoprotein (AGP). Dipyridamole analogues that retain potent nucleoside transport inhibitory activity in the presence of AGP are described and their ability to enhance the growth inhibitory and cytotoxic effects of thymidylate synthase (TS) inhibitors has been evaluated. Three dipyridamole analogues (NU3026, NU3059 and NU3060) were shown to enhance the growth inhibitory activity of the TS inhibitor CB3717 and block thymidine rescue in L1210 cells. The extent of potentiation at a fixed analogue concentration (10 microM) was related to the potency of inhibition of thymidine uptake. A further analogue, NU3076, was identified, which was more potent than dipyridamole with a Ki value for inhibition of thymidine uptake of 0.1 microM compared to 0.28 microM for dipyridamole. In marked contrast to dipyridamole, inhibition of thymidine uptake by NU3076 was not significantly affected by the presence of AGP (5 mg ml(-1)). NU3076 and dipyridamole produced equivalent potentiation of the cytotoxicity of the non-classical antifolate TS inhibitor, nolatrexed, in L1210 cells with both compounds significantly reducing the LC90, by > threefold in the absence of salvageable thymidine. Thymidine rescue of L1210 cells from nolatrexed cytotoxicity was partially blocked by both 1 microM NU3076 and 1 microM dipyridamole. NU3076 also caused a significant potentiation of FU cytotoxicity in L1210 cells. These studies demonstrate that nucleoside transport inhibition can be maintained in the absence of AGP binding with the dipyridamole pharmacophore and that such analogues can enhance the cytotoxicity of TS inhibitors.","['Curtin, N J', 'Bowman, K J', 'Turner, R N', 'Huang, B', 'Loughlin, P J', 'Calvert, A H', 'Golding, B T', 'Griffin, R J', 'Newell, D R']","['Curtin NJ', 'Bowman KJ', 'Turner RN', 'Huang B', 'Loughlin PJ', 'Calvert AH', 'Golding BT', 'Griffin RJ', 'Newell DR']","['Cancer Research Unit, University of Newcastle upon Tyne, Medical School, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Orosomucoid)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '64ALC7F90C (Dipyridamole)', '76849-19-9 (CB 3717)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dipyridamole/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/*toxicity', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*toxicity', 'Folic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/toxicity', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Structure', 'Orosomucoid/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Quinazolines/*toxicity', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Thymidylate Synthase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC2363125,1999/09/01 00:00,1999/09/01 00:01,['1999/09/01 00:00'],"['1999/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bjc.6690591 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1999 Aug;80(11):1738-46. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6690591.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, total phosphatase activity was significantly decreased (p < .006) and hydrogen peroxide production was significantly increased (p < .002) in Wurzburg cells compared to Jurkat cells. That the cell line with the faster growth rate should have these latter two properties is entirely consistent with the positive effects of increased kinase activity and hydrogen peroxide on proliferative cellular responses in T cells. As originally described, Wurzburg cells were distinguished from Jurkat cells by their lack of CD45, a membrane protein tyrosine phosphatase, and their positive response to hydrogen peroxide-stimulation of NF-kappaB activation.

The signal transduction pathways leading to this clinically-relevant form of apoptosis have, however, not been sufficiently elucidated. GC bind to their specific receptor, a ligand-activated transcription factor of the Zn-finger type, that activates or represses transcription of GC-responsive genes. Previous studies in leukemia cells suggested that transcriptional repression of c-myc expression might be the crucial event in GC-induced apoptosis, although in other systems, c-Myc apparently increased the sensitivity to cell-death inducers. To address this controversy, we stably transfected the GC-sensitive human T-ALL cell line CEM-C7H2 with constructs allowing tetracycline-regulated expression of c-Myc. Subsequent analyses of these cell lines showed that overexpression of c-Myc per se had little, if any, effect on cell viability, although it rendered the cells more sensitive to apoptosis induced by low serum, confirming the functionality of the expressed transgene. More importantly, however, when the cells were treated with GC in the presence of exogenous c-Myc, they underwent apoptosis exceeding that in cells treated in the absence of transgenic c-Myc. The data indicate that c-myc downregulation is not critical for induction of cell-death by GC in this system, and support the notion that c-Myc sensitizes cells to apoptosis-inducing agents.","['Loffler, M', 'Ausserlechner, M J', 'Tonko, M', 'Hartmann, B L', 'Bernhard, D', 'Geley, S', 'Helmberg, A', 'Kofler, R']","['Loffler M', 'Ausserlechner MJ', 'Tonko M', 'Hartmann BL', 'Bernhard D', 'Geley S', 'Helmberg A', 'Kofler R']","['Institute for General and Experimental Pathology, Division of Molecular Pathophysiology, University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', 'N12000U13O (Doxycycline)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'Down-Regulation', 'Doxycycline/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/09/01 00:00,1999/09/01 00:01,['1999/09/01 00:00'],"['1999/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1202820 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1999 Aug 12;18(32):4626-31. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1202820.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Adenoviral transduction of K562 erythroleukemia cells was highly efficiently with >95% of cells expressing the ecotropic receptor at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 103with a correspondingly high transduction with a retroviral vector. Ecotropic receptor expression in CD34+ cells following transduction with adenoviral vectors was increased by at least two-fold (from 20 to 48%) by replacing the RSV promoter with the CMV E1a promoter, resulting in a parallel increase in retroviral transduction efficiency. Replacing the head portion of the fiber protein in conventional adenoviral vectors (serotype 5) with the corresponding portion from an adenoviral 3 serotype resulted in ecotropic receptor expression in 60% of CD34+ cells at an MOI of 104 and a retroviral transduction of 60% of hematopoietic clonogenic progenitors.

To investigate telomere length changes in hematopoietic stem cells, patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) were evaluated. Fifteen patients after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT group), seven patients after autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (auto-PBSCT group), and 39 healthy controls were studied. Telomere length was measured in peripheral mononuclear cells by Southern blot hybridization. There was no significant difference between the allo-BMT and the auto-PBSCT groups. In the allo-BMT group, the mean telomere length of recipients was 2.01 kb shorter than that of their donors (P = 0. 008), and was 1.59 kb shorter than that of age-matched putative normal controls (P = 0.002). Telomere shortening in the allo-BMT group was equivalent to 41.4 years of aging in the donors, and to 52. 4 years of aging in the normal controls. The mean telomere length in the auto-PBSCT group was 2.36 kb shorter than that of the age-matched putative controls (P = 0.043), which was equivalent to 61.5 years of aging in normal controls. The extent of telomere shortening in the allo-BMT group showed a trend to negative correlation with the number of mononuclear cells infused.

The one containing 1/8 of the total CB with 1.4 x 10(8) NC CliniMACS selected CD34+ cells was expanded in the presence of 100 ng/ml G-CSF, 100 ng/ml TPO and 100 ng/ml flt3-L in 10% autologous CB plasma and X-VIVO 10 medium at day -10 before transplantation. This expanded cell population was sterile and consisted of about 60% granulocytic cells (CD13+, CD15+), about 30% myelomonocytic cells (CD14, HLA-DR+), 5.2% megakaryocytes (CD61+) and 1.2% CD34+ cells. The proportion of T (CD3+), NK cells (CD56+) as well as dendritic cells (CD83+) was below 0.2%. The unseparated CB infused at day 0 and +1 consisted of a total of thawed 4.4 x 10(7) NC/kg BW, 5.8 x 10(4) CFU-GM/kg BW, 1.54 x 10(5) CD34+cells/kg BW and 7. 73 x 10(2) LTC-IC/kg BW.

At day +2 after transplantation the patient revealed a focal pneumonia on X-ray with generalized sepsis and became catecholamine dependent. From day +4 the patient received 280 microg/m2 G-CSF. At day +5 she developed an erythroderma, which could not be identified as acute GVHD by biopsy. Early engraftment with leukocyte counts at days 8 and 14 were 350 and 700/microl, ANC 310 and 410/microl, respectively. Donor cells determined by chimerism analysis were 97% and 98% in the periphery at this early time. Most importantly, the pneumonia as well as the septicemia subsided within a few days. Notably, as well is the clearly shortened aplastic phase observed after this simultaneous CB cell component transplantation. The patients T cell and NK cell reconstitution could be detected at day +37 with 330 CD3+ cells/microl and 40 CD56+ cells/microl, respectively. The time to reach an absolute platelet count of 20 000 (50 000)/microl was 75 (103) days. The disease-free survival now exceeds 1 year in complete remission without chronic GVHD or any other health problems. These data show that the applicability of ex vivo expanded committed progenitors and LTC-IC, even in high risk leukemia at the time of transplantation, is feasible and can provide sufficient myeloid progenitors resulting in rapid engraftment able to clear bacterial pneumonia and sepsis. In addition, accelerated hematopoietic reconstitution apparently served as a well functioning platform for definitive graft-versus-leukemia activity. This transplantation of defined ex vivo generated components presents a feasible and generally applicable approach and may open a promising new avenue for cell therapy in malignant diseases.","['Kogler, G', 'Nurnberger, W', 'Fischer, J', 'Niehues, T', 'Somville, T', 'Gobel, U', 'Wernet, P']","['Kogler G', 'Nurnberger W', 'Fischer J', 'Niehues T', 'Somville T', 'Gobel U', 'Wernet P']","['Jose Carreras EUROCORD/NETCORD Bank Germany at the Bone Marrow Donor Center with Transplantation Immunology, Heinrich Heine University, Dusseldorf, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)']",IM,"['Cell Culture Techniques/methods', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclosporine/therapeutic use', 'Female', '*Fetal Blood', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Haplotypes', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy']",,1999/09/01 00:00,1999/09/01 00:01,['1999/09/01 00:00'],"['1999/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1701916 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1999 Aug;24(4):397-403. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1701916.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aggressive therapeutic modalities using high doses of chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy are now commonplace treatments for leukaemia, lymphoma and various non-haematologic malignancies. These intensive approaches have often been used in association with haematopoietic-progenitor-cell support and have induced major responses and remissions in patients with relapsed and refractory diseases, ultimately contributing to improve the disease-free survival of patients with high risk. This has encouraged Theratechnologies, a Montreal-based pharmaceutical company, to develop photodynamic ex vivo purging procedures, including the development of new photosensitizers and irradiation devices for the safe eradication of neoplastic cells from autologous grafts. Our first specific objective, therefore, was to design, synthesize, purify and test photoactive rhodamine derivatives. We have also selected a gas and phosphorus coating characteristic of an efficient scanning fluorescent source for extra-corporeal PDT using rhodamine derivatives. 4,5-Dibromorhodamine 123 (TH9402) was selected because of its photophysical properties, low toxicity and stability.

Of 138 subjects surveyed, including 108 Rapa Nui (the native inhabitants of this island), we identified one HTLV-I-seropositive Rapa Nui. The new HTLV-I isolate derived from this carrier (E-12) was phylogenetically analysed to ascertain the origin and past dissemination of HTLV-I in the island. The analysis demonstrated that isolate E-12 belongs to subgroup A of the Cosmopolitan group, and that it differs from HTLV-Is found in Melanesia, which are highly divergent variants. In subgroup A, E-12 grouped with South American HTLV-Is including those from Amerindians. This result suggests that this isolate originated in South America rather than in Melanesia.","['Ohkura, Sadayuki', 'Yamashita, Masahiro', 'Cartier, Luis', 'Gutierrez Tanabe, David', 'Hayami, Masanori', 'Sonoda, Shunro', 'Tajima, Kazuo']","['Ohkura S', 'Yamashita M', 'Cartier L', 'Gutierrez Tanabe D', 'Hayami M', 'Sonoda S', 'Tajima K']","['Laboratory of Viral Pathogenesis, Research Center for AIDS, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, 53 Shogoin-Kawahara-machi, Sakyo-Ku, Kyoto, Japan1.', 'Laboratory of Viral Pathogenesis, Research Center for AIDS, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, 53 Shogoin-Kawahara-machi, Sakyo-Ku, Kyoto, Japan1.', 'Department of Neuropathology, Chile University, Chile2.', 'Hangaroa Hospital, Easter Island, Chile3.', 'Laboratory of Viral Pathogenesis, Research Center for AIDS, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, 53 Shogoin-Kawahara-machi, Sakyo-Ku, Kyoto, Japan1.', 'Department of Virology, Faculty of Medicine, Kagoshima University, Japan4.', 'Division of Epidemiology, Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute, Japan5.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA, Viral', '*Ethnicity', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Infections/epidemiology/ethnology/immunology/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*classification/genetics/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phylogeny', 'Polynesia/epidemiology']",,1999/08/31 00:00,1999/08/31 00:01,['1999/08/31 00:00'],"['1999/08/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/31 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/31 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1099/0022-1317-80-8-1995 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 1999 Aug;80 ( Pt 8):1995-2001. doi: 10.1099/0022-1317-80-8-1995.,,"['GENBANK/AF013221', 'GENBANK/AF132300']",,,,,,,10.1099/0022-1317-80-8-1995 [doi],,,,

During the first days of arsenic trioxide treatment a rapid decrease in the D-dimers was seen (normal values reached until day 7), together with a slight decrease in peripheral blood leukocytes. This initial coagulation response was followed by a second phase of hematological response (starting on days 15-20) characterized by leukocytosis, occurrence of myeloid progenitor cells in the peripheral blood, and a decrease in bone marrow blasts (<1% on days 28 and 36). Finally, the patient entered complete hematological and cytogenetic remission, although the PML-RAR alpha fusion product was still detectable by PCR.

In order to determine whether this is related to an imbalance in the proportion of different stroma cell types or to integration of leukemic progeny into the regulatory cell network, stroma layers were established in mycophenolic acid-treated long-term marrow cultures from 16 patients with AML and 42 controls and analyzed by means of simultaneous membrane immunofluorescence and interphase cytogenetics. Macrophages were identified by CD14 expression, fibroblasts by staining with the AS02 antibody, and malignant cells by leukemia-specific numerical chromosome aberrations, including monosomy 7 and trisomy 8. Compared with normal controls, there was a slight decrease in the proportion of stroma fibroblasts (52+/-27% versus 77+/-5%) in 10-week-old cultures from patients with AML. Two of five AML patients with trisomy 8 and both patients with monosomy 7 had evidence of leukemic stroma cells. Most malignant cells were CD14+ macrophages (3.8-98.1% of all CD14+ cells), but some were AS02+ (2.8-5.2%). AML stroma layers showed a reduced capacity to support the growth of normal hematopoietic cells in standard two-stage long-term cultures, but this was unrelated to the presence or absence of leukemic stroma elements. In conclusion, AML populations vary with respect to their ability to produce a malignant microenvironment. Functional defects in the hematopoietic microenvironment, however, are not limited to AML patients with cytogenetically abnormal stroma cells, but extend to cases without evidence of malignant stroma cells.","['Zhang, W', 'Knieling, G', 'Vohwinkel, G', 'Martinez, T', 'Kuse, R', 'Hossfeld, D K', 'Duhrsen, U']","['Zhang W', 'Knieling G', 'Vohwinkel G', 'Martinez T', 'Kuse R', 'Hossfeld DK', 'Duhrsen U']","['Medizinische Klinik, Abteilung fur Onkologie und Hamatologie, Universitatskrankenhaus Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,['0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*pathology', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/genetics', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/immunology', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*pathology', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/analysis', 'Macrophages/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monosomy', 'Stromal Cells/*cytology/metabolism/physiology', 'Trisomy']",,1999/08/31 00:00,1999/08/31 00:01,['1999/08/31 00:00'],"['1999/08/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/31 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/31 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002770050520 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 1999 Jul;78(7):305-14. doi: 10.1007/s002770050520.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The extent to which this is due to reduced energy expenditure, increased energy intake, or both, is unclear at present. This in part reflects the limitations of existing models of the pre-obese state. In childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), patients typically gain weight excessively during and after 2 years of therapy, and are at high risk of becoming obese. Previous studies have failed to identify the cause of obesity in these patients. We have tested the hypothesis that excess weight gain in ALL is due to reduced total energy expenditure (TEE), measured using the doubly-labelled water method, and have identified risk factors for excess weight gain in ALL. Pre-obese children with ALL in the dynamic phase of weight gain are less physically active than their peers, with a reduced TEE of approximately 1.2 (95% CI 0.2, 2.2) MJ/d. While other factors might contribute to excess weight gain, lifestyle (i.e. reduced habitual physical activity) plays a central role in ALL. Several considerations suggest that ALL might be a useful model of the pre-obese state: lifestyle is critical to development of obesity in ALL; ALL is relatively common; approximately 70% of patients survive; patients are readily accessible during the 2 years of therapy and beyond.","['Ventham, J C', 'Reilly, J J']","['Ventham JC', 'Reilly JJ']","['Department of Human Nutrition, University of Glasgow, Yorkhill Hospital, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Proc Nutr Soc,The Proceedings of the Nutrition Society,7505881,,IM,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Exercise', 'Humans', '*Models, Biological', 'Obesity/*etiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/*physiopathology/therapy', 'Risk Factors', 'Weight Gain']",,1999/08/31 00:00,1999/08/31 00:01,['1999/08/31 00:00'],"['1999/08/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/31 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/31 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0029665199000385 [pii]', '10.1017/s0029665199000385 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Nutr Soc. 1999 May;58(2):277-81. doi: 10.1017/s0029665199000385.,,,,45,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we examined whether glucocorticoids including dexamethasone (Dex) and hydroxycortisone could diminish the cytotoxic effects of anti-microtubule agents including taxol (paclitaxel), microtubule stabilizing agent, and colchicine, microtubule disrupting agent, on human leukemia HL-60 cells. Taxol or colchicine decreased the viability of HL-60 cells in a dose-dependent manner. However, micromolar concentrations of glucocorticoids rendered HL-60 cells resistant against the cytotoxic activity of anti-microtubule agents. Pretreatments of the glucocorticoids were more effective than simultaneous treatments with antimicrotuble agents. The fact that actinomycin D or cycloheximide reversed the cytoprotective effects of glucocorticoids on cytotoxicities in HL-60 cells induced by antimicrotuble agents suggests glucocorticoids cytoprotection might be mediated via newly synthesized protein. Collectively, these data showed that micromolar concentrations of dexamethasone or hydrocortisone could attenuate the cytotoxic effects of taxol or colchicine on human leukemia HL-60 cells via protein synthesis.","['Pae, H O', 'Yoo, J C', 'Choi, B M', 'Kim, T Y', 'Chung, H T']","['Pae HO', 'Yoo JC', 'Choi BM', 'Kim TY', 'Chung HT']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Wonkwang University School of Medicine, Iksan, Chonbug, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Immunopharmacol Immunotoxicol,Immunopharmacology and immunotoxicology,8800150,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)', 'SML2Y3J35T (Colchicine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Colchicine/pharmacology', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Paclitaxel/*pharmacology']",,1999/08/31 00:00,1999/08/31 00:01,['1999/08/31 00:00'],"['1999/08/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/31 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/31 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/08923979909007119 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunopharmacol Immunotoxicol. 1999 Aug;21(3):439-53. doi: 10.3109/08923979909007119.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have retrospectively analyzed patients with chemosensitive disease and a history of follicular lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma who underwent high-dose chemoradiotherapy and bone marrow transplantation (BMT) with anti-B cell monoclonal antibody-purged autologous marrow for DLBCL. Between December 1982 and August 1997, 27 patients underwent autologous BMT using a uniform ablative regimen with cyclophosphamide, total-body irradiation, and bone marrow purging. All patients received multiple chemotherapy regimens before autologous BMT. At bone marrow (BM) harvest, only 44% of patients were in complete remission, and overt BM infiltration was present in 37%. After cyclophosphamide and total-body irradiation, no treatment-related deaths were seen. Eleven of the 27 patients relapsed, and four patients developed myelodysplasia/acute myelogenous leukemia. In seven patients in whom pathologic studies were available after relapse, the histology remained DLBCL. Twelve patients remained alive and in complete remission with a median follow-up of 36 months (range 10-132).

Follow-up information was obtained for 66 of the 73 patients, including 39 patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and 27 patients with other diseases.

Five of 39 patients with CML relapsed, and 11 of 27 patients with other diseases relapsed. Treatment-related toxicity accounted for 10 deaths.

The reasons for this are 1) autologous transplantation lacks the in vivo graft-vs.-tumor (GVT) effect associated with allogeneic SCT, which is effective in controlling or eliminating residual malignant cells remaining in the body after high-dose therapy, and 2) contaminating malignant cells in the autologous graft are reinfused into the body. Some researchers have attempted to administer immunomodulatory cytokines to simulate a GVT effect, and although this has shown some efficacy, it has several disadvantages. These include high toxicity associated with systemic administration, a short in vivo half-life, and insufficient levels reaching the site of residual disease. As an alternative, we investigated whether delivery of the cytokine interleukin (IL)-2 to the bone marrow can exert an antileukemic effect while avoiding the problems associated with systemic administration. We describe the delivery of IL-2 to the bone marrow by transplantation of syngeneic bone marrow, retrovirally transduced with the gene for IL-2, into lethally irradiated mice. We were able to efficiently transduce murine bone marrow with the IL-2 gene without adversely affecting clonogenic output from hematopoietic progenitors, and we were able to achieve expression of the transgene in transplanted animals. However, IL-2 transduction inhibited hematopoietic reconstitution in lethally irradiated mice. Marrow transduced with high-titer, high-expressing IL-2 retrovirus failed to engraft, and a low-titer, low-expressing IL-2 retrovirus also demonstrated reduced engraftment, although engraftment was sufficient to support survival of transplanted mice. Long-term, low-level expression of the IL-2 transgene was detectable in these mice and was effective in exerting an antileukemic effect. Mice transplanted with control marrow and challenged with leukemic cells suffered 100% mortality within 70 days, whereas mice transplanted with IL-2-transduced marrow exhibited 50% survival over the 175-day duration of this study. The work shows that delivery of immunomodulatory cytokines to the bone marrow can be achieved by transplantation of genetically modified hematopoietic cells. Furthermore, low-level IL-2 expression can exert an antileukemic effect. These data suggest that this may be an effective immunotherapeutic strategy to reduce relapse after autologous transplantation, but the selection and expression of the cytokine must be carefully considered to minimize adverse effects on hematopoiesis.","['Tam, Y K', 'Klingemann, H G']","['Tam YK', 'Klingemann HG']","['Section of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Rush Cancer Institute, Rush Medical College, Chicago, Illinois 60612, USA. ytam@rush.edu']",['eng'],"['Corrected and Republished Article', 'Journal Article']",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/immunology/radiation effects', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/methods', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Interleukin-2/genetics/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Survival Rate', 'Transduction, Genetic/immunology', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Transplantation, Autologous/methods', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",,1999/08/28 00:00,1999/08/28 00:01,['1999/08/28 00:00'],"['1999/08/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/28 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/28 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1083-8791(99)50013-X [pii]', '10.1053/bbmt.1999.v5.pm10465103 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 1999;5(4):231-42. doi: 10.1053/bbmt.1999.v5.pm10465103.,,,,,,,,,,['Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 1999;5(3):144-54.

Preclinical observations have shown that, for engraftment purposes, conditioning regimens can be reduced in intensity, resulting in reduced treatment toxicities. In preclinical canine studies, the use of potent pre- and postgrafting immunosuppression allowed for reduction in conditioning regimens and development of stable mixed chimerism. If these newer approaches using attenuated conditioning regimens can be successfully applied to human transplantation, an improved safety profile will allow potentially curative treatment of patients not currently offered such therapy.

This occurred at concentrations beyond that required for optimal response as judged by reduction of blast cell formation and tritiated thymidine and tritiated uridine incorporation into DNA and RNA, respectively. In contrast, bone marrow plasma from these patients was non-inhibitory or contained significantly less inhibitory activity. Bone marrow plasma from the majority of healthy controls was superior to their peripheral blood plasma in enhancing phytohaemagglutinin-induced mitogenesis. The difference between an individual's bone marrow- and peripheral blood-derived plasma in enhancing proliferation of patient and healthy control cells was significantly greater amongst the patients than the healthy control group; this was attributed mainly to the increased inhibitory activity of ALL peripheral blood plasma compared with normal plasma. Medium conditioned by phytohaemagglutinin-stimulated normal peripheral blood lymphocytes was effective in neutralizing the inhibitory activity of ALL peripheral blood plasma. Taken together, these in vitro results are at least suggestive that in vivo, in healthy subjects, the rapidly proliferating cells in the bone marrow and the 'resting' blood cells in the circulation may be under the influence of a fine balance of different types and/or levels of humoral growth stimulatory and inhibitory factors and that in ALL an unstable balance of these factors exists. The decreased proliferation of circulating blast cells compared with bone marrow blasts in ALL may be attributed, at least in part, to exposure to the different levels of inhibitor(s) in the circulation and bone marrow as demonstrated in vitro by our results.","['Schultz, J C']",['Schultz JC'],"['Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University of Wisconsin, Madison 53792-4108, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Prolif,Cell proliferation,9105195,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'WHI7HQ7H85 (Uridine)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/*physiopathology', 'Cell Line/drug effects', 'Child, Preschool', 'Culture Media/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*physiology', 'Lymphocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'Plasma/physiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood', 'RNA/metabolism', 'Reference Values', 'Time Factors', 'Uridine/metabolism']",,1994/01/01 00:00,1999/08/28 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/28 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2184.1994.tb01405.x [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Prolif. 1994 Jan;27(1):47-61. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2184.1994.tb01405.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The acquisition of monocyte-like phenotype is accompanied by slower progression through the cell cycle, and G1 block has been reported to be the basis of this effect. It is shown here that human promyelocytic leukaemia HL60 cells treated with analogues of vitamin D3 which are potent inducers of monocytic differentiation have an additional cell cycle block. Exposure to 10(-7) M 1,25(OH)2D3 or 1,25-(OH)2-16-ene-D3 resulted in monocytic differentiation and the expected G1 block evident at approximately 48 h in a rapidly differentiating variant of HL60 cells (HL60-G), and at 96 h in the more slowly differentiating HL60-240 cells. In addition, a G2+M block was noted at approximately 72 h in HL60-G and HL60-240 cells. Exposure to vitamin D3 analogues also markedly increased the number of dikaryons, suggesting that cytokinesis was impaired more than karyokinesis. Treatment with a third analogue 25-hydroxy-16,23-diene-D3 produced little differentiation and had minimal effects on the cell cycle parameters. These findings indicate that vitamin D3 analogues regulate cell proliferation by control of the transition of G1 and G2+M phases, reminiscent of the cdc2/CDK2 type of cell cycle control.","['Godyn, J J', 'Xu, H', 'Zhang, F', 'Kolla, S', 'Studzinski, G P']","['Godyn JJ', 'Xu H', 'Zhang F', 'Kolla S', 'Studzinski GP']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, UMD-New Jersey Medical School, Newark, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Cell Prolif,Cell proliferation,9105195,"['0 (25-hydroxy-16,23-diene vitamin D3)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Azure Stains)', '124409-58-1 (1,25-dihydroxy-16-ene-vitamin D3)', '1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Azure Stains', 'Calcitriol/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cholecalciferol/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'G1 Phase/physiology', 'G2 Phase/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Mitosis/physiology', 'Monocytes/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/pathology']",,1994/01/01 00:00,1999/08/28 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/28 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2184.1994.tb01404.x [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Prolif. 1994 Jan;27(1):37-46. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2184.1994.tb01404.x.,,,['R01 CA-44722/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

The antitumour activity of BrUrd, however, in comparison with 5-fluorouridine or 5-fluorouracil, is less pronounced. Because BrUrd is incorporated into RNA and can be detected immunocytochemically and analysed by cytometry, it may prove useful as an RNA precursor to assay cell transcriptional activity. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the cell cycle effects of BrUrd incorporation in human lymphocytic leukaemic MOLT-4 and HL-60 cells and mitogenically stimulated normal peripheral blood lymphocytes. BrUrd suppressed cell proliferation and induced cell death; when measured after 72 h of treatment, the LD50 was 10 and 20 microM for HL-60 and MOLT-4, respectively, and LD90 was 100 microM, for both cell lines. BrUrd was maximally incorporated by the cells progressing through S phase of the cycle and the S phase cells were most severely perturbed by the drug, which was detected in RNA but not in DNA. Suppression of the S phase traverse of MOLT-4, HL-60 and normal lymphocytes was seen at > or = 30 microM BrUrd concentration. Also sensitive was the cell traverse through G2+M which, in the case of lymphocytes, HL-60 and MOLT-4 cells, was perturbed at > or = 30, > or = 200 and 500 microM BrUrd concentrations, respectively. Transition of lymphocytes from G0 to G1 was little affected at < 100 microM, and, although suppressed, was still observed even at 500 microM BrUrd concentration. Apoptosis of HL-60 cells and lymphocytes was observed at > or = 50 microM BrUrd after 24 h of incubation; death of MOLT-4 cells had mixed features of apoptosis and necrosis and resembled the 'mitotic' or 'reproductive cell death' as described in other cell systems.

Hypersensitivity of FA cells to the clastogenic effect of crosslinking agents such as diepoxybutane (DEB) is used as a diagnostic criterion, because phenotypic heterogeneity makes clinical diagnosis difficult. Studies of genetic heterogeneity have shown that there are at least five different complementation groups, FA-A through FA-E. Overall, FA-A is the most prevalent group, accounting for 60%-65% of all FA. The FAA gene, which maps to chromosome 16q24.3, was recently isolated and methods for molecular diagnosis of FA-A are currently being developed. The first FA gene to be isolated (FAC) maps to chromosome 9q22.3; FA-C accounts for 10%-15% of FA. A variety of mutations and polymorphisms have been described in FAC. The most common of these is IVS4 +4 A-->T, which is the only FAC mutation found in Ashkenazi Jewish FA patients and their families. This mutation has not been found in any affected individual of non-Jewish ancestry. The carrier frequency of the IVS4 mutation was found to be 1 in 89 (1.1%; 95% confidence interval 0.79% to 1.56%) in an Ashkenazi Jewish population, whereas no carriers were identified in an Iraqi Jewish population, which represents the original gene pool of the Jews.

As this tumor type is unique to the rat and is only common in the F-344 strain, its significance for human cancer risk is unclear. For this reason, a survey of the published literature was undertaken to assess the occurrence and etiology of MNCL in F-344 rats and to evaluate its potential significance to humans using alkyl phthalate data as an example. It was found that MNCL occurs in untreated, aged F-344 rats at a high and variable rate, it is uncommon in most other rat strains, and its background incidence has increased significantly over time. This complicates retrospective data interpretation. MNCL has not been found in other mammalian species and no histologically comparable tumor is found in humans. In general, a statistically significant increase in frequency of a common tumor in the F-344 rat is an insufficient basis for determining that a chemical presents a carcinogenic hazard to humans, particularly when that tumor is not observed in other species. As one example, the alkyl phthalates constitute one group of substances which has been associated with increased MNCL frequency in the F-344 rat after high dietary doses. In evaluating the significance of this increase in MNCL, an extensive toxicological database for phthalates indicates that toxicological effects occur only at relatively high doses, and tumor development (including MNCL) occurs only after an apparent threshold is exceeded. Phthalates are not genotoxic as a class, further supporting the hypothesis of the existence of a threshold. When these considerations are collectively evaluated, it can be concluded that a finding of increased MNCL in F-344 rats exposed for a lifetime to a nongenotoxic chemical is not toxicologically relevant to humans, even when MNCL is observed at an increased incidence that is statistically significant. Thus, the increased incidence of MNCL observed in F-344 rats exposed to some alkyl phthalates is likely a strain-specific effect of little or no relevance for humans, and characterization of these chemicals as carcinogens based on increased MNCL in F-344 rats is not scientifically supported.","['Caldwell, D J']",['Caldwell DJ'],"['Exxon Biomedical Sciences, Inc., Mettlers Road, CN-2350, East Millstone, New Jersey 08875-2350, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Regul Toxicol Pharmacol,Regulatory toxicology and pharmacology : RTP,8214983,"['0 (Phthalic Acids)', '6O7F7IX66E (phthalic acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinogenicity Tests', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*chemically induced/pathology', 'Neoplasms/*chemically induced', 'No-Observed-Adverse-Effect Level', 'Phthalic Acids/*toxicity', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Risk Factors']",,1999/08/28 00:00,1999/08/28 00:01,['1999/08/28 00:00'],"['1999/08/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/28 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/28 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/rtph.1999.1305 [doi]', 'S0273-2300(99)91305-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Regul Toxicol Pharmacol. 1999 Aug;30(1):45-53. doi: 10.1006/rtph.1999.1305.,['Copyright 1999 Academic Press.'],,,64,,,,,,,,,

It usually presents as advanced stage disease, involving lymph nodes, spleen, bone marrow, and extranodal sites, particularly the gastrointestinal tract. However, frank leukemic presentation with high white cell counts is uncommon and can be difficult to distinguish from other chronic lymphoproliferative disorders. The aim of this study was to characterize the morphologic spectrum of leukemic mantle cell lymphoma. METHODS: During the period July 1994 through October 1998, 14 patients with mantle cell lymphoma in leukemic phase were diagnosed at the Department of Pathology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Hong Kong. The diagnosis of mantle cell lymphoma was based on histologic and immunocytochemical findings and was confirmed by cyclin D1 immunoreactivity in all cases. The clinical records and laboratory results were reviewed. Peripheral blood smears, bone marrow, and other tissue biopsies were examined, with particular attention to the cytologic features of the leukemic mantle cells. RESULTS: Mantle cell lymphoma in leukemic phase showed a very aggressive clinical course. Eight patients died at a mean of 13 months, and only 1 patient was disease free. Morphologically, the leukemic mantle cells exhibited a broad morphologic spectrum, with several cytologic patterns identified: 1) mixed small and medium-sized cells, 2) predominantly medium-sized cells, 3) predominantly large cells, and 4) giant cells. Despite variations in the size and nuclear shape, the leukemic mantle cells could usually be recognized by the nuclear irregularity and clefting, moderately dense but evenly distributed chromatin, small nucleoli, and scant cytoplasm. CONCLUSIONS: Recognition of the characteristic cytologic features of leukemic mantle cells can help to distinguish them from other chronic lymphoproliferative disorders. In contrast to the latter, the clinical course is aggressive and response to conventional chemotherapy is poor.","['Wong, K F', 'Chan, J K', 'So, J C', 'Yu, P H']","['Wong KF', 'Chan JK', 'So JC', 'Yu PH']","['Department of Pathology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Hong Kong, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,['136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow Examination', 'Cyclin D1/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/metabolism/*pathology/ultrastructure', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",,1999/08/27 00:00,1999/08/27 00:01,['1999/08/27 00:00'],"['1999/08/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/27 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/27 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19990901)86:5<850::AID-CNCR22>3.0.CO;2-Z [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0142(19990901)86:5<850::aid-cncr22>3.0.co;2-z [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1999 Sep 1;86(5):850-7. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0142(19990901)86:5<850::aid-cncr22>3.0.co;2-z.,['Copyright 1999 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The significance of MDR1 levels in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) has not been established. METHODS: The authors investigated MDR1 levels and their association with patient and tumor characteristics, responsiveness to therapy, and long term prognosis in 198 CML patients. These included 127 patients in early chronic phase (ECP) CML, 31 patients in late chronic phase (LCP) CML, and 40 patients in accelerated or blastic phase CML. MDR1 expression was analyzed by Western blot analysis and quantitative solid-phase plate radioimmunoassay. MDR1 levels were measured on cell lysates obtained from the bone marrow mononuclear cell fraction. Expression was compared in relation to the median derived from 36 normal control samples. RESULTS: Among patients with CML, high levels of MDR1 were found in 73 of 127 ECP (57%), 20 of 31 LCP (65%), 8 of 27 in accelerated phase (30%), and 8 of 13 in blastic phase (62%) (P value not significant). Furthermore, among the 127 ECP CML patients, high MDR1 levels were associated with age >/=50 years (69% vs. 51%; P < 0. 05), thrombocytosis >700 x 10(9)/L (84% vs. 53%; P < 0.01), and leukocyte counts </=50 x 10(9)/L (70% vs. 46%; P < 0.01). Response to interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) was independent of MDR1 expression; major cytogenetic responses were recorded in 28 of 73 patients with high MDR1 levels and in 16 of 54 patients with low MDR1 levels (38% vs. 30%; P value not significant). No difference in survival based on MDR1 level was observed. A small subset of 17 patients with low MDR1 levels (<1 times normal) had a trend toward worse survival (median, 30 months vs. 73 months; 5-year survival rates of 34% vs. 65%; P = 0.03).

The chimeric virus Rec2, which contains the pol and env genes of 57 virus on the background of A8 and does not cause spongiform degeneration in the central nervous system (CNS), induced leukemic cell infiltration of the CNS, mainly of the meningeal region, in 58.3% of infected rats. In contrast, A8 induced little or no leukemic cell infiltration of the CNS. Other chimeric viruses containing the LTR and the 5' half of the 5' leader sequence of A8 induced aggressive leukemia, and after infection of these viruses, leukemic cell infiltration of the CNS was only observed in less than 20.0% of the rats. These results indicate that the fragment containing the LTR and the 5' half of the 5' leader sequence of A8 is essential for induction of aggressive leukemia in rats but is not sufficient to cause CNS infiltration.

United Kingdom Childhood Cancer Study Investigators.,4095-9,"Rearrangements and fusion of the MLL gene with various alternative partner genes occur in approximately 80% of infant leukemias and are acquired during fetal hemopoiesis in utero. Similar MLL gene recombinants also occur in topoisomerase II-inhibiting drug-induced leukemias. These data have led to the suggestion that some infant leukemia may arise via transplacental fetal exposures during pregnancy to substances that form cleavable complexes with topoisomerase II and induce illegitimate recombination of the MLL gene. A structural feature shared by many topoisomerase II-inhibiting drugs and other chemicals is the quinone moiety. We assayed, by PCR-RFLP, for a polymorphism in an enzyme that detoxifies quinones, NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1), in a series (n = 36) of infant leukemias with MLL rearrangements versus unselected cord blood controls (n = 100). MLL-rearranged leukemias were more likely to have genotypes with low NQO1 function (heterozygous CT or homozygous TT at nucleotide 609) than controls (odds ratio, 2.5; P = 0.015). In contrast, no significant allele bias was seen in other groups of pediatric leukemias with TEL-AML1 fusions (n = 50) or hyperdiploidy (n = 29). In the subset of infant leukemias that had MLL-AF4 fusion genes (n = 21), the bias increase in low or null function NQO1 genotypes was more pronounced (odds ratio, 8.12; P = 0.00013). These data support the idea of a novel causal mechanism in infant leukemia involving genotoxic exposure in utero and modulation of impact on a selective target gene by an inherited allele encoding a rate-limiting step in a carcinogen detoxification pathway.","['Wiemels, J L', 'Pagnamenta, A', 'Taylor, G M', 'Eden, O B', 'Alexander, F E', 'Greaves, M F']","['Wiemels JL', 'Pagnamenta A', 'Taylor GM', 'Eden OB', 'Alexander FE', 'Greaves MF']","['Leukaemia Research Fund Centre, Institute of Cancer Research, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 1.6.5.2 (NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone))', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Alleles', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/enzymology/*genetics', '*Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)/*genetics', 'Pregnancy', '*Proto-Oncogenes', '*Transcription Factors']",,1999/08/27 00:00,1999/08/27 00:01,['1999/08/27 00:00'],"['1999/08/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/27 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/27 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1999 Aug 15;59(16):4095-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of the DNA sequence and structure surrounding the breakpoints may reveal clues to their formation. A long-distance inverse PCR strategy was used to amplify TEL-AML1 genomic fusion sequences from diagnostic DNA from nine patients. Breakpoints were scattered within the 14 kb of intronic DNA between exons 5 and 6 of TEL and in two putative cluster regions within AML1 intron 1. Fusion sequences exhibited characteristic signs of nonhomologous end joining, including microhomologies at the end points, and small deletions and duplications. DNA sequences near the breakpoints did not reveal any consistent characteristic signal sequences of the V(D)J recombinase, topoisomerase II consensus sites, or other sequence motifs associated with recombination. However, several translocations occurred near a repeat region of TEL that was found to be highly polymorphic. This region was cloned and found in nuclease sensitivity assays to exhibit paranemic structures, which may have contributed to DNA breakage or illegitimate recombination. The data are compatible with the possibility that TEL-AML1 translocations occur by nonhomologous recombination involving imprecise, constitutive repair processes following DNA double-strand breaks.","['Wiemels, J L', 'Greaves, M']","['Wiemels JL', 'Greaves M']","['Leukaemia Research Fund Centre, Institute of Cancer Research, Chester Beatty Laboratories, London, United Kingdom. joseph@icr.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', '*Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,1999/08/27 00:00,1999/08/27 00:01,['1999/08/27 00:00'],"['1999/08/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/27 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/27 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1999 Aug 15;59(16):4075-82.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated a newly synthesized vitamin D3 analogue [1,25(OH)2-16-ene-5,6-trans-D3 (Ro 25-4020)] that has a novel 5,6-trans motif. Dose-response studies showed that 1,25(OH)2-16-ene-5,6-trans-D3 had 10-100-fold greater antiproliferative activities than 1,25(OH)2D3 when measuring clonal growth of breast (MCF-7) and prostate (LNCaP) cancer cell lines as well as a myeloid leukemia cell line (HL-60). Because the chief toxicity of vitamin D3 is hypercalcemia, we examined the calcemic activity of 1,25(OH)2-16-ene-5,6-trans-D3 in mice. Remarkably, 1,25(OH)2-16-ene-5,6-trans-D3 was at least 40-fold less calcemic as compared with 1,25(OH)2D3 and 1,25(OH)2-16-ene-D3 (Ro 24-2637). To explore the mechanism by which the 1,25(OH)2-16-ene-5,6-trans-D3 analogue mediated its antiproliferative activity, several studies were performed. Pulse-exposure studies showed that a 4-day pulse exposure to 1,25(OH)2-16-ene-5,6-trans-D3 (10(-7) M) in liquid culture was adequate to achieve a 40% inhibition of MCF-7 clonal growth in the absence of the analogue, suggesting that the growth inhibition mediated by 1,25(OH)2-16-ene-5,6-trans-D3 was at least in part irreversible. Cell cycle studies showed that 1,25(OH)2-16-ene-5,6-trans-D3 increased the proportion of MCF-7 cells in the G0-G1 phase and decreased those in the S phase. Furthermore, 1,25(OH)2-16-ene-5,6-trans-D3 induced an elevated expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, p21waf1 and p27kip1. In addition, 1,25(OH)2-16-ene-5,6-trans-D3 almost completely inhibited telomerase activity, as measured by telomeric repeat amplification protocol assay and human telomerase reverse transcriptase mRNA. For each of the growth-related parameters that were examined, the vitamin D3 analogue was more active than 1,25(OH)2D3. In contrast, 1,25(OH)2D3 was more calcemic than 1,25(OH)2-16-ene-5,6-trans-D3. In summary, 1,25(OH)2-16-ene-5,6-trans-D3, having a novel 5,6-trans motif, strongly inhibited clonal proliferation and reduced telomerase activity with low calcemic activity, suggesting further testing in in vivo cancer models.

Using this alkaloid as a seed compound in COMPARE resulted in the identification of other berberine-like compounds and mitochondria-accumulating agents as highly related to berberine. Among these compounds, MKT077, a rhodacyanine derivative currently under Phase I clinical trials, showed a potent inhibitory effect with 50% inhibition at approximately 5 microM. With MKT077 as an upgraded seed for a new round of COMPARE analysis, we identified rhodacyanine FJ5002, a close derivative of MKT077, as the most potent telomerase inhibitor with 50% inhibition at approximately 2 microM. Long-term cultivation of U937, a human leukemia cell line, with subacute concentrations of FJ5002 resulted in population-doubling dependent changes characterized by progressive telomere erosion (from approximately 10 to approximately 4.0 kb), increased chromosome abnormalities, and senescence/crisis-like features.

Shimizu et al., J. Biol. Chem., 273: 8669-8674, 1998) that the pro-apoptotic drug, camptothecin, an inhibitor of topoisomerase I, induces a protein kinase C-alpha-mediated phosphorylation of lamin B in HL-60 cells, which precedes both degradation of lamin B and fragmentation of DNA. In this paper, we report that, in HL-60 cells exposed to camptothecin, there is a rapid and sustained increase of nuclear protein kinase C-alpha activity that is due to an increase in the amount of protein kinase C-alpha present in the nucleus. The enhancement of nuclear kinase C activity is preceded by an increase in the mass of nuclear diacylglycerol. As demonstrated by its sensitivity to propranolol, the nuclear diacylglycerol mass increase is due to the activation of a phospholipase D. Indeed, inhibitors of neither phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C nor phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C blocked the rise in nuclear diacylglycerol. In vitro assays also demonstrated the activation of a nuclear phospholipase D, but not of a phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C, after treatment with camptothecin. Propranolol was also able to block the rise in nuclear protein kinase C-alpha activity, thus suggesting that the increase in diacylglycerol mass is important for the activation of the kinase at the nuclear level.

This prompted us to investigate whether mutations in Ikaros play a role in human hematological malignancies. Reverse transcription-PCR was used to determine the relative expression levels of Ikaros isoforms in a panel of human leukemia/lymphoma cell lines and human bone marrow samples from patients with hematological malignancies. Among the cell lines examined, only BV-173, which was derived from a chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patient in lymphoid blast crisis, overexpressed the dominant-negative isoform, Ik-6. In 9 of 17 samples of patients in blast crisis of CML, Ikaros activity had been reduced either by drastically reducing mRNA expression (4 of 17) or by overexpressing the dominant-negative isoform Ik-6 (5 of 17). Significantly, expression of Ikaros isoforms seemed normal in chronic phase CML patients and patients with other hematological malignancies. In some cases, overexpression of the dominant-negative Ik-6 protein was confirmed by Western blot analysis, and Southern blot analysis indicated that decreases in Ikaros activity correlated with a mutation in the Ikaros locus. In summary, these findings suggest that a reduction of Ikaros activity may be an important step in the development of blast crisis in CML and provide further evidence that mutations that alter Ikaros expression may contribute to human hematological malignancies.","['Nakayama, H', 'Ishimaru, F', 'Avitahl, N', 'Sezaki, N', 'Fujii, N', 'Nakase, K', 'Ninomiya, Y', 'Harashima, A', 'Minowada, J', 'Tsuchiyama, J', 'Imajoh, K', 'Tsubota, T', 'Fukuda, S', 'Sezaki, T', 'Kojima, K', 'Hara, M', 'Takimoto, H', 'Yorimitsu, S', 'Takahashi, I', 'Miyata, A', 'Taniguchi, S', 'Tokunaga, Y', 'Gondo, H', 'Niho, Y', 'Harada, M']","['Nakayama H', 'Ishimaru F', 'Avitahl N', 'Sezaki N', 'Fujii N', 'Nakase K', 'Ninomiya Y', 'Harashima A', 'Minowada J', 'Tsuchiyama J', 'Imajoh K', 'Tsubota T', 'Fukuda S', 'Sezaki T', 'Kojima K', 'Hara M', 'Takimoto H', 'Yorimitsu S', 'Takahashi I', 'Miyata A', 'Taniguchi S', 'Tokunaga Y', 'Gondo H', 'Niho Y', 'Harada M', 'et al.']","['Department of Medicine, University of Okayama, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (IKZF1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Zfpn1a1 protein, mouse)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Blast Crisis/genetics', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/*genetics']",,1999/08/27 00:00,1999/08/27 00:01,['1999/08/27 00:00'],"['1999/08/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/27 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/27 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1999 Aug 15;59(16):3931-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This deleted region is close to hSNF5/INI1 (SMARCB1), a gene that encodes a widely expressed component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex and that suffers biallelic mutations in malignant rhabdoid tumors. To determine whether hSNF5/INI1 was also deleted in patients with CML, we performed fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis with a specific cosmid probe. Deletion of hSNF5/INI1 on the 9q+ chromosome was found in 9 of 25 (36%) cases in blast crisis (lymphoid, n = 3; myeloid, n = 6). For the three of these nine patients for whom material was available prior to transformation, deletions were also seen in chronic phase, indicating that they are early events. Analysis of an additional 21 patients in chronic phase revealed heterozygous loss of hSNF5/INI1 in 5 (24%) cases. Of the 14 patients who had hSNF5/INI1 deletions, 7 showed a mosaic pattern of hybridization in which only a proportion of CML cells that harbored both the t(9;22) derivative chromosomes had a deletion, indicating that loss of hSNF5/INI1 was acquired during the course of the disease. Single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis of all nine hSNF5/INI1 exons and splice junctions failed to reveal any mutations for 31 patients in transformation, including 8 who had deletions, although two polymorphisms were identified. We conclude that deletions of hSNF5/INI1 are frequent in patients with CML. Such deletions may be associated with reduced levels of hSNF5/INI1 expression, which could contribute to leukemogenesis by altering chromatin-mediated transcriptional control. Alternatively, the deletions could target another unidentified gene at 22q11 that plays a role in the pathogenesis of CML.","['Grand, F', 'Kulkarni, S', 'Chase, A', 'Goldman, J M', 'Gordon, M', 'Cross, N C']","['Grand F', 'Kulkarni S', 'Chase A', 'Goldman JM', 'Gordon M', 'Cross NC']","['Department of Haematology, Imperial College School of Medicine, Hammersmith Hospital, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (SMARCB1 Protein)', '0 (SMARCB1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', '*Gene Deletion', 'Gene Frequency', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'SMARCB1 Protein', 'Transcription Factors/genetics']",,1999/08/27 00:00,1999/08/27 00:01,['1999/08/27 00:00'],"['1999/08/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/27 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/27 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1999 Aug 15;59(16):3870-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, all cells of an ALL should have identical antigen receptor gene rearrangements. In a patient with diploid ALL of the B-cell precursor immunophenotype, seven different clonal rearrangements of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain genes (IgH) were identified, implying the presence of oligoclonal populations. All of these rearrangements were only detectable after a modification of the polymerase chain reaction for the complementarity determining region of the IgH genes using V(H) gene framework 3 and (H) consensus primers. Sequence analysis showed that these rearrangements were completely unrelated to each other. Only two of these rearrangements were detectable by Southern blot analysis. Quantification and single-cell analysis confirmed the high frequency of these latter two rearrangements, as well as their presence in the same clonal population. The other rearrangements characterized less than 5% of the leukemic population. In addition, two T-cell receptor Vdelta2-Ddelta3 (TCRdelta) rearrangements were identified, both at a similar frequency. However, they were derived from different cells. An Igkappa rearrangement represented the only clonal marker in this leukemia. All of the Ig and TCRdelta rearrangements, with the exception of one IgH rearrangement, remained stable throughout the course of the disease. The persistence of such a great number of distinct IgH rearrangements at different quantities within the leukemic population and of the two biclonal TCRdelta rearrangements is compatible with the presence of a clonal disease that is defined by the Igkappa rearrangement.","['Stolz, F', 'Panzer, S', 'Fischer, S', 'Panzer-Grumayer, E R']","['Stolz F', 'Panzer S', 'Fischer S', 'Panzer-Grumayer ER']","[""Children's Cancer Research Institute, St. Anna Kinderspital, Vienna, Austria.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Oligoclonal Bands)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Clone Cells/immunology', 'DNA/genetics', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulins/*genetics', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Male', 'Oligoclonal Bands', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/*genetics', 'Recurrence', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/08/27 00:00,1999/08/27 00:01,['1999/08/27 00:00'],"['1999/08/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/27 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/27 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mod Pathol. 1999 Aug;12(8):819-26.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Southern blot analysis was used as the ""gold standard"" for clonality assessment. For polymerase chain reaction analysis, primers directed against framework (FR) 3 (FR3-A and FR3-B), FR2, and FR1 of the variable gene segments and against joining gene segments of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene were used. Polymerase chain reaction products were analyzed by high-resolution fingerprinting analysis using radiolabeled nucleotides, gene scanning using fluorochrome-labeled primers, and heteroduplex analysis. All of the assays generated polyclonal patterns in the reactive tissues. The sensitivity in detecting monoclonality as defined by Southern blotting varied between 60% (heteroduplex analysis with FR3 primers) and 77% (high-resolution fingerprinting analysis with FR2 primers). Comparison of the three FR3 assays revealed that gene scanning had the highest sensitivity (69%), probably because it could detect small aberrant monoclonal amplicons. False-negative results were especially frequent in follicular center lymphoma (n = 20), but also in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (n = 18), both renowned for having mutated variable gene segments, potentially leading to primer mismatching. For example, in follicular center lymphoma, the FR3, FR2, and FR1 region primer sets detected clonality in only 35 to 40, 65, and 50%, respectively. Combining these techniques, 17 (85%) of 20 follicular center lymphoma samples showed monoclonality. Therefore, especially in follicular center lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and, to a lesser extent, in other lymphomas, multiple variable gene segment primer sets must be used for a reliable assessment of clonality. Our results also suggest that gene scanning is somewhat more sensitive than other read-out systems. Heteroduplex analysis, however, is a reliable alternative within a diagnostic setting, avoiding the use of radioactivity or expensive automated sequencing equipment and fluorochrome-labeled (oligo)nucleotides.","['Derksen, P W', 'Langerak, A W', 'Kerkhof, E', 'Wolvers-Tettero, I L', 'Boor, P P', 'Mulder, A H', 'Vrints, L W', 'Coebergh, J W', 'van Krieken, J H', 'Schuuring, E', 'Kluin, P M', 'van Dongen, J J']","['Derksen PW', 'Langerak AW', 'Kerkhof E', 'Wolvers-Tettero IL', 'Boor PP', 'Mulder AH', 'Vrints LW', 'Coebergh JW', 'van Krieken JH', 'Schuuring E', 'Kluin PM', 'van Dongen JJ']","['Department of Pathology, Leiden University Medical Center, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,['0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)'],IM,"['Blotting, Southern', 'Clone Cells/immunology', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain/*genetics', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin/*genetics', 'Genes, bcl-2/genetics', 'Heteroduplex Analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*genetics/immunology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*genetics/immunology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,1999/08/27 00:00,1999/08/27 00:01,['1999/08/27 00:00'],"['1999/08/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/27 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/27 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mod Pathol. 1999 Aug;12(8):794-805.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the present study was to assess the feasibility of using low intensity laser radiation (LILR) in treating extravasal infiltrates caused by cytostatics (vincristin, daunorubicin) administered in children with acute leukaemia (AL). We applied laser therapy in a group of children with AL in the stage of exacerbation. The children were undergoing chemotherapy with cytostatics.

We used minimal doses in the range of the anti-inflammatory enthrophic frequencies. We found that the extravasal infiltrates rapidly decreased the local inflammatory response and the pain was relieved. The strong anti-inflammatory effect can be accounted for by the nonspecific action of the LIRR on the tissues, which is manifested by better microcirculation, removal of toxic substances and stimulated regeneration capabilities of the cells.

Deletion or amplification of chromosomal segments carrying marker loci, as can occur in leukemia and other hematologic malignancies, may result in loss or increased dosage of marker alleles. Examination of these marker alleles by PCR therefore may give aberrant results, which might lead to misinterpretation of bone marrow transplantation (BMT) engraftment studies. METHODS AND RESULTS: We report a case of chronic myelogenous leukemia treated by BMT. PCR amplification of the minisatellite at the apoB locus on chromosome 2 was used to monitor the donor bone marrow engraftment. The patient experienced relapse in blast crisis with a near-haploid karyotype with loss of recipient-specific apoB allele causing an aberrant PCR result for bone marrow engraftment that mimicked full donor engraftment. CONCLUSIONS: Loss or gain of polymorphic DNA markers because of chromosomal losses or gains in some hematologic malignancies may affect the interpretation of bone marrow engraftment studies by PCR. When choosing polymorphic markers for such studies, it is important to avoid those that will be affected by expected chromosomal alteration, if possible. In addition, any abberant post-transplantation typing should prompt further investigation to rule out the possibility of chromosomal aberration. Review of all pertinent laboratory studies is important to avoid misinterpretation of results from a single test for engraftment analysis.","['Zhou, M', 'Sheldon, S', 'Akel, N', 'Killeen, A A']","['Zhou M', 'Sheldon S', 'Akel N', 'Killeen AA']","['Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109-0602, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Mol Diagn,Molecular diagnosis : a journal devoted to the understanding of human disease through the clinical application of molecular biology,9614965,['0 (Genetic Markers)'],IM,"['Adult', '*Aneuploidy', '*Blast Crisis', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Gene Amplification', '*Genetic Markers', 'Graft Survival/genetics', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",,1999/08/27 00:00,1999/08/27 00:01,['1999/08/27 00:00'],"['1999/08/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/27 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/27 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/s1084-8592(99)80039-3 [doi]', 'S1084-8592(99)80039-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Diagn. 1999 Jun;4(2):153-7. doi: 10.1016/s1084-8592(99)80039-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A variety of techniques have been used to test for ras mutations. Methods and Results: A simplified reverse dot blot (RDB) assay was used in this study. Polymerase chain reaction products were hybridized to nitrocellulose membrane-fixed synthetic probes (20 nucleotides long) specific for codons 12, 13, and 61 of H-, K-, and N-ras mutations and their wild-type sequences. No special treatment or modification of the probes was necessary to obtain adequate results in overnight film exposure when the polymerase chain reaction was carried out using (32)P-end labeled primers. It was demonstrated that this simplified RDB assay can also be used with fluorescein-11-dUTP and a chemiluminescence detection system. The RDB assay is more reliable than the single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) assay. By comparison, the SSCP assay is significantly less sensitive and less specific. It was confirmed with sequencing that 11 (12%) of 93 SSCP assays were false positive and 2 (2%) were false negative, whereas no false positive or false negative RDB assay was detected. The RDB assay also provides more additional detailed information about the specific point mutation and amino acid change, which may have clinical implications in some tumors. Conclusions: The RDB assay is very sensitive and able to detect mutations when the mutant allele is in 1% of the cells and can be used to detect minimal residual disease, particularly in some cases of leukemia and myelodysplasia.","['Albitar', 'Wu', 'Feltz', 'Jin', 'Hirsch-Ginsberg', 'Kantarjian', 'Beran']","['Albitar M', 'Wu WI', 'Feltz E', 'Jin G', 'Hirsch-Ginsberg C', 'Kantarjian H', 'Beran M']","['Section of Hematopathology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Diagn,Molecular diagnosis : a journal devoted to the understanding of human disease through the clinical application of molecular biology,9614965,,,,,1999/08/27 00:00,1999/08/27 00:00,['1999/08/27 00:00'],"['1999/08/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/27 00:00 [medline]', '1999/08/27 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1054/MODI00200169 [doi]', 'MODI00200169 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Diagn. 1997 Sep;2(3):169-176. doi: 10.1054/MODI00200169.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods and Results: MPO mRNA detection by RT-PCR was performed on cellular material from archival smears of preipheral blood (PB) and bone marrow aspirate from 16 patients previously diagnosed with AML, types MO-M5. MPO mRNA findings were correlated with morphology and flow-cytometric data. A group of six patients diagnosed with adult de novo acute lymphoblastic leukemia served as a negative patient control group for this retrospective study. MPO mRNA findings in PB appear to follow two patterns in patients with complete remission: (1) sustained positivity throughout the clinical course, correlated with relapse; and (2) initial positivity followed by sustained negativity, correlated with long complete remissions. For the only patient in this study found in partial remission, MP mRNA positivity in PB was seen throughout the clinical course. No MPO mRNA positivity was detected in the PB of acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases. Conclusions: A highly sensitive method for detection of MPO mRNA, such as RT-PCR, is useful in monitoring patients with AML for confirming or ruling out complete remission at the molecular level. The pattern of MPO mRNA positivity over time appears to be important and to correlate with clinical course, with sustained positivity being associated wtih impending relapse, while a switch from initial positivity to sustained negativity appears to be associated with long complete remssion. Studies of larger patient groups are necessary to confirm these initial findings.","['Crisan', 'David']","['Crisan D', 'David D']","['Department of Clinical Pathology, William Beaumont Hospital, Royal Oak, Michigan, USA']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Diagn,Molecular diagnosis : a journal devoted to the understanding of human disease through the clinical application of molecular biology,9614965,,,,,1996/12/01 00:00,1999/08/27 00:00,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/27 00:00 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1054/MODI00100313 [doi]', 'S1084-8592(96)70014-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Diagn. 1996 Dec;1(4):313-319. doi: 10.1054/MODI00100313.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ph results in fusion of the c-abl oncogene on chromosome 9 with the breakpoint cluster region BCR gene on chromosome 22. The purpose of this study was to compare reverse trascriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for BCR/abl fusion to cytogenetic methods for Ph detection in patients with acute leukemia. Methods and Results: Peripheral blood and bone marrow samples from cases of adult acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were examined for Ph by RT-PCR, karyotyping, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Using total cellular RNA and a single primer pair, cDNA was transcribed, amplified, electorphoresed, and probed for BCR/abl fusion. Patient cells and SUPB15 and K562 cell lines were used as breakpoint controls. Karyotyping was done by standard Giemsa banding. FISH was performed on bone marrow smears using digxigenin-labeled DNA probes for major and minor bcr breakpoints (corresponding to involvement of major bcr exons 2/3 and minor bcr exon 1, respectively) and biotin-labeled DNA probes for abl. Rhodamine-conjugated antidigoxigenin and fluorescein-conjugated avidin yielded red and green fluorescent signals, respectively. A total of 32 samples from patients with AML were studied, 20 from patients with de novo or relapsed AML and 12 from patients in remission. Five of 32 cases of AML (16%) were RT-PCR+/Ph+ all with major bcr breakpoints between exons 3 and 4. One of the 32 cases (3%) was RT-PCR+/Ph+; this case was the only positive remission sample. Of the four T-PCR+/Ph- cases, one showed t(2;17), one showed t(9;11), and two had a normal karyotype. FISH was done in three RT-PCR+ cases, yielding positive results with the major probe in two. A total of 22 samples from patients with ALL were studies, 15 from patients with de novo or relapsed ALL and seven from patient remission. Seven of 22 cases of ALL (32%) were RT-PCR+, four with major-bcr breakpoints between exons 3 and 4, and three with breakpoints in the minor-bcr. Two of the 22 (9%) cases were RT-PCR+/Ph+. Of the five RT-PCR+/Ph- cases, two showed a 22q- but lacked the typical Ph break on chromosome 9, 1 showed a 12p-, and two had a normal karyotype. FISH was performed in four RT-PCR+ cases, yielding positive results with the major probe in two cases and with the minor probe in two cases. Conclusions: RT-PCR is more sensitive than karyotyping, detecting masked Ph or translocations not found by cytogenetic analysis. FISH is a helpful adjunctive test when used to confirm BCR/abl fusion in RT-PCR+/Ph- cases.","['Wells', 'Phillips', 'Farhi']","['Wells SJ', 'Phillips CN', 'Farhi DC']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia, USA']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Diagn,Molecular diagnosis : a journal devoted to the understanding of human disease through the clinical application of molecular biology,9614965,,,,,1996/12/01 00:00,1999/08/27 00:00,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/27 00:00 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1054/MODI00100305 [doi]', 'S1084859296000240 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Diagn. 1996 Dec;1(4):305-313. doi: 10.1054/MODI00100305.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanisms for the extremely high susceptibility of myeloid stem cells to the leukemogenic effects of etoposide have not been elucidated. We propose a mechanism to account for the etoposide-induced secondary acute myelogenous leukemia and nutritional strategies to prevent this complication of etoposide therapy. We hypothesize that etoposide phenoxyl radicals (etoposide-O(.)) formed from etoposide by myeloperoxidase are responsible for its genotoxic effects in bone marrow progenitor cells, which contain constitutively high myeloperoxidase activity. Here, we used purified human myeloperoxidase, as well as human leukemia HL60 cells with high myeloperoxidase activity and provide evidence of the following. 1) Etoposide undergoes one-electron oxidation to etoposide-O(.) catalyzed by both purified myeloperoxidase and myeloperoxidase activity in HL60 cells; formation of etoposide-O(.)radicals is completely blocked by myeloperoxidase inhibitors, cyanide and azide. 2) Intracellular reductants, GSH and protein sulfhydryls (but not phospholipids), are involved in myeloperoxidase-catalyzed etoposide redox-cycling that oxidizes endogenous thiols; pretreatment of HL60 cells with a maleimide thiol reagent, ThioGlo1, prevents redox-cycling of etoposide-O(.) radicals and permits their direct electron paramagnetic resonance detection in cell homogenates. VP-16 redox-cycling by purified myeloperoxidase (in the presence of GSH) or by myeloperoxidase activity in HL60 cells is accompanied by generation of thiyl radicals, GS(.), determined by HPLC assay of 5, 5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline glytathionyl N-oxide glytathionyl nitrone adducts. 3) Ascorbate directly reduces etoposide-O(.), thus competitively inhibiting etoposide-O(.)-induced thiol oxidation. Ascorbate also diminishes etoposide-induced topo II-DNA complex formation in myeloperoxidase-rich HL60 cells (but not in HL60 cells with myeloperoxidase activity depleted by pretreatment with succinyl acetone). 4) A vitamin E homolog, 2,2,5,7, 8-pentamethyl-6-hydroxychromane, a hindered phenolic compound whose phenoxyl radicals do not oxidize endogenous thiols, effectively competes with etoposide as a substrate for myeloperoxidase, thus preventing etoposide-O(.)-induced redox-cycling. We conclude that nutritional antioxidant strategies can be targeted at minimizing etoposide conversion to etoposide-O(.), thus minimizing the genotoxic effects of the radicals in bone marrow myelogenous progenitor cells, i.e., chemoprevention of etoposide-induced acute myelogenous leukemia.","['Kagan, V E', 'Yalowich, J C', 'Borisenko, G G', 'Tyurina, Y Y', 'Tyurin, V A', 'Thampatty, P', 'Fabisiak, J P']","['Kagan VE', 'Yalowich JC', 'Borisenko GG', 'Tyurina YY', 'Tyurin VA', 'Thampatty P', 'Fabisiak JP']","['Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.

As a result, contemporary treatment strategies have focused on reducing therapy for patients with favorable disease presentations and reserved aggressive treatment modalities for patients with relapsed or refractory disease. The desire to avoid late treatment toxicity has prompted refinements in therapy designed to reduce growth impairment, second malignancy, and life-threatening organ dysfunction in long-term survivors. Treatment with radiation therapy alone is recommended only for older patients with localized disease who have achieved skeletal maturity, but requires surgical staging and places greater volumes of normal tissues at risk for late carcinogenesis. Treatment with chemotherapy alone avoids the long-term growth, organ dysfunction, and solid tumor induction associated with high-dose, extended-field radiation. However, these protocols prescribe higher cumulative doses of alkylating agent chemotherapy, which may increase the risk of treatment complications from myelosuppression, gonadal injury, and secondary leukemia. Combined modality therapy regimens have resulted in excellent treatment outcomes and reduced the incidence of treatment sequelae by utilizing lower doses and smaller volumes of radiation therapy and fewer cycles of less toxic chemotherapy in clinically staged children. Risk-adapted therapies using two to four cycles of multiagent chemotherapy and lower radiation doses and volumes have maintained excellent disease-free survival rates in clinically staged patients with localized favorable disease presentations. Novel approaches including compacted dose-intensive multiagent chemotherapy are currently under investigation with the objectives of improving outcome and reducing treatment sequelae in patients with advanced and unfavorable disease.","['Hudson, M M', 'Donaldson, S S']","['Hudson MM', 'Donaldson SS']","[""St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Hodgkin Disease/*therapy', 'Humans']",,1999/08/26 00:00,1999/08/26 00:01,['1999/08/26 00:00'],"['1999/08/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/26 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Semin Hematol. 1999 Jul;36(3):313-23.,,,,54,,,,,,,,,

HD has a complex epidemiology and EBV-associated cases are not randomly distributed. Disease occurring in early childhood and older adult age groups is more likely to be EBV-associated than for young adult cases. Paradoxically, there is more evidence supporting an infectious etiology in the latter group of younger patients. Defective EBV genomes and ""hit and run"" mechanisms involving EBV cannot account for all cases, and the direct involvement of known viral agents, including other lymphotropic herpesviruses, has largely been excluded.

In addition, GGA treatment interfered with the processing and membrane localization of Rap1 and Ras, and these changes may be a result of apoptosis. Moreover, nitric oxide donors significantly accentuated the GGA-induced apoptosis, suggesting that the apoptotic pathway induced by GGA might be regulated by a redox-sensitive mechanism.

We conclude that differential nuclear translocation of p65-NF-kappaB in LY sublines is not related to the lethal effect of the activating, damaging agent; rather it is due to the more efficient antioxidant defense in LY-S than in LY-R cells.","['Sochanowicz, B', 'Szumiel, I', 'Gradzka, I']","['Sochanowicz B', 'Szumiel I', 'Gradzka I']","['Department of Radiobiology and Health Protection, Institute of Nuclear Chemistry and Technology, Warsaw, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Radiat Environ Biophys,Radiation and environmental biophysics,0415677,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '9LHU78OQFD (Lovastatin)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antioxidants/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'DNA/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L5178/drug therapy/*genetics/radiotherapy', 'Lovastatin/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'NF-kappa B/drug effects/*genetics/radiation effects', 'Translocation, Genetic/*drug effects/*radiation effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/radiation effects']",,1999/08/26 00:00,1999/08/26 00:01,['1999/08/26 00:00'],"['1999/08/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s004110050148 [doi]'],ppublish,Radiat Environ Biophys. 1999 Jul;38(2):125-31. doi: 10.1007/s004110050148.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Identification of patients at risk and initiation of preventative interventions are the focus of medical and nursing management. Ongoing monitoring during and following cancer treatment is necessary to promote early response to changes in patient condition and minimize adverse events.

Growth factors can modulate these interactions (so-called 'inside-out' signalling) resulting in changes in ligand binding activity. We have studied alpha4beta1 integrin-mediated adhesion to the H120 fragment of fibronectin (which contains the strongest alpha4beta1 binding site) in CD34+ cells from patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) and have determined the effect of IL-3 on the level of adhesion. Compared to normal CD34+ cells isolated from cord blood and peripheral blood progenitor harvests (mean of 61.4 +/- 14.9% of cells attached) the CML CD34+ cells showed reduced levels of adhesion (mean of 41.9 +/- 14.7%, P < 0.05). The effect of 10 ng/ml of IL-3 resulting in reduced adhesion of normal CD34+ cells at 30 min was absent in 6/7 patients with CML. Abnormalities of adhesion to fibronectin may thus be related to IL-3 pathways affected by BCR-ABL.

Age and sex characteristics were similar in the two groups. 38 patients in the pentostatin group and 12 in the cladribine group were previously untreated. 22 patients in the cladribine group had received prior treatment with pentostatin; four were resistant, 17 had relapsed following partial (four) or complete (13) responses, and one was not evaluable for response. The response rates were the same in the two groups: 82% complete response (CR), 15% partial response (PR) for pentostatin and 84% CR, 16% PR for cladribine. Relapse rates were 24% for pentostatin and 29% for cladribine after median follow-up of 71 and 45 months respectively. At 45 months, however, the relapse rate for pentostatin was only 9.7%. We found a statistically significant difference in the disease-free interval (DFI) between the two groups suggesting that patients may relapse more quickly after cladribine. The majority of relapsed patients achieved second remissions following further therapy with either pentostatin or cladribine, with no evidence of cross resistance between the two agents. The 5-year survival for all patients was 97% and treatment- related toxicity was low. We conclude that both pentostatin and cladribine induce durable remissions in the majority of HCL patients.

Previously, we reported that expression of CD27 is deregulated in B-cell leukaemias and lymphomas. Here we show that, although infrequently expressed by normal human B cells in vivo, CD70 is found on 50% of B-CLLs, 33% of follicle centre lymphomas, 71% of large B-cell lymphomas, and 25% of mantle cell lymphomas. Interestingly, in the majority of leukaemias and lymphomas examined, CD70 was found to have a capped appearance, a feature that coincided with co-expression of CD27. Functional analysis showed that a subset of B-CLLs could proliferate vigorously in response to CD70 mAb but not to CD27 mAb. This response was synergistically enhanced by ligation of CD40 but inhibited by the presence of IL-4. Additional experiments indicated that the proliferative response was due to an agonistic signal delivered via CD70, rather than blocking of negative signalling by CD27. Thus, next to its role as ligand, in a subset of malignant B cells CD70 can operate as receptor and as such might contribute to progression of these B-cell malignancies.","['Lens, S M', 'Drillenburg, P', 'den Drijver, B F', 'van Schijndel, G', 'Pals, S T', 'van Lier, R A', 'van Oers, M H']","['Lens SM', 'Drillenburg P', 'den Drijver BF', 'van Schijndel G', 'Pals ST', 'van Lier RA', 'van Oers MH']","['Department of Immunobiology, CLB, and Laboratory for Experimental and Clinical Immunology, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD27 Ligand)', '0 (CD70 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7)']",IM,"['*Antigens, CD', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'CD27 Ligand', 'Cell Communication', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Membrane Proteins/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7/immunology']",,1999/08/25 00:00,1999/08/25 00:01,['1999/08/25 00:00'],"['1999/08/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/25 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/25 00:00 [entrez]']","['bjh1573 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.1999.01573.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1999 Aug;106(2):491-503. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1999.01573.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on the extensive junctional diversity, these rearrangements represent valuable targets for the analysis of minimal residual disease (MRD). In order to provide a simple method for the rapid detection of leukaemia clone-specific kappa deleting element (Kde) mediated rearrangements, we developed a multiplex PCR reaction that is able to amplify the five most frequent rearrangements in one tube. Position of the amplimers were chosen to enable identification of the involved segments according to the size of the PCR product. This method was tested on 101 B-lineage leukaemias (71 childhood B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemias (BCP ALL) and 30 chronic lymphocytic leukaemias (CLL)). 39 and 22 Kde rearrangements could be readily detected in 30 (44%) BCP ALL and 22 (56%) CLL, respectively. 36% of the Kde rearrangements in BCP ALL and 45% in CLL were intron recombination signal sequence (RSS)-Kde rearrangements.

The MCR Childhood Leukaemia Working Party.,436-44,"Between 1988 and 1995, 341 children with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) were treated on the Medical Research Council Acute Myeloid Leukaemia Trial (MRC AML10). The 5-year overall survival was 57%, much improved on previous trials. However, there were 47 deaths (13. 8%), 11 of which were associated with bone marrow transplantation (BMT). The treatment-related mortality was significant at 13.8%, but decreased in the latter half of the trial from 17.8% in 1998-91 to 9. 6% in 1992-95 (P = 0.03%). The main causes of death were infection (65.9%), haemorrhage (19.1%) and cardiac failure (19.1%). Fungal infection was a significant problem, causing 23% of all infective deaths. Haemorrhage occurred early in treatment, in children with initial white cell counts >100 x 109/l (P = 0.001), and was more common in those with M4 and M5 morphology. Cardiac failure only occurred from the third course of chemotherapy onwards, with 78% (7/9) in conjunction with sepsis as a terminal event. Some deaths could be prevented by identifying those most at risk, and with prompt recognition and aggressive management of complications of treatment. Future options include the prophylactic use of antifungal agents, and the use of cardioprotectants or alternatives to conventional anthracyclines to decrease cardiac toxicity.","['Riley, L C', 'Hann, I M', 'Wheatley, K', 'Stevens, R F']","['Riley LC', 'Hann IM', 'Wheatley K', 'Stevens RF']","['Department of Paediatrics, Middlesex Hospital, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*mortality', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Death, Sudden, Cardiac/etiology', 'Female', 'Hemorrhage/etiology/mortality', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Opportunistic Infections/etiology/mortality', 'Recurrence', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",,1999/08/25 00:00,1999/08/25 00:01,['1999/08/25 00:00'],"['1999/08/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/25 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/25 00:00 [entrez]']","['bjh1550 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.1999.01550.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1999 Aug;106(2):436-44. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1999.01550.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In response to erythropoietin (EPO) and haemin, HCD-57 cells proliferated and synthesized haemoglobin, but failed to complete terminal differentiation as indicated by lack of change in both gene expression and morphological appearance. In contrast, EPO-induced terminal differentiation in FVA and PHZ cells in vitro was accompanied by increases in haemoglobin positivity, morphological maturation and a shared pattern of gene expression. EPO receptor (EPO-R) mRNA levels peaked before globin gene expression which was maximal at 24 h. Peak GATA-1 and EKLF mRNA levels also preceded the globin gene peak, but the highest NF-E2 levels coincided with maximal globin levels, suggesting a role for NF-E2 in the maintenance, rather than the initiation of globin gene expression. Peak expression of delta-aminolaevulinic acid synthase (ALAS) coincided with peak globin expression.

Their median age was 39 years (range 14-59). The median interval from achievement of CR to ASCT was 4 months (2-8). The conditioning regimen was BAVC (BCNU, amsacrine, VP-16, cytarabine) in eight patients, BuCy (busulfan, cyclophosphamide) in 13, and TBI-Cy (total body irradiation, cyclophosphamide) in five. Relapse occurred after a median of 7 months (2-18). ASCT had been performed in CR1 for 23 patients and in CR2 for three. Nineteen patients had been given bone marrow, seven peripheral blood stem cells collected following consolidation plus G-CSF. Overall, CR was obtained by 13 patients (50%), all remitters requiring a single course. The median time for hematological recovery of neutrophils >500/microl and platelets >20,000/microl was 24 and 30 days, respectively. The median duration of G-CSF administration was 25 days, while the median hospitalization was 31 days. There were four deaths in induction (15%), while nine patients (35%) were resistant. After achieving CR, two patients received allogeneic BMT, five a second ASCT, and four were consolidated with HD-ARA-C. Only two patients were judged unable to receive any further therapy. There were 14 documented infections, while nine patients experienced fever of unknown origin. WHO >2 nonhematological toxicity consisted of stomatitis (50%), hepatic dysfunction (11%), diarrhea (11%), and lethargy (4%). Median overall survival and disease-free survival were 6 and 13 months, respectively. Six patients are in CCR at present. We conclude that FLAG is effective in patients with AML who are relapsing after ASCT. The toxicity is acceptable, enabling most patients to receive further treatment, including second transplantation procedures.","['Ferrara, F', 'Melillo, L', 'Montillo, M', 'Leoni, F', 'Pinto, A', 'Mele, G', 'Mirto, S']","['Ferrara F', 'Melillo L', 'Montillo M', 'Leoni F', 'Pinto A', 'Mele G', 'Mirto S']","['Divisione di Ematologia, Ospedale Cardarelli, Naples, Italy. ferrara@itb.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'FLAG protocol']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/mortality', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/*prevention & control/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives']",,1999/08/25 00:00,1999/08/25 00:01,['1999/08/25 00:00'],"['1999/08/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/25 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/25 00:00 [entrez]']","['90780380.277 [pii]', '10.1007/s002770050533 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 1999 Aug;78(8):380-4. doi: 10.1007/s002770050533.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is known to bind a gp130/ leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) receptor heterodimer and to induce myocyte hypertrophy. Accumulating evidence indicates that a gp130 signaling pathway is involved in cardiac development and ventricular hypertrophy. METHODS: In order to elucidate the pathophysiologic significance of cardiotrophin-1 in ventricular hypertrophy associated with hypertension, we examined the level of cardiotrophin-1 mRNA in the ventricle of spontaneously hypertensive rats/Izm stroke-prone (SHRSP/Izm) in neonates, and at 4-, 12- and 20-weeks of age by Northern blot analysis. We also examined the gene expression of LIF by Northern blot and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses. RESULTS: No significant difference was observed in the level of cardiotrophin-1 mRNA in the ventricle between SHRSP/ Izm and Wistar-Kyoto/Izm (WKY/Izm) neonates. However, the level of cardiotrophin-1 mRNA in the ventricle was significantly augmented in 4-week-old SHRSP/Izm, which did not yet show overt ventricular hypertrophy, and its augmented expression lasted for the duration of the experimental period. The difference in the level of cardiotrophin-1 mRNA between the two strains was most prominent at the age of 4 weeks. This augmented expression of the cardiotrophin-1 gene was not related to the severity of left ventricular hypertrophy. The level of cardiotrophin-1 mRNA in other organs, including the kidney and lung, showed no significant change with aging and was not different between the two strains. After long-term treatment with lisinopril, levels of cardiotrophin-1 mRNA were not changed, although it morphologically prevented the development of left ventricular hypertrophy. LIF mRNA was not detected in any ventricles examined by Northern blot analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that the expression of cardiotrophin-1 mRNA is increased in the early stage of ventricular hypertrophy in SHRSP/Izm and it remains elevated after hypertrophy has been established. However, it is unlikely that cardiotrophin-1 plays a mechanistic role in the development and maintenance of left ventricular hypertrophy in SHRSP/Izm. The present study also suggests that cardiotrophin-1, but not LIF, is a possible candidate for natural ligand of a gp130 signaling pathway in the heart.","['Ishikawa, M', 'Saito, Y', 'Miyamoto, Y', 'Harada, M', 'Kuwahara, K', 'Ogawa, E', 'Nakagawa, O', 'Hamanaka, I', 'Kajiyama, N', 'Takahashi, N', 'Masuda, I', 'Hashimoto, T', 'Sakai, O', 'Hosoya, T', 'Nakao, K']","['Ishikawa M', 'Saito Y', 'Miyamoto Y', 'Harada M', 'Kuwahara K', 'Ogawa E', 'Nakagawa O', 'Hamanaka I', 'Kajiyama N', 'Takahashi N', 'Masuda I', 'Hashimoto T', 'Sakai O', 'Hosoya T', 'Nakao K']","['Department of Medicine and Clinical Science, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Hypertens,Journal of hypertension,8306882,"['0 (Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'AJ7U77BR8I (cardiotrophin 1)', 'E7199S1YWR (Lisinopril)']",IM,"['Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Biomarkers', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis/drug effects/*genetics', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Gene Expression', 'Heart Ventricles/drug effects/pathology', 'Hypertension/complications/*genetics/metabolism', 'Hypertrophy, Left Ventricular/etiology/*genetics', 'Lisinopril/pharmacology', 'Male', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred SHR', 'Rats, Inbred WKY', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,1999/08/25 00:00,1999/08/25 00:01,['1999/08/25 00:00'],"['1999/08/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/25 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00004872-199917060-00013 [doi]'],ppublish,J Hypertens. 1999 Jun;17(6):807-16. doi: 10.1097/00004872-199917060-00013.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hemopoietic connective tissue is a special structure for autoregeneration and differentiation of stem cells. It forms hemopoiesis as the environment in which cells develop. Cell repopulation is the function of connective tissue and bone marrow. In leukemia involvement of the stroma creates conditions for tumor cell growth. Connective tissue disease at first manifests by imbalanced cell-to-cell interactions and then disorders cell repopulation and leads to appearance of abnormal cell forms. Abnormalities in cell development involve alteration of their biological properties. Fibrosis is a common biological phenomenon. It is one of manifestations of connective tissue functions. Fibrous tissue overgrowth in leukemia is to be regarded from a general biological viewpoint. Normally extension of the function of bone marrow hemopoiesis involves or is parallel with connective tissue growth which does not impair balanced interactions between cellular structures, their regeneration and degradation. Myelofibrosis, a form of fibrosis manifestations, is observed (in different measure) in all leukemias and is their integral component. Hemopoietic connective tissue is an ""incubator"" of SHC, and therefore, development of fibrosis is determined by the initial connective tissue involvement (disease) of nontumorous origin. In leukemia the same biological regularities, maintaining the organism viability, are in force, but their effect is distorted, because in leukemia the bulk of cells is many times higher than in health or even in disease. Moreover, increase of the bulk of cells occurrs under conditions of deficient bone marrow hemopoiesis, present to this or that measure in leukemia.","['Morozova, V T']",['Morozova VT'],,['rus'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Russia (Federation),Klin Lab Diagn,Klinicheskaia laboratornaia diagnostika,9432021,,IM,"['Cell Communication', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*etiology/*pathology', 'Stromal Cells/*pathology']",,1999/08/25 00:00,1999/08/25 00:01,['1999/08/25 00:00'],"['1999/08/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/25 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/25 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Klin Lab Diagn. 1999 Jun;(6):3-13.,,,,29,,Leikozy--bolezni stromy krovetvornykh organov (gipoteza),,,,,,,

The sequences were aligned and compared with ATK-1 prototype and published sequences. LTR sequences exhibited 1.5-2.4% of divergence with ATK-1. pX-sequenced regions showed a lower homology within p12(I) encoding sequences. Only few mutations were found within functionally important regions, but were not associated specifically with the clinical status. Finally, no mutations that could be related to sicca syndrome or argue the existence of clinical progression to TSP/HAM were found.

DESIGN: Data on 3 patients with acute leukemia receiving intrathecal methotrexate were prospectively analyzed. SETTING: Large tertiary-care center. RESULTS: All 3 patients with acute leukemia developed megaloblastic anemia confirmed by examination of the bone marrow aspirate and biopsy. Two of the 3 patients had low folic acid levels, while all patients had normal serum B(12) levels. All patients responded favorably to a therapeutic trial of folic acid. The median time for recovery of the hematologic parameters in these patients was 7 days. CONCLUSIONS: Intrathecally administered methotrexate may result in megaloblastic changes in the bone marrow of leukemic patients. The morphologic clues suggestive of folate deficiency in patients with acute leukemia may be masked by coexisting factors, such as the effects of cytotoxic treatment, prior transfusions, or persistent changes from the leukemic clone itself. Caution should be exercised to avoid attributing these changes to the neoplastic process, since the prognosis and treatment for the conditions involved are totally different. Repeat examination of the bone marrow, obtaining folic acid and vitamin B(12) levels, and a therapeutic trial of folic acid may help identify and reverse these changes.","['Sallah, S', 'Hanrahan, L R', 'Phillips, D L']","['Sallah S', 'Hanrahan LR', 'Phillips DL']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, East Carolina University, School of Medicine, Greenville, NC, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Arch Pathol Lab Med,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,7607091,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Anemia, Megaloblastic/blood/*chemically induced/complications/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Folic Acid/blood/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/blood/*complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*adverse effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*complications/drug therapy', 'Prospective Studies']",,1999/08/24 00:00,1999/08/24 00:01,['1999/08/24 00:00'],"['1999/08/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.5858/1999-123-0774-IMIMAI [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Pathol Lab Med. 1999 Sep;123(9):774-7. doi: 10.5858/1999-123-0774-IMIMAI.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dendritic cells (DC) are professional antigen-presenting cells (APC) able to present antigens in the context of co-stimulatory signals necessary for T cell activation. Although tumor cells may express tumor antigens, they are usually unable to elicit an immune response since they are devoid of co-stimulatory capacities. To overcome this problem, engineering tumors to provide APC function could potentially result in polyvalent immunization to multiple tumor antigens. We have tested the differentiation of AML-5 (monoblastic, promonocytic and monocytic) leukemia cells and demonstrated that eight out of the ten fresh human acute myeloid leukemia populations tested can differentiate in vitro into bona fide APC. Leukemic cells acquire in vitro DC morphology, mature DC markers such as CD83, the up-regulation of MHC and co-stimulatory molecules and the ability to produce IL-12 upon maturation, while retaining their characteristic caryotypic abnormalities. However, we could not obtain an immature DC phenotype. They also acquire the ability to induce the differentiation of allogeneic naive cord blood CD4 and CD8 T cells as well as resting autologous cytotoxic T cells. These results demonstrate that some tumor cells acquire APC phenotype and functions and can thereby induce a potent autologous immune response that will be a valuable tool for detection of new tumor antigens and for in vivo immunization.","['Charbonnier, A', 'Gaugler, B', 'Sainty, D', 'Lafage-Pochitaloff, M', 'Olive, D']","['Charbonnier A', 'Gaugler B', 'Sainty D', 'Lafage-Pochitaloff M', 'Olive D']","['U119 INSERM, Marseille, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (CD83 antigen)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Isoantigens)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/immunology/pathology', 'Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Autoantigens', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', 'CD40 Ligand', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunization', 'Immunoglobulins/metabolism', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interleukin-12/biosynthesis', 'Isoantigens', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology/*pathology']",,1999/08/24 00:00,1999/08/24 00:01,['1999/08/24 00:00'],"['1999/08/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/(SICI)1521-4141(199908)29:08<2567::AID-IMMU2567>3.0.CO;2-S [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1999 Aug;29(8):2567-78. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1521-4141(199908)29:08<2567::AID-IMMU2567>3.0.CO;2-S.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such an exceptionally long CDR3H is the first ever to be documented for an antibody in a species. These VDJ rearrangements encode functional IgM antibodies as some of these show polyspecific reactivity. The presence of even-numbered cysteine residues in the CDR3H may provide hitherto unknown configurational ability to the antigen combining site via intra-CDR3H disulfide bridging. In addition, the VDJ rearrangements encoding exceptionally long CDR3H paired with either novel V(lambda)1 or V(x)1x genes, earlier noted not to be expressed.

After APR, one T1 and four of seven T2 patients were NED at the time of last visit (2-7 years). One T1 patient died of local and distant disease. Three of seven T2 patients died with distant disease. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that sphincter preservation can be achieved with excellent cancer control without initial sacrifice of anal function in most patients. After local recurrence, salvage resection appears effective, but longer follow-up time of local and distant disease-free survival is advised before extrapolation to patients with T3 primaries.","['Steele, G D Jr', 'Herndon, J E', 'Bleday, R', 'Russell, A', 'Benson, A 3rd', 'Hussain, M', 'Burgess, A', 'Tepper, J E', 'Mayer, R J']","['Steele GD Jr', 'Herndon JE', 'Bleday R', 'Russell A', 'Benson A 3rd', 'Hussain M', 'Burgess A', 'Tepper JE', 'Mayer RJ']","['University of Chicago, IL 60637, USA. buckley@delphi.bsd.uchicago.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Ann Surg Oncol,Annals of surgical oncology,9420840,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/drug therapy/mortality/radiotherapy/*surgery', 'Anal Canal/*surgery', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Fluorouracil/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Prospective Studies', 'Radiotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Rectal Neoplasms/drug therapy/mortality/radiotherapy/*surgery', 'Survival Analysis', 'United States']",,1999/08/24 10:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1999/08/24 10:00'],"['1999/08/24 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1999/08/24 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10434-999-0433-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Surg Oncol. 1999 Jul-Aug;6(5):433-41. doi: 10.1007/s10434-999-0433-5.,,,"['CA722955/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA723286/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA724701/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,['Ann Surg Oncol. 1999 Jul-Aug;6(5):413-5.

Skin lesions are the feature of Fusarium and occur in the early period of the infection. In this case, during immunosuppression state after DLT, she presented with the whole body ache and erythematous lesions which appeared rapidly on her trunk and extremities. While administration of amphotericin B was started, her condition was further deteriorated and she died. Autopsy materials revealed that she had multiple fungal infection with different isolates, including Aspergillus and Candida in the brain, lung and liver, but not in the skin. With the immunohistochemical staining with specific antibody, Fusarium or Aspergillus infection was identified from the biopsy skin or autopsy brain, respectively.

METHODS: We analyzed the nature of malignant B-CLL B cells and their interactions with the microenvironment. RESULTS: B-CLL is a malignancy of a mantle zone-based subpopulation of anergic, self-reactive, activated CD5+ B cells devoted to the production of polyreactive natural autoantibodies. It is the quintessential example of a human malignancy that primarily involves defects in the induction of programmed cell death. An abnormal karyotype is observed in about 50% of patients with B-CLL. Patients with 13q14 abnormalities show heavy somatic mutation and have a benign disease. Trisomy 12 is associated with unmutated VH genes, atypical cellular morphology, and progressive disease. Extended cell survival is further shielded by a kinetic refractoriness likely promoted by abnormalities of the B-cell antigen receptor complex and favored by some cytokines that highlight a reciprocal dialog between malignant B and T cells. Because the tumor cells act as the major accessory cells, the accumulating malignant B-cell population per se is a hurdle to the production of normal antibodies and leads to a progressive and severe hypogammaglobulinemia. Conceivably, in the presence of certain immunoglobulin genes and when the T-cell control becomes deficient, activated malignant B cells may become able to present self-antigens and drive residual normal B cells to produce polyclonal autoantibodies restricted to self-antigens expressed only by blood cells and cause autoimmune cytopenias. CONCLUSION: The distinctiveness of B-CLL B cells explains why B-CLL is different from other B-cell tumors and accounts for the development of immune deficiency and autoimmunity.","['Caligaris-Cappio, F', 'Hamblin, T J']","['Caligaris-Cappio F', 'Hamblin TJ']","['Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche e Oncologia Umana, Universita di Torino, Ospedale Mauriziano Umberto I, Italy. fcaligaris@mauriziano.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['0 (Cytokines)'],IM,"['Autoimmunity', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cytokines/physiology', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/immunology/physiopathology']",,1999/08/24 00:00,1999/08/24 00:01,['1999/08/24 00:00'],"['1999/08/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1999.17.1.399 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1999 Jan;17(1):399-408. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1999.17.1.399.,,,,125,,,,,,,,,

The expression of CD56 has rarely been reported in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and has not been clinically characterized. Therefore, we examined the prognostic significance of CD56 expression in APL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified all reported cases of CD56+ APL in the medical literature and collected clinical, biologic, and therapeutic details. RESULTS: Data were obtained for 12 patients with CD56+ APL (> 20% blast expression of CD56), including four cases from a single institution with a total of 42 APL patients. All of the CD56+ APL patients had documented cytogenetic presence of t(15;17), and of the nine reported isotypes, eight (89%) were S-isoform. Only six CD56+ patients (50%) attained complete remission (CR); the other six individuals died within 35 days of presentation. Of the six patients who attained a CR, three (50%) relapsed at 111, 121, and 155 weeks, whereas three remained in continuous CR at 19, 90, and 109 weeks. Comparison of the control CD56- to CD56+ APL patients demonstrated that the latter group had a significantly lower fibrinogen level (P = .007), and among patients for whom data were available, there was a higher frequency of the S-isoform (P = .006). Additionally, the CR rate (50% v 84%, P = .025) and overall median survival (5 v 232 weeks; P = .019) were significantly inferior for CD56+ APL patients. CONCLUSION: CD56+ acute promyelocytic leukemia is infrequent, seems to occur more frequently with the S-isoform subtype, and may be associated with a lower CR rate and inferior overall survival.","['Murray, C K', 'Estey, E', 'Paietta, E', 'Howard, R S', 'Edenfield, W J', 'Pierce, S', 'Mann, K P', 'Bolan, C', 'Byrd, J C']","['Murray CK', 'Estey E', 'Paietta E', 'Howard RS', 'Edenfield WJ', 'Pierce S', 'Mann KP', 'Bolan C', 'Byrd JC']","['Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Washington, DC 20307, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['0 (CD56 Antigen)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'CD56 Antigen/*analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/immunology/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",,1999/08/24 00:00,1999/08/24 00:01,['1999/08/24 00:00'],"['1999/08/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1999.17.1.293 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1999 Jan;17(1):293-7. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1999.17.1.293.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Improving the degree of hematologic and cytogenetic response in patients with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive CML may improve prognosis. Both IFN-alpha and ara-C induce cytogenetic responses as single-agent therapy in CML. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred forty patients with Ph-positive early chronic-phase CML received subcutaneous injections of IFN-alpha 5 megaunits/m2 daily and ara-C 10 mg daily. Their median age was 46 years; 53% had good-risk disease, 33% had intermediate-risk disease, and 14% had poor-risk disease. Their results were compared with those of patients receiving IFN-alpha with or without intermittent ara-C (7 days/mo). RESULTS: A complete hematologic response (CHR) was achieved in 92% of patients. A cytogenetic response was seen in 74%: it was major in 50% (Ph-positive < 35%) and complete in 31% (Ph-positive 0%). With a median follow-up of 42 months, the 4-year estimated survival rote was 70% (95% confidence interval, 61% to 79%). Significant side effects included fatigue (43%; grade 3/4, 11%), weight loss (19%; grade 3/4, 11%), muscle and bone aches (20%; grade 3/4, 7%), oral ulcers (4%), diarrhea (6%), and neurologic changes (27%, grade 3/4, 6%). The median dose of IFN-alpha was 3.7 megaunits/m2 daily, mainly because of reductions for myelosuppression (70% of cases); the median ara-C dose was 7.5 mg daily. Prognostic risk groups were predictive for response to the IFN-alpha plus ara-C combination. The incidence of CHR was higher with IFN-alpha plus daily ara-C compared with IFN-alpha plus intermittent ara-C and IFN-alpha alone (no ara-C) (92% v 84% v 80%, P = .01), as were the incidences of cytogenetic response (74% v 73% v 58%; P = .003) and major cytogenetic response (50% v 38% v 38%; P = .06). The median time to achievement of major cytogenetic response was significantly shorter than that for previous IFN-alpha regimens (7 v 10 v 12 months; P < .01). However, with the present follow-up, the survival and time to blastic transformation were similar. CONCLUSION: The combination of IFN-alpha plus daily low-dose ara-C seems to be promising for the treatment of CML. High rates of CHR and cytogenetic response were observed with acceptable toxicity and a lower daily dose of IFN-alpha compared with our previous studies.","['Kantarjian, H M', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Smith, T L', 'Rios, M B', 'Cortes, J', 'Beran, M', 'Koller, C', 'Giles, F J', 'Andreeff, M', 'Kornblau, S', 'Giralt, S', 'Keating, M J', 'Talpaz, M']","['Kantarjian HM', ""O'Brien S"", 'Smith TL', 'Rios MB', 'Cortes J', 'Beran M', 'Koller C', 'Giles FJ', 'Andreeff M', 'Kornblau S', 'Giralt S', 'Keating MJ', 'Talpaz M']","['Department of Leukemia, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/diagnosis/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate']",,1999/08/24 00:00,1999/08/24 00:01,['1999/08/24 00:00'],"['1999/08/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1999.17.1.284 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1999 Jan;17(1):284-92. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1999.17.1.284.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The findings on magnetic resonance images of the femoral marrow were evaluated over periods of 1 to 92 months (median, 18 months) in 42 consecutive adult patients with newly diagnosed MDS. Magnetic resonance images were obtained by the T1-weighted spin echo method and the short T1 inversion recovery technique. RESULTS: Magnetic resonance images showed that the femoral marrow patterns changed from fatty, faint, or nodular to scattered or uniform as the disease progressed. Development of acute myeloid leukemia was observed in only 13 patients whose marrow exhibited a scattered or uniform pattern. The overall survival of the 29 patients with a scattered or uniform marrow pattern was significantly shorter than that of the 13 patients with a fatty, faint, or nodular marrow pattern (10.7% v 73.3% at 7 years; P < .01). The period of leukemia-free survival was also significantly shorter in the patients with a scattered or uniform marrow pattern versus a fatty, faint, or nodular pattern (37.7% v 100% at 7 years; P < .01).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy-five children who suffered a medullary relapse and achieved a second remission were treated with either an unmodified allogeneic HLA-matched sibling BMT after hyperfractionated total body irradiation (TBI) and cyclophosphamide (n = 38) or chemotherapy according to institutional chemotherapy protocols (n = 37). To avoid the bias of survival from the attainment of second remission in favor of BMT, the final comparative statistical analysis used the landmark approach and comprised 37 and 29 patients from the BMT and chemotherapy groups, respectively RESULTS: The disease-free survival (DFS) rate was 62% and 26% at 5 years, respectively, for the BMT and the chemotherapy groups (P = .03), with relapse rates of 19% and 67%, respectively, for these two groups (P = .01). There was an overall advantage for the BMT therapeutic approach, as compared with chemotherapy, for patients with ALL in CR2 (1) for patients with a WBC count (at diagnosis) of 20 x 10(9)/L or higher (DFS, 40% v 0%) and those with a WBC count of less than 20 x 10(9)/L (DFS, 73% v35%), (2) for patients whose duration of CR1 was less than 24 months (DFS 48% v 9%) and for patients whose duration of CR1 was 24 months or longer (DFS, 81% v 37%) and (3) for patients who were initially treated with intensive regimens incorporating more than five chemotherapy agents (DFS, 57% v 20%) and for patients treated with five agents or fewer (DFS, 72% v 32%). CONCLUSION: In our single-institution series, unmodified HLA-matched allogeneic sibling transplants using hyperfractionated TBI and cyclophosphamide for patients with ALL in CR2 have resulted in superior outcome with a significantly improved probability of DFS and a lower relapse rate, as compared with those for patients treated with chemotherapy, regardless of the duration of first remission, the disease characteristics at diagnosis, or the intensity of prior treatment during first remission.","['Boulad, F', 'Steinherz, P', 'Reyes, B', 'Heller, G', 'Gillio, A P', 'Small, T N', 'Brochstein, J A', 'Kernan, N A', ""O'Reilly, R J""]","['Boulad F', 'Steinherz P', 'Reyes B', 'Heller G', 'Gillio AP', 'Small TN', 'Brochstein JA', 'Kernan NA', ""O'Reilly RJ""]","['Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA. bouladf@mskcc.org']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/mortality/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",,1999/08/24 00:00,1999/08/24 00:01,['1999/08/24 00:00'],"['1999/08/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1999.17.1.197 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1999 Jan;17(1):197-207. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1999.17.1.197.,,,['P01 CA23766/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of leukemic cell karyotypes obtained from patients with new diagnoses of ALL who were treated at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital or by the Pediatric Oncology Group was performed to identify cases with the t(11;19)(q23;p13.3) translocation. Molecular analyses were performed on these cases to determine the status of the MLL gene and the presence of the MLL-ENL fusion transcript. RESULTS: Among 3,578 patients with ALL and successful cytogenetic analysis, we identified 35 patients with the t(11;19)(q23;p13.3) translocation: 13 infants and 11 older children had B-precursor leukemia, whereas 11 patients had a T-cell phenotype. Although all of the cases examined had MLL rearrangements and MLL-ENL fusion transcripts, outcome varied according to age and immunophenotype. Among B-precursor cases, only two of the 13 infants remain in complete remission, compared with six of the 11 older children. Most strikingly, no relapses have occurred among B-precursor patients 1 to 9 years of age or among T-cell patients. CONCLUSION: Although MLL gene rearrangements are generally associated with a dismal outcome in ALL, two distinct subsets with MLL-ENL fusions have an excellent prognosis. Our results suggest that patients with this genetic abnormality who have T-cell ALL or are 1 to 9 years of age should not be considered candidates for hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation during their first remission.","['Rubnitz, J E', 'Camitta, B M', 'Mahmoud, H', 'Raimondi, S C', 'Carroll, A J', 'Borowitz, M J', 'Shuster, J J', 'Link, M P', 'Pullen, D J', 'Downing, J R', 'Behm, F G', 'Pui, C H']","['Rubnitz JE', 'Camitta BM', 'Mahmoud H', 'Raimondi SC', 'Carroll AJ', 'Borowitz MJ', 'Shuster JJ', 'Link MP', 'Pullen DJ', 'Downing JR', 'Behm FG', 'Pui CH']","[""Department of Hematology/Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, the University of Tennessee College of Medicine, Memphis 38105-2794, USA. jeffrey.rubnitz@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (MLLT1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/immunology/mortality', 'Prognosis', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Transcription Factors', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,1999/08/24 00:00,1999/08/24 00:01,['1999/08/24 00:00'],"['1999/08/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1999.17.1.191 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1999 Jan;17(1):191-6. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1999.17.1.191.,,,"['CA-20,180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21,765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-71907/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three hundred sixty-eight patients with metastatic breast cancer, positive and/or unknown estrogen and progesterone receptors, zero or one prior trial of hormonal therapy, and no prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease were prospectively randomized into three groups. The groups of patients received either MA 160 mg/d (one tablet per day), MA 800 mg/d (five tablets per day), or MA 1,600 mg/d (10 tablets per day). RESULTS: Patient characteristics were well balanced in the three treatment groups. Three hundred sixty-six patients received treatment and were included in the analyses. The response rates were 23%, 27%, and 27% for the 160-mg, 800-mg, and 1,600-mg arms, respectively. Response duration correlated inversely with dose. Median durations of response were 17 months, 14 months, and 8 months for the 160-mg, 800-mg, and 1,600-mg arms, respectively. No significant differences in the treatment arms were noted for time to disease progression or for survival; survival medians were 28 months (low dose), 24 months (mid dose) and 29 months (high dose). The most frequent and troublesome toxicity, weight gain, was dose-related, with approximately 20% of patients on the two higher-dose arms reporting weight gain of more than 20% of their prestudy weight, compared with only 2% in the 160-mg dose arm. CONCLUSION: With a median follow-up of 8 years, these results demonstrate no advantage for dose escalation of MA in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.","['Abrams, J', 'Aisner, J', 'Cirrincione, C', 'Berry, D A', 'Muss, H B', 'Cooper, M R', 'Henderson, I C', 'Panasci, L', 'Kirshner, J', 'Ellerton, J', 'Norton, L']","['Abrams J', 'Aisner J', 'Cirrincione C', 'Berry DA', 'Muss HB', 'Cooper MR', 'Henderson IC', 'Panasci L', 'Kirshner J', 'Ellerton J', 'Norton L']","['University of Maryland Cancer Center, Baltimore, MD, USA.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred eighty-three patients with inoperable stage III non-small-cell lung cancer were entered onto a randomized trial by the Cancer and Leukemia Group B and the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group. Randomization was performed before initiation of any therapy. All patients received an induction chemotherapy program with vinblastine and cisplatin for 5 weeks, followed by 6,000 cGy of radiation therapy over 6 weeks. One hundred thirty-seven patients were randomized to this therapy regimen alone; 146 patients were randomized to receive carboplatin at 100 mg/m2/wk concurrent with the radiation therapy. RESULTS: The complete response was 18% with concurrent carboplatin versus 10% with radiotherapy alone (P = .101). There was no difference with respect to failure-free survival (10% with carboplatin and 9% with radiotherapy alone) or overall survival (13% with carboplatin and 10% with radiotherapy alone) at 4 years. In patients not receiving carboplatin, the relapse rate was 69% within the field of radiation and 53% in the boost volume. In patients receiving carboplatin, the relapse rate was 59% within the field of radiation and 43% in the boost volume. Patients with cancers more than 70 cm2 in size had significantly poorer survival (P = .01). CONCLUSION: Carboplatin at the dose and schedule used did not significantly impact on disease control or survival. The relapse rate within the chest remained more than 50%. More effective regimens will be required to impact on local disease control and survival.","['Clamon, G', 'Herndon, J', 'Cooper, R', 'Chang, A Y', 'Rosenman, J', 'Green, M R']","['Clamon G', 'Herndon J', 'Cooper R', 'Chang AY', 'Rosenman J', 'Green MR']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Iowa College of Medicine, Iowa City 52242, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Radiation-Sensitizing Agents)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', 'BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Carboplatin/*administration & dosage', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/drug therapy/mortality/*radiotherapy/secondary', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy/mortality/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Radiation-Sensitizing Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Survival Rate', 'Vinblastine/administration & dosage']",,1999/08/24 00:00,1999/08/24 00:01,['1999/08/24 00:00'],"['1999/08/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1999.17.1.4 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1999 Jan;17(1):4-11. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1999.17.1.4.,,,"['CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47559/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,['J Clin Oncol. 1999 Jan;17(1):1-3.

The Italian Co-operative Study Group on Chronic Myeloid Leukemia.,707-15,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Alpha-interferon (alphaIFN) can induce cytogenetic remissions in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Hemopoietic progenitors can be collected from the marrow in remission and utilized for autologous repopulation after high dose chemotherapy. This study was designed with the purpose of evaluating the feasibility of a combined treatment policy of alphaIFN followed by autologous bone marrow transplantation (autoBMT). DESIGN AND METHODS: A prospective study of alphaIFN and autoBMT was begun in 1989. Two hundred and seventy-two consecutive previously untreated non-blastic Ph positive chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients, who were less than 56 years old, were enrolled over a 3-year period (1989-1991) and were assigned to receive human recombinant alphaIFN 2a (Roferon-A) at a dose of 9 MIU daily for at least one year. If they achieved a cytogenetic response consisting in a percentage of Ph neg metaphases of more than 25%, they were eligible for marrow harvesting and subsequent autografting after high dose busulfan (16 mg/kg) and melphalan (60 mg/m(2)). RESULTS: Seventy-six patients (28%) were eligible for a marrow harvest but the marrow was harvested in only 37 cases (14%), and only twenty-three patients (8%) were actually autografted. One patient died of infection nine days after autoBMT. The other patients recovered and did not suffer any late adverse events. Five patients progressed to blastic phase, six are alive in complete hematologic remission and eleven are alive in complete hematologic and cytogenetic remission. AlphaIFN treatment was reinstituted after autoBMT in 18 of 22 cases, but four patients who are in continuous complete cytogenetic remission were not given alphaIFN anymore. The progression-free survival of the autografted patients is 65% 8 years after registration. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that bone marrow hemopoietic progenitors (Ph neg and Ph pos) can be collected from patients who respond to alphaIFN and can be used to rescue hemopoietic activity after high dose chemotherapy. Though some complete and durable cytogenetic remissions were obtained, the treatment could be applied only to a small group of good risk patients, highlighting that selection is very important and results cannot be extrapolated to the average patient.","['Meloni, G', 'Russo, D', 'Baccarani, M', 'Testoni, N', 'Martinelli, G', 'Fanin, R', 'Zuffa, E', 'Rosti, G', 'Alimena, G', 'Saglio, G', 'Mandelli, F', 'Tura, S']","['Meloni G', 'Russo D', 'Baccarani M', 'Testoni N', 'Martinelli G', 'Fanin R', 'Zuffa E', 'Rosti G', 'Alimena G', 'Saglio G', 'Mandelli F', 'Tura S']","['Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, University ""La Sapienza"", Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/*administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",,1999/08/24 00:00,1999/08/24 00:01,['1999/08/24 00:00'],"['1999/08/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/24 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1999 Aug;84(8):707-15.,,,,,['Haematologica. 1999 Aug;84(8):674.

We present the first comprehensive study analyzing induction and consolidation therapy of biphenotypic leukemia and correlate outcome to prognostic factors. DESIGN AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, the incidence of biphenotypic leukemia was found to be 3.6% from 693 adult and pediatric acute leukemias referred to our center for treatment over the last 8 years. Of these, 15 were B-lymphoid/myeloid, 8 were T-lymphoid/myeloid, one was T/B lymphoid and one had trilineage differentiation. RESULTS: Induction of remission in de novo cases was achieved in 70% of patients and relapse of disease occurred in 15%. The use of combined lymphoid and myeloid drugs for induction resulted in a high incidence of early deaths (25%). The overall probability of survival at 2 years was 39.4%. Patients with secondary disease had a uniformly poor outcome with low remission rates and high relapse rates. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Prognosis was most strongly related to the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome (p=0.03) and age under 15 years (p=0.01). We conclude that patients with biphenotypic leukemia should have risk stratification with treatment tailored to their prognostic factors.","['Killick, S', 'Matutes, E', 'Powles, R L', 'Hamblin, M', 'Swansbury, J', 'Treleaven, J G', 'Zomas, A', 'Atra, A', 'Catovsky, D']","['Killick S', 'Matutes E', 'Powles RL', 'Hamblin M', 'Swansbury J', 'Treleaven JG', 'Zomas A', 'Atra A', 'Catovsky D']","[""Department of Haematology, St George's Hospital Medical School, Cranmer Terrace, London SW17 ORE, UK. skillick@btinternet.com""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'T-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Treatment Outcome']",,1999/08/24 00:00,1999/08/24 00:01,['1999/08/24 00:00'],"['1999/08/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/24 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1999 Aug;84(8):699-706.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A site-specific cleavage of the ALL1 gene in a consensus sequence for topoisomerase II recognition has been considered to be the initial step leading to ALL1 rearrangement and subsequent therapy-related AL. The aim of the present study was to evaluate this cleavage in our patients, to analyze whether it is a laboratory-produced artefact and to check whether it persists or causes a real ALL1 gene rearrangement at relapse. DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied ALL1 rearrangement in 74 cases of AL before treatment by Southern blot avoiding room temperature exposure or delay in processing the samples which could produce ALL1 cleavage. DNA was available for two cases with ALL1 cleavage; it was analyzed by three different Southern blots in one and two in the other. One case with ALL1 cleavage was also studied in relapse. RESULTS: The presence of the cleavage of the ALL1 DNA was found in 3 of 74 (4%) patients. Two of these three patients had the ALL1 cleavage in three and two different analyses. One case was positive for ALL1 cleavage at diagnosis, but negative for both ALL1 cleavage and ALL1 rearrangement at relapse. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The fact that a constant pattern was obtained from the same patients in different DNA preparations, supports the notion that ALL1 cleavage is not a laboratory artefact. The absence of the cleavage in a sample from a relapsed patient suggests that the subclone with the ALL1 cleavage, in this case, did not play a clear role in the pathogenesis of disease recurrence.","['Anguita, E', 'Villegas, A', 'Serra, A', 'Gonzalez, F A', 'Ropero, P', 'Contra, T', 'Saglio, G']","['Anguita E', 'Villegas A', 'Serra A', 'Gonzalez FA', 'Ropero P', 'Contra T', 'Saglio G']","['Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinico San Carlos, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Recurrence', '*Transcription Factors']",,1999/08/24 00:00,1999/08/24 00:01,['1999/08/24 00:00'],"['1999/08/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/24 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1999 Aug;84(8):695-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These aberrations have been described in all FAB subtypes with the exception of M3, and in MDS and in megakaryoblastic crisis of chronic myeloid leukemia. We reviewed the biological and clinical features of 10 cases of AML with inv(3)(q21q26) and t(3;3)(q21;q26). DESIGN AND METHODS: Four hundred and sixteen patients with AML were studied in our Institute by cytogenetic analysis and 10 (2.4%) showed inv(3)(q21q26) (7 patients) or t(3;3)(q21;q26) (3 patients): 7 males, 3 females; median age, 43.5 yrs. We also used RT-PCR to investigate the pattern of expression of the EVI-1 gene in 5 patients. RESULTS: Additional chromosomal changes were demonstrated in 6 patients. In 5/10 cases a preceding MDS had been observed. A possible occupational exposure was established in 2 patients (a farmer and an histologist employing organic solvents) and another patient had a therapy-related leukemia. AML subtype was M1 in 9 patients and M2 in 1. A variable excess of micromegakaryocytes was observed in all the patients. In 5 patients the platelet count was normal or increased (median number: 172. 5x10(9)/L; range 55-440). Expression of EVI-1 gene was present in all the 5 patients studied. The clinical course and outcome was extremely poor: 9/10 patients were resistant and 1 patient showed a partial remission after induction therapy. Of the 9 patients resistant to the first line chemotherapy, 7 were also resistant to the second line chemotherapy. Three patients obtained a morphologic complete remission after third line chemotherapy (duration 1, 3 and 6 months); 2 of them were submitted to autologous bone marrow transplantation, but relapsed after 1 and 3 months. The median overall survival was 5.5 months. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our findings evidence a strong correlation between 3q21q26 chromosomal aberrations, abnormalities of megakaryocytopoiesis and lack of response to conventional chemotherapy and support the diagnostic and prognostic relevance of chromosome characterization in the classification of AML.","['Testoni, N', 'Borsaru, G', 'Martinelli, G', 'Carboni, C', 'Ruggeri, D', 'Ottaviani, E', 'Pelliconi, S', 'Ricci, P', 'Pastano, R', 'Visani, G', 'Zaccaria, A', 'Tura, S']","['Testoni N', 'Borsaru G', 'Martinelli G', 'Carboni C', 'Ruggeri D', 'Ottaviani E', 'Pelliconi S', 'Ricci P', 'Pastano R', 'Visani G', 'Zaccaria A', 'Tura S']","['Institute of Hematology and Medical Oncology Seragnoli, University of Bologna, Italy. ntestoni@med.unibo.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', '*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes', 'Middle Aged']",,1999/08/24 00:00,1999/08/24 00:01,['1999/08/24 00:00'],"['1999/08/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/24 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1999 Aug;84(8):690-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The incorporation of (13)C-labeled amino acids into cellular proteins, which reflects the level of new protein synthesis, was monitored by (13)C-NMR spectroscopy. In the absence of dexamethasone, the level of protein synthesis was found to be significantly different among the three cell lines. Dexamethasone caused a significant reduction ( congruent with 60-87%) in the level of protein synthesis in dexamethasone-sensitive CEM-C7-14 cells, while having no significant effect on protein synthesis in dexamethasone-resistant CEM-4R4 cells. Dexamethasone treatment caused a significant enhancement of the level of protein synthesis in the CEM-ICR27-4 cells.

METHODOLOGY: This was an open study with one group. Healthy varicella-susceptible adults and children living in the same household as children with cancer or leukaemia were vaccinated with a new live attenuated varicella vaccine (Oka strain) which is stable when stored at 2-8 degrees C (refrigerator temperature) for at least 24 months (Varilrix). Children less than 13 years of age received one dose (0.5 mL containing at least 103.3 plaque forming units) by subcutaneous injection and those aged over 13 years received two doses 8 weeks apart. Adverse reactions following vaccination were recorded daily by the vaccinees. Post-vaccination antibody estimation was determined using indirect immunofluorescence 6 weeks after vaccination. RESULTS: Thirty-five seronegative subjects (28 children and 7 adults and adolescents) were vaccinated. All subjects tested (34) had seroconverted after vaccination. Local injection site reactions were experienced by 15/35. Other adverse reactions were uncommon (rash 2/35, fever (>/= 37.5 degrees C) 3/35). No cases of clinical varicella occurred amongst the high-risk household contacts of the vaccine. CONCLUSION: This is the first study of this formulation of varicella vaccine in household contacts of children with cancer or leukaemia. The vaccine was found to be safe and immunogenic, but further follow-up is needed to document duration of immunity.","['Kappagoda, C', 'Shaw, P', 'Burgess, M', 'Botham, S', 'Cramer, L']","['Kappagoda C', 'Shaw P', 'Burgess M', 'Botham S', 'Cramer L']","['Centre for Immunisation Research, Parramatta, NSW, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Australia,J Paediatr Child Health,Journal of paediatrics and child health,9005421,['0 (Chickenpox Vaccine)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Chickenpox/immunology/*prevention & control', 'Chickenpox Vaccine/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', '*Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Infant', '*Leukemia/drug therapy/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Neoplasms/drug therapy/immunology']",,1999/08/24 00:00,1999/08/24 00:01,['1999/08/24 00:00'],"['1999/08/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['jpc382 [pii]'],ppublish,J Paediatr Child Health. 1999 Aug;35(4):341-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT).,231-45,"Data from the annual survey on transplant activity 1997, collected from 457 transplant teams in 31 European countries by the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) were used to describe current status and to assess relative and absolute changes in indication, donor type and stem cell source compared to 1991. A total of 16950 patients were reported to have a first blood or marrow transplant in 1997, a total of 18 923 procedures, including re- and double transplants were performed. Of the 16950 first transplants, 4751 (28%) were allogeneic, 12199 (72%) autologous transplants. Of the autologous transplants, 829 (7%) were bone marrow derived, 11370 (93%) from peripheral blood stem cells or combined bone marrow and peripheral blood stem cell transplants. Of the allogeneic transplants, 3311 (70%) were bone marrow, 1440 (30%) were peripheral blood stem cell transplants. In 1991, the respective figures were 2175 allogeneic (44%) and 2786 (56%) autologous transplants, more than 90% of the autologous, all allogeneic transplants bone marrow derived. Main indications in 1997 were leukemias with 5253 transplants (31%), 70% allogeneic; lymphomas with 6773 transplants (40%), 94% autologous; solid tumors with 4154 transplants (24%), 99% autologous; non-malignant disorders with 770 transplants (5 %), 85 % allogeneic. There was an absolute increase of 11971 transplants since 1991. An increase was observed in all disease categories. Marked differences were found, when the relative increase index (RII) for specific disease categories over time was analyzed. In allogeneic transplants, relatively more transplants were performed in 1997 for acute myeloid leukemia beyond 1st complete remission (RII 1.28), myelodysplastic syndromes (RII 1.58), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (RII 1.33) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (RII 1.58). For autologous transplant indications, a high relative increase index was observed in myelodysplastic syndromes (RII 3.77), in multiple myeloma (RII 2.12) and carcinoma of the breast (RII 6.37) with a relative decrease in leukemias (RII 0.39) and certain solid tumors such as glioma (RII 0.27) and neuroblastoma (RII 0.46). These data present the current status of blood and marrow transplantation in Europe. They show the change from bone marrow to blood as stem cell source and highlight shifts in indication.

METHODS: The medical records of 115 children less than 18 years old who had splenectomy for various hematological disorders were reviewed. Twenty of them had splenectomy for massive splenomegaly (spleen weight > or =1,000 g). The records of these were reviewed for age at operation, gender, hematological diagnosis, indication for splenectomy, operative procedures, postoperative complications, and outcome. RESULTS: Twenty children had splenectomy for massive splenomegaly. There were 16 males and 4 females. Their ages ranged from 4 to 15 years (mean 11.2). Twelve had sickle cell disease, 5 had sickle-beta-thalassemia, 1 had beta-thalassemia major, 1 had thalassemia intermediate, and 1 had chronic myeloid leukemia. The indications for splenectomy were hypersplenism in 11, recurrent splenic sequestration crisis in 8, and splenic abscess in 1. The transfusion requirements in the patient with beta-thalassemia major decreased markedly postoperatively from 18 transfusions/year to only 4 transfusions/year; and for those with hypersplenism, there was a marked improvement in their blood parameters following splenectomy.

The multi-drug resistance (MDR1) gene product, P-glycoprotein is expressed mainly in CD34 positive AML cells and Bcl-2 is expressed simultaneously with several putative drug resistance parameters in these cells. Bcl-2 over-expression is associated with CD34 positivity, poor response to chemotherapy and reduced overall survival in AML patients. Recently, all-trans retinoic acid (RA) has been reported to enhance cytarabine-induced apoptosis and downregulate Bcl-2 in several human myeloid leukaemia CD34 negative cells. The two CD34 positive human myeloid leukaemia cell lines: KG1 and KGla have the unique feature of expressing significant functional P-glycoprotein. Thus, the efficacy of RA in enhancing cytrabine- and fludarabine-induced apoptosis and overcoming the resistance was examined in both KG1 (CD34+CD7-) and KGla (CD34+CD7+) human myeloid leukaemia cells in the present study. Both cytarabine and fludarabine induced a dose dependent increase in the number of apoptotic cells in both CD34 positive cell types. Interestingly, the cytarabine-induced apoptosis was significantly more than fludarabine-induced apoptosis in both cell types. All-trans RA alone failed to induce apoptosis or inhibit proliferation of either of the two human CD34 positive leukaemia cell types. However, RA enhanced cytarabine- or fludarabine-induced apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation in KG1 CD34+CD7- but not in KGla CD34+CD7+ myeloid leukaemia cells. As single agents, RA, cytarabine and fludarabine reduced Bcl-2 expression in a dose dependent manner in both cell types. Using a quantitative ELISA assay, the Bcl-2 protein concentration was reduced by 86 or 100%, after 72 h of treatment with 10 microM cytarabine or fludarabine, respectively, in both CD34 positive leukaemia cell types. The addition of RA to cytarabine enhanced its induced reduction of Bcl-2 in KG1 CD34+CD7- but not in KGla CD34+CD7+ human myeloid leukaemia cells. Meanwhile, RA failed to augment fludarabine-induced reduction of Bcl-2 in both cell types. In conclusion, the present results suggest a potential role for the combination of RA and cytarabine in the treatment of refractory and/or relapsed AML patients with CD34+CD7- but not CD34+CD7+ blast cells.","['Ahmed, N', 'Laverick, L', 'Sammons, J', 'Baumforth, K R', 'Hassan, H T']","['Ahmed N', 'Laverick L', 'Sammons J', 'Baumforth KR', 'Hassan HT']","['Division of Biomedical Sciences, School of Health Sciences, University of Wolverhampton, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/*immunology', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",,1999/08/24 00:00,1999/08/24 00:01,['1999/08/24 00:00'],"['1999/08/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/24 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212699000843 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(99)00084-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1999 Aug;23(8):741-9. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(99)00084-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This effect can be significantly enhanced by interleukin (IL)-3. In this context it has been demonstrated that IL-3 induces the release of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and transforming growth factor beta1 (TGFbeta1) from megakaryocytes, factors known to enhance fibroblast proliferation. The present in vitro study was performed to elucidate the action of several other cytokines which are able to influence the different steps of megakaryocyte maturation and function like stem cell factor (SCF), IL-6, and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) as well. Following an appropriate experimental design we were able to show that none of the mentioned cytokines enhanced megakaryocyte dependent fibroblast proliferation in the coculture assays. On the other hand, IL-6 in combination with IL-3 surpassed the IL-3 dependent action significantly. However, the combined IL-3/IL-6 effect was not explainable by an increased PDGF/TGF-beta secretion of the megakaryocytes. In transwell experiments the inhibition of cell-to-cell contact via tissue culture inserts generated a conspicuous impairment of fibroblast growth in the IL-3/IL-6 treated cocultures. This reversal surpassed even the effect on the untreated and IL-3 stimulated cocultures. Hence, a direct contact of both cell types probably inducing adhesion phenomenons and warranting a certain threshold of local PDGF/TGF-beta concentration is a prerequisite for the proliferative effect on fibroblasts in the costimulation experiments. These results are of special interest regarding the evolution of myelofibrosis in chronic myeloproliferative disorders (CMPDs) because (1) various progenitor cells including the megakaryocytic lineage are hypersensitive towards IL-3 and (2) an abnormal secretion of IL-6 is described for megakaryocytes in these disorders.","['Schmitz, B', 'Wickenhauser, C', 'Thiele, J', 'Frimpong, S', 'Brockbals, C', 'Selbach, B', 'Mueller, C', 'Fischer, R']","['Schmitz B', 'Wickenhauser C', 'Thiele J', 'Frimpong S', 'Brockbals C', 'Selbach B', 'Mueller C', 'Fischer R']","['Institute of Pathology, University of Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)']",IM,"['*Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Fibroblasts/cytology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Megakaryocytes/*cytology', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/metabolism']",,1999/08/24 00:00,1999/08/24 00:01,['1999/08/24 00:00'],"['1999/08/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/24 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(99)00091-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(99)00091-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1999 Aug;23(8):723-9. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(99)00091-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analyses of data from randomized trials are complex, conclusions sometimes contradictory and results not sufficiently detailed to allow subject-level decisions. OBJECTIVE: To determine appropriate use of high-dose therapy and bone marrow transplants in persons with AML in 1st remission with specific features. Develop a treatment algorithm. PANELISTS: Nine leukemia experts from diverse geographic sites and practice settings. EVIDENCE: Boolean MEDLINE searches of acute myelogenous leukemia and chemotherapy and/or transplants. CONSENSUS PROCESS: We used a modified Delphi-panel group judgment process. Age, WBC, cytogenetics and FAB-type were permuted to define 72 clinical settings. Each panelist rated appropriateness of high-dose therapy and a transplant versus conventional-dose chemotherapy on a nine-point ordinal scale (1, most inappropriate, 9, most appropriate) considering 3 types of donors: (1) HLA-identical siblings; (2) alternative donors (HLA-matched related or unrelated people other than an HLA-identical sibling); and (3) autotransplants. An appropriateness index was developed based on median rating and amount of disagreement. The relationship of appropriateness indices to the permuted clinical variables was considered by analysis of variance and recursive partitioning. Preference between donor types was analyzed by comparing mean appropriateness indices of comparable settings and a treatment algorithm developed. CONCLUSIONS: In people with an HLA-identical sibling, this type of transplant was rated appropriate in those with unfavorable cytogenetics and uncertain in all other settings. In people without an HLA-identical sibling, an alternative donor transplant was rated appropriate in those < 30 years with unfavorable cytogenetics, uncertain in those > 30 years and unfavorable cytogenetics and inappropriate in all other settings. Autotransplants were rated appropriate in people with unfavorable cytogenetics and uncertain in all other settings. An HLA-identical sibling donor, when available, was always preferred to an alternative donor transplant or autotransplant. In people without an HLA-identical sibling, an autotransplant was almost always favored over an alternative donor transplant with the magnitude of preference inversely correlated with transplant appropriateness.","['Gale, R P', 'Park, R E', 'Dubois, R W', 'Herzig, G P', 'Hocking, W G', 'Horowitz, M M', 'Keating, A', 'Kempin, S', 'Linker, C A', 'Schiffer, C A', 'Wiernik, P H', 'Weisdorf, D J', 'Rai, K R']","['Gale RP', 'Park RE', 'Dubois RW', 'Herzig GP', 'Hocking WG', 'Horowitz MM', 'Keating A', 'Kempin S', 'Linker CA', 'Schiffer CA', 'Wiernik PH', 'Weisdorf DJ', 'Rai KR']","['Salick Health Care, Inc., Los Angeles, CA 90048-4520, USA. r.p.gale@salick.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Evidence-Based Medicine', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/*therapy', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",,1999/08/24 00:00,1999/08/24 00:01,['1999/08/24 00:00'],"['1999/08/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/24 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212699000442 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(99)00044-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1999 Aug;23(8):709-18. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(99)00044-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously ATRA has been shown to inhibit the growth in vitro, of established human myeloma cell lines as well as cultured primary myeloma cells from patients. ATRA acts by down-regulating IL-6-receptor-alpha or gp130 on the surface of the myeloma cells. However, despite its in vitro effects on myeloma cells, ATRA therapy on advanced stage multiple myeloma (MM) patients has so far largely been ineffective. In current studies, we have assessed the efficacy of ATRA therapy against primary murine plasma cell tumors, which are an animal model for human MM. These tumors are induced at about 50% incidence in pristane-primed BALB/c mice by injection of v-raf/v-myc- containing retroviruses and are IL-6 dependent. Using this animal model, we assessed the effect of ATRA as a therapeutic agent against primary tumors at two early time points in disease development. ATRA was administered in liposomal vesicles (ATRAGEN), since liposomal-ATRA has been shown to circumvent clearance mechanisms by hepatic microsomes, which normally occur with free ATRA. In addition, ATRAGEN was previously shown to be less toxic in mice than free ATRA. ATRAGEN was administered beginning on day 25 or day 45 after virus injection and continued twice weekly for 8-11 weeks. ATRAGEN administration begun at either time point did not alter the incidence or the latency of plasma cell tumors compared with control animals. These results suggest that ATRA may not be an effective sole therapy against early MM.","['Swaminathan, N', 'Lopez-Berestein, G', 'Rudikoff, S']","['Swaminathan N', 'Lopez-Berestein G', 'Rudikoff S']","['Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Biology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Terpenes)', '26HZV48DT1 (pristane)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Liposomes', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Plasmacytoma/*drug therapy', 'Terpenes', 'Tretinoin/*therapeutic use']",,1999/08/24 00:00,1999/08/24 00:01,['1999/08/24 00:00'],"['1999/08/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02785845 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol. 1999 Jul;16(2):119-28. doi: 10.1007/BF02785845.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The protein binding of IDA was determined using equilibrium dialysis. Cell uptake of IDA was measured using sensitive and P-gp-containing resistant human leukemic cell lines (HL-60 and HL-60-Vinc) in vitro. IDA was assayed spectrophotofluorometrically. RESULTS: In the incubation media examined, the free fraction of IDA varied more than seven-fold from approximately 60% in 15% fetal calf serum (FCS)/PBS to only 8% in human serum. Cellular uptake of IDA was approximately three times higher in medium containing low protein concentrations. R-VRP eliminated the difference in IDA uptake between resistant and sensitive cell lines and this was the case when the cells were incubated in solutions containing both high and low protein concentrations. However, R-VRP did not overcome the effect of high protein concentrations on IDA uptake. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma protein binding is an important determinant for cellular uptake of IDA in vitro. This should be taken into account when interpreting results of in vitro functional assays with patient material. Chemosensitizers such as R-VRP are effective in both high and low protein solutions. Investigations like these may be useful for evaluating cytostatic efficacy and chemosensitizer action in vivo.","['Kessel, M', 'Gieseler, F', 'Woodcock, B G']","['Kessel M', 'Gieseler F', 'Woodcock BG']","['Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, J.W.

METHODS: Pharmacokinetic studies were performed in 27 patients with a diagnosis of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), who were being treated with a combination chemotherapy regimen including idarubicin and cytarabine for the induction of a first remission (n = 14), or of a second remission (n = 7), or for remission consolidation (n = 6). Of these 27 patients, nine were coadministered CyA and seven were coadministered CyA plus D-Ver as MDR modulators. Blood was sampled at appropriate intervals after each of the three IDA daily administrations. IDA and idarubicinol (IDAOL) were assayed by HPLC. Pharmacokinetic evaluations were performed by means of a two-compartment open model with zero-order absorption and first-order elimination using the WinNonlin pharmacokinetic software package. RESULTS: CyA markedly increased the area under the concentration time-curve (AUC) of both IDA [558.26 (197.25) microg x h x l(-1) vs 315.44 (158.28) microg x h x l(-1); P < 0.01] and IDAOL [2896.60 (736.38) microg x h x l(-1) vs 1028.49 (603.95) microg x h x l(-1); P < 0.001] when coadministered as a single modulator, due to a lower total body clearance (CL) [83.51 (52.44) l x h(-1) x m(-2) vs 139.65 (69.45) l x h(-1) x m(-2); NS]. When patients received two MDR modulators simultaneously (D-Ver plus CyA), IDA exposure was essentially the same as in those of the no inhibitor group [331.29 (95.49) microg x h x l(-1) vs 315.44 (158.28) microg x h x l(-1); NS], whereas the IDAOL total body exposure was greater than in the no inhibitor group [2030.32 (401.11) microg x h x l(-1) vs 1028.49 (603.95) microg x h x l(-1); P < 0.01], even if less than in patients receiving CyA as a single MDR modulator (IDA + CyA group) [AUC 2030.32 (401.11) microg x h x l(-1) vs 2896.60 (736.38) microg x h x l(-1); P < 0.05], suggesting an antagonistic effect against those of CyA on IDA and IDAOL elimination and/or an unpredictable redistribution. The main pharmacokinetic parameters of IDA, such as CL and volume of distribution at steady state (Vdss), were remarkably affected by the coadministration of CyA or CyA plus D-Ver, but no statistically significant difference was noted because of IDA pharmacokinetic interpatient variation. CONCLUSION: The results show that CyA alone at a dose of 10 mg x kg(-1) daily significantly increased systemic body exposure to both IDA and IDAOL in acute leukemia, and suggest that these pharmacokinetic effects were at least partially decreased when D-Ver was coadministered with CyA. Our findings raise important questions concerning the need for a dosage adjustment of IDA when MDR modulators are coadministered.","['Pea, F', 'Damiani, D', 'Michieli, M', 'Ermacora, A', 'Baraldo, M', 'Russo, D', 'Fanin, R', 'Baccarani, M', 'Furlanut, M']","['Pea F', 'Damiani D', 'Michieli M', 'Ermacora A', 'Baraldo M', 'Russo D', 'Fanin R', 'Baccarani M', 'Furlanut M']","['Institute of Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology, DPMSC University of Udine, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Clin Pharmacol,European journal of clinical pharmacology,1256165,"['83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Cyclosporine/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*physiology', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/*pharmacokinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Verapamil/administration & dosage/*pharmacology']",,1999/08/24 00:00,1999/08/24 00:01,['1999/08/24 00:00'],"['1999/08/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002280050641 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Clin Pharmacol. 1999 Jul;55(5):361-8. doi: 10.1007/s002280050641.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Children with Down syndrome have an 18-20 fold increased incidence of leukemia. Pulmonary hypoplasia, lung cysts, and pig bronchus (origin of the right upper lobe bronchus from the trachea) have been described. Neurologic findings include mineralizing vasculopathy of the basal ganglia, Moyamoya disease, and cerebellar/vermian hypoplasia. Musculoskeletal manifestations are numerous and include eleven ribs, hypersegmented sternum, abnormal pelvis, joint laxity/dislocations, and DDH (developmental dysplasia of the hip). Of special importance is the ""triple jeopardy"" of the upper cervical spine (atlanoaxial subluxation, hypoplastic posterior arch of C1, and atlantooccipital instability) and the resulting controversial cervical spine radiographic screening of children with Down syndrome. Knowledge of the many anomalies associated with Down syndrome can aid the clinician, not only in diagnosing abnormalities in these patients, but also in counseling families for potential problems that can occur in these children.","['Kriss, V M']",['Kriss VM'],"['Department of Diagnostic Radiology, University of Kentucky Medical Center, Lexington 40536-0084, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Clin Pediatr (Phila),Clinical pediatrics,0372606,,IM,"['Cardiomegaly/diagnostic imaging', 'Cervical Vertebrae/diagnostic imaging', 'Child', 'Down Syndrome/*complications/diagnostic imaging/physiopathology', 'Echocardiography', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases/diagnostic imaging', 'Hematologic Diseases/diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Radiography, Thoracic', 'Spinal Cord Compression/diagnostic imaging']",,1999/08/24 00:00,1999/08/24 00:01,['1999/08/24 00:00'],"['1999/08/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/000992289903800801 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Pediatr (Phila). 1999 Aug;38(8):441-9. doi: 10.1177/000992289903800801.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The presentations provided both a general overview and a detailed analysis of multiple biological systems, which despite their specific differences, also generated insights into important common themes. The success of any meeting is most appropriately measured by the kinds of questions that are provoked for future study, not merely by the recitation of past discoveries. In fact, the different presentations often raised highly similar questions for future study. At the most fundamental levels of transcriptional regulation, what are the signals that provide specificity of gene expression? What is the structural basis of specific protein-protein interactions, such as those between homeodomain proteins and beta-catenin-Lef1 interactions, and how are these determinants altered in transcriptional regulation in oncogenesis and in genetic diseases? How is specificity achieved in transcriptional repression, given that the fundamental biochemical reactions often involve modifications of relatively ubiquitous components such as histones? To what extent do changes in specificity of gene activation and repression or in chromosomal architecture mediate the kinds of developmental and oncogenic signals mediated through transcriptional regulators such as Myc, BCL6 and other basic helix-loop-helix proteins and the HMGI proteins? How do altered signaling pathways affect diseases of development and differentiation such as cardiovascular disorders and aging itself? What are the pathways that integrate extracellular signals and transcription during the process of organogenesis? How do fundamental cellular structures such as adhesion junctions, and the interactions of a cell with other cells and extracellular matrix impact on normal and abnormal development and on malignancy, and how do these levels of structure and function alter nuclear regulation of transcription and cell division? These are some of the recurrent questions raised in talk after talk at this symposium, questions that undoubtedly will provide the impetus for important discoveries that will be presented at future CABM symposia.","['Rabson, A B']",['Rabson AB'],"['Center for Advanced Biotechnology and Medicine, Cancer Institute of New Jersey, UMDNJ-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Piscataway 08854, USA. rabson@mbcl.rutgers.edu']",['eng'],['Congress'],Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Aging/genetics', 'Animals', 'Chromatin/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, myc', 'Genetic Diseases, Inborn/*genetics', 'Growth/genetics', 'Heart Diseases/genetics', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Templates, Genetic', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation']",,1999/08/24 00:00,1999/08/24 00:01,['1999/08/24 00:00'],"['1999/08/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/24 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0304-419X(99)00018-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0304-419x(99)00018-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1999 Jul 29;1424(1):R21-36. doi: 10.1016/s0304-419x(99)00018-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purposive sample was composed of 122 school-age children with chronic illnesses, such as nephrotic syndrome, leukemia, and congenital heart disease, who were admitted to three major teaching hospitals in Shanghai City. The children's medical records, demographic forms, and the Piers-Harris Self-concept Scale (PHSCS) were used to collect the data. Descriptive statistics, and stepwise multiple regression were used to analyze the data utilizing the SPSS program (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). The results of this study showed that the majority of hospitalized Chinese school-age children with a chronic illness had at least an average level of self-concept. Academic achievement (grade point average) was a strong predictor of self-concept, as are most of its subconcepts, including social behavior, academic competence, and physical appearance and attributes. Age was a significant predictor of overall self-concept, social behavior, and popularity subconcept. Sex was a significant predictor of self-concept subconcepts such as social behavior, anxiety, and popularity. Duration of illness was a significant predictor of physical appearance and attributes. In addition, the type of illness was a significant predictor of popularity. It can be concluded that the importance of school education should be emphasized by hospital and school nurses for the purpose of helping such children build a positive self-concept concerning their age, sex, academic achievement, type of illness, and duration of illness. Recommendations for further research have been suggested.","['Hu, Y', 'Kantawang, S', 'Yang, Y']","['Hu Y', 'Kantawang S', 'Yang Y']","['School of Nursing, Shanghai Medical University, PR China. yhyang@shmu.edu.cn']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Australia,Int J Nurs Pract,International journal of nursing practice,9613615,,,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Body Image', 'Child', 'Child, Hospitalized/education/*psychology', 'China', 'Chronic Disease/nursing/*psychology', 'Educational Status', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Nursing Methodology Research', 'Pediatric Nursing', '*Psychology, Child', 'Regression Analysis', '*Self Concept', 'Social Behavior', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Time Factors']",,1999/08/24 10:00,2000/07/15 11:00,['1999/08/24 10:00'],"['1999/08/24 10:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/15 11:00 [medline]', '1999/08/24 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1440-172x.1999.00149.x [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Nurs Pract. 1999 Mar;5(1):38-46. doi: 10.1046/j.1440-172x.1999.00149.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A potential use for GFP is as a co-expressed marker, to select and enrich gene-modified cells by flow cytometry. Processed peptides derived from GFP and presented by the major histocompatibility complex on the cell surface could potentially induce T cell immune responses against GFP+ cells. Thus, clinical application of GFP is premature, since in vivo studies on its immunogenicity are lacking. Therefore, we investigated immune responses against EGFP (enhanced-GFP) in two transplantable murine models: the BALB/c (H-2d) BM185 pre-B leukemia and the C57BL/6 (H-2b) EL-4 T cell lymphoma. BM185 and EL-4 cell lines modified to express high levels of EGFP showed drastic reduction of disease development when transplanted into immunocompetent mice. BM185/ EGFP did lead to rapid development of disease in immunodeficient Nu/Nu mice. Mice surviving BM185/EGFP leukemia challenge developed high cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses against EGFP-expressing cells. Furthermore, immune stimulation against BM185/EGFP cells could also be induced by immunization with EGFP+ transduced dendritic cells. The effects of the co-expression of EGFP and immunomodulators (CD80 plus GM-CSF) were also investigated as an irradiated leukemia vaccine. EGFP co-expression by the vaccine did not interfere with the development of CTLs against the parental leukemia or with the anti-leukemia response in vivo. These results indicate that the immune response against EGFP may interfere with its applicability in gene insertion/replacement strategies but could potentially be employed for leukemia cell vaccines.","['Stripecke, R', 'Carmen Villacres, M', 'Skelton, D', 'Satake, N', 'Halene, S', 'Kohn, D']","['Stripecke R', 'Carmen Villacres M', 'Skelton D', 'Satake N', 'Halene S', 'Kohn D']","['Division of Research Immunology/Bone Marrow Transplantation, Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, CA 90027, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Gene Ther,Gene therapy,9421525,"['0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Vaccines, DNA)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B7-1 Antigen/immunology', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/immunology', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology/therapy', 'Luminescent Proteins/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Vaccines, DNA']",,1999/08/24 10:00,2000/02/26 09:00,['1999/08/24 10:00'],"['1999/08/24 10:00 [pubmed]', '2000/02/26 09:00 [medline]', '1999/08/24 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.gt.3300951 [doi]'],ppublish,Gene Ther. 1999 Jul;6(7):1305-12. doi: 10.1038/sj.gt.3300951.,,,['AI33314/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,['Gene Ther. 2001 Dec;8(23):1814-5.

In this study, we determined the efficacy and safety of the in vivo elimination of HSVtk expressing cells with ganciclovir treatment of a bystander cell killing-insensitive leukemic cell line. The retroviral construct pLTk+NeoDeltaMo, containing the HSVtk gene and the NeoR gene in a bicistronic unit, was introduced into rat leukemic LT12 cells. LT12/Tk+N cells showed a 1000- to 10 000-fold increased sensitivity to ganciclovir in vitro. In vitro mixing experiments demonstrated that LT12 cells were not susceptible to bystander cell lysis by LT12/Tk+N-2 cells exposed to ganciclovir. Rats injected s.c. with cloned LT12/Tk+N-2 cells developed tumors reaching a diameter of 3-4 cm after 40 days. Rats treated with gan- ciclovir twice daily for 5 consecutive days starting at day 7 did not develop s.c. tumors. Large established s.c. LT12/Tk+N-2 tumors completely regressed after ganciclovir treatment. However, recurrences of s.c. tumors were observed that were no longer sensitive to ganciclovir treatment. In vitro analysis of aspirates from the recurrent tumors demonstrated loss of HSVtk expression. In vitro culture of LT12/Tk+N-2 cells in soft agar in the presence of ganciclovir indicated that the frequency with which HSVtk-loss variants occurred is approximately one per 104 cells. The in vivo occurrence of HSVtk-loss variants escaping ganciclovir-induced elimination may have important implications for vaccination protocols using HSVtk gene expressing tumor cells that are not susceptible to bystander cell killing.","['Braakman, E', 'Vogels, R', 'Martens, A C', 'Vermeulen, J', 'Bron, M', 'Hoogerbrugge, P M', 'Valerio, D', 'Hagenbeek, A']","['Braakman E', 'Vogels R', 'Martens AC', 'Vermeulen J', 'Bron M', 'Hoogerbrugge PM', 'Valerio D', 'Hagenbeek A']","['Department of Hematology, Dr Daniel den Hoed Cancer Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Gene Ther,Gene therapy,9421525,"['EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'P9G3CKZ4P5 (Ganciclovir)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Ganciclovir/*therapeutic use', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*therapy', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Rats', 'Simplexvirus/enzymology/*genetics', 'Thymidine Kinase/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/08/24 10:00,2000/02/26 09:00,['1999/08/24 10:00'],"['1999/08/24 10:00 [pubmed]', '2000/02/26 09:00 [medline]', '1999/08/24 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.gt.3300913 [doi]'],ppublish,Gene Ther. 1999 Jun;6(6):1139-46. doi: 10.1038/sj.gt.3300913.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously we reported successful gene transfer into canine marrow repopulating cells, however, gene transfer efficiency was low, usually below 0.1% (Kiem et al, Hum Gene Ther 1996; 7: 89). In this study we have used CD34-enriched marrow cells to study different retroviral pseudotypes for their ability to transduce canine hematopoietic repopulating cells. Cells were divided into two equal fractions that were cocultivated for 72 h with irradiated packaging cells producing vector with different retroviral pseudotypes (GALV, amphotropic or 10A1). The vectors used contained small sequence differences to allow differentiation of cells genetically marked by the different vectors. Nonadherent and adherent cells from the cultures were infused into four dogs after a myeloablative dose of 920 cGy total body irradiation. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of DNA from peripheral blood and marrow after transplant showed that the highest gene transfer rates (up to 10%) were obtained with the GALV-pseudotype vector. Gene transfer levels have remained stable now for more than 18 months. Southern blot analysis confirmed the high gene transfer rate. Interference studies on canine D17 cells revealed that 10A1 virus behaved like an amphotropic virus and was not able to use the GALV receptor. In summary, our results show improved gene transfer into canine hematopoietic repopulating cells when CD34-enriched cells are transduced by cocultivation on a GALV-pseudotype packaging cell line in combination with a GALV-pseudotype vector. Furthermore, these results demonstrate that the monoclonal antibody to canine CD34 used in this study is able to enrich for hematopoietic repopulating cells.","['Kiem, H P', 'McSweeney, P A', 'Bruno, B', 'Goerner, M', 'Buron, G', 'Morris, J', 'Storb, R', 'Miller, A D']","['Kiem HP', 'McSweeney PA', 'Bruno B', 'Goerner M', 'Buron G', 'Morris J', 'Storb R', 'Miller AD']","['Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98109-1024, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Gene Ther,Gene therapy,9421525,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Line', 'Dogs', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Leukemia Virus, Gibbon Ape/*genetics']",,1999/08/24 10:00,2000/02/26 09:00,['1999/08/24 10:00'],"['1999/08/24 10:00 [pubmed]', '2000/02/26 09:00 [medline]', '1999/08/24 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.gt.3300925 [doi]'],ppublish,Gene Ther. 1999 Jun;6(6):966-72. doi: 10.1038/sj.gt.3300925.,,,"['DK42716/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL03701/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL36444/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,

The median age of patients at diagnosis was 47.5 years (range 20.5-59.5). The median numbers of nucleated cells and CFU-GM transplanted were 10 x 10(8)/kg and 97 x 10(4)/kg, respectively. The median duration to reach more than 0.5 x 10(9)/l neutrophils and 50 x 10(9)/l platelets was 12 (range 5-19) and 11 days (range 0-79), respectively. Twenty patients (group I) were transplanted in chronic phase either for resistance to IFN (14 patients) (group IA) or because the Sokal index was more than 1.2 (six patients) (group IB). All those patients had preparative regimen with busulfan (4 mg/kg/day x 4) and melphalan (140 mg/m2). They were treated with recombinant alpha-interferon (IFN) after transplant. The cumulative incidence of major cytogenetic response (MCR) at 12 months was 25 +/- 21% (95% CI), the 5-year survival was 75 +/- 42% (95% CI). These results (observed in patients with bad prognosis factors) are similar to those usually observed in CML patients treated by IFN, whatever the Sokal risk. Thus autologous transplantation is able to reproduce for poor prognosis patients the results observed in standard risk patients treated with IFN. This suggests that it could prolong survival. Fifty-two other patients (group II) were transplanted for CML in transformation (accelerated phase = 32; blast crisis = 20) after a preparative regimen containing either total body irradiation (TBI) or busulfan. The median survival was short (10.4 months) and only 21 patients survived more than 1 year. The survival was longer for patients transplanted in accelerated phase (vs blast crisis), those who were due to receive a double transplant (vs single) (34 patients), those who were treated with IFN after transplant (vs hydroxyurea) and for the patients who obtained a complete hematologic response.","['Pigneux, A', 'Faberes, C', 'Boiron, J M', 'Mahon, F X', 'Cony-Makhoul, P', 'Agape, P', 'Lounici, A', 'Bernard, P', 'Bilhou-Nabera, C', 'Bouzgarrou, R', 'Marit, G', 'Reiffers, J']","['Pigneux A', 'Faberes C', 'Boiron JM', 'Mahon FX', 'Cony-Makhoul P', 'Agape P', 'Lounici A', 'Bernard P', 'Bilhou-Nabera C', 'Bouzgarrou R', 'Marit G', 'Reiffers J']","[""Service d'Hematologie, Hopital du Haut Leveque, CHU Bordeaux, Pessac, France.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Hematopoiesis', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",,1999/08/24 00:00,1999/08/24 00:01,['1999/08/24 00:00'],"['1999/08/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1701871 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1999 Aug;24(3):265-70. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1701871.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is shown herein that expression of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and LIF receptor is developmentally regulated during adipocyte differentiation. Preadipocytes secrete bioactive LIF, and an antagonist of LIF receptor inhibits adipogenesis. Genetically modified embryonic stem (ES) cells combined with culture conditions to commit stem cells into the adipocyte lineage were used to examine the requirement of LIF receptor during in vitro development of adipose cells. The capacity of embryoid bodies derived from lifr(-/-) ES cells to undergo adipocyte differentiation is dramatically reduced. LIF addition stimulates adipocyte differentiation of Ob1771 and 3T3-F442A preadipocytes and that of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma2 ligand-treated mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Expression of the early adipogenic transcription factors C/EBPbeta and C/EBPdelta is rapidly stimulated following exposure of preadipose cells to LIF. The selective inhibitors of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, i.e. PD98059 and U0126, inhibit LIF-induced C/EBP gene expression and prevent adipocyte differentiation induced by LIF. These results are in favor of a model that implicates stimulation of LIF receptor in the commitment of preadipocytes to undergo terminal differentiation by controlling the early expression of C/EBPbeta and C/EBPdelta genes via the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade.","['Aubert, J', 'Dessolin, S', 'Belmonte, N', 'Li, M', 'McKenzie, F R', 'Staccini, L', 'Villageois, P', 'Barhanin, B', 'Vernallis, A', 'Smith, A G', 'Ailhaud, G', 'Dani, C']","['Aubert J', 'Dessolin S', 'Belmonte N', 'Li M', 'McKenzie FR', 'Staccini L', 'Villageois P', 'Barhanin B', 'Vernallis A', 'Smith AG', 'Ailhaud G', 'Dani C']","['Centre de Biochimie (IFR349 and UMR6543 CNRS) Universite de Nice-Sophia Antipolis, Faculte des Sciences, Parc Valrose, 06108 Nice, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Cebpd protein, mouse)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '142662-43-9 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-delta)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)']",IM,"['Adipocytes/cytology/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-delta', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins', 'Cell Differentiation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Growth Inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Lymphokines/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytokine/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stem Cells/metabolism', '*Transcription Factors']",,1999/08/24 00:00,1999/08/24 00:01,['1999/08/24 00:00'],"['1999/08/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/24 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.274.35.24965 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)55440-0 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1999 Aug 27;274(35):24965-72. doi: 10.1074/jbc.274.35.24965.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The specific receptor for LIF, gp190, binds this cytokine with low affinity and is also required for signal transduction. We have recently reported that glycosylated LIF produced by transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells also binds to a lectin-like receptor, mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor II receptor (Man-6-P/IGFII-R) (Blanchard, F., Raher, S., Duplomb, L., Vusio, P., Pitard, V., Taupin, J.

The present study shows that (i) mannose 6-phosphate-containing LIF is naturally produced by a number of normal and tumor cell lines; (ii) other cytokines in the interleukin-6 family do not bind to Man-6-P/IGFII-R; and (iii) another unrelated cytokine, macrophage-colony-stimulating factor, is also able to bind to Man-6-P/IGFII-R in a mannose 6-phosphate-sensitive manner. No functional effects or signal transductions mediated by this lectin-like receptor were observed in various biological assays after LIF binding, and mannose 6-phosphate-containing LIF was as active as non-glycosylated LIF. However, mannose 6-phosphate-sensitive LIF binding resulted in rapid internalization and degradation of the cytokine on numerous cell lines, which suggests that Man-6-P/IGFII-R plays an important role in regulating the amounts of LIF available in vivo.","['Blanchard, F', 'Duplomb, L', 'Raher, S', 'Vusio, P', 'Hoflack, B', 'Jacques, Y', 'Godard, A']","['Blanchard F', 'Duplomb L', 'Raher S', 'Vusio P', 'Hoflack B', 'Jacques Y', 'Godard A']","['Groupe de Recherche Cytokines/Recepteurs/Transduction, Unite INSERM 463, Institut de Biologie, 9 Quai Moncousu, 44035 Nantes Cedex 01, France. fblan@inserm.nantes.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Mannosephosphates)', '0 (Receptor, IGF Type 2)', '3672-15-9 (mannose-6-phosphate)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'CHO Cells', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Cricetinae', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Glycosylation', 'Growth Inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*metabolism', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'Mannosephosphates/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptor, IGF Type 2/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",,1999/08/24 00:00,1999/08/24 00:01,['1999/08/24 00:00'],"['1999/08/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/24 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.274.35.24685 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)55402-3 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1999 Aug 27;274(35):24685-93. doi: 10.1074/jbc.274.35.24685.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gel mobility shift assays and transient transfection assays demonstrate that AML1 binds specifically to this site in the blk promoter and this binding site is important for blk promoter activity. Furthermore, in vitro binding analysis revealed that the AML1 runt DNA-binding domain physically interacts with the paired DNA-binding domain of BSAP, a B cell-specific transcription factor. BSAP has been shown previously to be important for B cell-specific regulation of the blk gene. Physical interaction of AML1 with BSAP correlates with functional cooperativity in transfection studies where AML1 and BSAP synergistically activate blk promoter transcription by more than 50-fold.

A comparison of two-dimensional gels of extracts from these cells labelled with [(35)S]methionine revealed that five distinct protein spots were induced by cAMP in a protein-synthesis-dependent manner. The spots seemed to result from the acidic shift of a precursor protein. The most abundant spot was phospho-actin. The spots induced by cAMP in intact cells were induced by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAPK) during the translation in vitro of mRNA from the leukaemia cells. The effect of cAPK was strictly co-translational, none of the spots being induced when cAPK was added after translation. This suggested that the protein spots arose by co-translational phosphorylation catalysed by cAPK. Two of the protein spots, phospho-actin and a protein with a molecular mass of 30 kDa and an isoelectric point of 4.5, were studied further with respect to expression. They were produced during the whole pre-apoptotic period, had cellular half-lives of several hours and were induced by the same concentrations of cAMP analogue that induced apoptosis.

It induces differentiation of HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells along the monocytic pathway and production of IL1, TNF-alpha and IL6 in human monocytes and monocytic cell lines. Recently our laboratory isolated cDNA clones for P48 from Reh cells and genomic clones from Mycoplasma fermentans DNA and showed that P48 is a M. fermentans gene product. In this paper we report the analysis of P48 expression at the DNA, mRNA and protein levels in different Mycoplasma species. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) analysis of extracted DNA using P48-specific oligonucleotide primers revealed P48 sequences in M. fermentans but not M. hominis, M. iowae, M. genitalium or M. capricolum. Southern analysis of Mycoplasma DNAs revealed hybridizing bands in M. fermentans and M. capricolum under low stringency, but only in M. fermentans under high stringency. Consistent with this, Northern blot studies revealed a single hybridizing transcript in M. fermentans but not in other Mycoplasma species tested. However, Western blot studies with anti-P48 antibodies revealed P48 antigenic material in M. fermentans, as well as M. hominis and M. iowae. These studies demonstrate that the gene for P48 is derived from M. fermentans or a closely related species and is absent in these other species tested. However, the P48 protein exhibits shared antigenic determinants among several Mycoplasma species which presently are of unknown function or significance. P48 is a Mycoplasma -derived immunomodulatory molecule which may be important in Mycoplasma pathophysiology and may be useful in understanding human haematopoietic differentiation and the control of cytokine biosynthesis.","['Hall, R E', 'Kestler, D P', 'Agarwal, S', 'Goldstein, K M']","['Hall RE', 'Kestler DP', 'Agarwal S', 'Goldstein KM']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, University ofTennessee Medical Center/Graduate School of Medicine, Knoxville, TN, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Microb Pathog,Microbial pathogenesis,8606191,"['0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Bacterial)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Bacterial)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (monocytic differentiation factor P48)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bacterial Proteins/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Bacterial/analysis', 'Growth Substances/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Humans', '*Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mycoplasma/*metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Bacterial/analysis', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Species Specificity']",,1999/08/24 00:00,1999/08/24 00:01,['1999/08/24 00:00'],"['1999/08/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/24 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/mpat.1999.0293 [doi]', 'S0882-4010(99)90293-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Microb Pathog. 1999 Sep;27(3):145-53. doi: 10.1006/mpat.1999.0293.,['Copyright 1999 Academic Press.'],,"['CA-58205/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-72591/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

A variety of mechanisms have been proposed to explain this phenomenon. The exact mechanism depends upon the drug of interest as well as the tumor type treated. While studying a cell line selected for its resistance to cisplatin we noted that the cells expressed a > 25,000-fold collateral resistance to methotrexate. Given the magnitude of this resistance we elected to investigate this intriguing collateral resistance. From a series of investigations we have identified an alteration in a membrane protein of the resistant cell as compared to the sensitive cells that could be the primary mechanism of resistance. Our studies reviewed here indicate decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of a protein (molecular mass = 66) in the resistant cells, which results in little or no transfer of methotrexate from the medium into the cell. Since this is a relatively novel function for tyrosine phosphorylation, this information may provide insight into possible pharmacological approaches to modify therapeutic regimens by analyzing the status of this protein in tumor samples for a better survival of the cancer patients.","['Bhushan, A', 'Hacker, M P', 'Tritton, T R']","['Bhushan A', 'Hacker MP', 'Tritton TR']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Idaho State University, Pocatello 83209-8334, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Brazil,Braz J Med Biol Res,Brazilian journal of medical and biological research = Revista brasileira de pesquisas medicas e biologicas,8112917,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Cisplatin/adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy', 'Methotrexate/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Phosphorylation', 'Tyrosine/pharmacology']",,1999/08/24 00:00,1999/08/24 00:01,['1999/08/24 00:00'],"['1999/08/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/24 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0100-879X(99)03200705 [pii]', '10.1590/s0100-879x1999000700005 [doi]']",ppublish,Braz J Med Biol Res. 1999 Jul;32(7):827-33. doi: 10.1590/s0100-879x1999000700005.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among STATs, two highly related proteins, STAT5a and STAT5b, are activated by various cytokines, including prolactin, growth hormone, erythropoietin, interleukin 2 (IL-2), and IL-3. We have cloned a STAT5-dependent immediate-early cytokine-responsive gene, CIS1 (encoding cytokine-inducible SH2-containing protein 1). In this study, we created CIS1 transgenic mice under the control of a beta-actin promoter. The transgenic mice developed normally; however, their body weight was lower than that of the wild-type mice, suggesting a defect in growth hormone signaling. Female transgenic mice failed to lactate after parturition because of a failure in terminal differentiation of the mammary glands, suggesting a defect in prolactin signaling. The IL-2-dependent upregulation of the IL-2 receptor alpha chain and proliferation were partially suppressed in the T cells of transgenic mice. These phenotypes remarkably resembled those found in STAT5a and/or STAT5b knockout mice. Indeed, STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation was suppressed in mammary glands and the liver.

To directly test this possibility, mouse bone marrow cells were engineered by retroviral gene transfer to overexpress E2A-Pbx1a together with Hoxa9. The results obtained demonstrated a strong synergistic interaction between E2A-Pbx1a and Hoxa9 in inducing growth factor-independent proliferation of transduced bone marrow cells in vitro and leukemic growth in vivo in only 39 +/- 2 days. The leukemic blasts which coexpress E2A-Pbx1a and Hoxa9 showed little differentiation and produced cytokines such as interleukin-3, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and Steel.

In this study, we demonstrated that cytokine stimulation of mcl-1 mRNA and protein expression were attenuated by pretreatment of cells with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) inhibitors. Reporter gene assays further showed that the PI3-K/Akt signaling pathway was involved in IL-3 activation of mcl-1 gene transcription. Analysis of the mcl-1 promoter revealed that both promoter elements, SIE at position -87 and CRE-2 at -70, contribute to IL-3 stimulation of mcl-1 gene expression. Although either the SIE site or the CRE-2 site alone was sufficient to confer IL-3 inducibility on a heterologous promoter, only IL-3 activation of the CRE-2 reporter was mediated via the PI3-K/Akt pathway. The SIE binding activity was constitutively high in cells deprived of or stimulated by IL-3. In contrast, the CRE-2 binding activity was low in cytokine-starved cells and was strongly induced within 1 h following cytokine treatment of cells. In addition, cytokine induction of the CRE-2 but not of the SIE binding activity was dependent on activation of the PI3-K/Akt signaling pathway. Lastly, we showed that CREB was one component of the CRE-2 binding complex and played a role in IL-3 activation of the mcl-1 reporter gene. Taken together, our results suggest that both PI3-K/Akt-dependent and -independent pathways contribute to the IL-3 activation of mcl-1 gene expression. Activation of mcl-1 by the PI3-K/Akt-dependent pathway is through a transcription factor complex containing CREB.","['Wang, J M', 'Chao, J R', 'Chen, W', 'Kuo, M L', 'Yen, J J', 'Yang-Yen, H F']","['Wang JM', 'Chao JR', 'Chen W', 'Kuo ML', 'Yen JJ', 'Yang-Yen HF']","['Graduate Institute of Life Science, National Defense Medical School, Taipei, Taiwan, Republic of China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/metabolism', 'DNA Primers/genetics', '*Genes, Immediate-Early', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",PMC84561,1999/08/24 00:00,1999/08/24 00:01,['1999/08/24 00:00'],"['1999/08/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.19.9.6195 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1999 Sep;19(9):6195-206. doi: 10.1128/MCB.19.9.6195.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, in addition to restoring CENU tumor cell sensitivity, 6-BG also increases the cytotoxic effects of CENUs on hematopoietic cells. Several 6-BG-resistant human MGMT mutants have been characterized in Escherichia coli and are predicted to protect mammalian cells against the combination of 6-BG and CENU treatment in vivo. Two mutants, P140A and P140A/G156A, demonstrated 20- and 1200-fold more resistance to 6-BG depletion of MGMT activity compared with wild-type MGMT (WTMGMT). Here, we analyzed retroviral vectors that express either WTMGMT, the P140A or P140A/G156A mutant forms of MGMT. Retroviral-infected L1210 hematopoietic cells demonstrated similar levels of RNA in all transduced clones. However, the amount of MGMT protein and DNA repair activity was reduced in clones expressing the P140A/G156A mutant compared with those expressing WTMGMT or P140A. Expression of P140A was associated with a 4- to 8-fold increase in resistance to 6-BG depletion of MGMT in transduced L1210 clones and a 1, 3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea IC(50) of 50 microM (compared with 27.5 microM for WTMGMT) in primary murine hematopoietic cells. These results demonstrate the utility of screening 6-BG-resistant MGMT proteins in hematopoietic cells and provide evidence that the P140A mutant form of MGMT generates 6-BG- and CENU-resistant hematopoietic cells. Retrovirus vectors expressing this mutant may be useful in future human gene therapy trials.","['Maze, R', 'Kurpad, C', 'Pegg, A E', 'Erickson, L C', 'Williams, D A']","['Maze R', 'Kurpad C', 'Pegg AE', 'Erickson LC', 'Williams DA']","['Section of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research, Riley Hospital for Children, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '01KC87F8FE (O(6)-benzylguanine)', '2365-30-2 (1-(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', 'EC 2.1.1.63 (O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase)', 'P8M1T4190R (Ethylnitrosourea)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Carcinoma', 'Ethylnitrosourea/*analogs & derivatives/toxicity', 'Female', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Guanine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Melanoma, Experimental', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mutation', 'O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Retroviridae/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/08/24 00:00,1999/08/24 00:01,['1999/08/24 00:00'],"['1999/08/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/24 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 1999 Sep;290(3):1467-74.,,,"['CA45628-10/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01CA75426/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

Here we examine involvement of the stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) cascade and AP1 in the initiation of apoptosis in U937 cells by podophyllotoxin-derived inhibitors of topoisomerase II. Induction of apoptotic cell death and DNA damage by treatment of U937 cells with etoposide (100 microM) was associated with phosphorylation and activation of the c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK1) SAPK enzymes p46 and p54-JNK2 and transient increases in expression of the transcription factor c-Jun, a primary JNK substrate. These responses were accompanied by a modest, but sustained, recruitment of the mitogen-activated protein kinases p42-extracellular signal receptor-activated kinase (ERK)1 and p44-extracellular signal receptor-activated kinase 2. The capacity of etoposide to promote double-stranded DNA degradation and cell death was unaffected by manipulations that interfere with SAPK signaling outflow through c-Jun/AP1, including: 1) pharmacological inhibition of AP1 activity by diferuloylmethane and 2) molecular ablation of normal c-Jun function by the Jun dominant-negative mutant TAM-67. Cytotoxicity of the structurally related compound teniposide was similarly unaffected. In parallel trials, the lethal actions of ceramide (but not of sphingosine) were markedly diminished by pretreatment with diferuloylmethane or expression of TAM-67, confirming the effectiveness of these interventions in suppression of SAPK/AP1-dependent apoptosis. The involvement of AP1 in the proapoptotic actions of other inhibitors of topoisomerase II activity was also evaluated. Induction of cell death by the anthracyclines daunorubicin, daunorubicin, and idarubicin was found to be insensitive to pretreatment with diferuloylmethane or expression of TAM-67. Collectively, the present data indicate that induction of apoptosis by etoposide and related inhibitors of topoisomerase II is mediated through a cell death pathway that does not require SAPK-dependent recruitment of AP1. These findings additionally suggest that activation of the SAPK represents a consequence, rather than an underlying cause, of etoposide-induced apoptosis in myeloid leukemia cells.","['Jarvis, W D', 'Johnson, C R', 'Fornari, F A', 'Park, J S', 'Dent, P', 'Grant, S']","['Jarvis WD', 'Johnson CR', 'Fornari FA', 'Park JS', 'Dent P', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Virginia, Richmond, Virginia, USA. wjarvis@hsc.vcu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Curcumin/pharmacology', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/drug therapy/pathology', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/metabolism/*physiology', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/metabolism/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/08/24 00:00,1999/08/24 00:01,['1999/08/24 00:00'],"['1999/08/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/24 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 1999 Sep;290(3):1384-92.,,,"['CA-09380/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-09241/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,

Enhanced PTK activity is intimately correlated with proliferative diseases, such as cancers, leukemias, psoriasis, and restenosis. This realization prompted us to systematically synthesize tyrosine phosphorylation inhibitors (tyrphostins) as potential drugs. Over the years, we have demonstrated the ability to synthesize selective tyrphostins aimed at different receptor, as well as at nonreceptor, tyrosine kinases. Some of these tyrphostins have shown efficacy in vivo as antileukemic agents and antirestenosis agents. AG 490, a Jak-2 inhibitor, is potent against recurrent pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

METHODS: A case control study based on 88 cases and 133 controls used different assessment methods to determine EMF exposure in the child's current residence. Cases comprised incident leukemias diagnosed at 0-14 years of age between 1985-1993 from a larger study in southern Ontario; population controls were individually matched to the cases by age and sex. Exposure was measured by a personal monitoring device worn by the child during usual activities at home, by point-in-time measurements in three rooms and according to wire code assigned to the child's residence. RESULTS: An association between magnetic field exposures as measured with the personal monitor and increased risk of leukemia was observed. The risk was more pronounced for those children diagnosed at less than 6 years of age and those with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Risk estimates associated with magnetic fields tended to increase after adjusting for power consumption and potential confounders with significant odds ratios (OR) (OR: 4.5, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.3-15.9) observed for exposures > or = 0.14 microTesla (microT). For the most part point-in-time measurements of magnetic fields were associated with non-significant elevations in risk which were generally compatible with previous research. Residential proximity to power lines having a high current configuration was not associated with increased risk of leukemia. Exposures to electric fields as measured by personal monitoring were associated with a decreased leukemia risk. CONCLUSIONS: The findings relating to magnetic field exposures directly measured by personal monitoring support an association with the risk of childhood leukemia. As exposure assessment is refined, the possible role of magnetic fields in the etiology of childhood leukemia becomes more evident.","['Green, L M', 'Miller, A B', 'Agnew, D A', 'Greenberg, M L', 'Li, J', 'Villeneuve, P J', 'Tibshirani, R']","['Green LM', 'Miller AB', 'Agnew DA', 'Greenberg ML', 'Li J', 'Villeneuve PJ', 'Tibshirani R']","['Department of Public Health Sciences, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age of Onset', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Female', 'Housing', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Ontario/epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/etiology', 'Risk Assessment']",,1999/08/24 00:00,1999/08/24 00:01,['1999/08/24 00:00'],"['1999/08/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1008919408855 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 1999 Jun;10(3):233-43. doi: 10.1023/a:1008919408855.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report the case of a 50-year-old woman who developed sarcoidosis while being treated with IFN-alpha for chronic myelogenous leukemia. Her disease activity correlated with the dosage of IFN-alpha. We speculate that the immunomodulatory effects of IFN-alpha triggered clinical manifestations of sarcoidosis in this patient.","['Pietropaoli, A', 'Modrak, J', 'Utell, M']","['Pietropaoli A', 'Modrak J', 'Utell M']","['Department of Medicine, University of Rochester Medical Center, NY 14642-8692, USA.

One acylfulvene derivative, MGI 114 (HMAF), demonstrates marked efficacy in xenograft carcinoma models when compared to the parent acylfulvene or related illudin compounds. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the two analogs in animals, however, is similar. To help elucidate the basis of the increased therapeutic efficacy of MGI 114, we determined the in vitro cytotoxicity, cellular accumulation and DNA incorporation of this drug and compared the results with those from the parent acylfulvene analog. METHODS: The cytotoxicity of acylfulvene analogs was tested in vitro against a variety of tumor cell lines. Radiolabeled MGI 114 was used for cellular accumulation and DNA incorporation studies. RESULTS: MGI 114 retained relative histiospecific toxicity towards myeloid leukemia and various carcinoma cell lines previously noted with the parent acylfulvene compound. Markedly fewer intracellular molecules of MGI 114 were required to kill human tumor cells in vitro as compared to the parent acylfulvene, indicating that MGI 114 was markedly more toxic on a cellular level. At equitoxic concentrations, however, the incorporation of MGI 114 into genomic tumor cell DNA was equivalent to that of acylfulvene. Analysis of cellular accumulation of MGI 114 into tumor cells revealed a lower Vmax for tumor cells, and a markedly lower Vd for diffusion accumulation as compared to acylfulvene. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of a single methylhydroxyl group to acylfulvene to produce MGI 114 results in a marked increase in cytotoxicity in vitro towards tumor cells as demonstrated by the reduction in IC50 values. There was a corresponding decrease in the number of intracellular molecules of MGI 114 required to kill tumor cells, but no quantitative alteration in covalent binding of the drugs to DNA at equitoxic concentrations. This indicates that cellular metabolism plays a role in the in vitro cytotoxicity of MGI 114. The equivalent incorporation into genomic DNA at equitoxic doses suggests that DNA damage produced by acylfulvene and MGI 114 is equivalent in regard to cellular toxicity and ability to repair DNA. This increased cellular toxicity, together with the decrease in diffusion rate, may explain the increased therapeutic efficacy of MGI 114 as compared to the parent acylfulvene analog.","['Kelner, M J', 'McMorris, T C', 'Montoya, M A', 'Estes, L', 'Uglik, S F', 'Rutherford, M', 'Samson, K M', 'Bagnell, R D', 'Taetle, R']","['Kelner MJ', 'McMorris TC', 'Montoya MA', 'Estes L', 'Uglik SF', 'Rutherford M', 'Samson KM', 'Bagnell RD', 'Taetle R']","['Department of Pathology, UCSD Medical Center, San Diego, CA 92103, USA. mkelner@ucsd.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes)', '6B799IH05A (irofulven)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Sesquiterpenes/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/08/24 00:00,1999/08/24 00:01,['1999/08/24 00:00'],"['1999/08/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002800050972 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1999;44(3):235-40. doi: 10.1007/s002800050972.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the study was to determine intrapatient and interpatient variability in vincristine disposition and demographic, clinical, and biochemical characteristics influencing this variability. METHODS: Vincristine plasma concentrations were measured by a high-performance liquid chromatography assay with electrochemical detection. A limited sampling strategy was used based on a bayesian parameter estimation algorithm that is part of the ADAPT II software package. A two-compartment, first-order model was fitted to the data, and pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated from the model using the ADAPT II software. For statistical analysis, analysis of variance (ANOVA), t test, simple and multiple regression analysis, and non-parametric or robust equivalents were used. RESULTS: Results showed a large intrapatient and interpatient variability in distribution half-life, elimination half-life, total body clearance, apparent volume of distribution at steady state, and area under the concentration-time curve. Intrapatient variability was significantly smaller than interpatient variability for all these parameters except distribution half-life. The diagnosis or treatment protocol turned out to be the most predictive characteristic; leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients had a significantly higher total body clearance than Wilms' tumor patients. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that both intrapatient and interpatient variability in vincristine pharmacokinetics is large in pediatric cancer patients and that variability, although significantly influenced by diagnosis, largely remains unpredictable.","['Gidding, C E', 'Meeuwsen-de Boer, G J', 'Koopmans, P', 'Uges, D R', 'Kamps, W A', 'de Graaf, S S']","['Gidding CE', 'Meeuwsen-de Boer GJ', 'Koopmans P', 'Uges DR', 'Kamps WA', 'de Graaf SS']","[""Children's Cancer Center, University Hospital Groningen, The Netherlands.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Area Under Curve', 'Child', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Wilms Tumor/drug therapy/metabolism']",,1999/08/24 00:00,1999/08/24 00:01,['1999/08/24 00:00'],"['1999/08/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002800050968 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1999;44(3):203-9. doi: 10.1007/s002800050968.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The research was prompted in large part by experimental investigations showing that transplacental exposure to certain N-nitroso compounds, i.e., nitrosoureas, could produce brain tumors in laboratory animals. Fourteen such epidemiological studies, 13 of which used the case-control approach, are reviewed here. Most of the studies showed no significant association between total cured meat intake and childhood cancer risk but more found positive than negative relationships. Furthermore, several studies reported significant positive associations for maternal and sometimes childhood or paternal consumption of one or more cured meats, with odds ratios of twofold or greater reported among the highest consumers. On the other hand, a correlation analysis found no positive concordance between temporal trends from the 1970s to 1990s in childhood brain cancer rates and cured meat consumption, inasmuch as cancer rates rose over time while residual nitrite levels in cured meats fell sharply. Because of the potential for bias, especially recall bias, and/or confounding, the relatively weak magnitude of the associations reported, and the inconsistency between study findings, at this time it cannot be concluded that eating cured meat has increased the risk of childhood brain cancer or any other cancers. Moreover, although N-nitroso compounds are sometimes found in cured meats or may be formed endogenously, there is no empirical evidence that eating cured meats results in human neural nitrosourea exposure. Nevertheless, the hypothesis that eating nitrite-cured meats may influence childhood and perhaps adult brain cancer cannot be dismissed. Unbiased evaluation of the hypothesis may derive from the conduct of cohort studies, where the interview-derived information on cured meat intake precedes, or is not otherwise associated with, the diagnosis of cancer.","['Blot, W J', 'Henderson, B E', 'Boice, J D Jr']","['Blot WJ', 'Henderson BE', 'Boice JD Jr']","['International Epidemiology Institute, Rockville, MD 20850, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Nutr Cancer,Nutrition and cancer,7905040,['0 (Nitroso Compounds)'],IM,"['Brain Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Child', '*Diet', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', '*Meat Products/adverse effects', '*Nitroso Compounds/adverse effects', 'Risk Factors']",,1999/08/24 10:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1999/08/24 10:00'],"['1999/08/24 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1999/08/24 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1207/S15327914NC340115 [doi]'],ppublish,Nutr Cancer. 1999;34(1):111-8. doi: 10.1207/S15327914NC340115.,,,,52,,,,,,,,,

It is believed that genistein, a natural tyrosine kinase inhibitor and a metabolite of soy products, may be responsible for the protection from these cancers. Genistein was shown to inhibit cell proliferation and to induce cell cycle arrest at the G2-M phase in breast, prostate, and jurkat T cell leukemia cell lines. However, such studies have not been reported in squamous cell cancers of the head and neck. In this report, we show that genistein inhibits proliferation of a squamous cell carcinoma cell line HN4. Additionally, genistein caused cell cycle arrest at the S/G2-M phase and induced programmed cell death (apoptosis) in these cells. These effects appear to be dose and time dependent, irreversible, persisting when the cells were recultured in genistein-free medium for up to 72 hours, and specific for tumor cells, because genistein did not affect normal keratinocytes. These results suggest that if genistein shows similar results in clinical trials, it can be a potential chemopreventive/chemotherapeutic agent for cancers of the head and neck.","['Alhasan, S A', 'Pietrasczkiwicz, H', 'Alonso, M D', 'Ensley, J', 'Sarkar, F H']","['Alhasan SA', 'Pietrasczkiwicz H', 'Alonso MD', 'Ensley J', 'Sarkar FH']","['Department of Pathology, Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI 48201, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Nutr Cancer,Nutrition and cancer,7905040,"['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Anticarcinogenic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*prevention & control', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Genistein/*pharmacology', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/*prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",,1999/08/24 00:00,1999/08/24 00:01,['1999/08/24 00:00'],"['1999/08/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1207/S15327914NC340102 [doi]'],ppublish,Nutr Cancer. 1999;34(1):12-9. doi: 10.1207/S15327914NC340102.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Additionally, LOH in two chromosome regions (9p and 12p) was investigated. Furthermore, expression of the TEL, TEL/AML1 and p27(KIP1) genes on 12p and the p16 gene on 9p were detected by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Replication errors were detected in 5/65 patients (7.7%). Most (4/5 patients) RER were preferentially located in the 9p and 12p regions. There were two patients who had DNA abnormalities in both 9p and 12p, one with common acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) showed 9p LOH and the TEL/AML1 fusion gene on 12p and the other with common ALL and 12p RER had diminished expression of both the p27(KIP1) gene on 12p and the p16 gene on 9p.

Methods were developed to measure both the mean UVA irradiance and the intensity profile in the UVA-illuminated area of the microscope. This allowed us to calculate the applied UVA radiant exposure of the cells during each experiment. This investigation was undertaken because of the conflicting results in the literature on the effects of electromagnetic fields on the signals of the calcium-sensitive fluorescence probe FURA-2 in lymphocytes. Taking into account that each group used a different system with different optics and lamps, these conflicting results are now at least partially understandable. Our measurements indicate that in a typical experiment with FURA-2 the cells were irradiated with up to 776 kJ m(-2) during 25 min of exposure to UVA light. This causes changes in intracellular free Ca(2+) concentrations ([Ca(2+)](i)). Designating cells in which the [Ca(2+)](i) was distinctly increased during the experiment as ""responding"", we found Hill-type dependences on the irradiance. Jurkat cells showed a 50% response even at 10 kJ m(-2) and osteosarcoma cells at about 60 kJ m(-2), whereas neuroblastoma cells even at the maximum possible dose responded only minimally. In the case of neuroblastoma cells, we found a dependence of this effect on the CO(2) partial pressure during the preincubation. An electrical treatment with an a.c. field (5 kHz sinusoidal, amplitude modulation 16 Hz 100%, 800 V m(-1), 5 min) had a significant effect on intracellular calcium in neuroblastoma cells only in the case of cells that were not pretreated with CO(2) with high fluences of UVA irradiation. In conclusion, these results indicate that the possibility of UVA artifacts must be considered in all experiments using fluorescence microscopy. Furthermore, our results lead to the hypothesis that oxidative stress could be the link between UVA and electric-field effects.","['Ihrig, I', 'Schubert, F', 'Habel, B', 'Haberland, L', 'Glaser, R']","['Ihrig I', 'Schubert F', 'Habel B', 'Haberland L', 'Glaser R']","['Institute of Biology, Humboldt University, Invalidenstrasse 42, D-10115 Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,['SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calcium Signaling/*radiation effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', '*Electromagnetic Fields', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Fluid/*metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence/methods', 'Neuroblastoma', 'Osteosarcoma', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Ultraviolet Rays']",,1999/08/24 00:00,1999/08/24 00:01,['1999/08/24 00:00'],"['1999/08/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/24 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Radiat Res. 1999 Sep;152(3):303-11.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A total of 383 leukemias were observed among 283,139 study subjects. Considering all leukemias apart from chronic lymphocytic leukemia, the optimal relative risk model had a dose response with a purely quadratic term representing induction and an exponential term consistent with cell sterilization at high doses; the addition of a linear induction term did not improve the fit of the model. The relative risk decreased with increasing time since exposure and increasing attained age, and there were significant (P < 0.00001) differences in the parameters of the model between datasets. These differences were related in part to the significant differences (P = 0.003) between the models fitted to the three main radiogenic leukemia subtypes (acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia). When the three datasets were considered together but the analysis was repeated separately for the three leukemia subtypes, for each subtype the optimal model included quadratic and exponential terms in dose. For acute myeloid leukemia and chronic myeloid leukemia, there were reductions of relative risk with increasing time after exposure, whereas for acute lymphocytic leukemia the relative risk decreased with increasing attained age. For each leukemia subtype considered separately, there was no indication of a difference between the studies in the relative risk and its distribution as a function of dose, age and time (P > 0.10 for all three subtypes). The nonsignificant indications of differences between the three datasets when leukemia subtypes were considered separately may be explained by random variation, although a contribution from differences in exposure dose-rate regimens, inhomogeneous dose distribution within the bone marrow, inadequate adjustment forcell sterilization effects, or errors in dosimetry could have played a role.","['Little, M P', 'Weiss, H A', 'Boice, J D Jr', 'Darby, S C', 'Day, N E', 'Muirhead, C R']","['Little MP', 'Weiss HA', 'Boice JD Jr', 'Darby SC', 'Day NE', 'Muirhead CR']","['National Radiological Protection Board, Chilton, Didcot OX11 0RQ, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Japan', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/etiology/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/etiology/mortality', '*Nuclear Warfare', 'Spondylitis, Ankylosing/*radiotherapy', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/*radiotherapy']",,1999/08/24 10:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1999/08/24 10:00'],"['1999/08/24 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1999/08/24 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Radiat Res. 1999 Sep;152(3):280-92.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Groups of mice irradiated with a total dose of 1. 0 Gy at two different chronic dose rates (0.5, 0.004 Gy/h) had similar frequencies of AML. Compared to control animals that did not develop AML, irradiation at either of these dose rates did not change the longevity of the mice that did not die of leukemia. The survival rates of irradiated mice that did develop leukemia in the two groups were not different from each other, indicating that the dose rates produced similar responses and therefore were both chronic exposures. We then tested the ability of a chronic 10-cGy (0. 5 Gy/h) exposure to ionizing radiation, mild hyperthermia (40.5 degrees C whole-body, 60 min) or treatment with interleukin-1 (1500 U i.p.) to induce an adaptive response and modify the frequency or latency of AML which resulted from a subsequent (24 h later) 1.0-Gy (0.5 Gy/h) chronic radiation exposure. The frequency of radiation-induced leukemia was not changed in mice given any of the three adapting treatments 24 h prior to the chronic 1.0-Gy dose that induced leukemia. However, the latent period for development of AML was significantly increased by both the prior low radiation dose and mild hyperthermia treatment. Injection of interleukin-1, in contrast, may have reduced the latent period. Similar to the single 1.0-Gy chronic exposure alone, none of the adapting treatments prior to that exposure influenced the survival of animals that did not develop AML. These results indicate that an earlier exposure to a small adapting dose of radiation or to a mild heat stress can influence secondary steps in radiation-induced carcinogenesis.","['Mitchel, R E', 'Jackson, J S', 'McCann, R A', 'Boreham, D R']","['Mitchel RE', 'Jackson JS', 'McCann RA', 'Boreham DR']","['Radiation Biology and Health Physics Branch, Atomic Energy of Canada Limited Chalk River Laboratories, Chalk River, Ontario K0J 1J0, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,['0 (Interleukin-1)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adaptation, Physiological/*radiation effects', 'Animals', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Female', 'Gamma Rays', 'Hyperthermia, Induced', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*etiology/mortality/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*etiology/mortality/*physiopathology', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Risk Factors']",,1999/08/24 00:00,1999/08/24 00:01,['1999/08/24 00:00'],"['1999/08/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/24 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Radiat Res. 1999 Sep;152(3):273-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In cultured rat thymocytes the extent of apoptosis induced by dexamethasone alone did not increase by addition of 0.1 - 10 mM butyrate. Even more pronounced was the non-additive interrelationship between dexamethasone and trichostatin A, as trichostatin A-induced apoptosis was not only blocked by the presence of dexamethasone but dexamethasone-induced apoptosis was also partially inhibited in the presence of 0.1 - 0.5 microM trichostatin A. The fact that the non-additive relationship with dexamethasone for apoptosis induction was observed with both histone deacetylase inhibitors suggests that in thymocytes this phenomenon is related to histone acetylation. In contrast to this, in the human T cell-derived leukemia cell line CEM-C7H2, dexamethasone did not block butyrate- or trichostatin A-induced apoptosis; moreover, butyrate, in the concentration range of 0.1 - 1 mM, had a marked synergistic effect on dexamethasone-induced apoptosis. This synergism, however, was not mimicked by trichostatin A, indicating that the effect is not related to histone acetylation but rather due to a pleiotropic effect of butyrate.

We also noticed unexpectedly that overexpression of PU.1 together with DMSO induces marked growth arrest and apoptosis in MEL cells, supporting the notion that some oncogenes induce growth inhibition and apoptosis rather than cell proliferation and transformation under specific circumstances as shown with the c-myc gene.

Structural similarity of Syk and ZAP70 suggests their functional overlap. Previously, it was observed that expression of either ZAP70 or Syk reconstitutes Ag receptor signaling in Syk-negative B cells. However, in CD45-deficient T cells, Syk, but not ZAP70, restores T cell receptor-signaling pathway. To study the function of Syk, ZAP70, and CD45 in mast cells, a Syk/CD45 double-deficient variant of RBL-2H3 cells was characterized. After transfection, stable cell lines were isolated that expressed ZAP70, Syk, CD45, ZAP70 plus CD45, and Syk plus CD45. IgE stimulation did not induce degranulation in parental double-deficient cells, nor in the cells expressing only CD45. ZAP70 expression did not restore Fc epsilon RI signaling unless CD45 was coexpressed in the cells. However, Syk alone restored the IgE signal transduction pathway. The coexpression of CD45 with Syk had no significant effects on the responses to FcepsilonRI-aggregation. There was much better binding of Syk than ZAP70 to the phosphorylated Fc epsilon RI gamma-ITAM. Furthermore, unlike Syk, ZAP70 required CD45 to display receptor-induced increase in kinase activity.

However, whether mast cell activation occurs as a direct response to neuronal activation or requires an intermediary cell is unclear. Addressing this issue, we used an in vitro coculture approach comprising cultured murine superior cervical ganglia and rat leukemia basophilic cells (RBLs; possesses properties of mucosal-type mast cells). Following loading with the calcium fluorophore, Fluo-3, neurite-RBL units (separated by <50 nm) were examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Addition of bradykinin, or scorpion venom, dose-dependently elicited neurite activation (i.e., Ca2+ mobilization) and, after a lag period, RBL Ca2+ mobilization. Neither bradykinin nor scorpion venom had any direct effect on the RBLs in the absence of neurites. Addition of a neutralizing substance P Ab or a neurokinin (NK)-1 receptor antagonist, but not an NK-2 receptor antagonist, dose-dependently prevented the RBL activation that resulted as a consequence of neural activation by either bradykinin or scorpion venom. These data illustrate that nerve-mast cell cross-talk can occur in the absence of an intermediary transducing cell and that the neuropeptide substance P, operating via NK-1 receptors, is an important mediator of this communication.

Recent biochemical experiments have demonstrated that in the presence of the cellular protein CREB, Tax directly binds the viral CRE G+C-rich sequences via interaction with the minor groove. To determine the functional significance of the Tax-DNA interaction, we synthesized minor groove-binding pyrrole-imidazole polyamides which bind specifically to the G+C-rich sequences in the viral CREs. At concentrations where the polyamides specifically protect the G+C-rich sequences from MPE:Fe cleavage, the polyamides block the Tax-DNA interaction. At precisely these same concentrations, the polyamides specifically inhibit Tax transactivation in vitro, without altering CREB-activated transcription or basal transcription from the same promoter. Together, these data provide strong evidence that Tax-viral CRE interaction is essential for Tax function in vitro, and suggest that targeted disruption of the Tax-DNA minor groove interaction with polyamides may provide a novel approach for inhibiting viral replication in vivo.","['Lenzmeier, B A', 'Baird, E E', 'Dervan, P B', 'Nyborg, J K']","['Lenzmeier BA', 'Baird EE', 'Dervan PB', 'Nyborg JK']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, 80523-1870, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,"['0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Nylons)']",IM,"['Base Composition', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/metabolism', 'DNA, Viral/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nylons/chemical synthesis/chemistry/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Transcriptional Activation']",,1999/08/24 00:00,1999/08/24 00:01,['1999/08/24 00:00'],"['1999/08/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/24 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/jmbi.1999.2969 [doi]', 'S0022-2836(99)92969-8 [pii]']",ppublish,J Mol Biol. 1999 Aug 27;291(4):731-44. doi: 10.1006/jmbi.1999.2969.,['Copyright 1999 Academic Press.'],,"['R01 CA055035/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA055035-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM51747/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA55035/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

The activity alterations of N -acetylglucosaminyltransferase III and V (GnT-III, GnT-V) as well as alpha-1,6-fucosyl-tranferase (alpha1,6 Fuc T) were studied during the differentiation of HL-60 cells by the above-mentioned five inducers using the fluorescence (PA)-labeled glycan-HPLC method for GnT assays and biotin-labeled glycan-LCA affinity chromatography combined with the HRP-avidin colorimetric method for alpha1,6 Fuc T assay. It was observed that after 3 days, all three enzymes decreased in HL-60 cells induced by 1 micromol/l ATRA and 0.6 mmol/l n-BA, while GnT-III and alpha1,6 Fuc T increased, but GnT-V still decreased after induction by 1% DMSO. GnT-V and alpha1,6 Fuc T declined, while GnT-III was elevated after induction by 0.1 micromol/l PMA for 3 days. In contrast, GnT-III increased after the treatment with 50 micromol/l GM(3)for 3 or 6 days, but GnT-V was not appreciably changed and alpha1,6 FucT was elevated after 6 days of GM(3)treatment. It may be concluded that the decrease of GnT-V is the common change in myeloid differentiation and the increase of GnT-III is the general alteration in monocytoid differentiation. The changes in the activities of glycosyltransferases were consistent with the structural changes in surface N -glycans previously found in our laboratory, i.e. that the antennary number of N -glycans decreased during myeloid differentiation by ATRA, and the amount of bisecting GlcNAc in N -glycans increased during monocytoid differentiation by PMA.","['Liu, A H', 'Liu, F', 'Li, Z', 'Gu, J X', 'Chen, H L']","['Liu AH', 'Liu F', 'Li Z', 'Gu JX', 'Chen HL']","['Key Laboratory of Glycoconjugate Research, Ministry of Public Health, Department of Biochemistry, Shanghai Medical University, Shanghai, 200032, P.R.

The ratio of diadenosine 5',5'''-P1,P3-triphosphate to diadenosine 5',5'''-P1,P4-tetraphosphate (Ap3A/Ap4A) is sensitive to the cellular status and alters when cultured cells undergo differentiation or are treated with interferons. In cells undergoing apoptosis induced by DNA topoisomerase II inhibitor VP16, the concentration of Ap3A decreases significantly while that of Ap4A increases. Here, we have examined the effects of exogenously added Ap3A and Ap4A on apoptosis and morphological differentiation. Penetration of Ap(n)A into cells was achieved by cold shock. Ap4A at 10 microM induced programmed cell death in human HL60, U937 and Jurkat cells and mouse VMRO cells and this effect appeared to require Ap4A breakdown as hydrolysis-resistant analogues of Ap4A were inactive. On its own, Ap3A induced neither apoptosis nor cell differentiation but did display strong synergism with the protein kinase C activators 12-deoxyphorbol-13-O-phenylacetate and 12-deoxyphorbol-13-O-phenylacetate-20-acetate in inducing differentiation of HL60 cells. We propose that Ap4A and Ap3A are physiological antagonists in determination of the cellular status: Ap4A induces apoptosis whereas Ap3A is a co-inductor of differentiation.

Structural rearrangements affected chromosome arms 2p, 2q, 5q, 9p, 12p (n = 2), 6q, 11p (n = 3), and 21q (n = 4). An extra chromosome 21 was found to be the most frequent anomaly. It was detected in 6 out of 41 patients at initial diagnosis (15%) and in 7 out of the 9 patients at relapse. No karyotype with trisomy 21 exceeded 47 chromosomes. Gain of chromosome 21 was the sole anomaly in GTG-banding analysis in 2/41 patients at initial diagnosis and in 4/9 at relapse. Notably, chromosome painting analysis performed in 11 out of the 13 patients with an extra chromosome 21 revealed duplication of the normal chromosome 21 in 8, and duplication of der(21)t(12;21) in 3 patients. Furthermore, gain of der(21)t(12;21) chromosome was confined exclusively to the relapse patients.","['Loncarevic, I F', 'Roitzheim, B', 'Ritterbach, J', 'Viehmann, S', 'Borkhardt, A', 'Lampert, F', 'Harbott, J']","['Loncarevic IF', 'Roitzheim B', 'Ritterbach J', 'Viehmann S', 'Borkhardt A', 'Lampert F', 'Harbott J']","[""Children's University Hospital, Giessen, Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)']",IM,"['Child', 'Chromosome Aberrations/*genetics', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Down Syndrome/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', '*Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Recurrence', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics']",,1999/08/19 10:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1999/08/19 10:00'],"['1999/08/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/08/19 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/(SICI)1098-2264(199903)24:3<272::AID-GCC13>3.0.CO;2-U [pii]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1999 Mar;24(3):272-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The karyotype, which has not changed significantly over several years of culture, was described initially as 44,XY,-5,del(7q),inv(7q),add(8q),add(11q),del(12p),-15,-17,+mar. With the advent of multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) techniques, the prospect of accurately characterizing this complex karyotype became feasible. In the present study, we applied 24-color whole-chromosome painting and analyzed the results using a filter-based detection system and proprietary software for multiplex FISH (M-FISH). This resulted in the refinement of the karyotype and the identification of hitherto unsuspected chromosome rearrangements. M-FISH identified the origin of the add(8q) and add(11q) as well as the small marker chromosome. Both the del(7q) and del(12p) were redefined as unbalanced translocations and an apparently normal chromosome 11 was shown to be t(11;17). Importantly, the del(12p) was shown to be a der(12)t(7;12). Single-color whole-chromosome painting studies confirmed these findings, but also identified a cryptic t(Y;12) not seen in the original M-FISH analysis. We then carried out a FISH screening assay using a complete set of chromosome-specific subtelomeric probes. This allowed the identification of p and q subtelomeric regions involved in the translocations and indicated amplification of the 8q subtelomeric region. Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) revealed a highly unbalanced karyotype, as deletions accompanied the majority of translocations, and identified the regions of amplification as 8q22.3-qter and 11q21-qter. Finally, conventional FISH with centromeric and unique sequence probes was necessary to elucidate all of the rearrangements.","['Tosi, S', 'Giudici, G', 'Rambaldi, A', 'Scherer, S W', 'Bray-Ward, P', 'Dirscherl, L', 'Biondi, A', 'Kearney, L']","['Tosi S', 'Giudici G', 'Rambaldi A', 'Scherer SW', 'Bray-Ward P', 'Dirscherl L', 'Biondi A', 'Kearney L']","['Institute of Molecular Medicine, Headington, Oxford, England.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,['0 (DNA Probes)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosome Painting', 'DNA Probes/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid/genetics', 'Telomere/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*chemistry']",,1999/08/19 10:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1999/08/19 10:00'],"['1999/08/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/08/19 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/(SICI)1098-2264(199903)24:3<213::AID-GCC6>3.0.CO;2-B [pii]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1999 Mar;24(3):213-21.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS: From a population based series of 5078 children diagnosed in the UK during 1980-94, 4988 remained for analysis after exclusion of nine children ascertained from death certificates alone and 81 who received no antileukaemia treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Actuarial survival rates. RESULTS: Between 1980-84 and 1990-94, the proportion of children treated at paediatric oncology centres rose from 77% to 89%, and the proportion entered into national trials rose from 59% to 82%. Each of age, sex, white blood count, immunophenotype, and Down's syndrome status had a highly significant effect on survival. Five year survival improved from 67% in 1980-84 to 81% in 1990-94, a 42% reduction in the risk of death within five years of diagnosis. Survival did not differ significantly between hospitals with different numbers of new patients per year or between paediatric oncology centres and other hospitals. Children who were entered into national trials had higher survival and this difference became greater in recent years; five year survival rates for children diagnosed during 1980-84 were 70% and 64% for trial and non-trial patients, respectively; in 1990-94 the rates were 84% and 68% for trial and non-trial patients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Survival after ALL continues to improve. Nearly 50 children/year diagnosed during 1990-94 survived who would have died a decade before. Survival does not vary systematically with place of treatment but is higher for children entered into national trials.","['Stiller, C A', 'Eatock, E M']","['Stiller CA', 'Eatock EM']","['Childhood Cancer Research Group, Department of Paediatrics, University of Oxford, 57 Woodstock Road, Oxford OX2 6HJ, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Arch Dis Child,Archives of disease in childhood,0372434,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Distribution', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Down Syndrome/complications', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Oncology Service, Hospital/organization & administration', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/etiology/*mortality/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Registries', 'Sex Distribution', 'Survival Rate/trends', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",PMC1718071,1999/08/18 00:00,1999/08/18 00:01,['1999/08/18 00:00'],"['1999/08/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/18 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/adc.81.3.202 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Dis Child. 1999 Sep;81(3):202-8. doi: 10.1136/adc.81.3.202.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we evaluated the targeting potential of a synthetic receptor binding epitope (NP) covalently attached to a water-soluble polymeric drug carrier. In particular, the biorecognition of N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (HPMA) copolymer-NP conjugates by B- and T-cells and the cytotoxicity of HPMA copolymer-NP-adriamycin (ADR) conjugates toward B-cells, T-cells, and peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) were evaluated. METHODS: HPMA copolymer-NP and optionally ADR conjugates varying in the NP density and mode of NP attachment were incubated with Raji B-cells (human Burkitt's lymphoma), CCRF-CEM T-cells (acute human lymphoblastic leukemia), and CCRF-HSB-2 T-cells (human lymphoblastic leukemia). The kinetics of binding was studied, the Langmuir adsorption isotherms analyzed, binding constants calculated, and IC50 doses determined. RESULTS: Flow cytometry studies revealed that binding was homogeneous to both cell types. The apparent binding constants to T-cells were about two times higher when compared to B-cells. The binding and cytotoxicity increased with increased amount of epitopes per polymer chain. Attachment of the NP via a GFLG spacer resulted in increased biorecognition when compared with conjugates containing NP bound via a GG spacer. HPMA copolymer-NP-ADR conjugates possessed specific cytotoxicity to T- and B-malignant cells. Concentrations, which were lethal to the latter, were not toxic for PBL. CONCLUSIONS: The data obtained seem to indicate the potential of the HPMA copolymer-NP conjugates as polymer anticancer drug carriers targetable to immunocompetent cells.","['Omelyanenko, V', 'Kopeckova, P', 'Prakash, R K', 'Ebert, C D', 'Kopecek, J']","['Omelyanenko V', 'Kopeckova P', 'Prakash RK', 'Ebert CD', 'Kopecek J']","['Department of Pharmaceutics and Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of Utah, Salt Lake City 84112, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Pharm Res,Pharmaceutical research,8406521,"['0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Epitopes, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Immunoconjugates)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Polymethacrylic Acids)', '0 (Receptors, Complement 3d)', '0 (doxorubicin-N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide copolymer conjugate)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/drug therapy/immunology', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/toxicity', 'Drug Carriers', 'Epitopes, B-Lymphocyte/*immunology/metabolism', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/*immunology/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoconjugates/*immunology/metabolism/pharmacokinetics/toxicity', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/drug therapy/immunology', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology', 'Oligopeptides/administration & dosage/*immunology/pharmacokinetics', 'Polymethacrylic Acids/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/toxicity', 'Receptors, Complement 3d/*immunology/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/08/18 00:00,1999/08/18 00:01,['1999/08/18 00:00'],"['1999/08/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/18 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1018975414165 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharm Res. 1999 Jul;16(7):1010-9. doi: 10.1023/a:1018975414165.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: HPLC-based quantitative detection methods were used to measure calphostin C levels in lysates of leukemic cells and in plasma of mice treated with calphostin C. The plasma concentration-time data were analyzed using the WinNonlin program. In vitro esterases and a microsome P450 preparation in conjunction with a LC-MS(API-EI) system were used to study the metabolism of calphostin C. RESULTS: An intracellular exposure level (AUC0-6h) of 257 microM x h was achieved after in vitro treatment of NALM-6 cells with calphostin C at a 5 microM final concentration in culture medium. After intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of a 40 mg/kg nontoxic bolus dose of calphostin C, the estimated Cmax was 2.9 microM, which is higher than the effective in vitro concentration of calphostin C against leukemic cells. Drug absorption after i.p. administration was rapid with an absorption half-life of 24.2 min and the estimated t(max) was 63.0 min. Calphostin C was cleared with an elimination half-life of 91.3 min. An inactive and smaller metabolite (calphostin B) was detected in plasma of calphostin C-treated mice with a t(max) of 41.3 min. Esterase (but not P450) treatment of calphostin C in vitro yielded an inactive metabolite (calphostin B) of the same size and elution profile. CONCLUSIONS: Target plasma calphostin C concentrations of potent antileukemic activity can be reached in mice at nontoxic dose levels.

However, it is not clear whether the plasma membranes or the mitochondria, or both are involved; nor is it known which of these two targets is more important for regaining the cells former drug sensitivity. For the present study, we treated WSU-CLL cells with Bryo 1, isolated plasma membranes and mitochondria, and then subjected the purified fractions to infrared (IR) spectroscopic and chromatographic analyses. IR spectroscopy revealed a decreased glycosylation of both plasma membranes and mitochondria in Bryo 1-treated cells compared to untreated cells. The amount of lipid relative to protein was increased in both types of membranes, but considerably more enhanced in the plasma membrane fraction of the Bryo 1-treated cells than in mitochondria. Quantitative lipid analysis by thin layer chromatography also revealed that Bryo 1 treatment significantly increased the phospholipid content in plasma membranes, whereas the lipids in the mitochondria remained essentially unchanged. Changes in lipid composition were quite dramatic for plasma membranes where phosphatidylcholines were decreased by 50%, phosphatidylethanolamines doubled and sphingomyelins increased five-fold compared to the lipid composition in plasma membranes of untreated cells. In addition, the IR spectroscopic analysis provided evidence for an increased plasma membrane fluidity in Bryo 1-treated cells, whereas the fluidity of the mitochondria remained essentially unchanged; marker bands indicating mitochondrial DNA decreased upon Bryo 1 treatment. These results suggest that Bryo 1 increases the sensitivity of WSU-CLL cells to chemotherapeutic agents such as 2-CdA by action on two cell targets: (1) introduction of significant changes in plasma membrane permeability or fluidity through modifications in lipid content and composition as well as by reducing the surface glycosylation; (2) introduction of changes in lipid and DNA content of the mitochondria. Small alterations in the lipid composition of the mitochondria may provide the conditions for an altered proton gradient and transmembrane potential leading to apoptosis and decreased cell survival.","['Liu, K Z', 'Schultz, C P', 'Johnston, J B', 'Beck, F W', 'Al-Katib, A M', 'Mohammad, R M', 'Mantsch, H H']","['Liu KZ', 'Schultz CP', 'Johnston JB', 'Beck FW', 'Al-Katib AM', 'Mohammad RM', 'Mantsch HH']","['Institute for Biodiagnostics, National Research Council, Winnipeg, MB, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Membrane Lipids)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Bryostatins', 'Cell Membrane/chemistry/*drug effects/*pathology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Lactones/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Macrolides', 'Membrane Lipids/chemistry', 'Membrane Proteins/chemistry', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/pathology/ultrastructure', 'Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/08/18 00:00,1999/08/18 00:01,['1999/08/18 00:00'],"['1999/08/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/18 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401463 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Aug;13(8):1273-80. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401463.,,,['R01-CA-79837-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

FL progenitors are known to have higher proliferative capacities and lower cytokine requirements than their ABM counterparts. In this study, we isolated FL and ABM CD34++ CD38- cells and used a two-stage culture system to investigate the effects of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and blocking anti-TGF-beta antibodies (anti-TGF-beta) on these cells. First, we demonstrate that FL progenitors are significantly less sensitive to the inhibitory effects of TGF-beta than ABM cells. Second, whereas ABM cells are significantly stimulated by anti-TGF-beta, only very limited effects are seen on FL cells. Third, we show that the effect of anti-TGF-beta is mainly situated at the level of the initial cell cycles of very primitive progenitor cells with a high proliferation potential. Fourth, we demonstrate that blocking the effects of endogenous TGF-beta reduces the growth factor requirements of ABM cells in order to proliferate and differentiate. Based on these data, we hypothesize that at least part of the functional differences that exist between adult and fetal stem cells can be accounted for by a developmental different responsiveness to TGF-beta.","['Weekx, S F', 'Plum, J', 'Van Cauwelaert, P', 'Lenjou, M', 'Nijs, G', 'De Smedt, M', 'Vanhove, M', 'Muylaert, P', 'Van Bockstaele, D R', 'Berneman, Z N', 'Snoeck, H W']","['Weekx SF', 'Plum J', 'Van Cauwelaert P', 'Lenjou M', 'Nijs G', 'De Smedt M', 'Vanhove M', 'Muylaert P', 'Van Bockstaele DR', 'Berneman ZN', 'Snoeck HW']","['Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, University of Antwerp, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Fetus/cytology/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Pregnancy', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*pharmacology']",,1999/08/18 00:00,1999/08/18 00:01,['1999/08/18 00:00'],"['1999/08/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/18 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401462 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Aug;13(8):1266-72. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401462.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have studied the impact of combining PB with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) on the ML-1 myeloid leukemia cell line. ATRA augmented PB-induced differentiation, cell-cycle arrest, and apoptosis. ATRA augmented PB induction of the myelomonocytic marker CD11b at all doses of ATRA tested (0.0025-1 microM). Although ATRA did not significantly affect the ED50 of PB, the combination of ATRA (1 microM) and PB (0.5 mM) augmented PB-induced CD11b expression eight-fold. Compared to PB alone, this combination of ATRA and PB induced greater cell cycle arrest (S-phase 14% vs 38%; G0/G1-phase cells 72% vs 52%) and greater apoptosis (24% vs 16% by TUNEL assay). Treatment with ATRA (0.5 microM) in combination with PB (0.5 mM) led to significantly greater inhibition of colony formation (4.8% vs 48% inhibition). ATRA combined synergistically with PB to augment CD11b expression and inhibit colony formation. This combination also showed significant interaction in terms of S-phase inhibition. However, this interaction varied as a function of ATRA concentration: antagonistic at low concentrations of ATRA, synergistic at higher concentrations of ATRA. These data suggest that retinoids may significantly augment the cytostatic and differentiating activity of PB, leading to increased potency of the latter drug at clinically achievable doses.","['Yu, K H', 'Weng, L J', 'Fu, S', 'Piantadosi, S', 'Gore, S D']","['Yu KH', 'Weng LJ', 'Fu S', 'Piantadosi S', 'Gore SD']","['The Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Baltimore, MD 21287-8963, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Phenylbutyrates)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Phenylbutyrates/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/08/18 00:00,1999/08/18 00:01,['1999/08/18 00:00'],"['1999/08/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/18 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401468 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Aug;13(8):1258-65. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401468.,,,"['5 RO1 CA6703-3/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA06973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

Phenotypic and functional abnormalities in T cell compartment have been frequently reported in patients with hairy cell leukemia (HCL) and, in more recent studies, a significant reduction in the absolute number of CD4+ lymphocytes bearing the CD45RO antigen has also been recorded. In our study we evaluated the CD45RA and CD45RO expression on CD4+ T cells by three-color staining in flow cytometry in 38 HCL patients, 19 untreated and 19 previously treated with 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (2-CdA), administered at a daily dose of 0.1 mg/kg c.i. for 7 days. In HCL untreated patients, the proportion and the absolute number of CD4+/CD45RA+ and of CD4+/CD45RO+ T cell subsets were similar to normal controls. In contrast, HCL patients at 3-5 years by the end of treatment with 2-CdA, together with a reduction in the absolute number of CD4+ T cells, showed a persistent and significant decrease in the proportion and absolute number of CD4+/CD45RA+ cells as compared with both untreated HCL patients and normal controls (41 +/- 16% vs 57 +/- 14% and vs 65 +/- 7%) (P = 0.01 and 0.0001) and (0.201 +/- 0.137 x 10(9)/l vs 0.549 +/- 0.238 x 10(9)/l and vs 0.696 +/- 0.078 x 10(9)/l) (P = 0.00009 and P = 0.00001).

In the present study, we have investigated the structural and cellular basis for PB-induced cytostasis, using the ML-1 human myeloid leukemia cell line as a model system. PB induced a dose-dependent increase in cells in G1 with a corresponding decrease in cells in S-phase of the cell cycle. At comparable doses, PB induced expression of CD11b, indicating myeloid differentiation. At higher doses, the drug induced apoptosis. The antitumor activity was independent of the aromatic ring, as butyric acid (BA) was of equal or greater potency at producing these biological changes. In contrast, shortening of the fatty acid carbon chain length, as demonstrated with phenylacetate (PA), significantly diminished drug potency. Consistent with their effects on cell cycle, PB and BA, but not PA, induced the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21(WAF1/CIP1), and led to the appearance of hypophosphorylated Rb, suggesting a role for p21(WAF1/CIP1) in PB-induced cytostasis. Therefore, it appears that the fatty acid moiety of PB, rather than its aromatic ring, is critical for its activity in myeloid leukemic cells. These data provide a potential mechanistic basis for the increased potency of PB over PA previously demonstrated in primary leukemic samples, and support the further clinical development of PB in the treatment of hematologic malignancies.","['DiGiuseppe, J A', 'Weng, L J', 'Yu, K H', 'Fu, S', 'Kastan, M B', 'Samid, D', 'Gore, S D']","['DiGiuseppe JA', 'Weng LJ', 'Yu KH', 'Fu S', 'Kastan MB', 'Samid D', 'Gore SD']","['Department of Oncology, The Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Phenylbutyrates)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'G1 Phase/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Phenylbutyrates/chemistry/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/08/18 00:00,1999/08/18 00:01,['1999/08/18 00:00'],"['1999/08/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/18 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401471 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Aug;13(8):1243-53. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401471.,,,"['5 R01 CA6703-3/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA61949/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA06973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

Among these 12, six patients (50%) harbored a TP53 mutation, and two of five examined showed microsatellite instability, suggesting replication error (RER+) phenotype. Meanwhile, among the other nine patients without -5/5q- and/or -7/7q-, none harbored a TP53 mutation, and none of five examined showed RER+ phenotype. Thus, TP53 mutations and RER+ phenotype were preferentially associated with specific chromosomal losses in t-AML/MDS. We then screened for mutational events in representative DNA mismatch repair genes; exons 5-7 and 12-15 of the hMSH2 gene and exon 9 of hMLH1. Notably, two unrelated patients showing RER+ phenotype had an identical missense alteration at codon 419 of hMSH2 in their marrow cells and fibroblasts, which were not found in 120 DNA samples from healthy volunteers or patients with other hematological disorders. Consequently, this study revealed a possible relationship of RER+ phenotype accompanying an hMSH2 alteration to the development of therapy-related AML/MDS in association with TP53 mutations and specific chromosomal losses, and suggests that some patients may be predisposed to myelodysplasia after chemotherapy for their primary tumor.","['Horiike, S', 'Misawa, S', 'Kaneko, H', 'Sasai, Y', 'Kobayashi, M', 'Fujii, H', 'Tanaka, S', 'Yagita, M', 'Abe, T', 'Kashima, K', 'Taniwaki, M']","['Horiike S', 'Misawa S', 'Kaneko H', 'Sasai Y', 'Kobayashi M', 'Fujii H', 'Tanaka S', 'Yagita M', 'Abe T', 'Kashima K', 'Taniwaki M']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Satellite)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Base Pair Mismatch', 'Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'DNA Replication', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'DNA, Satellite/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/chemically induced/diagnostic imaging/*genetics/pathology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/genetics/pathology', 'Radionuclide Imaging', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics']",,1999/08/18 00:00,1999/08/18 00:01,['1999/08/18 00:00'],"['1999/08/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/18 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401466 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Aug;13(8):1235-42. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401466.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, quality control of transplants is getting increasing interest. We studied leukapheresis products (LPs), consecutively collected during postremission treatment of 20 patients with de novo AML for minimal residual disease (MRD) by 5-parametric flow cytometry and for myelodysplasia (MDS)-associated alterations by paired lineage-selected colony assays for colony-forming units-megakaryocytes (CFU-mega) and burst-granulocytes-monocytes colony-forming units (CFU) to evaluate the predictive value of these transplant-associated parameters on outcome. We defined the leukemia-associated immunophenotype at diagnosis and studied the impact of MRD detection in LPs collected after double induction with TAD (thioguanine, daunorubicin, cytarabine) and HAM (mitoxantrone, high-dose cytarabine, n=18 patients) and TAD consolidation treatment (n=20 patients) on outcome after aPBSCT. The level of MRD in the transplants correlated with the relapse-free survival (RFS) using a cut-off level of 1 x 10(-3) residual leukemic cells. The median RFS was 6 months for the group with > or = 1 x 10(-3) residual leukemic cells and has not been reached in the group with low MRD levels (< 1 x 10(-3)). By using the same cut-off level a weak correlation could also be demonstrated between MRD in the pregraft bone marrow and RFS (P = 0.04). Quantitatively abnormal megakaryocytic colony growth in the back-up LPs collected after double induction and in the transplant LPs was characterized by the ratio CFU-mega/CFU. In the group of relapsing patients the ratio CFU-mega/CFU was significantly lower than in the group of patients with CCR (P = 0.004), both in the back-ups and in the transplants. All patients with CFU-mega/CFU ratios < 0.12 relapsed, five of seven patients developed MDS before progressing to full leukemic relapse. Using the optimized cut-off level for the ratio CFU-mega/CFU (< vs > or = 0.12), seven of 10 relapsing patients (70%) could be identified to be at risk of relapse, whereas MRD in the transplants identified only 50% of the relapses and MRD in the pregraft bone marrow 25%. In conclusion, the study could identify two pretransplant risk factors predicting relapse in patients with AML receiving aPBSCT in first CR: MRD in transplants as well as MDS-like alterations within the transplants. These results may have multifold implications on the design of risk-adapted chemotherapy as well as on purging techniques and may contribute to a better understanding of leukemogenesis.","['Reichle, A', 'Rothe, G', 'Krause, S', 'Zaiss, M', 'Ullrich, H', 'Schmitz, G', 'Andreesen, R']","['Reichle A', 'Rothe G', 'Krause S', 'Zaiss M', 'Ullrich H', 'Schmitz G', 'Andreesen R']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Regensburg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Graft Survival', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Megakaryocytes/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual/pathology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Recurrence', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",,1999/08/18 00:00,1999/08/18 00:01,['1999/08/18 00:00'],"['1999/08/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/18 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401481 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Aug;13(8):1227-34. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401481.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most promising methods of detecting minimal residual disease (MRD) are flow cytometric identification of leukemia-associated immunophenotypes and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of antigen-receptor genes. However, neither assay can be applied to all patients. Moreover, both assays carry the risk of false-negative findings due to clonal evolution. The simultaneous use of both assays might resolve these problems, but the correlation between the methods is unknown. We studied serial dilutions of normal and leukemic cells by flow cytometry and PCR amplification of IgH genes and found the two methods highly sensitive (one leukemic cell among 10(4) or more normal cells), accurate (r2 was 0.999 for flow cytometry and 0.960 for PCR by regression analysis) and concordant (r2 = 0.962).

The goal of the EMA91 study was to determine whether administration of GM-CSF between the two sequences of EMA chemotherapy and during the second sequence could increase therapeutic efficacy by potentially increasing leukemic cell recruitment into the S phase of cell cycle before the second sequence. One hundred and ninety-two patients aged less than 65 years with previously treated AML received GM-CSF, 5 microg/kg/day or placebo from day 4 to day 8 of EMA chemotherapy. One hundred and twenty were refractory and 72 were in first relapse after a complete remission (CR) of more than 6 months duration.

Filgrastim was given both during and after chemotherapy with the objective to accelerate hematopoietic repopulation and enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy. In a prospective randomized multicentre phase II trial, a total of 64 patients with poor risk primary MDS were randomized to receive either granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF, filgrastim, AMGEN, Breda, The Netherlands) 5 microg/kg/day subcutaneously or no G-CSF in addition to daunomycin (30 mg/m2/days 1, 2 and 3 intravenous bolus) and cytarabine (200 mg/m2 days 1-7, continuous infusion). The overall complete response rate was 63%: 73% for patients receiving filgrastim as compared to 52% in the standard arm (P = 0.08). Overall survival at 2 years was estimated at 29% for patients assigned to the filgrastim arm and 16% for control patients (P = 0.22). The median time for recovery of granulocytes towards 1.0 x 10(9)/l post-chemotherapy was 23 days in the filgrastim-treated patients vs 35 days in the standard arm (P = 0.015). There were no differences in time of platelet recovery, length of hospital stay, duration of antibiotic use or infectious complications between the two treatment groups. However the earlier recovery of neutrophils in the filgrastim group was associated with a reduced interval of 9 days between the induction and consolidation cycle. In patients with poor risk MDS the use of filgrastim during and after induction therapy results in a significantly reduced neutrophil recovery time.

TGF-beta has pleiotropic and profound effects on the immune system and on hematologic malignancies, ie leukemia. It is the most potent immunosuppressor described to date. Evidence exists that the immunosuppressive potential of TGF-beta is an important promoter of malignant cell growth. This is partly caused by TGF-beta-induced interference with the generation of tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes, but also by TGF-beta-induced promotion of angiogenesis and tumor stroma formation. Until now, significant clinical responses have not been achieved with the current cancer immunotherapeutic approaches. One of the possible explanations for this failure is immunosuppression induced by tumor-derived TGF-beta. Here, several strategies to counteract the immunosuppressive effects of TGF-beta and the current limitations of these strategies will be discussed.

These antileukemic effects can be either nonspecific cytotoxicity (killer cell activity) or reactivity against leukemia-specific antigenic peptides presented by self-HLA molecules. The antigen-specific T cell activation requires recognition of specific peptides together with costimulatory signalling. For most patients the AML blasts express both HLA class I and class II molecules for antigenic presentation, but patients are heterogeneous with regard to: (1) expression of costimulatory binding molecules; (2) expression of receptors/counterreceptors involved in induction of apoptosis; (3) constitutive release of immunomodulatory soluble mediators. This heterogeneity suggests that the ability of AML blasts to initiate an antileukemic T cell response will differ between individual patients. Thus, clinical approaches for immunotherapy in AML have to overcome three major problems. First, the therapy should reduce the patient heterogeneity so that therapeutic effects become more predictable; or alternatively one should define patient subsets which are likely to benefit from immunotherapy. Second, immunotherapy should enhance antileukemic T cell reactivity or blast susceptibility to immune attacks. Third, the therapeutic procedures must be safe and suitable for routine use. All three problems probably have to be solved before immunotherapy can become a routine treatment.","['Bruserud, O']",['Bruserud O'],"['Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital and the University of Bergen, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)'],IM,"['Cell Adhesion Molecules/immunology', 'Cell Communication/*immunology', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex/immunology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*immunology/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology']",,1999/08/18 00:00,1999/08/18 00:01,['1999/08/18 00:00'],"['1999/08/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/18 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401452 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Aug;13(8):1175-87. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401452.,,,,177,,,,,,,,,

Research has focused on different biochemical and genetic aspects of these processes. Initially, cytokines were identified by clonogenic assays and purified by biochemical techniques. This soon led to the molecular cloning of the genes encoding the cytokines and their cognate receptors. Determining the structure and regulation of these genes in normal and malignant hematopoietic cells has furthered our understanding of neoplastic transformation. Furthermore, this has allowed the design of modified cytokines which are able to stimulate multiple receptors and be more effective in stimulating the repopulation of hematopoietic cells after myelosuppressive chemotherapy. The mechanisms by which cytokines transduce their regulatory signals have been evaluated by identifying the involvement of specific protein kinase cascades and their downstream transcription factor targets. The effects of cytokines on cell cycle regulatory molecules, which either promote or arrest cell cycle progression, have been more recently examined. In addition, the mechanisms by which cytokines regulate apoptotic proteins, which mediate survival vs death, are being elucidated. Identification and characterization of these complex, interconnected pathways has expanded our knowledge of leukemogenesis substantially. This information has the potential to guide the development of therapeutic drugs designed to target key intermediates in these pathways and effectively treat patients with leukemias and lymphomas. This review focuses on the current understanding of how hematopoietic cytokines such as IL-3, as well as its cognate receptor, are expressed and the mechanisms by which they transmit their growth regulatory signals. The effects of aberrant regulation of these molecules on signal transduction, cell cycle regulatory and apoptotic pathways in transformed hematopoietic cells are discussed.

Responders had statistically significant prolongation of survival compared with nonresponders. The nonmyeloablative, maximum tolerated dose for each of two doses of 131I-Lym-1 was 3.7 GBq/m2 (total 7.4 GBq/m2 [100 mCi/m2, total 200 mCi/m2]) of body surface area. The purpose of this study was to determine the pharmacokinetics and radiation dosimetry for the initial 131I-Lym-1 therapy dose in patients with NHL and CLL and to compare tumor dosimetry with 131I-Lym-1 dosing and other patient parameters. METHODS: Fifty-one patients with stage 3 or 4 lymphoma were treated with 131I-Lym-1 (0.74-8.04 GBq [20-217 mCi]) in either a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or low-dose (LD) trial. Total Lym-1 given to each patient was sufficient in all instances to exceed the threshold required for stable pharmacokinetics. Quantitative imaging and physical examination, including caliper and CT measurement of tumor size and analysis of blood, urine and feces, were performed for a period of 7 to 10 d after infusion to assess pharmacokinetics and radiation dosimetry. Clinical records were reviewed to obtain data required for comparative assessments. RESULTS: The concentration (%ID/g) and biologic half-time of 131-Lym-1 in tumor were about twice those in normal tissues, although tumor half-time was similar to that of the thyroid. Pharmacokinetics were similar for patients in the MTD and LD trials, and for NHL and CLL patients in the LD trial, except that the latter group had less tumor concentration of 131I. Mean tumor radiation dose per unit of administered 131I was 1.0 Gy/GBq (3.7 rad/mCi) for patients with NHL whether in MTD or LD trials, about nine times greater than that for body or marrow. Tumor radiation dose was less and liver radiation dose was more in patients with CLL. Otherwise, radiation dosimetry was, on average, remarkably similar among groups of patients and among individual patients. Pharmacokinetics and dosimetry did not appear to be influenced by the amount of 131I or Lym-1 within the ranges administered. Tumor concentration of 131I and radiation dose per gigabecquerel were inversely related to tumor size but did not seem to be related to histologic grade or type, tumor burden or therapeutic response. CONCLUSION: The therapeutic index of 131I-Lym-1 was favorable, although the index for patients with CLL was less than that for patients with NHL. Pharmacokinetics and radiation dosimetry were, on average, remarkably similar among patients and groups of patients in different trials.","['DeNardo, G L', 'DeNardo, S J', 'Shen, S', 'DeNardo, D A', 'Mirick, G R', 'Macey, D J', 'Lamborn, K R']","['DeNardo GL', 'DeNardo SJ', 'Shen S', 'DeNardo DA', 'Mirick GR', 'Macey DJ', 'Lamborn KR']","['University of California Davis Medical Center, Sacramento, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Nucl Med,"Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",0217410,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '0 (Radiopharmaceuticals)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacokinetics', 'Binding Sites', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Iodine Radioisotopes/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/blood', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*radiotherapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Radioimmunotherapy', 'Radiometry', 'Radiopharmaceuticals/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Splenectomy']",,1999/08/18 00:00,1999/08/18 00:01,['1999/08/18 00:00'],"['1999/08/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/18 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/18 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Nucl Med. 1999 Aug;40(8):1317-26.,,,['CA47829/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

Pig STSs representing 11 HSA 3 genes, including v-Raf-1 murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 (RAF1), retinoic acid beta receptor (RARB), cholecystokinin (CCK), pituitary transcription factor 1 (POU1F1), ceruloplasmin (CP), guanine nucleotide binding protein, alpha-inhibiting polypeptide 2 (GNAI2), sucrase-isomaltase (SI), rhodopsin (RHO), dopamine receptor D3 (DRD3), growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43), and somatostatin (SST), were developed. Ten pig STSs were regionally mapped using a somatic cell hybrid panel (SCHP) to SSC 13 with 80-100% concordance. Large-insert probes were obtained by screening a pig yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) library with primers for each STS. Several YACs were identified for DRD3, GAP43, POU1F1, RHO, SI, and SST for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) mapping. Single gene and bi-color FISH with each pairwise combination were used to further define the gene order on SSC 13. While these data confirm chromosome painting results showing that HSA 3 probes hybridize to a major portion of SSC 13, they also demonstrate extensive gene-order differences between man and pig within this large conserved synteny group. Interestingly, several conserved chromosomal regions have been detected between pig and mouse that are not conserved between man and mouse, suggesting that the SSC 13 gene arrangement may be the closest to that of the ancestral eutherian chromosome.","['Sun, H F', 'Ernst, C W', 'Yerle, M', 'Pinton, P', 'Rothschild, M F', 'Chardon, P', 'Rogel-Gaillard, C', 'Tuggle, C K']","['Sun HF', 'Ernst CW', 'Yerle M', 'Pinton P', 'Rothschild MF', 'Chardon P', 'Rogel-Gaillard C', 'Tuggle CK']","['Department of Animal Science, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Switzerland,Cytogenet Cell Genet,Cytogenetics and cell genetics,0367735,,IM,"['Animals', '*Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3/*genetics', '*Conserved Sequence', 'Humans', 'Hybrid Cells', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Sequence Tagged Sites', 'Swine/*genetics']",,1999/08/18 00:00,1999/08/18 00:01,['1999/08/18 00:00'],"['1999/08/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/18 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/18 00:00 [entrez]']","['15312 [pii]', '10.1159/000015312 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytogenet Cell Genet. 1999;85(3-4):273-8. doi: 10.1159/000015312.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to compare the outcomes of laparoscopic splenectomy for patients with HM to those with benign disease (BD). METHODS: A review was conducted of a prospectively accumulated database of 64 consecutive, unselected laparoscopic splenectomies performed by two surgeons between March 1992 and August 1997. RESULTS: Of 14 patients with HM (7 lymphoma, 6 leukemia, 1 myeloid metaplasia), three required conversion to open splenectomy (21%). In the remaining 11 patients, two had postoperation complications (18%), including one death from sepsis (9%). Of 50 patients with BD (36 idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura [ITP], 5 spherocytosis, 4 hemolytic anemia, and 5 others), three were converted to open surgery (6%). Complications developed in 5 (11%) of the remaining 47 patients. No deaths occurred. All patients who had spleens larger than 27 cm in diameter required conversion. Patients undergoing laparoscopic splenectomy for HM were older (54 +/- 16 years vs. 36 +/- 18 years; p = 0.002), had larger spleens (median 17.0 cm vs. 11.0 cm; p < 0.001), and had lower preoperation hemoglobin levels (113 +/- 30 g/L vs. 132 +/- 23 g/L; p = 0.03) than patients with BD. The HM group required longer operation time (239 +/- 73 min vs. 180 +/- 61 min; p < 0.01), but showed no differences with respect to operation blood loss (median, 100 vs. 165 mL), requirement for transfusion (median, 0.0 vs. 0.0 units), and length of hospital stay (median 3.0 vs. 3.0 days). CONCLUSIONS: Although patients with HM had larger spleens and required longer operation time for laparoscopic splenectomy, surgical outcomes were equivalent. The laparoscopic approach should be preferred, even for patients with HM. The only limitation appears to be splenic size greater than 27 cm.","['Schlachta, C M', 'Poulin, E C', 'Mamazza, J']","['Schlachta CM', 'Poulin EC', 'Mamazza J']","[""The University of Toronto Centre for Minimally Invasive Surgery, St. Michael's Hospital, Wellesley Central Site JB 217B, 160 Wellesley Street East, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, M4Y 1J3.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Surg Endosc,Surgical endoscopy,8806653,,IM,"['Adult', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Female', 'Hematologic Diseases/surgery', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*surgery', 'Humans', '*Laparoscopy', 'Length of Stay', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Prospective Studies', '*Splenectomy']",,1999/08/18 00:00,1999/08/18 00:01,['1999/08/18 00:00'],"['1999/08/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/18 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/18 00:00 [entrez]']","['SRGNDM98-062 [pii]', '10.1007/s004649901121 [doi]']",ppublish,Surg Endosc. 1999 Sep;13(9):865-8. doi: 10.1007/s004649901121.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These processes are regulated by extracellular stimuli such as cytokines, cell-cell interactions, and cell-matrix interactions, which trigger a series of intracellular events culminating in the modulation of specific genes. STATs are a highly homologous group of transcription factors that are activated by various pathways and regulate many of the genes controlling cellular function. STATs are activated by tyrosine phosphorylation and modulated by serine phosphorylation, placing them at a convergence point for numerous intracellular signaling pathways. Given the importance of STATs in the control of normal physiologic processes, it is not surprising that inappropriate activation of these proteins has been found in human malignancies. A number of distinct mechanisms have been elucidated by which STATs are activated inappropriately, including autocrine or paracrine stimulation of normal receptors and increased activity of tyrosine kinases through enhanced expression, mutations, or the presence of activating proteins. Furthermore, inappropriate STAT serine phosphorylation has been found in several tumors as well. The increased understanding of signaling pathways in tumors can be translated into therapeutic strategies that have the potential to be more selective and less toxic than current anti-cancer treatments. Approaches which may be effective include the development of antagonists of receptors that can trigger STAT activation, inhibitors of the tyrosine and serine kinases that phosphorylate and activate STATs, agents that decrease STAT levels or inhibit their recruitment to kinases, and molecules that can prevent the binding of STATs to target DNA sequences. Thus, elucidation of cellular and biochemical processes in tumors has enhanced our understanding of the pathogenesis of malignancies and may provide the basis for significant advances in therapy.","['Frank, D A']",['Frank DA'],"[""Department of Adult Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Brigham and Women's Hospital, and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA. david_frank@dfci.harvard.edu""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Mol Med,"Molecular medicine (Cambridge, Mass.)",9501023,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism', 'Lymphoma', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/drug effects', 'src-Family Kinases/metabolism']",PMC2230445,1999/08/18 00:00,1999/08/18 00:01,['1999/08/18 00:00'],"['1999/08/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/18 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['0155 [pii]'],ppublish,Mol Med. 1999 Jul;5(7):432-56.,,,['CA79547/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],245,,,,,,,,,

Certain classes of AIDS NHL are associated with alterations in oncogenes or tumor-suppressor genes or infections by oncogenic herpesviruses. However, the clinically significant class of AIDS NHL designated immunoblastic lymphoma plasmacytoid (AIDS IBLP) lacks any consistent genetic alterations. We identified the TCL1 oncogene from a set of AIDS IBLP-associated cDNA fragments generated by subtractive hybridization with non-AIDS IBLP. Aberrant TCL1 expression has been implicated in T cell leukemia/lymphoma development, and its expression also has been seen in many established B cell tumor lines. However, TCL1 expression has not been reported in AIDS NHL. We find that TCL1 is expressed in the majority of AIDS IBLP tumors examined. TCL1 protein expression is restricted to tumor cells in AIDS IBLP tissue samples analyzed with immunohistochemical staining. Hyperplastic lymph node and tonsil also exhibit strong TCL1 protein expression in mantle zone B cells and in rare interfollicular zone cells, whereas follicle-center B cells (centroblasts and centrocytes) show weaker expression. These results establish TCL1 as the most prevalent of all of the surveyed oncogenes associated with AIDS IBLP. They also indicate that abundant TCL1 expression in quiescent mantle zone B cells is down-regulated in activated germinal center follicular B cells in parallel to the known expression pattern of BCL-2. High-level expression in nonproliferating B cells suggests that TCL1 may function in protecting naive preactivated B cells from apoptosis.","['Teitell, M', 'Damore, M A', 'Sulur, G G', 'Turner, D E', 'Stern, M H', 'Said, J W', 'Denny, C T', 'Wall, R']","['Teitell M', 'Damore MA', 'Sulur GG', 'Turner DE', 'Stern MH', 'Said JW', 'Denny CT', 'Wall R']","['Molecular Biology Institute, University of California, Los Angeles School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA. mteitell@ucla.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (CXCL13 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL13)', '0 (Chemokines, CXC)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (TCL1A protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Chemokine CXCL13', 'Chemokines, CXC/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Lymph Nodes/metabolism', 'Lymphoid Tissue/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma, AIDS-Related/*genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*genetics/metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC22292,1999/08/18 00:00,1999/08/18 00:01,['1999/08/18 00:00'],"['1999/08/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/18 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.96.17.9809 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1999 Aug 17;96(17):9809-14. doi: 10.1073/pnas.96.17.9809.,,,"['R01 GM040185/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA66533/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA74929/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM40185/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, the ES cell-derived A-MuLV-transformed pre-B (EAB) cells are phenotypically and functionally indistinguishable from standard A-MuLV-transformed pre-B cells derived from infection of mouse fetal liver or bone marrow.

To develop methods for targeted expression of transgenes, we transduced human CD34+ peripheral blood cells with a murine leukemia virus (MuLV) vector controlled by the human integrin alphaIIb promoter (nucleotides -889 to +35). A naturally occurring cDNA encoding the Pl(A2) alloantigen form (Pro(33)) of the integrin beta3 subunit was subcloned into this construct (-889Pl(A2)beta3) and transduced into cells that endogenously synthesized Pl(A1)beta3 (Leu(33)) as a marker for detection of provirus-derived beta3. The ability of this vector to target expression of Pl(A2)beta3 to megakaryocytes was first examined in cell lines. Immunoblot analysis with human anti-Pl(A2) alloserum detected synthesis of Pl(A2)beta3 in transduced promegakaryocytic cells; however, Pl(A2)beta3 protein was not detected in transduced epithelial cells. Human hematopoietic CD34+ cells were transduced with -889Pl(A2)beta3 virions and induced to differentiate with megakaryocyte growth and development factor.

No cytotoxic T-cell activity was found against melanoma cells, although the endogenous presence of the mycobacterial gene induced a preferential Th1 response. After immunization, a low serological response against melanoma cells was detected, while a high titer of antibodies directed to parental B16 cells, mainly of IgG2(a) isotype, was found in protected mice after challenge. These antibodies exhibited complement-dependent cytotoxicity against melanoma cells in vitro, while in vivo, used in passive immunization, they induced a decrease in a number of experimental B16 lung metastases. Most of the antibodies were directed against endogenous murine leukemia viruses. No reactivity against melanocyte lineage-specific antigens was observed. In particular, no reactivity was found in sera from protected mice against tyrosinase-related protein 2 (TRP-2), either stably expressed in a non-melanoma cell line or obtained by in vitro transcription-translation, or against tyrosinase, TRP-1 and gp100 antigens immunoprecipitated from B16 cells.

Donor T cell expansion on day +13 was increased after conditioning with Cy/TBI compared with Cy or TBI alone, although cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) function was not altered. Histological analysis of the gastrointestinal tract demonstrated synergistic damage by Cy/TBI and allogeneic donor cells, which permitted increased translocation of LPS into the systemic circulation. TNF-alpha and IL-1 production in response to LPS was increased in BMT recipients after Cy/TBI conditioning. Neutralization of IL-1 significantly reduced serum LPS levels and GVHD mortality, but it did not affect donor CTL activity. By contrast, neutralization of TNF-alpha did not prevent GVHD mortality but did impair CTL activity after BMT. When P815 leukemia cells were added to the bone marrow inoculum, allogeneic BMT recipients given the TNF-alpha inhibitor relapsed at a significantly faster rate than those given the IL-1 inhibitor. To confirm that the role of TNF-alpha in graft versus leukemia (GVL) was due to effects on donor T cells, cohorts of animals were transplanted with T cells from either wild-type mice or p55 TNF-alpha receptor-deficient mice. Recipients of TNF-alpha p55 receptor-deficient T cells demonstrated a significant impairment in donor CTL activity after BMT and an increased rate of leukemic relapse compared with recipients of wild-type T cells. These data highlight the importance of conditioning in GVHD pathophysiology, and demonstrate that TNF-alpha is critical to GVL mediated by donor T cells, whereas IL-1 is not.","['Hill, G R', 'Teshima, T', 'Gerbitz, A', 'Pan, L', 'Cooke, K R', 'Brinson, Y S', 'Crawford, J M', 'Ferrara, J L']","['Hill GR', 'Teshima T', 'Gerbitz A', 'Pan L', 'Cooke KR', 'Brinson YS', 'Crawford JM', 'Ferrara JL']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/genetics/immunology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/immunology', 'Cyclophosphamide/pharmacology', 'Digestive System/injuries', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/*immunology/prevention & control', 'Graft vs Host Reaction/drug effects/immunology', 'Interleukin-1/antagonists & inhibitors/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/genetics/immunology', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/antagonists & inhibitors/*immunology', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",PMC408528,1999/08/17 00:00,1999/08/17 00:01,['1999/08/17 00:00'],"['1999/08/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/17 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI6896 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1999 Aug;104(4):459-67. doi: 10.1172/JCI6896.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Growth of TaY cells depends on the presence of IL-2 and the cells harbor HTLV-I genomes. A severe cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed in many HHV-6B(OK)-infected TaY cells one week after infection. The release of virus from HHV-6B(OK)-infected TaY cells [TaY(OK)] was first detected after three days and increased rapidly for up to seven days after infection, as demonstrated by PCR. The titer of HHV-6B(OK) in the supernatant was comparable to the value of 10(3.5) TCID50/ml obtained with PHA-activated cord blood lymphocytes (CBL) that had been infected with HHV-6B(OK). The replication of the virus was shown to depend to a considerable extent on cell viability. Electron microscopy revealed many herpesvirus-type capsid- and enveloped-viruses in the nuclei and cytoplasm of degenerated cells in TaY(OK) cultures. The U1102 strain of HHV-6A and the Z29 strain of HHV-6B also infected TaY cells productively, as detected by PCR and an immunofluorescence test. These results suggest that the activation of CD4+ T lymphocytes with mitogens such as PHA or IL-2 and the expression of some cellular gene or the HTLV-I gene might be essential for efficient propagation of HHV-6B. TaY cells should play an important role in future investigations of cell-virus interactions and genetic variations or cell tropism of HHV-6 isolates since no cell line that shows propagation of both HHV-6A and HHV-6B has been reported to date.","['Zhou, C F', 'Abe, K', 'Wang, P', 'Ojima, T', 'Yamamoto, K']","['Zhou CF', 'Abe K', 'Wang P', 'Ojima T', 'Yamamoto K']","['Department of Virology, Medical Research Institute, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Australia,Microbiol Immunol,Microbiology and immunology,7703966,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte', 'Base Sequence', 'Cytopathogenic Effect, Viral', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA Probes', 'DNA, Viral/isolation & purification', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Genes, pX', 'Genetic Variation', 'Herpesvirus 6, Human/genetics/*growth & development/ultrastructure', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/pathology/*virology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes/virology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Virus Integration']",,1999/08/17 00:00,1999/08/17 00:01,['1999/08/17 00:00'],"['1999/08/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/17 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1348-0421.1999.tb02426.x [doi]'],ppublish,Microbiol Immunol. 1999;43(5):425-36. doi: 10.1111/j.1348-0421.1999.tb02426.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a majority of patients, antisense ICE suppressed both AML cell proliferation and CFU-AML although a stimulatory effect was sometimes evident. The proportion of AML patients with suppression obtained by antisense ICE was higher than with IL-1Ra, suggesting the involvement of additional ICE-dependent cytokine(s) in AML cell growth besides IL-1.

Although inhibition by IL-1Ra or antisense ICE on growth parameters of AML cells in vitro prevailed, indicating the importance of IL-1 activity in autonomous AML cell growth, stimulatory effects on the cells of some patients suggest that AML is a heterogenous disorder regarding IL-1 beta regulation.","['Stosic-Grujicic, S', 'Basara, N', 'Dinarello, C A']","['Stosic-Grujicic S', 'Basara N', 'Dinarello CA']","['Institute for Biological Research Sinisa Stankovic, Belgrade, Yugoslavia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Clin Lab Haematol,Clinical and laboratory haematology,7907061,"['0 (Antirheumatic Agents)', '0 (IL1RN protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin 1 Receptor Antagonist Protein)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Sialoglycoproteins)', 'EC 3.4.22.36 (Caspase 1)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antirheumatic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Caspase 1/metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin 1 Receptor Antagonist Protein', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/genetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Sialoglycoproteins/genetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/08/17 00:00,1999/08/17 00:01,['1999/08/17 00:00'],"['1999/08/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/17 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2257.1999.00221.x [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Lab Haematol. 1999 Jun;21(3):173-85. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2257.1999.00221.x.,,,['AI15614/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Mortality patterns by duration of employment in various job groups were examined for mesothelioma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, multiple myeloma, cell type specific leukaemia, and brain tumours. RESULTS: Mortality from mesothelioma was examined for the total cohort and for two maintenance groups with the greatest potential for exposure to asbestos. The insulator group had a standardised mortality ratio (SMR) of 3029, and a larger group consisting of insulators, carpenters, labourers, electricians, pipefitters, boiler-makers, and welders had an SMR of 411. The mortalities from mesothelioma increased with increasing duration of employment. Mortality was lower for those first employed after 1950. An analysis of all brain tumours for the total cohort and some job and unit subgroups resulted in an SMR of 178 for those employed on the units related to motor oil and 166 for those employed as laboratory workers. Mortality from brain tumours in both of these job groups was higher for those employed > or = 5 years in the group. An analysis of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma showed no consistent patterns among the various employment groups. Mortality from multiple myeloma was non-significantly increased among people employed on the crude (SMR = 155) and fluid catalytic cracking units (SMR = 198). Leukaemia mortality was not increased for the total cohort, and a cell type analysis of leukaemia mortality for the total cohort showed no significant increases for the major cell types. However, there were significant increases for acute unspecified leukaemia (SMR = 276) and leukaemia of unknown cell type (SMR = 231). CONCLUSIONS: Analyses of specific causes of death by duration of employment in various job and process units did not show any patterns which suggest that, other than for mesothelioma, any of these increases in mortalities were likely to have resulted from workplace exposures or from employment at one of the places included in the Texaco mortality study.","['Divine, B J', 'Hartman, C M', 'Wendt, J K']","['Divine BJ', 'Hartman CM', 'Wendt JK']","['Texaco, Houston, TX 77251, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Occup Environ Med,Occupational and environmental medicine,9422759,['0 (Petroleum)'],IM,"['Brain Neoplasms/etiology/mortality', 'Cause of Death', 'Chemical Industry/*statistics & numerical data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/etiology/mortality', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/etiology/mortality', 'Male', 'Mesothelioma/etiology/mortality', 'Multiple Myeloma/etiology/mortality', 'Neoplasms/etiology/*mortality', 'Occupational Diseases/etiology/*mortality', '*Petroleum', 'Research Personnel/statistics & numerical data', 'Texas/epidemiology']",PMC1757716,1999/08/17 00:00,1999/08/17 00:01,['1999/08/17 00:00'],"['1999/08/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/17 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/oem.56.3.174 [doi]'],ppublish,Occup Environ Med. 1999 Mar;56(3):174-80. doi: 10.1136/oem.56.3.174.,,,,,['Occup Environ Med. 2000 Feb;57(2):143-4.

Analysis of overall patterns of mortality among refining, research, and petrochemical workers.",167-73,"OBJECTIVE: To update information on the workers of the Texaco mortality study to determine if the patterns of mortality have changed with 16 additional years of follow up. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: All workers were employed for > or = 5 years at company refineries, petrochemical plants, and research laboratories from 1947-93. The cohort now consists of 28,480 employees with an average of > or = 20 years of follow up. RESULTS: The overall mortality, and most cause specific mortalities were lower than or similar to those for the general population of the United States. For white men (86% of the cohort), there were 8873 observed deaths and 11,181 expected resulting in a significantly lower standardised mortality ratio (SMR) of 79. There were significant deficits for all the leading causes of death in the United States including all cancers, cancer of the lung, stroke, heart disease, respiratory disease, and accidents. Slightly increased mortality was found for cancer of the pancreas, cancer of the brain and central nervous system, leukaemia, and cancer of other lymphatic tissue. For cancer of the bone, the SMR was 162 (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 86 to 278), and for benign and unspecified neoplasms, it was 152 (95% CI 109 to 206). Overall mortality patterns for non-white men and women were similar to those for white men. Mortality patterns for white men were also examined by duration of employment, time first employed, location, and by job and process unit. There were significantly increased SMRs for brain cancer for those people employed as laboratory workers and on units with motor oil and for cancer of other lymphatic tissue for people employed on the fluid catalytic cracking unit. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the updated study showed a favourable mortality experience for employees in the Texaco mortality study compared with the United States population. There were a few increases found consistently including, but not limited to, brain cancer and cancer of other lymphatic tissue.

These were referenced by location at diagnosis to small census areas of which there were 25,723 in the study area. Population counts, surface area and, hence, population density were available for all these small areas. Previous analyses have shown limited extra-Poisson variation (EPV) of case counts within small areas; this is most pronounced in areas of intermediate population density (150-499 persons/km2). In this study, the data set was examined in more detail for evidence that variations in incidence and EPV of CL are associated with population density. Incidence showed a curvilinear association with population density and was highest in areas which were somewhat more densely populated (500-750 persons/km2), where the incidence rate ratio relative to areas having > or = 1000 persons/km2 was 1.16 (95% confidence interval 1.07-1.26) and the P value for quadratic trend across eight strata of population density was 0.02. Incidence in these areas is uniformly elevated and showed no evidence of heterogeneity (i.e. EPV). Statistically significant evidence of EPV was evident amongst some of the areas previously classified as intermediate density areas (specifically, those with a density of 250-499 persons/km2, P < 0.001 for CL). These results were interpreted in terms of the current aetiological hypotheses for CL which propose that exposure to localised epidemics of one or more common infectious agent may contribute to the development of leukaemia. They suggest that such epidemics arise regularly in moderately densely populated areas and also sporadically in areas which are somewhat less densely populated. Although other interpretations are possible, these results may assist in the identification of characteristics which infectious agents must possess if direct or indirect causes of CL.","['Alexander, F E', 'Boyle, P', 'Carli, P M', 'Coebergh, J W', 'Ekbom, A', 'Levi, F', 'McKinney, P A', 'McWhirter, W', 'Michaelis, J', 'Peris-Bonet, R', 'Petridou, E', 'Pompe-Kirn, V', 'Plesko, I', 'Pukkala, E', 'Rahu, M', 'Stiller, C A', 'Storm, H', 'Terracini, B', 'Vatten, L', 'Wray, N']","['Alexander FE', 'Boyle P', 'Carli PM', 'Coebergh JW', 'Ekbom A', 'Levi F', 'McKinney PA', 'McWhirter W', 'Michaelis J', 'Peris-Bonet R', 'Petridou E', 'Pompe-Kirn V', 'Plesko I', 'Pukkala E', 'Rahu M', 'Stiller CA', 'Storm H', 'Terracini B', 'Vatten L', 'Wray N']","['Department of Public Health Sciences, University of Edinburgh, Medical School, U.K.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,,IM,"['Child', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/epidemiology', 'Europe/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', '*Population Density', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology', 'Small-Area Analysis']",,1999/08/17 00:00,1999/08/17 00:01,['1999/08/17 00:00'],"['1999/08/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/17 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/17 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0959804998003852 [pii]', '10.1016/s0959-8049(98)00385-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 1999 Mar;35(3):439-44. doi: 10.1016/s0959-8049(98)00385-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Telomerase plays a key role in the maintenance of chromosomal stability in tumours, but it still remains unknown whether anticancer agents can inhibit telomerase activity. In this study, we evaluated the effect of various anticancer agents (etoposide, cisplatin, irinotecan, mitomycin C and daunorubicin) on the telomerase activity of three human haematopoietic cancer cell lines (Daudi, K562 and U937). A decrease of telomerase activity was not observed in cells treated with IC50 doses of the drugs, except for irinotecan-treated Daudi cells and daunorubicin- and irinotecan-treated U937 cells. Propidium iodide staining disclosed that the cells with decreased telomerase activity were severely damaged. U937 cells exposed to 5 microM (IC90) etoposide showed three different stages of cell viability during treatment. Apoptotic cells with an intact plasma membrane still maintained high telomerase activity, while cells with plasma membrane damage lost telomerase activity. The mRNA of the telomerase catalytic subunit (hTERT) showed a decrease in expression along with the decline of telomerase activity. These results indicate that the concentrations of drugs resulting in cytostatic effects on cells do not affect telomerase activity.","['Akiyama, M', 'Horiguchi-Yamada, J', 'Saito, S', 'Hoshi, Y', 'Yamada, O', 'Mizoguchi, H', 'Yamada, H']","['Akiyama M', 'Horiguchi-Yamada J', 'Saito S', 'Hoshi Y', 'Yamada O', 'Mizoguchi H', 'Yamada H']","['Department of Paediatrics, Jikei University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (telomerase RNA)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*enzymology/pathology', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy/*enzymology/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', '*RNA', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Telomerase/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/08/17 00:00,1999/08/17 00:01,['1999/08/17 00:00'],"['1999/08/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/17 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/17 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0959804998003657 [pii]', '10.1016/s0959-8049(98)00365-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 1999 Feb;35(2):309-15. doi: 10.1016/s0959-8049(98)00365-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This distinction has a biological logic in the context of the selective pressures for clonal emergence in different developmental and cellular contexts and has a major impact on curability. Most childhood leukaemias and some other mesenchymal stem cell tumours are of fetal origin and can metastasize without corruption of restraints on cell proliferation or bypassing apoptosis. In marked contrast to most invasive or metastatic epithelial carcinomas in adults, these former cancers then retain sensitivity to therapeutic apoptosis. Moreover, their abbreviated and less complex evolutionary status is associated with less genetic diversity and instability, minimising opportunity for clonal selection for resistance. A minority of leukaemias in children and a higher fraction in adults do, however, have genetic alterations that bypass cell cycle controls and apoptosis imposition. These are the 'bad news' genotypes. The cellular and molecular diversity of acute leukaemia impacts also on aetiology. Paediatric acute leukaemias can be initiated prenatally by illegitimate recombination and fusion gene formation in fetal haemopoiesis. For acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in children, twin studies suggest that a secondary postnatal molecular event is also required. This may be promoted by an abnormal or delayed response to common infections. Even for a classic case of a cancer that is intrinsically curable by systematic chemotherapy i.e. childhood ALL, prevention may turn out to be the preferred option.","['Greaves, M']",['Greaves M'],"['LRF Centre for the Cell and Molecular Biology of Leukaemia, Chester Beatty Laboratories, London, U.K. m.greaves@icr.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,,IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Diseases in Twins', 'Female', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Twins, Monozygotic']",,1999/08/17 00:00,1999/08/17 00:01,['1999/08/17 00:00'],"['1999/08/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/17 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/17 00:00 [entrez]']","['S095980499800433X [pii]', '10.1016/s0959-8049(98)00433-x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 1999 Feb;35(2):173-85. doi: 10.1016/s0959-8049(98)00433-x.,,,,87,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have shown that the pathogen can be cultivated in vitro in permissive cells such as human promyelocytic HL-60 leukemia cells. The mechanism(s) of its infection and propagation in target cells, however, is not well understood, due in part to lack of a method capable of quantitatively determining the amount of the infectious agent. Although several assays currently exist for the HGE agent, they are mostly qualitative and have a number of limitations. In this report, size differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic rRNAs are utilized to quantitatively assay the HGE agent in HL-60 cells. By comparing the integrated intensity of agarose gel resolved HGE-specific rRNA in host cells, with identically prepared and analyzed rRNA isolated from known quantities of E. coli (JM 109), it is possible to calculate the E. coli-equivalence of the HGE agent present in HL-60 cells according to the equation: Y (E. coli, in viable cells x 10(8)) = -2.573 + 0.11X (% infection by the HGE agent in HL-60 cells).

This sequence contains a stem-loop structure (nucleotides 204-227) much like the 278-303 region. We describe the chemical and thermal stability of dimers containing the 204-227 stem-loop as well as kinetics and salt-dependence of dimer formation. Our results show that dimerization of MoMLV RNA can be nucleated at multiple sites and suggest that the 5' untranslated region may contain separately folding and dimerizing domains.","['Oroudjev, E M', 'Kang, P C', 'Kohlstaedt, L A']","['Oroudjev EM', 'Kang PC', 'Kohlstaedt LA']","['Department of Chemistry, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA 93106, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,"['0 (RNA, Viral)', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Dimerization', 'Drug Stability', 'Genome, Viral', 'Kinetics', 'Magnesium/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*chemistry/genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation/drug effects', 'RNA, Viral/*chemistry/drug effects/genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Temperature']",,1999/08/17 10:00,2000/10/03 11:01,['1999/08/17 10:00'],"['1999/08/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/03 11:01 [medline]', '1999/08/17 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/jmbi.1999.2984 [doi]', 'S0022-2836(99)92984-4 [pii]']",ppublish,J Mol Biol. 1999 Aug 20;291(3):603-13. doi: 10.1006/jmbi.1999.2984.,['Copyright 1999 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Many of the vertebrate Hox proteins bind DNA cooperatively with the Pbx1 homeodomain protein. The crystal structure of a human HoxB1-Pbx1-DNA ternary complex revealed that interactions between the two proteins are mediated by the HoxB1 hexapeptide, which inserts into a hydrophobic pocket in Pbx1. It was also found that the Pbx1 DNA-binding domain is larger than the canonical three-helix homeodomain, containing an additional alpha-helix that is joined to the C terminus of the homeodomain by a turn of 310helix. These extra C-terminal residues had previously been shown to augment the cooperative interaction of Pbx1 with Hox partners, as well as enhancing the DNA binding of monomeric Pbx1. In order to characterize the role of the fourth Pbx1 helix in greater detail, we have examined the backbone structure of the enlarged Pbx1 DNA-binding domain in solution by(1)H,(15)N and(13)C multidimensional NMR spectroscopy. Our results show that the additional alpha-helix of Pbx1 is unfolded when the protein is free in solution and that its folding is triggered by binding of Pbx1 to DNA. In contrast, no change in conformation is observed upon mixing the HoxB1 protein with Pbx1 in the absence of DNA. This study suggests a model for the assembly of a stable HoxB1-Pbx1-DNA ternary complex.","['Jabet, C', 'Gitti, R', 'Summers, M F', 'Wolberger, C']","['Jabet C', 'Gitti R', 'Summers MF', 'Wolberger C']","['Department of Biophysics and Biophysical Chemistry and Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, 21205, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (HOXB1 homeodomain protein)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Solutions)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'DNA/chemistry/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Solutions']",,1999/08/17 10:00,2000/10/03 11:01,['1999/08/17 10:00'],"['1999/08/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/03 11:01 [medline]', '1999/08/17 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/jmbi.1999.2983 [doi]', 'S0022-2836(99)92983-2 [pii]']",ppublish,J Mol Biol. 1999 Aug 20;291(3):521-30. doi: 10.1006/jmbi.1999.2983.,['Copyright 1999 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

M0/M1 leukemic cells are not sensitive to differentiating agents, whereas M3 leukemic cells are induced to undergo granulocytic differentiation after ATRA treatment but are not sensitive to VD. M2 leukemic blast cells behave differently because they undergo monocytic differentiation with both the differentiation inducers. To gain some insight into the maturation of M2-type leukemic cells, we studied the molecular mechanisms underlying monocytic differentiation induced by ATRA and VD in spontaneous M2 blast cells as well as in Kasumi-1 cells (an acute myeloid leukemia M2-type cell line). Our results indicate that ATRA as well as VD efficiently increases the nuclear abundance of VD receptor (VDR) and promotes monocytic differentiation. VDR is functionally active in ATRA-treated Kasumi-1 cells because it efficiently heterodimerizes with retinoid X receptor, binds to a DR3-type vitamin D-responsive element, and activates the transcription of a vitamin D-responsive element-regulated reporter gene. Consistent with these findings, VD-responsive genes are induced by ATRA treatment of Kasumi-1 cells, suggesting that the genetic program underlying monocytic differentiation is activated. The molecular mechanism by which ATRA increases the nuclear abundance of a functional VDR is still unknown, but our data clearly indicate that the M2 leukemic cell context is only permissive of monocytic differentiation.","['Manfredini, R', 'Trevisan, F', 'Grande, A', 'Tagliafico, E', 'Montanari, M', 'Lemoli, R', 'Visani, G', 'Tura, S', 'Ferrari, S', 'Ferrari, S']","['Manfredini R', 'Trevisan F', 'Grande A', 'Tagliafico E', 'Montanari M', 'Lemoli R', 'Visani G', 'Tura S', 'Ferrari S', 'Ferrari S']","['Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche, Sezione di Chimica Biologica, Universita di Modena e di Reggio Emilia, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Retinoid X Receptors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Dimerization', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Monocytes/*cytology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/drug effects', 'Protein Multimerization', 'Receptors, Calcitriol/genetics/*physiology', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Retinoid X Receptors', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/08/14 00:00,1999/08/14 00:01,['1999/08/14 00:00'],"['1999/08/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/14 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/14 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1999 Aug 1;59(15):3803-11.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it is not clear if hypermethylation is limited to single target genes or if multiple genes are simultaneously methylated. To understand the extent of aberrant de novo methylation, we have analyzed the methylation pattern of a number of tumor-related genes in leukemia from the same cohort of patients. We used bisulfite genomic sequencing to characterize the methylation pattern of the CpG islands associated with the calcitonin, estrogen receptor, E-cadherin, p15, p16, Rb, GST-Pi, and HIC1 genes in the bone marrow from 9 normal and 20 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). All of the normal control samples were essentially unmethylated for each of the eight tumor-related genes studied. In contrast, 19 of 20 (95%) of the AML patients had an abnormal methylation pattern in at least one gene, and 15 of 20 (75%) had abnormal methylation patterns in two or more of the target genes. We conclude that there is a general deregulation of CpG island methylation in leukemia and that hypermethylation is not limited to single genes, but a number of genes are methylated concurrently. Moreover, the subset of genes that are commonly methylated in leukemia appear to be cancer type specific.","['Melki, J R', 'Vincent, P C', 'Clark, S J']","['Melki JR', 'Vincent PC', 'Clark SJ']","['Kanematsu Laboratories, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Camperdown, New South Wales, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (CDKN2B protein, human)', '0 (Cadherins)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Hic1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '9007-12-9 (Calcitonin)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (GSTP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione S-Transferase pi)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cadherins/genetics', 'Calcitonin/genetics', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cohort Studies', '*CpG Islands', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15', '*Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/analysis', '*DNA Methylation', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Genes', 'Genes, Retinoblastoma', 'Genes, p16', 'Glutathione S-Transferase pi', 'Glutathione Transferase/genetics', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/genetics', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Receptors, Estrogen/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,1999/08/14 00:00,1999/08/14 00:01,['1999/08/14 00:00'],"['1999/08/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/14 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/14 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1999 Aug 1;59(15):3730-40.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To address the question of whether this endonuclease attack occurs randomly or nonrandomly along chromosomes, we first constructed chromosome fluorescence in situ hybridization probes from the 200- and 400-bp fragments from gamma-irradiated apoptotic human T cells along with similar-sized probes from randomly sheared DNA of nonirradiated cells. These probes were compared for their binding along normal human metaphase chromosomes after fluorescence in situ hybridization with and without the presence of unlabeled total human blocking DNA. The addition of blocking DNA to the apoptotic probes revealed a nonrandom pattern of hybridization that was not observed for the nonirradiated control probes. The most obvious areas of selective binding occurred around the centromeric and other heterochromatic regions along the chromosome arms, such as the long (q arm) of the Y chromosome. The converse of this experiment was also carried out. DNA probes from heterochromatic and euchromatic regions of the human Y chromosome were hybridized onto slot blots of apoptotic ladder-sized and randomly sheared nonirradiated human T-lymphocyte DNA. The slot blot results showed that for an equal mass of ladder-sized apoptotic DNA and randomly sheared nonirradiated control DNA, the apoptotic DNA sample contains a relatively larger proportion of Y heterochromatin DNA sequences (approximately 2.5-fold). Together, these results indicate that apoptosis-mediated endonuclease attack does not occur randomly in the genome but occurs preferentially in heterochromatin.","['Dullea, R G', 'Robinson, J F', 'Bedford, J S']","['Dullea RG', 'Robinson JF', 'Bedford JS']","['Department of Radiological Health Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins 80523-1673, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Heterochromatin)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endonucleases)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Apoptosis/*radiation effects', 'Centromere/radiation effects', 'Chromosomes, Human/*radiation effects/ultrastructure', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Fragmentation/*radiation effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*radiation effects', 'Endonucleases/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells/radiation effects', 'Heterochromatin/*radiation effects', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Jurkat Cells/pathology/radiation effects', 'Leukemia/*pathology/radiotherapy', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/pathology/radiation effects', 'Y Chromosome/radiation effects']",,1999/08/14 00:00,1999/08/14 00:01,['1999/08/14 00:00'],"['1999/08/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/14 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/14 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1999 Aug 1;59(15):3712-8.,,,"['CA09236/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA73926/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,['NASA'],['Non-programmatic'],

In a previous report (Sane, A. T., and Bertrand, R., Cancer Res., 58: 3066-3072, 1998), we showed that, after CPT treatment, caspase inhibition by the tripeptide derivative benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp(Ome)-fluoromethyl ketone (zVAD-fmk) blocked apoptosis and slowed passage of the cells through S-G2 and caused a transient accumulation of these cells at the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Accumulation of these cells at G1 is not associated with major changes in expression level of cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk)2, cdk4, and cdk6; cyclin D1 and cyclin E; or p16, p21, p27, and p57 after CPT treatment. Furthermore, cdk2, cdk4, and cdk6 kinase activities remain unaffected after CPT treatment. These results indicate that the G1 arrest of these cells does not correlate with a classical driven cell cycle checkpoint but with the known effect of CPT in mediating inhibition of DNA replication and RNA transcription after stabilization of topoisomerase I-linked DNA strand breaks. However, persistent caspase inhibition after CPT treatment also results in cells falling into necrosis after the transient G1 arrest. These results indicate that the enforced inhibition of caspase activities does not confer a survival advantage upon CPT-treated cells but is coupled with a shift from apoptosis to transient G1 arrest followed by massive necrosis.","['Sane, A T', 'Bertrand, R']","['Sane AT', 'Bertrand R']","['Research Centre of the University of Montreal, Notre-Dame Hospital, Montreal Cancer Institute, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Camptothecin/*pharmacology', '*Caspase Inhibitors', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'DNA Repair/drug effects', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/*drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'G1 Phase/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Necrosis', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Topoisomerase I Inhibitors', 'U937 Cells/*drug effects']",,1999/08/14 00:00,1999/08/14 00:01,['1999/08/14 00:00'],"['1999/08/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/14 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/14 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1999 Aug 1;59(15):3565-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The fusion protein DAFF2A was stably expressed in mouse NIH 3T3-based helper cells and independently identified with either alpha-DAF MAb or alpha-Env PAb on the cell membrane. Western blot analysis confirmed the expected molecular weight of the fusion protein. Viral titers obtained from NIH 3T3 helper cell pools were 5 x 10(5) CFU for wild-type amphotropic EnvA virus and 1 x 10(5) CFU for DAFF2A virus, respectively. By blocking the catalytic domain of DAF by pretreatment with alpha-DAF MAb DAFF2A, recombinant virions could be converted to wild-type with respect to sensitivity against human serum. Since the method for producing virions that are protected against human serum should be applicable to any cell type it offers a novel tool for human in vivo gene therapy.","['Spitzer, D', 'Hauser, H', 'Wirth, D']","['Spitzer D', 'Hauser H', 'Wirth D']","['Department of Gene Regulation and Differentiation, GBF-National Research Center for Biotechnology, Braunschweig, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (CD55 Antigens)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Antibodies/immunology', 'Blotting, Western', 'CD55 Antigens/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Complement System Proteins/*immunology/metabolism', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics/*immunology/physiology', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Mice', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/immunology']",,1999/08/14 00:00,1999/08/14 00:01,['1999/08/14 00:00'],"['1999/08/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/14 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/10430349950017572 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 1999 Jul 20;10(11):1893-902. doi: 10.1089/10430349950017572.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Promoter activities of various retroviral long terminal repeats (LTRs) were examined by using chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) as a reporter. The U3 region of spleen focus-forming virus (SFFVp) showed higher enhancer activity than that of Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MuLV) in both cell lines. The U3 region of myeloproliferative sarcoma virus (MPSV) showed higher activity only in GC-1 spg cells.

The efficiency of transduction of the multidrug-resistance gene (mdr-1) by an Mo-MuLV-based vector was compared with hybrid vectors consisting of the murine embryonic stem cell virus (MESV) PBS and the LTR of either SFFVp or MPSV. Rhodamine efflux assays and colchicine-resistant colony-forming assays demonstrated higher gene expression by the hybrid vectors. Amphotropic and ecotropic receptors were found to be expressed and functional in both cell lines.

The functional restoration provided by allogeneic beta-cell transplantation is limited by adverse effects of immunosuppression. To pursue an insulin replacement therapy based on autologous, engineered human non-beta cells, we generated a retroviral vector encoding a genetically modified human proinsulin, cleavable to insulin in non-beta cells, and a human nonfunctional cell surface marker. Here we report that this vector efficiently transduced primary human cells, inducing the synthesis of a modified proinsulin that was processed and released as mature insulin. This retrovirally derived insulin displayed in vitro biological activity, specifically binding to and phosphorylation of the insulin receptor, comparable to human insulin. In vivo, the transplantation of insulin-producing fibroblasts reverted hyperglycemia in a murine model of diabetes, whereas proinsulin-producing cells were ineffective.

Addition of DEP extract to an incubation mixture of mouse lung microsomes in the presence of NADPH resulted in a time-dependent NADPH oxidation and acetylated-cytochrome c reduction. Using purified P450 reductase as the enzyme source, superoxide radicals which were detected as the spin adduct (DMPO-OOH) while metabolized by P450 reductase were dependent upon both DEP and enzyme concentrations. The ELISA method using a specific monoclonal antibody revealed that DEP produced 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), which is formed from deoxyguanosine in DNA by hydroxyl radicals, in the culture medium of L1210 cells. Active oxygen scavengers such as superoxide dismutase and catalase effectively blocked the formation of 8-OHdG in culture medium, and deferoxamine, which inhibits hydroxyl radicals production by chelating iron, was also effective in inhibiting the DEP-produced 8-OHdG formation. These results indicate that DEP components produce 8-OHdG through the hydroxyl radical formation via superoxide by redox cycling of P450 reductase.","['Arimoto, T', 'Yoshikawa, T', 'Takano, H', 'Kohno, M']","['Arimoto T', 'Yoshikawa T', 'Takano H', 'Kohno M']","['First Department Internal Medicine, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Jpn J Pharmacol,Japanese journal of pharmacology,2983305R,"['0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Vehicle Emissions)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '3352-57-6 (Hydroxyl Radical)', '53-59-8 (NADP)', ""88847-89-6 (8-Hydroxy-2'-Deoxyguanosine)"", 'EC 1.6.- (NADH, NADPH Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.6.2.4 (NADPH-Ferrihemoprotein Reductase)', 'G9481N71RO (Deoxyguanosine)']",IM,"[""8-Hydroxy-2'-Deoxyguanosine"", 'Acetylation', 'Animals', 'Cytochrome c Group/metabolism', 'Deoxyguanosine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Hydroxyl Radical/metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Microsomes, Liver/metabolism', 'NADH, NADPH Oxidoreductases/*metabolism', 'NADP/metabolism', 'NADPH-Ferrihemoprotein Reductase', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Superoxides/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Vehicle Emissions']",,1999/08/14 00:00,1999/08/14 00:01,['1999/08/14 00:00'],"['1999/08/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/14 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1254/jjp.80.49 [doi]'],ppublish,Jpn J Pharmacol. 1999 May;80(1):49-54. doi: 10.1254/jjp.80.49.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Macrophages are a source of growth factors that can modulate angiogenesis. In this study, we analyzed the effect of oncostatin M (OSM) on angiogenesis, as it could be involved in the development of atherosclerosis. The effect of OSM was compared with those of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). On human dermal microvasculature endothelial cells (HMEC-1s), OSM (22.5 to 112.5 pmol/L) induced a dose-dependent increase in cell proliferation greater than that induced by the classic angiogenic factors vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF; 543 pmol/L) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF; 1.1 nmol/L). LIF (19 to 475 pmol/L) induced only a 30% increase in cell proliferation, and IL-6 had no effect. Furthermore, in a modified Boyden-chamber model, OSM, LIF, and IL-6 were chemoattractant for HMEC-1s. In a tridimensional gel of fibrin, OSM increased tube formation and tube length, which were already noticeable by day 3. LIF and IL-6 induced a weaker effect that was only obvious by day 10. The angiogenic effect of OSM was also demonstrated in vivo in a rabbit corneal model: OSM was more potent than LIF, the length of the neovessels being longer with OSM than with LIF, whereas IL-6 was without effect. We tested factors that could be involved in the proliferative effect of OSM on HMEC-1s. OSM induced only a slight increase in the urokinase receptor and a 60% increase in VEGF secretion, whereas it does not modify IL-8 secretion or bFGF levels. The effect of OSM seems to depend on endothelial cell origin and cell species: OSM (up to 112.5 pmol/L) did not induce human umbilical vein endothelial cell proliferation and even had a small inhibitory effect (17%) on calf pulmonary artery endothelial cells. In conclusion, OSM induces an angiogenic effect on capillary endothelial cells, which could be, at least in part, implicated in pathological processes such as atherosclerosis or tumor growth.","['Vasse, M', 'Pourtau, J', 'Trochon, V', 'Muraine, M', 'Vannier, J P', 'Lu, H', 'Soria, J', 'Soria, C']","['Vasse M', 'Pourtau J', 'Trochon V', 'Muraine M', 'Vannier JP', 'Lu H', 'Soria J', 'Soria C']","['Laboratoire DIFEMA, UFR de Medecine et Pharmacie de Rouen, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol,"Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",9505803,"['0 (Chemotactic Factors)', '0 (Endothelial Growth Factors)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (PLAUR protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Urokinase Plasminogen Activator)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Plasminogen Activators)']",IM,"['Capillaries/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Division', 'Chemotactic Factors/physiology', 'Endothelial Growth Factors/biosynthesis', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology/metabolism', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/biosynthesis', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-8/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/biosynthesis/pharmacology', 'Microcirculation/cytology', 'Neovascularization, Physiologic/*drug effects', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/*pharmacology', 'Plasminogen Activators/physiology', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/physiology', 'Receptors, Urokinase Plasminogen Activator', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors']",,1999/08/14 00:00,1999/08/14 00:01,['1999/08/14 00:00'],"['1999/08/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/14 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1161/01.atv.19.8.1835 [doi]'],ppublish,Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol. 1999 Aug;19(8):1835-42. doi: 10.1161/01.atv.19.8.1835.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Young age and enrollment in the intermediate-risk study were associated with higher rates of catheter use. During each of the first four phases of therapy, the adjusted risk of infection was two- to fourfold higher when a catheter was in place. The proportion of patients with infection during the first four phases of therapy was 2.6 times higher with a CVC (14.4% versus 5.7%). Catheter use was associated with significantly increased hospitalization rates during induction, consolidation, and interim maintenance, but not during delayed intensification.

Such exposures are likely to be mutagenic. This in turn suggests that a level of in vivo genotoxic exposure that usually has minimal pathological consequences might become leukaemogenic when damaged cells fail to abort by apoptosis. If this were to be the case, then the cell type that becomes leukaemic and the chromosomal/molecular changes that occur would also be of considerable interest. We tested this possibility by exposing E mu-BCL-2 and wild-type mice of differing ages to a single dose of X-irradiation of 1-4 Gy. Young (approximately 4-6 weeks) transgenic mice developed leukaemia at a high rate following exposure to 2 Gy but adult mice (4-6 months) did not.

The KRML (MAFB) transcriptional regulator plays a pivotal role in regulating lineage-specific hematopoiesis by repressing ETS1-mediated transcription of erythroid-specific genes in myeloid cells. In previous studies, we mapped the human KRML gene within a genomic contig on human chromosome 20, bands q11.2-q13.1. We have isolated the human cDNA containing the full-length predicted open reading frame (ORF). Multiple KRML transcripts of approximately 1.8 and approximately 3 kb, which differ in the length of the 3' untranslated region, are ubiquitously expressed in hematopoietic tissues and encode a protein with 323 amino acids (MW 35,832). The protein has 84% identity and 92% similarity to the murine protein. The ORF of the human KRML gene contains no introns, and the gene spans approximately 3 kb. KRML maps within the smallest commonly deleted segment in malignant myeloid disorders characterized by a deletion of 20q; however, we detected no mutations of KRML in leukemia cells with loss of 20q.

A fundamental unanswered question is whether these differences relate to discrete stages or are part of a continuous process. We have sought to define aspects of the haematological ageing process, and have found that results from children with bone marrow failure syndromes differ from age-matched reference values. Haemopoietic cells were obtained from umbilical cord blood, from blood and bone marrow of healthy individuals and from the blood of young patients with bone marrow failure syndromes. Clonogenic myeloid progenitors (CFU-GM) were grown in semi-solid medium to measure their frequency; the proliferative capacity of myeloid progenitors was measured by replating colonies and observing secondary colony formation. We found that the frequency of CFU-GM in normal marrow increased and their proliferative capacity decreased exponentially with age. The proliferative capacity of CFU-GM in normal blood also decreased exponentially with age. This relationship extrapolated back to the levels of proliferation measured for cord blood CFU-GM (age = 0). The proliferative capacities of CFU-GM from children with bone marrow failure syndromes were severely reduced compared with age-matched reference values. These results indicate that a decline in haemopoietic progenitor cell function begins at birth and continues throughout life. This decline may occur prematurely in childhood marrow failure syndromes with a predisposition to leukaemia.","['Marley, S B', 'Lewis, J L', 'Davidson, R J', 'Roberts, I A', 'Dokal, I', 'Goldman, J M', 'Gordon, M Y']","['Marley SB', 'Lewis JL', 'Davidson RJ', 'Roberts IA', 'Dokal I', 'Goldman JM', 'Gordon MY']","['LRF Centre for Adult Leukaemia and Department of Haematology, Imperial College School of Medicine at Hammersmith Hospital, London.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aging/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/*pathology', 'Cell Division', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Middle Aged']",,1999/08/12 00:00,1999/08/12 00:01,['1999/08/12 00:00'],"['1999/08/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/12 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/12 00:00 [entrez]']","['bjh1477 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.1999.01477.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1999 Jul;106(1):162-6. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1999.01477.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The production of haemopoiesis inhibitor by patient cells and the influence of high concentrations of stem cell factor (SCF) and Flt3-ligand (FL) on cell survival and ex vivo expansion potential were also studied. Before expansion, patient CD34+ cells showed viability and cell-cycle phase distribution similar to normal but lower percentages of CD34+DR- or CD34+CD38- cells and lower progenitor content. After 48 h of culture +/-30% of patient cells had died regardless of the cytokine combination used, whereas only 15% of normal cells died.

Co-culture of patient and normal cells did not show any evidence for haemopoiesis inhibitor production by patient cells.

Finally, dexamethasone did not inhibit the anti-proliferative effect of retinoic acid but rather showed anti-proliferative activity itself.","['de Ridder, M C', 'van der Plas, A J', 'Erpelinck-Verschueren, C A', 'Lowenberg, B', 'Jansen, J H']","['de Ridder MC', 'van der Plas AJ', 'Erpelinck-Verschueren CA', 'Lowenberg B', 'Jansen JH']","['Institute of Haematology, Erasmus University of Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. deridder@hema.fgg.eur.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '0 (CD18 Antigens)', '0 (Thrombomodulin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/*therapeutic use', 'Blotting, Northern', 'CD18 Antigens/metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Dexamethasone/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Thrombomodulin/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/08/12 00:00,1999/08/12 00:01,['1999/08/12 00:00'],"['1999/08/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/12 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/12 00:00 [entrez]']","['bjh1481 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.1999.01481.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1999 Jul;106(1):107-10. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1999.01481.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two pairs of leukaemic cell lines, each consisting of the parental non-multidrug resistance (MDR) line and of a MDR variant, were studied for cytotoxicity (MTT test) and for cellular DNR kinetic and accumulation (flow cytometry). DNX and free DNR were equally toxic against non-MDR cells, whereas the liposomal anthracycline was more toxic than the free drug against the MDR variant. Non-MDR cells accumulated DNR more rapidly when they were exposed to free DNR than to DNX, but MDR cells accumulated more DNR when they were exposed to DNX. The kinetics of DNX and free DNR were also studied in the blast cells of 41 cases of acute leukaemia and they were found to be related to blast cell PGP expression. In 15 cases with a low PGP expression intracellular DNR accumulation was faster and higher with free DNR than with DNX. In 26 cases with a high PGP expression the area under the curve was similar with DNX and free DNR, but the kinetics of intracellular DNR accumulation showed an early low plateau with free DNR and a slow and continuous increase with DNX. In MDR cell lines the ratio was more favourable to DNX than to free DNR.

We have previously shown the K562/IDA subline resulting from intermittent treatment of the K562 human leukaemia cell line with 20 ng/ml idarubicin did not develop multidrug resistance but became more sensitive to etoposide. Additional similar treatments of this subline produced the K562/IDA20 subline which partially retained its etoposide sensitivity although these cells expressed P-glycoprotein and were resistant to paclitaxel. Sensitization to etoposide was associated with increased decatenation activity of topoisomerase II, although there were no changes in topoisomerase IIalpha expression or formation of etoposide-dependent cleavable complexes. In comparison, the K562/IDA10 subline produced by intermittent treatment of the K562 cells, firstly with 5 ng/ml then 10 ng/ml idarubicin, showed no detectable expression of P-glycoprotein, decreased topoisomerase IIalpha expression and increased resistance to etoposide and amsacrine, but not to idarubicin or genistein. Even though intermittent treatment with idarubicin caused increased drug resistance in both sublines, they remained sensitive to idarubicin. Therefore the potential of idarubicin as a substitute for other anthracyclines in the treatment of cancer warrants further investigation.","['Locke, V L', 'Davey, R A', 'Davey, M W']","['Locke VL', 'Davey RA', 'Davey MW']","['Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, University of Technology, Sydney, Gore Hill, NSW, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Blotting, Western', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/*therapeutic use', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/enzymology']",,1999/08/12 00:00,1999/08/12 00:01,['1999/08/12 00:00'],"['1999/08/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/12 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/12 00:00 [entrez]']","['bjh1494 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.1999.01494.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1999 Jul;106(1):86-91. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1999.01494.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The resistant lines displayed a high degree of cross resistance to all deoxynucleoside analogues, with little or no cross resistance to other agents. There was a profound accumulation defect of all nucleoside analogues in the resistant variants but no significant defect in nucleoside transport in any of the variants. 5' nucleotidase activity was strongly increased and deoxycytidine kinase activity was moderately reduced in all of the resistant variants, resulting in reduced accumulation of triphosphate analogues. In addition a deletion in one of the alleles of the deoxycytidine kinase was detected in the fludarabine-resistant line. Ribonucleotide reductase activity was found to be strongly increased in the gemcitabine-selected line and purine nucleoside phosphorylase was increased in the 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine-selected line. Free nucleotide pools were increased in the 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine-selected line. There was no expression of the mdr1 gene by the resistant lines.

However, cost and occasional adverse side-effects necessitate careful use. Identifying before treatment patients not likely to benefit from fludarabine could advance disease management both clinically and financially. We used the DiSC (differential staining cytotoxicity) assay, an ex vivo apoptotic drug response test, to identify the sensitivity or resistance to fludarabine of lymphocytes from B-cell CLL patients and compared the results with subsequent patient treatment, response and survival. Patients were grouped thus: those receiving fludarabine within 1 year of assay (+/- other cytotoxic drugs), and those receiving other chemotherapy (excluding fludarabine) within 1 year of assay. Fludarabine-test-resistance was found in 12/100 (12%) of untreated patients and 45/143 (31%) of previously treated patients (17/32 (53%) of patients previously treated with fludarabine). Treating fludarabine-test-resistant patients with fludarabine resulted in poor response compared with fludarabine-test-sensitive patients (7% v 69%) and short survival (median 7.9 v 41.7 months; relative risk (RR) = 14.8; P < 0.0001). 81% of fludarabine-test-resistant patients were test sensitive to other regimens. If treated with chemotherapy other than fludarabine, test-resistant patients responded better and survived substantially longer than those treated with fludarabine (RR = 2.9; P = 0.001). Not all CLL patients should receive fludarabine. Fludarabine-test-resistance by DiSC assay is a powerful independent prognostic factor. Pretreatment DiSC assay results could enable the toxic, clinical and financial costs of fludarabine treatment to be avoided in fludarabine-test-resistant patients. Disease management, response, survival and use of financial resources might be significantly improved if therapy choice in CLL patients was guided by DiSC assay.","['Bosanquet, A G', 'Johnson, S A', 'Richards, S M']","['Bosanquet AG', 'Johnson SA', 'Richards SM']","['Bath Cancer Research Unit, School of Postgraduate Medicine, University of Bath, Royal United Hospital, Bath. a.g.bosanquet@bath.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cause of Death', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate', 'Therapeutics', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",,1999/08/12 00:00,1999/08/12 00:01,['1999/08/12 00:00'],"['1999/08/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/12 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/12 00:00 [entrez]']","['bjh1516 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.1999.01516.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1999 Jul;106(1):71-7. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1999.01516.x.,,,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,

Immunohistochemical studies on paraffin-embedded tissue specimens demonstrated that 3G12 reacted with most CD30-positive ALCL cases and some T-cell lymphomas and some Hodgkin's lymphomas, but not with B-cell lymphomas or non-haematogeneic tumours. The immunoprecipitation study with 3G12 demonstrated a major band of 200 kD and a minor band of 100 kD, which were different from CD30. Thus 3G12 defines a novel antigen that shares a similarity to CD30 in terms of distribution among haemopoietic cells.

The authors have reported previously that the cupric nitrilotriacetate (Cu-NTA), a renal carcinogen, induces oxidative DNA damage and apoptosis in HL-60 human leukemia cells (Ma, Y., et al. Free Radic. Biol Med. 25:568-575; 1998). The focus of this investigation was to examine the possible pathway of the apoptosis induced by Cu-NTA. Results of the present study demonstrated that after exposure of HL-60 cells to Cu-NTA, an increase in lipid hydroperoxide and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (deltaphim) were observed, followed by the increase in cytosolic cytochrome c that was released from the mitochondria. These events proceeded and triggered the activation of caspase-3 (CPP32/apopain/Yama), resulting in the degradation of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase and DNA fragmentation. The antioxidants, N-acetylcysteine and glutathione, protected the loss of deltaphim and blocked the apoptosis induced by Cu-NTA.

Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a neuroimmune pleiotropic cytokine, was measured to assess its role in hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid function. Mean circulating serum LIF levels in 10 hypothyroid patients [TSH, 23+/-0.5 mIU/L (mean+/-SEM); free T4, 0.77+/-0.1 ng/dL] was 0.29+/-0.04 ng/mL, 145% higher (P < 0.04) than in 20 normal subjects (LIF, 0.20+/-0.02 ng/mL; TSH, 2.23+/-0.21 mIU/L; free T4, 1.23+/-0.04 ng/dL) but was not different from those in 10 hyperthyroid patients (LIF, 0.21+/-0.03 ng/mL; TSH, 0.01+/-0.00 mIU/L; free T4, 3.63+/-0.51 ng/dL). Serum LIF concentrations linearly correlated with serum TSH in the 40 samples (r = 0.58, P < 0.001). When T4 (1-8 microg/kg x day) was administered to cynomolgus monkeys with methimazole-induced hypothyroidism, serum T4 and T3 levels increased appropriately, and TSH and LIF concentrations decreased. When methimazole was given alone, both serum TSH (146+/-30 mIU/L) and LIF (8.84+/-0.49 ng/mL) were markedly induced. When methimazole together with T4 (>2 microg/kg x day) was administered, both serum TSH (7.5+/-1.2 mIU/L) and LIF (6.22+/-0.31 ng/mL) were lowered (P < 0.01). Monkey serum LIF levels and log TSH levels also correlated (r = 0.72, P < 0.01). Cultured thyroid carcinoma cells produced LIF (9.2 ng/10(6) cells/48 h). TSH (100 mIU/mL) and interleukin (IL)-6 (10 nmol/L) stimulated in vitro LIF secretion from the cells by 170+/-12% (P < 0.05) and 261+/-8% (P < 0.05), respectively. Dexamethasone (1 micromol/L) inhibited basal LIF concentration by 83% (P < 0.05), whereas TSH and IL-6 stimulated LIF by 52% (P = 0.04) and 42% (P = 0.03), respectively. However, using Northern blot analysis, we could not observe induction of LIF mRNA by TSH, suggesting that LIF regulation by TSH may be due to stimulation of secretion. The results show that the thyroid gland is a source of LIF production; TSH, IL-6, and glucocorticoid influence thyroid cell LIF expression. The correlation between TSH and LIF suggests that LIF may participate in the physiologic regulation of hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid function.","['Ren, S G', 'Seliktar, J', 'Li, X', 'Hershman, J M', 'Braunstein, G D', 'Melmed, S']","['Ren SG', 'Seliktar J', 'Li X', 'Hershman JM', 'Braunstein GD', 'Melmed S']","['Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Research Institute, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, California 90048, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,0375362,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '9002-71-5 (Thyrotropin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/*biosynthesis/blood', 'Humans', 'Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System/physiology', 'Hypothyroidism/*diagnosis', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*biosynthesis/blood', 'Macaca fascicularis', 'Male', 'Thyroid Gland/*metabolism', 'Thyrotropin/blood']",,1999/08/12 00:00,1999/08/12 00:01,['1999/08/12 00:00'],"['1999/08/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/12 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/12 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/jcem.84.8.5918 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 1999 Aug;84(8):2883-7. doi: 10.1210/jcem.84.8.5918.,,,['DK-42792/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study is to review patients during a 30-year period with these tumours and assess clinical aspects to improve management. METHODS: The records of 68 patients from 1967 to 1996 were reviewed with respect to age at diagnosis, affected sites, presentation, clinical diagnosis, operation, pathology and prognosis. RESULTS: The most common presentation was a painless scrotal mass (84%). The most common testicular tumour was mature teratoma (n = 27) followed by yolk sac tumour (n = 17). Thirteen patients had paratesticular rhabdomyosarcoma. Two teratocarcinomas, three leydig cell tumours, two sertoli cell tumours, one granulosa cell tumour, one fibroma, one gonadoblastoma, and one secondary tumour from acute myeloid leukaemia were found also. Testis-sparing surgery was performed in 21 of 33 patients with benign tumours (27 teratoma, three leydig cell tumours, two sertoli cell tumours, one fibroma), which caused no recurrence.

The authors performed a retrospective study to determine the prevalence and types of ocular abnormalities in a pediatric population following BMT. DESIGN: Retrospective noncomparative study. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and four consecutive pediatric patients with aplastic anemia and various hematologic malignancies who required BMT. INTERVENTION: Bone marrow transplantation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Visual acuity and slit-lamp biomicroscopic and funduscopic examinations. RESULTS: Ocular changes developed in 51% of patients. The most frequent findings included dry eye syndrome (12.5%), cataract (23.0%), and posterior segment complications (13.5%). A final visual acuity of 20/40 or better was achieved in 95.7% of eyes. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric patients can develop severe and potentially vision-threatening complications following BMT. Despite the high incidence of anterior and posterior segment abnormalities, ocular symptoms were generally mild and the majority of patients retained excellent visual function. Factors associated with ocular complications included the underlying disease, total body irradiation, systemic chemotherapy, graft-versus-host disease, and immunosuppression. Familiarity with these risk factors and potential complications in pediatric patients is important for successful treatment.","['Suh, D W', 'Ruttum, M S', 'Stuckenschneider, B J', 'Mieler, W F', 'Kivlin, J D']","['Suh DW', 'Ruttum MS', 'Stuckenschneider BJ', 'Mieler WF', 'Kivlin JD']","['The Eye Institute, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee 53226-4812, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Ophthalmology,Ophthalmology,7802443,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Eye Diseases/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Female', 'Fluorescein Angiography', 'Hematologic Diseases/therapy', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Male', 'Prevalence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Visual Acuity']",,1999/08/12 00:00,1999/08/12 00:01,['1999/08/12 00:00'],"['1999/08/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/12 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/12 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0161-6420(99)90454-2 [pii]', '10.1016/S0161-6420(99)90454-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Ophthalmology. 1999 Aug;106(8):1564-70. doi: 10.1016/S0161-6420(99)90454-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this review we focus upon abnormalities in red blood cell production and discuss how alterations in cytokine regulation of red blood cell production may contribute to these disease processes. We discuss clinical states in which blood red cell numbers are altered, including primary familial and congenital polycythaemia, the myeloproliferative disorder polycythaemia vera, erythroleukaemia, and Diamond-Blackfan anaemia.

By indirect immunofluorescence and dual labeling with marker proteins, we demonstrate that p13II, an 87-amino acid protein coded by the x-II ORF, is selectively targeted to mitochondria. Mutational analysis revealed that mitochondrial targeting of p13II is directed by an atypical 10-amino acid signal sequence that is not cleaved upon import and is able to target the Green Fluorescent Protein to mitochondria. Expression of p13II results in specific alterations of mitochondrial morphology and distribution from a typical string-like, dispersed network to round-shaped clusters, suggesting that p13II might interfere with processes relying on an intact mitochondrial architecture. Functional studies of mitochondria with the cationic fluorochrome tetramethylrhodamine revealed that a subpopulation of the cells with p13II-positive mitochondria show a disruption in the mitochondrial inner membrane potential (Apsi), an early event observed in cells committed to apoptosis. Taken together, these results suggest novel virus-cell interactions that might be important in HTLV-I replication and/or pathogenicity.","['Ciminale, V', 'Zotti, L', ""D'Agostino, D M"", 'Ferro, T', 'Casareto, L', 'Franchini, G', 'Bernardi, P', 'Chieco-Bianchi, L']","['Ciminale V', 'Zotti L', ""D'Agostino DM"", 'Ferro T', 'Casareto L', 'Franchini G', 'Bernardi P', 'Chieco-Bianchi L']","['Department of Oncology and Surgical Sciences, University of Padova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (rof protein, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1)']",IM,"['*Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', '*Genes, pX', 'Genome, Viral', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Open Reading Frames', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Retroviridae Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Transfection']",,1999/08/12 00:00,1999/08/12 00:01,['1999/08/12 00:00'],"['1999/08/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/12 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/12 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1203047 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1999 Aug 5;18(31):4505-14. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1203047.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our studies and those of others indicate that Bcr sequences within the Bcr-Abl oncoprotein are critically involved in activating the Abl tyrosine kinase and actively participate in the oncogenic response, which is generated by the Bcr-Abl oncoprotein. We investigated the role of the Bcr protein in the oncogenic effects of Bcr-Abl. Reduction of the level of the Bcr protein by incubating cells with a 3' BCR anti-sense oligodeoxynucleotide increased the growth rate and survival of hematopoietic cell lines expressing Bcr-Abl. Also, enforced expression of Bcr in Bcr-Abl cell lines strongly reduced transformation efficiency. Induction of Bcr expression drastically reduced the phosphotyrosine content of Bcr-Abl in Rat-1 fibroblasts transformed by P185 BCR-ABL and in hematopoietic cells expressing P210 Bcr-Abl within days following induction of Bcr. Rat-1/P185 cells maintained for three weeks after Bcr induction had dramatically reduced amounts of phosphotyrosine proteins compared to cells in which Bcr expression was repressed by the addition of Tet. In contrast Bcr expression did not decrease the phosphotyrosine content of either v-Src or activated Neu tyrosine kinase. Importantly, the phosphotyrosine content of total P160 BCR (induced plus endogenous) was strongly reduced by inducing expression of Bcr, indicating that the induced Bcr protein was not a target of the tyrosine kinase activity of Bcr-Abl but instead functioned as an inhibitor of Bcr-Abl. These results show that the Bcr protein can function as a negative regulator of Bcr-Abl, but that the inhibitory effects of Bcr are dependent on achieving an elevated level of Bcr expression relative to Bcr-Abl.","['Wu, Y', 'Ma, G', 'Lu, D', 'Lin, F', 'Xu, H J', 'Liu, J', 'Arlinghaus, R B']","['Wu Y', 'Ma G', 'Lu D', 'Lin F', 'Xu HJ', 'Liu J', 'Arlinghaus RB']","['Department of Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (tetracycline resistance-encoding transposon repressor protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transfection']",,1999/08/12 00:00,1999/08/12 00:01,['1999/08/12 00:00'],"['1999/08/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/12 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/12 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1202828 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1999 Aug 5;18(31):4416-24. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1202828.,,,"['CA16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA49639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA65611/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

This review was performed to (1) determine which children are affected, (2) identify predisposing factors, and (3) assess efficacy of treatment. METHODS: A 10-year (1988 to 1997) review identified 33 children who had 38 episodes of neutropenic enteropathy. Each presented with fever, abdominal pain, and chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. All were treated with fluid resuscitation, bowel rest, and broad-spectrum antibiotics. Surgical intervention was reserved for children with bowel perforation. RESULTS: Neutropenic enteropathy occurred in 24 children with hematologic malignancies and nine with solid tumors. This disease developed in three children after bone marrow transplantation for leukemia. All five patients in whom recurrent episodes developed were receiving chemotherapy for Burkitt's lymphoma. Cytosine arabinoside and VP16 were the most commonly implicated chemotherapeutic agents. Four children required laparotomy and right hemicolectomy, and all survived. Overall survival was 94%. CONCLUSIONS: Although previously described in children receiving chemotherapy for hematologic malignancies, neutropenic enteropathy also occurs in children who have solid tumors and after bone marrow transplantation. The use of cytosine arabinoside and VP16 may predispose patients to this disease. Children receiving chemotherapy for Burkitt's lymphoma are at increased risk for recurrent episodes. Excellent survival rate was attained with supportive care being used as the primary treatment modality.","['Baerg, J', 'Murphy, J J', 'Anderson, R', 'Magee, J F']","['Baerg J', 'Murphy JJ', 'Anderson R', 'Magee JF']","[""B.C.

The present study was designed to investigate whether gp130-mediated signaling is involved in this activation, and if so, which interleukin (IL)-6 family cytokine is involved. Pressure overload was produced by ligation of the abdominal aorta of Wistar rats or ICR mice. IP-Western blot was performed to detect tyrosine phosphorylation of STATs, gp130, and the association of gp130 with JAK kinases. The serum concentration of IL-6 was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Expression of IL-6, IL-11, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), oncostatin M (OSM), and cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1) mRNA was quantitated. After pressure overload, rapid phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 was observed at 5 min, STAT1 was rephosphorylated at 60 min, and intense phosphorylation of STAT3 was observed at 60 min. Both the phosphorylation of gp130 and the association of gp130 with JAK1 and JAK2 were increased after pressure overload. IL-6 was significantly increased by two-fold in the pressure-overloaded rats. Only CT-1 mRNA expression could be detected by Northern blot, and it increased after pressure overload. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction revealed that IL-6 mRNA expression was increased 9.5-fold. IL-11, LIF, CNTF, and OSM expression were unaffected by pressure overload. These results suggested that gp130-mediated signaling was involved in the pressure overload-induced activation of the JAK/STAT pathway, and that IL-6 and CT-1 might be involved in this activation.","['Pan, J', 'Fukuda, K', 'Kodama, H', 'Sano, M', 'Takahashi, T', 'Makino, S', 'Kato, T', 'Manabe, T', 'Hori, S', 'Ogawa, S']","['Pan J', 'Fukuda K', 'Kodama H', 'Sano M', 'Takahashi T', 'Makino S', 'Kato T', 'Manabe T', 'Hori S', 'Ogawa S']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Keio University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Heart Vessels,Heart and vessels,8511258,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'AJ7U77BR8I (cardiotrophin 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cardiomegaly/*physiopathology', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Interleukin-6/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Myocardium/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precipitin Tests', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",,1999/08/12 00:00,1999/08/12 00:01,['1999/08/12 00:00'],"['1999/08/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/12 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/12 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01745045 [doi]'],ppublish,Heart Vessels. 1998;13(4):199-208. doi: 10.1007/BF01745045.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The value of using a cisplatin-based dose dense approach in the salvage setting has not been documented and in addition the role of methotrexate remains uncertain. This paper reviews results from our investigations of these issues. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1987 and 1996, 65 patients with relapsing or refractory germ-cell tumour received weekly m-BOP (methotrexate, bleomycin, vincristine and cisplatin) as salvage therapy. Residual masses were excised if possible and patients progressing after this received cisplatin and ifosfamide based chemotheraphy with or without high dose chemotherapy (HDCT) consolidation. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 33 months, 34% are progression free following m-BOP, 11% who had surgery for residual masses which showed viable cancers are progression free. A further 15% who progressed following m-BOP with or without surgery were rendered progression free by third-line therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The use of m-BOP as second line therapy with deferment of cisplatin and ifosfamide based treatment to third line therapy with consolidation of third line responses with HDCT, leads to an overall progression-free survival of 60%. It does not appear that M-BOP prejudiced the response to third line therapy suggesting a lack of cross resistance. The potentially lower risk of leukaemia and infertility from m-BOP requires further evaluation.","['Shamash, J', 'Oliver, R T', 'Ong, J', 'Raja, M', 'Edmonds, P', 'Gallagher, C J', 'Ostrowski, M J', 'LeVay, J', 'Williams, M']","['Shamash J', 'Oliver RT', 'Ong J', 'Raja M', 'Edmonds P', 'Gallagher CJ', 'Ostrowski MJ', 'LeVay J', 'Williams M']","[""School of Medicine and Dentistry, St. Bartholomew's Hospital, Queen Mary and Westfield College, Smithfield, London, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,"['11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'UM20QQM95Y (Ifosfamide)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'm-BOP protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bleomycin/administration & dosage', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Disease Progression', 'Germinoma/*drug therapy/surgery', 'Humans', 'Ifosfamide/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', '*Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",,1999/08/12 00:00,1999/08/12 00:01,['1999/08/12 00:00'],"['1999/08/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/12 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/12 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1023/a:1008318612005 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(19)57230-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 1999 Jun;10(6):685-92. doi: 10.1023/a:1008318612005.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Description of two cases and review of the literature.,649-53,"T-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (T-CLL) has recently been reclassified under the heading of T-cell prolymphocytic leukaemia (T-PLL) because of its unfavourable clinical course, independently of the morphologic features. This rare neoplasm usually shows CD4+/CD8- phenotype. Herein we report on two cases of T-PLL with CD8 expression that correspond to a possible variant of the disease first proposed by Hui et al. in 1987. These cases presented with malignant cells showing immunophenotypic features that can be easily identified and distinguished from other peripheral T-cell leukemias. However, the total number of cases studied is inadequate for defining a discrete clinico-pathologic entity with characteristic clinical features and cytogenetical abnormalities. An international collaboration in which tissue from similar cases is referred to a central pathologist for immunophenotyping and cytogenetical study, and clinical data are centrally compiled, may assist in defining this rare malady as a discrete clinico-pathologic entity.","['Ascani, S', 'Leoni, P', 'Fraternali Orcioni, G', 'Bearzi, I', 'Piccioli, M', 'Materazzi, M', 'Zinzani, P L', 'Gherlinzoni, F', 'Falini, B', 'Pileri, S A']","['Ascani S', 'Leoni P', 'Fraternali Orcioni G', 'Bearzi I', 'Piccioli M', 'Materazzi M', 'Zinzani PL', 'Gherlinzoni F', 'Falini B', 'Pileri SA']","['Service of Pathologic Anatomy and Hematopathology, Institute of Haematology and Clinical Oncology L. & A.

DESIGN: Prospective case study from June 1997 through December 1997. SETTING: Seven provincial hospitals and Kenyatta National Referral Hospital. SUBJECTS: Both sexes with tissue proven malignancy. INTERVENTIONS: By obtaining clinical information, and laboratory evaluatory results. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportions of vital statistics, anatomic site, stage and histology of cancer, vaccination, breastfeeding, congenital abnormality, parental vital statistics, education, smoking, water availability status and consanguinity. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty seven cases were evaluated. Male to female (M:F) ratio was 1.5:1. Mean ages: patients 6.5, fathers 36.6, mothers 31.1 years. Histologic types were: Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) 45%, nephroblastoma 14%, Hodgkin's lymphoma 9.5%, acute lymphocytic leukaemia 7.6%, retinoblastoma 5.7%, acute myeloid leukaemia 5.1%. The age distribution was as follows: 0-5 years, 46.5%, 6-10, 39.5% and 11-16 years 14%. The birth places of the children were as follows: Nyanza 25%, Central 21%, Eastern 16%, Western 13%, Rift Valley 9%, Coast 8%, Nairobi 8% and North Eastern had less than one per cent. The ethnic distribution was; Luo 25%, Kikuyu 22%, Luhya 13%, Kamba 10%, Coastal 6%, Kalenjin 6%, others 19%. Fifty per cent of the cases studied were breastfed for over six months, 34% for 3-6 months, five per cent less than three months and eleven per cent were not breastfed. Eighty five per cent of the cases received complete vaccination. The modal number of siblings was four and only 49% of parents received formal education. No consanguinity was noted in the studied population. The abdomen and jaw were main anatomic sites involved by the tumours. CONCLUSION: This study showed that the commonest childhood tumour is Burkitt's lymphoma and nephroblastoma is the commonest solid tumour. While the results demonstrate geographic and ethnic variations, other factors studied do not appear to influence the characteristics of cancers in the cases investigated.","['Mwanda, O W']",['Mwanda OW'],"['Department of Haematology and Blood Transfusion, College of Health Sciences, University of Nairobi, Kenya.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Kenya,East Afr Med J,East African medical journal,0372766,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Distribution', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Kenya/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",,1999/08/12 00:00,1999/08/12 00:01,['1999/08/12 00:00'],"['1999/08/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/12 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/12 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,East Afr Med J. 1999 Jan;76(1):3-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We observed that wild-type HIV-2 envelope protein or a frameshift mutant with 187 unrelated carboxyl-terminal residues did not allow the formation of infectious retroviral particles. In view of recent findings that an HIV-1 envelope protein variant with a shortened cytoplasmic domain was incorporated into MuLV particles, we constructed carboxyl-terminal truncations of the HIV-2 envelope protein. An envelope variant with 18 cytoplasmic amino acids formed only very few viral pseudotypes. The further removal of an additional 11 amino acids allowed the efficient pseudotyping of MuLV particles. As with the HIV-1 envelope protein, an HIV-2 envelope variant with 7 cytoplasmic amino acids was incorporated into functional MuLV particles. The pseudotyped vectors obtained are able to infect human CD4/CXCR4-expressing cells. Cell lines expressing human CD4 and other coreceptors could not be infected. This retroviral vector will prove useful for the study of HIV infection events mediated by the HIV-2 envelope glycoproteins, as well as for the targeting of CD4+ cells in the context of gene therapy of AIDS.","['Hohne, M', 'Thaler, S', 'Dudda, J C', 'Groner, B', 'Schnierle, B S']","['Hohne M', 'Thaler S', 'Dudda JC', 'Groner B', 'Schnierle BS']","['Institute for Experimental Cancer Research, Tumor Biology Center, Breisacherstrasse 117, Freiburg, D-79106, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD4 Antigens/metabolism', 'Gene Products, env/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genes, env', '*Genetic Vectors', 'HIV-1/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'HIV-2/*chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics/physiology', 'Mice', 'Receptors, CXCR4/metabolism', 'Transfection']",,1999/08/12 00:00,1999/08/12 00:01,['1999/08/12 00:00'],"['1999/08/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/12 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/12 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/viro.1999.9847 [doi]', 'S0042-6822(99)99847-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Virology. 1999 Aug 15;261(1):70-8. doi: 10.1006/viro.1999.9847.,['Copyright 1999 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The inhibitory effects of troglitazone on cell proliferation and expression of p21 mRNA were observed in a human myelomonocytic cell line, U937, and a human myelomonoblastic cell line, KPB-M15. In addition, in EoL-1 cells, p21 protein was induced by troglitazone treatment and the induction was inhibited by protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide.

The spatial distribution of leukemia cases has been investigated over seven scales of observation. A power-law relation of the variance to the mean of aggregates (quadrats) was used to detect possible scale-invariant self-similar clustering. The spatial distribution of leukemia cases (incidence from 1946 to 1964) was well fitted by a power-law function. The follow-up of clustering from the first years of case notification (1946) confirmed a scale-invariant self-similar spatial pattern with a stable power-law slope from 1952 onward. This pattern was shown to pertain specifically to school-age leukemia cases. Younger cases had a random distributional pattern over space. Observation and simulations of the distributional patterns revealed memory-keeping of historical (the pre-1953 era) fractal-like conditions. Based on a comparison of the leukemia fractal dimension with that of the city residential data, it is speculated that the current scale-invariant self-similar spatial clustering of the leukemia cases reflects the onset of the historical fractal patterning of the city residences at a particular time point in the past.","['Philippe, P']",['Philippe P'],"[""Faculty of Medicine, University of Montreal, M. d'Youville Bldg, Montreal, QC, H3C 3J7, Canada.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Theor Biol,Journal of theoretical biology,0376342,,IM,"['Child', 'Fractals', 'Humans', '*Models, Statistical', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology', 'San Francisco', 'Space-Time Clustering', 'Urban Population']",,1999/08/12 00:00,1999/08/12 00:01,['1999/08/12 00:00'],"['1999/08/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/12 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/12 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/jtbi.1999.0964 [doi]', 'S0022-5193(99)90964-5 [pii]']",ppublish,J Theor Biol. 1999 Aug 21;199(4):371-81. doi: 10.1006/jtbi.1999.0964.,['Copyright 1999 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The different effects on transcription are carried out through recruitment of co-regulators: unliganded receptors bind corepressors (NCoR and SMRT) that are found within a complex containing histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity, whereas liganded receptors recruit coactivators with histone acetylase activity (HATs). Chromatin remodeling activities have also shown to be required, suggesting a hierarchy of promoter structure modifications in RA target genes carried out by multiple coregulatory complexes. In this review, we examine the experimental evidence for the model just sketched. We focus on recent findings highlighting new molecular details in receptor-coregulator interactions, including the discovery and initial characterisation of novel complexes with multiple chromatin modifying activities. Finally, we look at the role of aberrant recruitment of the NCoRHDAC complex by altered retinoid receptors in the pathogenesis of acute promyelocytic leukemia. These results point to a crucial role for control of transcription factor coregulator interactions in the regulation of cellular processes, and suggest new molecular targets for cancer therapy.","['Minucci, S', 'Pelicci, P G']","['Minucci S', 'Pelicci PG']","['Department of Experimental Oncology, European Institute of Oncology, Milan, 20141, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Semin Cell Dev Biol,Seminars in cell & developmental biology,9607332,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (NCOR1 protein, human)', '0 (NCOR2 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 1)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 2)', '0 (Nucleosomes)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Retinoids)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.3.1.- (Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Histone Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Acetyltransferases/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Chromatin/genetics/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'DNA/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Dimerization', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Histone Acetyltransferases', 'Histone Deacetylases/metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism', 'Ligands', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Models, Genetic', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 1', 'Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 2', 'Nucleosomes/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/chemistry/drug effects/*physiology', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Repressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Retinoids/pharmacology', '*Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/physiology', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,1999/08/10 00:00,1999/08/10 00:01,['1999/08/10 00:00'],"['1999/08/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/10 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/scdb.1999.0303 [doi]', 'S1084-9521(99)90303-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Semin Cell Dev Biol. 1999 Apr;10(2):215-25. doi: 10.1006/scdb.1999.0303.,['Copyright 1999 Academic Press.'],,,97,['Semin Cell Dev Biol. 1999 Apr;10(2):165-7.

Sometimes, however, chromosomal rearrangements involve segments too small, too similarly banded, or too complex to be described adequately or even to be detected by G-banding. Cross-species color banding is a new FISH-based screening technique that enables the generation of a specific color banding pattern for each human chromosome based on the genomic homologies between man and various species of apes. We report the first application of cross-species color banding (RxFISH) to characterize the chromosomal rearrangements of 10 leukemia samples the G-band karyotypes of which were incomplete. The combination of G-banding and RxFISH in every case yielded additional information beyond that obtained by either technique used alone, determining the identity of even the most complex, inter- as well as intrachromosomal, rearrangements.

This activation of MAPKs is proposed to play a role in the replacement of damaged proteins during these stresses. Heat shock also activates MAPKs; however, the signaling cascade and the biochemical and physiological links between activation by heat and downstream effects are unknown. In this report we demonstrate that, unlike irradiation, heat induces MAPKs through ceramide metabolism to sphingosine with stimulation of Raf-1 protein kinase. The activation of MAPKs by heat does not occur in all cell types, because the step(s) downstream of ceramide to activation of Raf-1 protein kinase is missing in myeloid leukemic cells such as HL-60, U937, and K562, while it is present in NIH3T3 fibroblasts. Heat-induced MAPK activation may enhance the ability of cells to survive a severe heat shock. Blocking 60-70% of the activity of MAPK (ERK1) by stable overexpression of the dominant negative allele ERK1-KR renders NIH3T3 and K562 cells up to 100-fold more sensitive to cytotoxic effects of heat. Conversely, NIH3T3 and K562 cells stably overexpressing the wild-type ERK1 develop resistance to killing by heat. These results suggest that increased thermal sensitivity of leukemic cells to thermal stress or other cancer therapy regimens could be attributable to lack of pertinent activation of the MAPK pathway by such stresses.","['Woessmann, W', 'Meng, Y H', 'Mivechi, N F']","['Woessmann W', 'Meng YH', 'Mivechi NF']","['Medical College of Georgia, Augusta, Georgia 30912, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (N-acetylsphingosine)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/genetics/*physiology', 'Cell Death/*physiology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3', '*Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf/metabolism', 'Sphingosine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'U937 Cells']",,1999/08/10 00:00,1999/08/10 00:01,['1999/08/10 00:00'],"['1999/08/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/10 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-4644(19990915)74:4<648::AID-JCB14>3.0.CO;2-6 [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-4644(19990915)74:4<648::aid-jcb14>3.3.co;2-y [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 1999 Sep 15;74(4):648-62. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-4644(19990915)74:4<648::aid-jcb14>3.3.co;2-y.,"['Copyright 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,['CA62130/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

Expression of the Moloney amphotropic retroviral receptor-pit-2 or GLVR-2-is critical to the recognition and entry of Moloney leukemia virus-derived viruses into human target cells such as CD34+ hematopoietic cells. GLVR-2 functions as a sodium-dependent phosphate transporter as well as a receptor. We have previously shown that the expression of the murine homologue of the amphotropic receptor Ram 1, also a phosphate transporter, is developmentally regulated in murine hematopoietic fetal liver cells. We also demonstrated that culture of murine fetal liver cells in phosphate-free (PO(4)-free) medium increases levels of receptor mRNA and makes murine fetal liver cells susceptible to Moloney amphotropic viral gene transfer. We now examine the effect of culture conditions on the expression of GLVR-2 in human CD34+ cells. In this report, we demonstrate that there is a 2-3 fold increase in GLVR-2 mRNA levels in CD34+ cells after 3 days in culture with interleukin 3, interleukin 6, and stem-cell factor. In addition, the use of PO(4)-free medium increases expression of GLVR-2 an additional 2-fold in these cells during this time. These results indicate that GLVR-2 expression can be up-regulated on these cells, and may permit improved retroviral gene transfer efficiencies.","['Kaubisch, A', 'Ward, M', 'Schoetz, S', 'Hesdorffer, C', 'Bank, A']","['Kaubisch A', 'Ward M', 'Schoetz S', 'Hesdorffer C', 'Bank A']","['Department of Medicine, Columbia University, College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York 10032, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Phosphate Transport Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Slc20a2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins)', '0 (Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins, Type III)', '0 (Symporters)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Antigens, CD34', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology/*virology', 'Humans', 'Liver/cytology', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', '*Phosphate Transport Proteins', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Virus/*genetics', 'Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins', 'Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins, Type III', '*Symporters', 'Up-Regulation']",,1999/08/10 00:00,1999/08/10 00:01,['1999/08/10 00:00'],"['1999/08/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/10 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-8652(199908)61:4<243::AID-AJH4>3.0.CO;2-J [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1096-8652(199908)61:4<243::aid-ajh4>3.0.co;2-j [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1999 Aug;61(4):243-53. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1096-8652(199908)61:4<243::aid-ajh4>3.0.co;2-j.,"['Copyright 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,"['DK-25274/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-28381/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-48345/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,

(ii) The forward and side scatter characteristics were affected by all of the lysis and fixation procedures, and this was most marked for LF-1000-Lyse and Flow. (iii) OptiLyse C gave preparations with poor forward and side scatter resolution due to the presence of residual red cell fragments. (iv) Lysis and fixation procedures did not affect the apparent expression of the CD3, CD45, or FMC7 antigens on normal or CLL samples, but gave highly variable results for the expression of the CD5, CD11b, kappa, and lambda antigens on the CLL samples. We conclude that lysis and fixation procedures can introduce different artefacts in the analysis of normal and leukaemic samples that are best avoided by analysing live whole blood.","['Macey, M G', 'McCarthy, D A', 'Milne, T', 'Cavenagh, J D', 'Newland, A C']","['Macey MG', 'McCarthy DA', 'Milne T', 'Cavenagh JD', 'Newland AC']","['Department of Haematology, The Royal London Hospital, Whitechapel, London, United Kingdom.

Sensitive techniques to detect minimal residual disease (MRD) may allow better estimates of the leukemia burden and help the selection of appropriate therapeutic strategies. Flow cytometry and polymerase chain reaction have emerged as the most promising methods for detecting submicrospopic levels of leukemia. Flowcytometric detection of MRD is based on the identification of immunophenotypic combinations expressed on leukemic cells but not on normal hematopoietic cells. It affords the detection of one leukemic cell among 10,000 normal bone marrow cells, and can be currently applied to at least two thirds of all patients with acute leukemia. Prospective studies in large series of patients have demonstrated a strong correlation between MRD levels during clinical remission and treatment outcome. Therefore, MRD assays can be reliably used to assess early response to treatment and predict relapse. In this review, we discuss methodologic aspects and clinical results of flowcytometric detection of MRD in patients with acute leukemia.","['Campana, D', 'Coustan-Smith, E']","['Campana D', 'Coustan-Smith E']","[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, Medicine, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA. dario.campana@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/immunology', 'Cell Lineage/immunology', 'Child', 'False Negative Reactions', 'False Positive Reactions', '*Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/immunology', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/immunology', 'Risk Factors', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",,1999/08/10 00:00,1999/08/10 00:01,['1999/08/10 00:00'],"['1999/08/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/10 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0320(19990815)38:4<139::AID-CYTO1>3.0.CO;2-H [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0320(19990815)38:4<139::aid-cyto1>3.0.co;2-h [doi]']",ppublish,Cytometry. 1999 Aug 15;38(4):139-52. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0320(19990815)38:4<139::aid-cyto1>3.0.co;2-h.,"['Copyright 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,100,,,,,,,,,

Major exposure groups included the reactor workers, villagers evacuated from within 30 km of the accident, the ""liquidators"" who decontaminated the evacuation zone afterward, those in radiocontaminated villages not evacuated, and ""others"" not in the latter categories. The possibility of being exposed to radiation caused considerable anxiety, especially among pregnant women. Were teratogenic levels of radiation (> or = 0.1 Gy) exposure attained? To date there is no consistent proof that this level of radiation exposure was received. Nevertheless, thousands of induced abortions were performed. Radioiodine (I-131) caused thyroid cancer in young children in portions of Belarus, the Ukraine, and Russia. It is not known but very possible that I-131 fetal thyroid exposure contributed to this observation. The relationship between mental retardation and radiation exposure has not been confirmed. Leukemia and other cancers, while predicted for the liquidators (mainly males), has not been found in the other exposure groups at this time. Investigations of aborted fetuses and newborns in Belarus showed an increase in the frequency of both congenital and fetal abnormalities in high and low Cs-137 contaminated regions. This study is unreliable due to detection and selection biases. Accident and environmental factors unrelated to radiation doses may have contributed to these observations. Occasional positive teratogenic studies in less contaminated regions of Western Europe are suspect because of the low radiation doses received. There is no substantive proof regarding radiation-induced teratogenic effects from the Chernobyl accident.","['Castronovo, F P Jr']",['Castronovo FP Jr'],"[""Department of Health Physics and Radiopharmacology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Teratology,Teratology,0153257,['0 (Teratogens)'],IM,"['Abortion, Induced', 'Europe', 'Female', 'Fetus/radiation effects', 'Humans', '*Nuclear Reactors', 'Pregnancy', '*Radioactive Hazard Release', 'Republic of Belarus', '*Teratogens', 'Ukraine']",,1999/08/10 10:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1999/08/10 10:00'],"['1999/08/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1999/08/10 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-9926(199908)60:2<100::AID-TERA14>3.0.CO;2-H [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1096-9926(199908)60:2<100::AID-TERA14>3.0.CO;2-H [doi]']",ppublish,Teratology. 1999 Aug;60(2):100-6. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1096-9926(199908)60:2<100::AID-TERA14>3.0.CO;2-H.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since then we have seen 18 further cases. OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical profile of Libyan cases of XP. METHODS: With the help of a special protocol, all 42 cases (23 girls and 19 boys from 29 families) treated and followed between 1981 and 1994 were subjected to detailed analysis. RESULTS: A history of consanguinity was present in the parents of 39 patients. XP in Libya is characterized by a relatively high incidence (approximately 15-20 per million of the population), early onset of initial manifestations (median age, 12 months) and malignant tumors (median age, 8 years), severe ocular and oral lesions in a high percentage of patients, and early death (median age, 15.5 years). The malignant skin tumors seen were squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in 23 patients, basal cell carcinoma (BCC) in 17 patients, and basosquamous carcinoma in two patients. Malignant melanoma was not seen, but lentigo maligna was found in one case. SCC of the tongue, carcinoma of the thyroid, and lymphatic leukemia affected individual patients. Subnormal physical growth was observed in six patients, but none of the patients had significant neurologic abnormalities. The results of etretinate therapy in nine patients revealed that it is an effective preventive agent against carcinogenesis, but not a curative one. CONCLUSIONS: Severe ophthalmic manifestations affected a higher percentage of patients at an early age. Malignant melanoma did not develop in any case, except for lentigo maligna in one patient.","['Khatri, M L', 'Bemghazil, M', 'Shafi, M', 'Machina, A']","['Khatri ML', 'Bemghazil M', 'Shafi M', 'Machina A']","['Department of Dermatology, Faculty of Medicine, Al-Fateh University of Medical Sciences and Central Hospital, Tripoli, Libya.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Int J Dermatol,International journal of dermatology,0243704,"['0 (Dermatologic Agents)', '65M2UDR9AG (Etretinate)', 'SOI2LOH54Z (Zinc Oxide)']",IM,"['Age of Onset', 'Anemia/complications', 'Carcinoma, Basal Cell/pathology/therapy', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/pathology/therapy', 'Dermatologic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Etretinate/therapeutic use', 'Eye Diseases/complications', 'Female', 'Growth Disorders/complications', 'Humans', 'Hypothyroidism/complications', 'Kidney Calculi/complications', 'Libya', 'Male', 'Mouth Neoplasms/pathology/therapy', 'Radiotherapy', 'Skin/*pathology', 'Skin Neoplasms/pathology/therapy', 'Survival Analysis', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/pathology/therapy', 'Tuberculosis, Pulmonary/complications', 'Xeroderma Pigmentosum/complications/*pathology/therapy', 'Zinc Oxide/therapeutic use']",,1999/08/10 00:00,1999/08/10 00:01,['1999/08/10 00:00'],"['1999/08/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-4362.1999.00751.x [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Dermatol. 1999 Jul;38(7):520-4. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-4362.1999.00751.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Cultured human fetal retinal pigment epithelium (HFRPE) was exposed to green fluorescent protein (GFP)-transducing retroviral vectors, Moloney murine leukemia virus, and lentivirus. The cultured cells were followed by fluorescence microscopy. Suspensions of GFP-expressing HFRPE were transplanted into the subretinal space of pigmented rabbits, and the transplant sites were examined by SLO for fluorescence, including fluorescein and indocyanine green angiography. The rabbits were euthanatized at different times after transplantation, and the retinas were studied histologically. RESULTS: Retroviral gene transfer can introduce a foreign gene such as GFP into cultured HFRPE. Gene expression is maintained in cultured RPE for at least 3 months. The lentiviral vector transduced both nondividing and dividing cells; the Moloney vector only transduced the latter. GFP-expressing cells can be followed in the living retina. Their changes reflect the rejection response followed histologically. CONCLUSIONS: Cultured HFRPE could be transduced to express GFP for long periods of time by retroviral gene transfer. GFP allowed retinal transplants and gene expression to be monitored in vivo. These results provide a model for potential ex vivo gene therapy in the subretinal space.","['Lai, C C', 'Gouras, P', 'Doi, K', 'Lu, F', 'Kjeldbye, H', 'Goff, S P', 'Pawliuk, R', 'Leboulch, P', 'Tsang, S H']","['Lai CC', 'Gouras P', 'Doi K', 'Lu F', 'Kjeldbye H', 'Goff SP', 'Pawliuk R', 'Leboulch P', 'Tsang SH']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, New York, New York 10032, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci,Investigative ophthalmology & visual science,7703701,"['0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Defective Viruses', '*Fetal Tissue Transplantation', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Humans', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Ophthalmoscopy', 'Pigment Epithelium of Eye/metabolism/*transplantation/virology', 'Rabbits', 'Retina/cytology/metabolism/*surgery', 'Retroviridae/*genetics/metabolism']",,1999/08/10 00:00,1999/08/10 00:01,['1999/08/10 00:00'],"['1999/08/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/10 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 1999 Aug;40(9):2141-6.,,,"['EY RO1-EY03854/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'EY07105/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

Primary thyroid lymphomas were found in 23 patients (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, 18; marginal zone B-cell lymphoma, 4; plasmacytoma, 1), and secondary lymphomas were found in 9 patients (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, 3; Burkitt lymphomas, 2; Burkitt-like lymphoma, 1; hairy cell leukemia, 1; nasal T-cell and natural killer cell lymphoma, 1; and intestinal T-cell lymphoma, 1). Primary thyroid lymphomas were large (mean, 7 cm), found commonly in older women, and often misdiagnosed as undifferentiated carcinomas. Fine-needle aspiration was not helpful for diagnosis. Fifteen patients had Hashimoto thyroiditis. A history of thyrotoxicosis was found in 3 patients, and coexistence of 3 diseases (papillary microcarcinomas, primary thyroid lymphoma, and Hashimoto thyroiditis) was found 4 patients. The 5-year survival rate for primary thyroid lymphoma was 53%. Combined surgery and radiotherapy seemed to be the best treatment. Secondary thyroid lymphomas often were asymptomatic.

We have designed an extremely rapid, practical, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based method using a rapid air thermal cycler to detect type A, B, and B-variant fusion patterns of PML/RAR alpha. We examined 15 cases of APL and 13 cases of leukemias other than APL with a nested reverse-transcription PCR assay. Three APL samples were type A, 11 were type B, and 1 was a B variant based on gel band patterns. PCR products exhibited positive probe hybridization signals and had sequences containing type A, B, or B-variant fusion patterns. PCR amplification of PML/RAR alpha was complete in 22 minutes, and the entire test required 4 1/2 hours. This method permits exceptional turnaround time and is an alternative to cytogenetics and slower PCR assays.","['Hussey, C E', 'Lyon, E', 'Millson, A', 'Lay, M J', 'Wittwer, C T', 'Segal, G H']","['Hussey CE', 'Lyon E', 'Millson A', 'Lay MJ', 'Wittwer CT', 'Segal GH']","['Department of Pathology, University of Utah Health Sciences Center, Salt Lake City 84132, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Artificial Gene Fusion/*methods', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,1999/08/10 00:00,1999/08/10 00:01,['1999/08/10 00:00'],"['1999/08/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ajcp/112.2.256 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1999 Aug;112(2):256-62. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/112.2.256.,,,['GM51647/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

The proliferation rate of these cells is usually very low and this is thought to be one of the reasons for the lack of a curative potential of cytostatic chemotherapy in CLL and low grade NHL. Recombinant human (rh) IL-6 might increase the in vivo proliferation rate leading to a higher sensitivity for chemotherapy. We tested this hypothesis by administering rhIL-6 to 9 CLL patients and 3 NHL patients in doses of 2.5 micrograms/kg, 5 micrograms/kg and 10 micrograms/kg s.c. daily for 5 days followed by CHOP chemotherapy on the last day of rhIL-6 injection. Six patients had two treatment cycles. The proportion of cells in S-phase was determined by the bromodeoxyuridine labeling index (LI). Three patients achieved a partial remission, one patient had progressive disease and the remaining patients demonstrated no change. Two patients, who received 10 micrograms/kg/day rhIL-6, demonstrated a significant increase in LI, one of these was first observed in the second treatment cycle. A significant decrease was seen in two patients receiving 2.5 micrograms/kg and 5 micrograms/kg respectively. Immunophenotypic assessment demonstrated that rhIL-6 increased the expression of CD20 in all CLL patients with a reversal after cessation of rhIL-6. We conclude that rhIL-6, in the dosage and schedule used in this study, did not increase the proportion of the cells in S-phase and that the growth stimulatory effects of rhIL-6 in CLL in vivo probably are insignificant. However, the role of rhIL-6 in CLL as inducer of increased CD20 expression prior to anti-CD20 antibody treatment remains to be determined.","['Brown, P D', 'Diamant, M', 'Jensen, P O', 'Geisler, C H', 'Mortensen, B T', 'Nissen, N I']","['Brown PD', 'Diamant M', 'Jensen PO', 'Geisler CH', 'Mortensen BT', 'Nissen NI']","['Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interleukin-6)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD20/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interleukin-6/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'S Phase/*drug effects']",,1999/08/10 00:00,1999/08/10 00:01,['1999/08/10 00:00'],"['1999/08/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199909050957 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1999 Jul;34(3-4):325-33. doi: 10.3109/10428199909050957.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Six relapsed 25-46 months (median 30) after BMT. Fourteen (10%) died of non-relapse causes (12 transplant-related and 2 unrelated) 24-140 months (median 73) after BMT; mainly due to complications of chronic GVHD (8 infections, 3 secondary malignancies). One hundred and seventeen (86%) patients are alive in remission 25-226 months (median 103) after BMT; 116 (85%) in continuous remission. Eight survivors have symptomatic chronic GVHD requiring therapy (Karnofsky scores 60-90%, median 80%). The majority of those without chronic GVHD have Karnofsky scores of 100%. The 10-year probabilities of survival, toxic death, and relapse (from the 2-year mark) are 81%, 13%, and 5%. Twenty-two (19%) survivors had creatinine levels of > 110 mumol/L (one more than double), and 11 (9%) had bilirubin levels of > 17 mmol/L (one more than double) at the last follow-up. The absence of chronic GVHD at the 2-year mark (RR 3.5, P = .004), and female sex (RR 2.9, P = .04) influenced overall survival favorably, and the absence of chronic GVHD at the 2-year mark (RR 8.1, P = .001) influenced toxic death favorably. We conclude that patients with acute leukemia who are alive and well without chronic GVHD two years following an allograft have a high probability of being cured, whereas patients with active chronic GVHD requiring immunosuppression continue to be at risk of non-relapse death. The incidence of long-term liver and kidney dysfunction measured by serum bilirubin and creatinine is low.","['Singhal, S', 'Powles, R', 'Treleaven, J', 'Kulkarni, S', 'Horton, C', 'Mehta, J']","['Singhal S', 'Powles R', 'Treleaven J', 'Kulkarni S', 'Horton C', 'Mehta J']","['Leukaemia Unit, Royal Marsden Hospital, Surrey, UK. ssinghal@exchange.uams.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', '*Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Outcome Assessment, Health Care', 'Prospective Studies']",,1999/08/10 00:00,1999/08/10 00:01,['1999/08/10 00:00'],"['1999/08/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199909050953 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1999 Jul;34(3-4):287-94. doi: 10.3109/10428199909050953.,,,,37,,,,,,,,,

They can be classified into two types; i.e., those that do/do not require phosphorylation to induce the differentiation of leukemia cells. Neplanocin A, a potent S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase inhibitor, induces the differentiation of some leukemia cells without phosphorylation. On the other hand, deoxycoformycin (dCF), a potent adenosine deaminase inhibitor, also induces the myelomonocytic differentiation of leukemia cells when it is treated with deoxyadenosine (dAdo). This differentiation is inhibited by 5'-amino-deoxyadenosine, an inhibitor of (deoxy)adenosine kinase, suggesting that kinase-dependent phosphorylation is involved in the differentiation-inducing effect of dCF plus dAdo. Retinoids induce the differentiation of NB4 cells, a cell line derived from human promyelocytic leukemia. When used in combination with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), both NPA and dCF plus dAdo greatly enhance the granulocytic differentiation of NB4 cells. This enhancing effect is greatest when the cells are pretreated with NPA and then with ATRA. On the other hand, pre-exposure of NB4 cells to ATRA greatly potentiates the differentiation induced by dCF plus dAdo, while pretreatment with dCF plus dAdo before exposure to ATRA is less effective. The ATRA-induced differentiation of NB4 cells is effectively augmented by clinically applicable concentrations of these analogs. A clinical strategy that combines intermittent treatment with these analogs and a low dose of ATRA may increase the clinical response and decrease the adverse effects of ATRA.","['Niitsu, N', 'Honma, Y']","['Niitsu N', 'Honma Y']","['Department of Chemotherapy, Saitama Cancer Center Research Institute, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",IM,"['Adenosine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/therapeutic use', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Deoxyadenosines/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Models, Chemical', 'Pentostatin/therapeutic use', 'Tretinoin/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/08/10 00:00,1999/08/10 00:01,['1999/08/10 00:00'],"['1999/08/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199909050951 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1999 Jul;34(3-4):261-71. doi: 10.3109/10428199909050951.,,,,67,,,,,,,,,

This loss of genetic material suggests the presence of a tumor suppressor gene playing an important role in growth regulation or in the differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells. In order to substantiate this hypothesis and determine the chromosomal location of this putative gene, we and others have applied a deletion mapping strategy based on the detection of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at specific genomic loci in leukemic cells. Hemizygous deletions at chromosome 12p12.3 were observed in childhood B cell precursor ALL, and proved to be one of the most frequent genetic alterations seen in this disease. The shortest region of overlapping deletions (SRO) was delimited by the markers D12S89 (distal) and D12S358 (proximal), separated by a genetic interval of approximately 3 cM. LOH in the same region in other hematological diseases, as well as in a variety of solid tumors, suggests either the presence of several tumor suppressor genes or the existence of a single gene with a wide range of activity. This genetic interval contains two known genes: TEL/ETV6, an ets-like transcription factor, and the cyclin-dependant kinase inhibitor, p27/kip1. Accumulating evidence suggests that an as yet unidentified tumor suppressor gene is closely linked to these two genes. Long-range restriction mapping of the SRO region allowed the construction of a approximately 750 kb physical map containing 4 known genes, 7 STSs, 3 chromosome 12 ESTs and 8 CpG islands. The construction of a 12p12.3 framework map is a crucial step towards the identification of candidate genes and should provide a valuable tool for the characterization of transcriptional units.","['Aissani, B', 'Bonan, C', 'Baccichet, A', 'Sinnett, D']","['Aissani B', 'Bonan C', 'Baccichet A', 'Sinnett D']","[""Service d'Hematologie-Oncologie, Centre de Cancerologie Charles-Bruneau, Hopital Sainte-Justine, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Child', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Phosphoproteins/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', '*Repressor Proteins', 'Transcription Factors/genetics']",,1999/08/10 00:00,1999/08/10 00:01,['1999/08/10 00:00'],"['1999/08/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199909050948 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1999 Jul;34(3-4):231-9. doi: 10.3109/10428199909050948.,,,,70,,,,,,,,,

The Rfv3 gene was previously mapped to an approximately 20-centimorgan (cM) region of chromosome 15. More refined mapping was not possible, due to a lack of microsatellite markers and leakiness in the Rfv3 phenotype, which prevented definitive phenotyping of individual recombinant mice. In the present study, we overcame these difficulties by taking advantage of seven new microsatellite markers in the Rfv3 region and by using progeny tests to accurately determine the Rfv3 phenotype of recombinant mice. Detailed linkage analysis of relevant crossovers narrowed the location of Rfv3 to a 0.83-cM region. Mapping of closely linked genes in an interspecific backcross panel allowed us to exclude two previous candidate genes, Ly6 and Wnt7b. These studies also showed for the first time that the Hsf1 gene maps to the Rfv3-linked cluster of genes including Il2rb, Il3rb, and Pdgfb.

The transcriptional enhancer in the long terminal repeat (LTR) of SL3 contains two 72-bp repeats. Each repeat contains a binding site for the transcription factor CBF (also called AML1). The CBF binding sites are called core elements. SAA is a mutant that is identical to SL3 except for the presence of a single-base-pair substitution in each of the two core elements. This mutation significantly attenuates viral lymphomagenicity. Most lymphomas that occur in SAA-infected mice contain proviruses with reversions or second-site suppressor mutations within the core element. We examined the selective pressures that might account for the predominance of the reversions and suppressor mutations in tumor proviruses by analyzing when proviruses with altered core sequences became abundant during the course of lymphomagenesis. Altered core sequences were easily detected in thymus DNAs by 4 to 6 weeks after SAA infection of mice, well before lymphomas were grossly evident. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that viruses with the core sequence alterations emerged because they replicated more effectively in mice than SAA. The number of 72-bp tandem, repeats in the viral LTR was found to vary, presumably as a consequence of reverse transcriptase slippage during polymerization. Proviruses with two repeats predominated in the thymuses of SAA- and SL3-infected mice before lymphomas developed, although LTRs with one or three repeats were also present. This suggested that two was the optimal number of 72-bp repeats for viral replication. However, in lymphomas, proviruses with three or four repeats usually predominated. This suggested that a late step in the process of lymphomagenesis led to the abundance of proviruses with additional repeats.

This is due in large part to the technical problems and/or inefficiency of conventional DNA transfer methods, as well as the low rates of homologous recombination obtained in unselected cell populations. We recently described an alternative approach in which adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors were used to modify homologous chromosomal sequences, and targeting rates close to 1% were observed at the single copy hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT) locus in normal human cells (D. W. Russell and R. K. Hirata, Nat. Genet. 18:325-330, 1998). Here we report experiments in which we used a retroviral shuttle vector system to introduce and characterize target loci in human chromosomes, and demonstrate that AAV vectors can correct several types of mutations with high fidelity, independent of chromosomal position. The gene targeting rates varied depending on the type of mutation being corrected, implicating cellular mismatch recognition functions in the reaction. Since AAV vectors can efficiently deliver DNA to many cell types both in vivo and ex vivo, our results suggest that AAV-mediated gene targeting will have wide applicability, including therapeutic gene correction.","['Inoue, N', 'Hirata, R K', 'Russell, D W']","['Inoue N', 'Hirata RK', 'Russell DW']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98195-7720, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,,IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Dependovirus/*genetics', 'Gene Targeting/*methods', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', '*Mutagenesis', 'Simian virus 40/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC104264,1999/08/10 00:00,1999/08/10 00:01,['1999/08/10 00:00'],"['1999/08/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.73.9.7376-7380.1999 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1999 Sep;73(9):7376-80. doi: 10.1128/JVI.73.9.7376-7380.1999.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two models have been put forward to explain the mechanisms by which the RNAs dimerize; each model emphasizes the role of specific molecular determinants. The kissing-loop model implicates interactions between palindromic sequences in the DLS region. The second model proposes that purine-rich stretches in the region form purine quartet structures. Here, we present an examination of the in vitro dimerization of Moloney murine sarcoma virus (MuSV) RNA in the context of these two models. Dimers were found to form spontaneously in a temperature-, time-, concentration-, and salt-dependent manner. In contrast to earlier reports, we found that deletion of neither the palindrome nor the consensus purine motifs (PuGGAPuA) affected the level of dimer formation at low concentrations of RNA. Rather, different purine-rich sequences, i.e., consecutive stretches of guanines, were found to enhance both in vitro RNA dimerization and in vivo viral replication. Biochemical evidence further suggests that these guanine-rich (G-rich) stretches form guanine quartet structures. We also found that the palindromic sequences could support dimerization at significantly higher RNA concentrations. In addition, the G-rich stretches were as important as the palindromic sequence for maintaining efficient viral replication. Overall, our data support a model that entails contributions from both of the previously proposed mechanisms of retroviral RNA dimerization.","['Ly, H', 'Nierlich, D P', 'Olsen, J C', 'Kaplan, A H']","['Ly H', 'Nierlich DP', 'Olsen JC', 'Kaplan AH']","['Departments of Microbiology & Immunology, School of Medicine, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Cations, Monovalent)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '451W47IQ8X (Sodium Chloride)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', '9FN79X2M3F (Lithium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cations, Monovalent', 'Consensus Sequence', 'DNA, Viral', 'Dimerization', 'Genome, Viral', 'Guanine/*metabolism', 'Lithium', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics/physiology', 'RNA, Viral/*metabolism', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Temperature', 'Virus Replication']",PMC104250,1999/08/10 00:00,1999/08/10 00:01,['1999/08/10 00:00'],"['1999/08/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.73.9.7255-7261.1999 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1999 Sep;73(9):7255-61. doi: 10.1128/JVI.73.9.7255-7261.1999.,,['GENBANK/AF033813'],['K11 AI01107/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

The SRS 19-6 murine leukemia virus (MuLV), which originated in mainland China, induces leukemias of multiple cellular origins. Indeed, infected mice often harbor more than one tumor type. Since the enhancers of many MuLVs are major determinants of tumor specificity, we tested the role of the SRS 19-6 MuLV enhancers in its broad disease specificity. The enhancer elements of the Moloney MuLV (M-MuLV) were replaced by the 170-bp enhancers of SRS 19-6 MuLV, yielding the recombinants DeltaMo+SRS(+) and DeltaMo+SRS(-) M-MuLV. M-MuLV normally induces T-lymphoid tumors in all infected mice. Surprisingly, when neonatal mice were inoculated with DeltaMo+SRS(+) or DeltaMo+SRS(-) M-MuLV, all tumors were of T-lymphoid origin, typical of M-MuLV rather than SRS 19-6 MuLV. Thus, the SRS 19-6 MuLV enhancers did not confer the broad disease specificity of SRS 19-6 MuLV to M-MuLV. However, all tumors contained DeltaMo+SRS M-MuLV proviruses with common enhancer alterations. These alterations consisted of tandem multimerization of a subregion of the SRS 19-6 enhancers, encompassing the conserved LVb and core sites and adjacent sequences. Moreover, when tumors induced by the parental SRS 19-6 MuLV were analyzed, most of the T-lymphoid tumors had similar enhancer alterations in the same region whereas tumors of other lineages retained the parental SRS 19-6 MuLV enhancers. These results emphasize the importance of a subregion of the SRS 19-6 MuLV enhancer in induction of T-cell lymphoma. The relevant sequences were consistent with crucial sequences for T-cell lymphomagenesis identified for other MuLVs such as M-MuLV and SL3-3 MuLV. These results also suggest that other regions of the SRS 19-6 MuLV genome contribute to its broad leukemogenic spectrum.","['Granger, S W', 'Bundy, L M', 'Fan, H']","['Granger SW', 'Bundy LM', 'Fan H']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry and Cancer Research Institute, University of California, Irvine, California 92697-3900, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA, Viral', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Leukemia/virology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*virology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proviruses']",PMC104241,1999/08/10 00:00,1999/08/10 00:01,['1999/08/10 00:00'],"['1999/08/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.73.9.7175-7184.1999 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1999 Sep;73(9):7175-84. doi: 10.1128/JVI.73.9.7175-7184.1999.,,,"['R01 CA032455/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009054/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5 T32 CA09054/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32455/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

Identification of agents that spare normal immune effector cells, thus facilitating addition of immune-based therapies, and that modulate factors associated with drug resistance in CLL might represent a major therapeutic advance. Depsipeptide (FR901228) is a novel agent entering clinical trials that has selective in vitro activity against resistant leukemia cell lines. To assess its in vitro activity in CLL, we exposed peripheral mononuclear cells from CLL patients (n = 10) to varying concentrations of this agent. Viability of the CLL cells was reduced by 50% (LC(50)) at 4 hours, 24 hours, and 4 days at depsipeptide concentrations of 0.038, 0.024, and 0.015 micromol/L, respectively. Depsipeptide had marked selective cytotoxicity when compared with normal blood mononuclear cells, in which the LC(50) was 3.44 micromol/L at 4 hours (P =.03), 0.965 micromol/L at 24 hours (P =.01), and 0.0318 micromol/L at 96 hours (P =.04).

Expression of apoptotic proteins after depsipeptide exposure (0.015 micromol/L) included no change in bcl-2, elevation of bax, and decreased expression of p27. These data demonstrate that depsipeptide has significant selective in vitro activity against human CLL cells concurrent with favorable alterations of the bcl-2:bax protein ratio and decrease in p27 expression. Such findings strongly support the early introduction of depsipeptide into clinical trials for patients with CLL.","['Byrd, J C', 'Shinn, C', 'Ravi, R', 'Willis, C R', 'Waselenko, J K', 'Flinn, I W', 'Dawson, N A', 'Grever, M R']","['Byrd JC', 'Shinn C', 'Ravi R', 'Willis CR', 'Waselenko JK', 'Flinn IW', 'Dawson NA', 'Grever MR']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Washington, DC, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Depsipeptides)', '0 (Peptides, Cyclic)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'CX3T89XQBK (romidepsin)']",IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Clinical Trials, Phase I as Topic', '*Depsipeptides', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', '*Peptides, Cyclic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",,1999/08/10 10:00,2000/04/01 09:00,['1999/08/10 10:00'],"['1999/08/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/01 09:00 [medline]', '1999/08/10 10:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)67360-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 Aug 15;94(4):1401-8.,,,,,,,,['Blood 2000 Jan 15;95(2):409'],,,,,

This study further explores the molecular basis of chemotherapy sensitivity of DS AML patients by examining the expression of chromosome 21-localized genes in myeloblasts from newly diagnosed AML patients. Transcript levels of two chromosome 21-localized genes, cystathionine-beta-synthase (CBS) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), measured by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), were 12.0- and 3. 8-fold higher in DS compared with non-DS myeloblasts (P <.0001 and P <.0001, respectively). Conversely, there were no significant increases in transcripts for 2 other chromosome 21-localized genes, carbonyl reductase and the reduced folate carrier. CBS transcript levels correlated with both in vitro ara-C sensitivity measured by the 3-[4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium-bro mid e (MTT) assay (P =.003) and the generation of (3)H-ara-C triphosphate (ara-CTP) after in vitro incubations with 5 micromol/L (3)H-ara-C (P =.0003). Transcripts of deoxycytidine kinase were 2.6-fold higher in DS compared with non-DS cells and may be a factor in the enhanced metabolism of ara-C in DS cells. There was no significant correlation of SOD transcripts with in vitro ara-C and daunorubicin sensitivities. Increased CBS transcripts could result in elevated CBS activity, which modulates ara-C metabolism by altering reduced folate pools, deoxycytidine triphosphate pools, S-adenosylmethionine levels, and/or methylation of the deoxycytidine kinase gene. The further identification of the molecular mechanisms of chemotherapy sensitivity of DS AML patients may lead to significant improvements in the treatment and cure of AML.","['Taub, J W', 'Huang, X', 'Matherly, L H', 'Stout, M L', 'Buck, S A', 'Massey, G V', 'Becton, D L', 'Chang, M N', 'Weinstein, H J', 'Ravindranath, Y']","['Taub JW', 'Huang X', 'Matherly LH', 'Stout ML', 'Buck SA', 'Massey GV', 'Becton DL', 'Chang MN', 'Weinstein HJ', 'Ravindranath Y']","[""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital of Michigan, Detroit, MI, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Daunorubicin/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Down Syndrome/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/complications/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukocytes/*drug effects/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/08/10 00:00,1999/08/10 00:01,['1999/08/10 00:00'],"['1999/08/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)67359-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 Aug 15;94(4):1393-400.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We therefore investigated whether less-mature myeloid cells were similarly susceptible to rapid CI activation. Although the promyelocytic leukemia line HL-60 was refractory to cytokine differentiation, CI treatment induced near-uniform overnight expression of CD83, CD80 (B7.1), and CD86 (B7. 2), as well as additional characteristics of mature DC. Several cytokines that alone had restricted impact on HL-60 could enhance CI-induced differentiation and resultant T-cell sensitizing capacity. In parallel studies, CD34(pos) cells cultured from normal donor bone marrow developed marked DC-like morphology after overnight treatment with either rhCD40L or CI, but only CI simultaneously induced upregulation of CD83, CD80, and CD86. This contrasted to peripheral blood monocytes, in which such upregulation could be induced with either CI or rhCD40L treatment. We conclude that normal and transformed myeloid cells at many stages of ontogeny possess the capacity to rapidly acquire many properties of mature DC in response to CI treatment. This apparent ability to respond to calcium mobilization, even when putative signal-transducing agents are inoperative, suggests strategies for implementing host antileukemic immune responses.","['Koski, G K', 'Schwartz, G N', 'Weng, D E', 'Gress, R E', 'Engels, F H', 'Tsokos, M', 'Czerniecki, B J', 'Cohen, P A']","['Koski GK', 'Schwartz GN', 'Weng DE', 'Gress RE', 'Engels FH', 'Tsokos M', 'Czerniecki BJ', 'Cohen PA']","['Medicine Branch, National Cancer Institute, Laboratory of Pathology, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (B7-2 Antigen)', '0 (CD83 antigen)', '0 (CD86 protein, human)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Ionophores)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/physiology', 'B7-1 Antigen/physiology', 'B7-2 Antigen', 'Calcimycin/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Dendritic Cells/*cytology/physiology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/physiology', 'Ionophores/*pharmacology', '*Leukopoiesis/drug effects', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",,1999/08/10 00:00,1999/08/10 00:01,['1999/08/10 00:00'],"['1999/08/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)67356-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 Aug 15;94(4):1359-71.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this protocol, chemotherapy and treatment stratification were identical to the ALL-BFM-86 protocol (Reiter et al, Blood 84:3122, 1994), but cranial irradiation was restricted to patients with initial central nervous system (CNS) involvement. Patients were stratified into 3 risk groups, based on leukemia cell mass and response to initial treatment: standard-risk group (SRG), risk group (RG), and experimental group (EG). As in ALL-BFM-86, a randomized study on late intensification (protocol S) was performed in RG patients, and during the study (since October 1990), early reinduction treatment (protocol II) was introduced for SRG patients. Treatment duration for all patients was 18 months. Two hundred eighteen children entered the study: 74 SRG, 127 RG, and 17 EG patients. The overall complete remission (CR) rate was 98%. The 5-year event-free survival (EFS) for all DCLSG ALL-7 patients was 65. 3% (standard error [SE] 3.2%), which was significantly different from the 73% (SE 1%) 5-year EFS achieved in the ALL-BFM-86 study (P =.02, Z-test). However, restricting the analysis to SRG patients receiving protocol II with a total duration of treatment of 18 months, the 5-year EFS rates were 64.6% (SE 4.0%) and 67% (SE 4%), respectively, and no significant difference could be established (P =.67, Z-test). The 5-year EFS rates for SRG, RG, and EG patients were 63.5% (SE 5.6%), 66.6% (SE 4.2%), and 63.3% (SE 12.0%), respectively. SRG patients receiving protocol II fared better than patients not receiving protocol II (5-year EFS 76.7% [SE 7.7] and 54. 5% [SE 7.5], respectively). No difference in 5-year EFS was observed in RG patients randomized to receive or not to receive late intensification with protocol S. The overall CNS relapse rate at 5 years was 5.5%. The incidence rate at 5 years was 11.4% in SRG patients not receiving protocol II, whereas no CNS relapses occurred in SRG patients receiving protocol II. Six children died in first complete remission and 2 children developed a second malignancy (thyroid carcinoma and acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia). Systemic high-dose methotrexate (MTX) and intrathecal chemotherapy is a safe and effective method of CNS prophylaxis in the context of BFM-oriented treatment for all children with ALL, regardless of the risk group (with the possible exception of T-ALL patients with high white blood cell counts). The results of the DCLSG ALL-7 study confirm those of the ALL-BFM-86 study showing that early reinduction with protocol II is essential in the treatment of SRG patients and that late intensification with protocol S does not improve the prognosis for RG patients.","['Kamps, W A', 'Bokkerink, J P', 'Hahlen, K', 'Hermans, J', 'Riehm, H', 'Gadner, H', 'Schrappe, M', 'Slater, R', 'van den Berg-de Ruiter, E', 'Smets, L A', 'de Vaan, G A', 'Weening, R S', 'van Weerden, J F', 'van Wering, E R', 'den der Does-van den Berg, A']","['Kamps WA', 'Bokkerink JP', 'Hahlen K', 'Hermans J', 'Riehm H', 'Gadner H', 'Schrappe M', 'Slater R', 'van den Berg-de Ruiter E', 'Smets LA', 'de Vaan GA', 'Weening RS', 'van Weerden JF', 'van Wering ER', 'den der Does-van den Berg A']","['Dutch Childhood Leukemia Study Group (DCLSG), The Hague, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Treatment Outcome']",,1999/08/10 00:00,1999/08/10 00:01,['1999/08/10 00:00'],"['1999/08/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)67342-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 Aug 15;94(4):1226-36.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The prednisone response was defined as the cytoreduction (number of blood blasts per microliter at day 8) to a 7-day prednisone prephase and 1 intrathecal dose of methotrexate on day 1. Prednisone good responder (PGR; <1,000 blasts/microL) received conventional therapy and prednisone poor responder (PPR; >/=1,000 blasts/microL) received intensified therapy. Infant ALL was characterized by a high incidence of a white blood cell count greater than 100 x 10(3)/microL (57%), central nervous system leukemia (24%), lack of CD10 expression (59%), 11q23 rearrangement (49%) including the translocation t(4;11) (29%), and a comparatively high proportion of PPR (26%), which were all significantly associated with inferior outcome by univariate analysis. The estimated probability for an event-free survival at 6 years (pEFS) was by far better for PGR compared with PPR, who had a dismal prognosis despite intensified treatment (pEFS, 53% +/- 6% v 15% +/- 7%, P =.0001). Infant PGR, who were less than 6 months of age (n = 40), lacked CD10 expression (n = 43), and/or had an 11q23 rearrangement (n = 17) fared significantly better compared with corresponding PPR, as indicated by a pEFS of 44% +/- 8%, 49% +/- 8%, and 41% +/- 12%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, PPR was the strongest adverse prognostic factor (relative risk, 3.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.9 to 5.8; P <.0001). Infants with PGR, comprising a major subgroup (74%) among infants, might successfully be treated with conventional therapy, whereas PPR require new therapeutic strategies, including early treatment intensification or bone marrow transplantation in first remission.","['Dordelmann, M', 'Reiter, A', 'Borkhardt, A', 'Ludwig, W D', 'Gotz, N', 'Viehmann, S', 'Gadner, H', 'Riehm, H', 'Schrappe, M']","['Dordelmann M', 'Reiter A', 'Borkhardt A', 'Ludwig WD', 'Gotz N', 'Viehmann S', 'Gadner H', 'Riehm H', 'Schrappe M']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Medical School Hannover, Hannover, Germany.

However, relapse of accelerated phase CML, blast crisis, or acute leukemia after allogeneic SCT are resistant to DLI in the majority of cases. In vitro-selected and expanded leukemia-reactive T-cell lines may be more effective in inducing an antileukemic response in vivo. To treat a patient with accelerated phase CML after allogeneic SCT, leukemia-reactive cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) lines were generated from her HLA-identical donor. Using a modification of a limiting dilution assay, T cells were isolated from the donor, selected based on their ability to inhibit the in vitro growth of CML progenitor cells, and subsequently expanded in vitro to generate CTL lines. Three CTL lines were generated that lysed the leukemic cells from the patient and inhibited the growth of leukemic progenitor cells. The CTL did not react with lymphocytes from donor or recipient and did not affect donor hematopoietic progenitor cells. The 3 leukemia-reactive CTL lines were infused at 5-week intervals at a cumulative dose of 3.2 x 10(9) CTL. Shortly after the third infusion, complete eradication of the leukemic cells was observed, as shown by cytogenetic analysis, fluorescence in situ hybridization, molecular analysis of BCR/ABL-mRNA, and chimerism studies. These results show that in vitro cultured leukemia-reactive CTL lines selected on their ability to inhibit the proliferation of leukemic progenitor cells in vitro can be successfully applied to treat accelerated phase CML after allogeneic SCT.","['Falkenburg, J H', 'Wafelman, A R', 'Joosten, P', 'Smit, W M', 'van Bergen, C A', 'Bongaerts, R', 'Lurvink, E', 'van der Hoorn, M', 'Kluck, P', 'Landegent, J E', 'Kluin-Nelemans, H C', 'Fibbe, W E', 'Willemze, R']","['Falkenburg JH', 'Wafelman AR', 'Joosten P', 'Smit WM', 'van Bergen CA', 'Bongaerts R', 'Lurvink E', 'van der Hoorn M', 'Kluck P', 'Landegent JE', 'Kluin-Nelemans HC', 'Fibbe WE', 'Willemze R']","['Departments of Hematology and Pharmacy, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],IM,"['Adult', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'HLA Antigens/immunology', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Accelerated Phase/*immunology/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Remission Induction', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology/transplantation', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,1999/08/10 00:00,1999/08/10 00:01,['1999/08/10 00:00'],"['1999/08/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)67339-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 Aug 15;94(4):1201-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The European APL Group.,1192-200,"All transretinoic acid (ATRA) followed by daunorubicin (DNR)-AraC chemotherapy (CT) has improved the outcome of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) by comparison to CT alone. In a randomized trial, (1) we compared 2 induction schedules (ATRA followed by CT [ATRA-->CT] and ATRA plus CT [ATRA+CT, with CT added on day 3 of ATRA treatment]) and (2) we assessed the role of maintenance treatment. Four hundred thirteen patients </=75 years of age and with newly diagnosed APL were included. Induction treatment was stratified on white blood cell (WBC) count and age: patients </=65 years of age and with an initial WBC count of </=5,000/microL (n = 208) were randomized between ATRA-->CT and ATRA+CT (initially randomized patients); patients with a WBC count greater than (high WBC count group, n = 163) and patients 66 to 75 years of age with a WBC count greater than 5,000/microL (elderly group, n = 42) were not initially randomized and received ATRA+CT from day 1 and ATRA -->CT, respectively. All patients achieving CR received 2 additional DNR-AraC courses (only 1 in patients 66 to 75 years of age) and were then randomized for maintenance between no treatment, intermittent ATRA (15 days every 3 months) for 2 years, continuous low-dose CT (6 mercaptopurine + methotrexate) for 2 years, or both, using a 2-by-2 factorial design. Overall, 381 (92%) of the patients achieved complete remission (CR), 31 (7%) suffered an early death, and only 1 patient had leukemic resistance. ATRA syndrome occurred in 64 patients (15%) and was fatal in 5 cases. The CR rate was similar in all induction treatment groups. Event-free survival (EFS) was significantly lower in the high WBC group (P =.0002) and close to significance in the elderly group (P =.086) as compared with initially randomized patients. Relapse at 2 years was estimated at 6% in the ATRA+CT group, versus 16% in the ATRA-->CT group (P =.04, relative risk [RR] =.41). EFS at 2 years was estimated at 84% in the ATRA+CT group, versus 77% in the ATRA-->CT group (P =.1, RR =.62). Two hundred eighty-nine patients were randomized for maintenance. The 2-year relapse rate was 11% in patients randomized to continuous maintenance CT and 27% in patients randomized to no CT (P =.0002) and 13% in patients randomized to intermittent ATRA and 25% in patients randomized to no ATRA (P =.02). An additive effect of continuous maintenance CT and intermittent ATRA was seen, and only 6 of the 74 patients who received both maintenance treatments had relapsed. Overall survival was improved in patients who received maintenance CT (P =.01), and there was a trend for better survival in patients who received maintenance ATRA (P =.22). Our findings strongly suggest that early addition of chemotherapy to ATRA and maintenance therapy combining continuous CT and intermittent ATRA can reduce the incidence of relapse in APL. This effect already translates into significantly better survival for maintenance treatment with continuous CT.","['Fenaux, P', 'Chastang, C', 'Chevret, S', 'Sanz, M', 'Dombret, H', 'Archimbaud, E', 'Fey, M', 'Rayon, C', 'Huguet, F', 'Sotto, J J', 'Gardin, C', 'Makhoul, P C', 'Travade, P', 'Solary, E', 'Fegueux, N', 'Bordessoule, D', 'Miguel, J S', 'Link, H', 'Desablens, B', 'Stamatoullas, A', 'Deconinck, E', 'Maloisel, F', 'Castaigne, S', 'Preudhomme, C', 'Degos, L']","['Fenaux P', 'Chastang C', 'Chevret S', 'Sanz M', 'Dombret H', 'Archimbaud E', 'Fey M', 'Rayon C', 'Huguet F', 'Sotto JJ', 'Gardin C', 'Makhoul PC', 'Travade P', 'Solary E', 'Fegueux N', 'Bordessoule D', 'Miguel JS', 'Link H', 'Desablens B', 'Stamatoullas A', 'Deconinck E', 'Maloisel F', 'Castaigne S', 'Preudhomme C', 'Degos L']","['European APL Group, Service des Maladies pour la Recherche contre le Cancer.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/*administration & dosage']",,1999/08/10 00:00,1999/08/10 00:01,['1999/08/10 00:00'],"['1999/08/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)67338-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 Aug 15;94(4):1192-200.,,,,,['Blood. 1999 Dec 1;94(11):3958.

The domains are structurally similar to the N-terminal ""core"" and C-terminal ""dimerization"" domains, respectively, of the human immunodeficiency virus type one (HIV-1) and equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) capsid proteins, although several important differences exist. In particular, hydrophobic residues near the major homology region are partially buried in HTLV-I CA, which is monomeric in solution, whereas analogous residues in HIV-1 and EIAV CA project from the C-terminal domain and promote dimerization. These differences in the structure and oligomerization state of the proteins appear to be related to, and possibly controlled by, the oxidation state of conserved cysteine residues, which are reduced in HTLV-I CA but form a disulfide bond in the HIV-1 and EIAV CA crystal structures. The results are consistent with an oxidative capsid assembly mechanism, in which CA oligomerization or maturation is triggered by disulfide bo nd formation as the budding virus enters the oxidizing environment of the bloodstream.","['Khorasanizadeh, S', 'Campos-Olivas, R', 'Summers, M F']","['Khorasanizadeh S', 'Campos-Olivas R', 'Summers MF']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Maryland Baltimore County, Baltimore, MD, 21250, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,"['0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Solutions)', 'EC 5.2.1.8 (Peptidylprolyl Isomerase)', 'K848JZ4886 (Cysteine)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Capsid/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Cysteine/metabolism', 'HIV-1/chemistry', 'Horses', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Infectious Anemia Virus, Equine/chemistry', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Peptidylprolyl Isomerase/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Solutions']",,1999/08/10 00:00,1999/08/10 00:01,['1999/08/10 00:00'],"['1999/08/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/10 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/jmbi.1999.2986 [doi]', 'S0022-2836(99)92986-8 [pii]']",ppublish,J Mol Biol. 1999 Aug 13;291(2):491-505. doi: 10.1006/jmbi.1999.2986.,['Copyright 1999 Academic Press.'],['PDB/1QRJ'],['AI30917/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

In contrast to the parental HL-60 cells, HL-525 is resistant to TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis but sensitive to anti-Fas mAb-induced apoptosis. Both cell types expressed similar levels of the TNF-receptor I, whereas the Fas receptor was detected only in HL-525 cells. Transfecting the HL-525 cells with an expression vector containing PKC-beta reestablished their susceptibility to TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis. The apoptotic effect of TNF-alpha in HL-60 and the transfectants was abrogated by fumonisin, an inhibitor of ceramide generation, and by the peptide Ac-YVAD-BoMK, an inhibitor of caspase-1 and -4. Supplementing HL-525 cells with exogenous ceramides bypassed the PKC-beta deficiency and induced apoptosis, which was also restrained by the caspase-1 and -4 inhibitor.

Tax expression triggers persistent phosphorylation and degradation of the NF-kappaB inhibitory proteins IkappaBalpha and IkappaBbeta, resulting in constitutive nuclear expression of NF-kappaB. Recent studies demonstrate that Tax activates the IkappaB kinase (IKK), although the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this report, we show that Tax physically interacts with a regulatory component of the IKK complex, the NF-kappaB essential modulator or IKKgamma (NEMO/IKKgamma). This molecular interaction appears to be important for recruiting Tax to the IKK catalytic subunits, IKKalpha and IKKbeta. Expression of NEMO/IKKgamma greatly promotes binding of Tax to IKKalpha and IKKbeta and stimulates Tax-mediated IKK activation. Interestingly, a mutant form of Tax defective in IKK activation exhibited a markedly diminished level of NEMO/IKKgamma association. These findings suggest that the physical interaction of Tax with NEMO/IKKgamma may play an important role in Tax-mediated IKK activation.","['Harhaj, E W', 'Sun, S C']","['Harhaj EW', 'Sun SC']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, Pennsylvania 17033, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (CHUK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (IKBKB protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (IKBKE protein, human)']",IM,"['Catalytic Domain', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase', 'Mutation', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/08/07 00:00,1999/08/07 00:01,['1999/08/07 00:00'],"['1999/08/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/07 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/07 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.274.33.22911 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)65234-8 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1999 Aug 13;274(33):22911-4. doi: 10.1074/jbc.274.33.22911.,,,['1 R01 CA68471/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

Five of eight peptide-immunized sheep showed a high T-cell proliferative response to the BLV peptides and all of these were protected from the infection. The other three peptide-immunized sheep showed no T-cell proliferative responses to any BLV antigens similar to control sheep, though they also exhibited resistance to BLV challenge. To investigate other mechanisms which suppress BLV expansion in these non-responding sheep, we measured the levels of the cytokine expressions before, and after, BLV challenge using competitive reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain-reaction systems. It was revealed that the expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) was higher in BLV-resistant sheep than in BLV-susceptible sheep. Thus, TNFalpha expression rather than specific T-cell activity may play an important role in the protective mechanism against BLV infection, at least during the primary viremia phase.","['Kabeya, H', 'Ohashi, K', 'Oyunbileg, N', 'Nagaoka, Y', 'Aida, Y', 'Sugimoto, C', 'Yokomizo, Y', 'Onuma, M']","['Kabeya H', 'Ohashi K', 'Oyunbileg N', 'Nagaoka Y', 'Aida Y', 'Sugimoto C', 'Yokomizo Y', 'Onuma M']","['Department of Disease Control, Graduate School of Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Vet Immunol Immunopathol,Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,8002006,"['0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Vaccines)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cattle', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/immunology/*prevention & control/virology', 'Immunization/veterinary', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/isolation & purification/*physiology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptide Fragments/immunology', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/veterinary', 'Sheep', 'Sheep Diseases/immunology/*prevention & control/virology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/immunology', 'Viral Vaccines/*administration & dosage']",,1999/08/07 00:00,1999/08/07 00:01,['1999/08/07 00:00'],"['1999/08/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/07 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/07 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0165-2427(99)00029-X [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-2427(99)00029-x [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Immunol Immunopathol. 1999 May;68(2-4):255-65. doi: 10.1016/s0165-2427(99)00029-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytokines produced from macrophages infected by intracellular bacteria play a critical role in the expression of innate immune responses as well as in the subsequent triggering of protective acquired cell-mediated immunity. We followed the induction and secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin 1 alpha (IL-1alpha), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and interleukin 12 (IL-12) in the macrophage-like mouse cell line P388D1 during the initial phase of an in vitro infection by virulent C. burnetii Nine Mile. Secretion of IL-1alpha and TNF-alpha were observed within 3 h post-inoculation. IL-12, however, was not detected in cell supernatants. Two forms of C. burnetii exist, virulent phase I and avirulent phase II organisms. To determine whether the cytokine response was dependent on the form of C. burnetii, the induction of IL-1alpha and TNF-alpha in infected P388D1 cells was compared. Both cytokines were produced by macrophages early after infection with Phase I bacteria. A similar induction of TNF-alpha was observed after infection with the avirulent Phase II bacteria, but no IL-1alpha induction could be detected. As the only difference identified between the two forms of C. burnetii is the composition of their lipopolysaccharides (LPS), the ability of each of the purified LPS from the two variants to induce IL-1alpha was investigated. Purified C. burnetii LPS induced a moderate IL-1alpha response in comparison to that induced by the efficient stimulator E. coli LPS. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in action between Phase I and Phase II LPS preparations. We thus postulate that factors other than LPS differ between the two variants of C. burnetii, and these differences may account for differences in IL-1alpha induction.","['Tujulin, E', 'Lilliehook, B', 'Macellaro, A', 'Sjostedt, A', 'Norlander, L']","['Tujulin E', 'Lilliehook B', 'Macellaro A', 'Sjostedt A', 'Norlander L']","['Defence Research Establishment, Department of NBC Defence, Division of Microbiology, Umea, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Vet Immunol Immunopathol,Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,8002006,"['0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Coxiella burnetii/*physiology', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Interleukin-1/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia P388/*metabolism', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Macrophage Activation/drug effects', 'Macrophages/*metabolism/*microbiology', 'Mice', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*biosynthesis']",,1999/08/07 10:00,2000/02/19 09:00,['1999/08/07 10:00'],"['1999/08/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2000/02/19 09:00 [medline]', '1999/08/07 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0165-2427(99)00023-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-2427(99)00023-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Immunol Immunopathol. 1999 May;68(2-4):159-68. doi: 10.1016/s0165-2427(99)00023-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One approach for overcoming this problem is to develop methods of selecting and enriching the successfully transduced cells. We investigated the feasibility of using the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene as a selectable marker of hematopoietic cells. When M1 murine leukemia cells were electroporated with GFP expression vectors, a red-shifted mutant (S65T) GFP showed several-fold greater fluorescence than the wild-type GFP and generated readily detectable green light under control of SRalpha or CAG promoter. We then inserted an SRalpha-S65T GFP cassette into the MSCV retrovirus vector and established virus producer cells. Infection of primary murine bone marrow cells resulted in a distinct population with green fluorescence, which was separated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. The fractionated bright cells gave rise to fluorescent spleen colonies in lethally irradiated mice, while the fluorescence-negative cells yielded only dark colonies. These results indicated that GFP is a faithful marker in gene transfer into hematopoietic progenitor/stem cells, facilitating selection of the transduced cells and tracking of their progeny in vivo.","['Kume, A', 'Hashiyama, M', 'Suda, T', 'Ozawa, K']","['Kume A', 'Hashiyama M', 'Suda T', 'Ozawa K']","['Division of Genetic Therapeutics, Center for Molecular Medicine, Jichi Medical School, Kawachi-gun, Tochigi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescence', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cells/virology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', '*Luminescent Proteins/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', '*Retroviridae', 'Spleen/cytology', '*Transduction, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/08/07 00:00,1999/08/07 00:01,['1999/08/07 00:00'],"['1999/08/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/07 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/07 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/stem.170226 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 1999;17(4):226-32. doi: 10.1002/stem.170226.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we found that gamma-radiation-induced apoptosis of leukemia cells was associated with activation of multiple caspases and bax up-regulation. Membrane changes and caspase activities were suppressed by specific caspase inhibitors. Similarly, the serine protease inhibitors z-Ala-Ala-Asp-cmk (AAD) and tosyl-lysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK) also prevented caspase activation and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage in vivo but had no effect on caspase activity in vitro. TLCK also prevented bax up-regulation as a result of its inhibitory effect on p53 function. Inhibitors of caspases and serine proteases partially prevented cell death, suggesting a caspase involvement in Bax-mediated cell death. We propose an ordering of signaling events in Bax-mediated cell death, including steps upstream and downstream of p53 and bax up-regulation.","['Gong, B', 'Chen, Q', 'Endlich, B', 'Mazumder, S', 'Almasan, A']","['Gong B', 'Chen Q', 'Endlich B', 'Mazumder S', 'Almasan A']","['Department of Cancer Biology, Lerner Research Institute, The Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Ohio 44195, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell Growth Differ,Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9100024,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Serine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '2104-86-1 (Tosyllysine Chloromethyl Ketone)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis/genetics/physiology', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Gamma Rays', 'Humans', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Serine Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Serine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Tosyllysine Chloromethyl Ketone/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",,1999/08/07 00:00,1999/08/07 00:01,['1999/08/07 00:00'],"['1999/08/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/07 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/07 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Growth Differ. 1999 Jul;10(7):491-502.,,,['CA 81504/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

Among AML with hyperleukocytosis, M5 subtype was the most. Hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, DIC and CNSL were more frequent in hyperleukocytosis group. The complete remission rate was 41.4% for patients with hyperleukocytosis versus 54.2% for patients with non-hyperleukocytosis. The early mortality rate was significantly increased in hyperleukocytic patients (23.8%) as compared to the nonhyperleukocytic group (11.1%). Intracranial hemorrhage was the main cause of early death. The high risk factors of early death were: hemoglobin < or = 40 g/L, blood platelet < or = 30 x 10(9)/L, DIC, infection, CNSL at presentation. Acute leukemia with hyperleukocytosis has poor prognosis. Especially, acute myeloid leukemia with hyperleukocytosis must be taken seriously because of high early mortality rate.","['Wang, X', 'Lin, G', 'Wang, J']","['Wang X', 'Lin G', 'Wang J']",['Shanghai Huashan Hospital.'],['chi'],"['Clinical Trial', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",China,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua nei ke za zhi,16210490R,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'China', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies']",,1997/08/01 00:00,1999/08/07 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/07 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi. 1997 Aug;36(8):532-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study is to describe a cerebral angiitis-like syndrome after allogeneic BMT. METHODS: Clinical and diagnostic findings of 5 BMT patients with chronic graft versus host disease and neuropathological data of 1 patient were reported. RESULTS: In the described patients, focal neurological signs and neuropsychological abnormalities occurred years after BMT. MRI revealed periventricular white matter lesions, lacunar or territorial infarctions, leukoencephalopathy, and hemorrhages. Angiitis of the central nervous system was confirmed in 1 patient at autopsy, and an angiitis-like syndrome was suspected in the other patients because of the clinical course and response to treatment. Three patients received cyclophosphamide and steroids (2 improved, 1 died), 1 patient improved after steroids alone, and 1 patient without immunosuppressive therapy deteriorated further. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that an angiitis-like syndrome of the central nervous system can be a neurological manifestation of graft versus host disease, which should be considered a possible cause of cerebral ischemic episodes and pathological MRI scans in BMT patients with graft versus host disease.","['Padovan, C S', 'Bise, K', 'Hahn, J', 'Sostak, P', 'Holler, E', 'Kolb, H J', 'Straube, A']","['Padovan CS', 'Bise K', 'Hahn J', 'Sostak P', 'Holler E', 'Kolb HJ', 'Straube A']","['Department of Neurology, Klinikum Grobetahadern, Ludwig-Maximilians University, Munich, Germany. padovan@brain.nefo.med.uni-muenchen.de']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Stroke,Stroke,0235266,,IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Brain/*blood supply/diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Cerebral Angiography', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*complications/diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects', 'Vasculitis/diagnosis/*etiology']",,1999/08/06 00:00,1999/08/06 00:01,['1999/08/06 00:00'],"['1999/08/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/06 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1161/01.str.30.8.1651 [doi]'],ppublish,Stroke. 1999 Aug;30(8):1651-6. doi: 10.1161/01.str.30.8.1651.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hence the biochemical properties, the subcellular localization, and the role in endocytosis of a CALM protein were studied. In vitro binding and coimmunoprecipitation demonstrated that the clathrin heavy chain is the major binding partner of CALM. The bulk of cellular CALM was associated with the membrane fractions of the cell and localized to clathrin-coated areas of the plasma membrane. In the membrane fraction, CALM was present at near stoichiometric amounts relative to clathrin. To perform structure-function analysis of CALM, we engineered chimeric fusion proteins of CALM and its fragments with the green fluorescent protein (GFP). GFP-CALM was targeted to the plasma membrane-coated pits and also found colocalized with clathrin in the Golgi area. High levels of expression of GFP-CALM or its fragments with clathrin-binding activity inhibited the endocytosis of transferrin and epidermal growth factor receptors and altered the steady-state distribution of the mannose-6-phosphate receptor in the cell. In addition, GFP-CALM overexpression caused the loss of clathrin accumulation in the trans-Golgi network area, whereas the localization of the clathrin adaptor protein complex 1 in the trans-Golgi network remained unaffected. The ability of the GFP-tagged fragments of CALM to affect clathrin-mediated processes correlated with the targeting of the fragments to clathrin-coated areas and their clathrin-binding capacities. Clathrin-CALM interaction seems to be regulated by multiple contact interfaces. The C-terminal part of CALM binds clathrin heavy chain, although the full-length protein exhibited maximal ability for interaction. Altogether, the data suggest that CALM is an important component of coated pit internalization machinery, possibly involved in the regulation of clathrin recruitment to the membrane and/or the formation of the coated pit.","['Tebar, F', 'Bohlander, S K', 'Sorkin, A']","['Tebar F', 'Bohlander SK', 'Sorkin A']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Colorado Health Science Center, Denver, Colorado 80111, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Biol Cell,Molecular biology of the cell,9201390,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport)', '0 (Clathrin)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Monomeric Clathrin Assembly Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (PICALM protein, human)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (clathrin assembly protein AP180)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport', 'Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'COS Cells/metabolism', 'Clathrin/genetics/*metabolism', 'Coated Pits, Cell-Membrane/metabolism', 'Endocytosis/*physiology', 'Endosomes/metabolism', 'ErbB Receptors/metabolism', 'Golgi Apparatus/metabolism', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Humans', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Monomeric Clathrin Assembly Proteins', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",PMC25500,1999/08/06 00:00,1999/08/06 00:01,['1999/08/06 00:00'],"['1999/08/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/06 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1091/mbc.10.8.2687 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Biol Cell. 1999 Aug;10(8):2687-702. doi: 10.1091/mbc.10.8.2687.,,,"['P30 CA046934/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-46934/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK-46817/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

However, serum IL-12 concentration remained low. Three patients receiving DLT for EBV-LPD did not develop acute GVHD with no increase of IFN-gamma and IL-12 production. These results indicate that IL-12 may play an important role in the development of acute GVHD after allogeneic stem cell grafting or DLT, and increased IL-12 production by Mphi occurs with various stimuli, including LPS.","['Yabe, M', 'Yabe, H', 'Hattori, K', 'Shimizu, T', 'Matsumoto, M', 'Morimoto, T', 'Yasuda, Y', 'Inoue, H', 'Kato, S', 'Nishimura, T']","['Yabe M', 'Yabe H', 'Hattori K', 'Shimizu T', 'Matsumoto M', 'Morimoto T', 'Yasuda Y', 'Inoue H', 'Kato S', 'Nishimura T']","['Department of Pediatrics, Tokai University School of Medicine, Kanagawa, Isehara, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*etiology/immunology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis/blood/pharmacology/physiology', 'Interleukin-12/biosynthesis/blood/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Leukemia/blood/prevention & control', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Macrophages/metabolism', 'Male']",,1999/08/06 00:00,1999/08/06 00:01,['1999/08/06 00:00'],"['1999/08/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/06 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1701819 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1999 Jul;24(1):29-34. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1701819.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have failed to establish whether undernutrition is a common feature at diagnosis. METHODS: Body mass index (BMI, weight/height2), expressed as a standard deviation score (SDS) relative to contemporary United Kingdom reference data, was used as the index of nutritional status. The index was calculated in a national cohort of standard-risk patients (n = 1019) treated in the same protocol in the United Kingdom. RESULTS: Prevalence of undernutrition (defined as BMI SDS <-2.0) exceeded expected frequencies in boys (7.6%) and girls (6.7%). These differences were statistically significant (p < 0.001), with a 95% confidence interval for the prevalence of undernutrition of 5.8% to 9.0%. CONCLUSIONS: Undernutrition is relatively common in patients with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia, with a threefold excess of patients below the cutoff used to define undernutrition. Screening for undernutrition at diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia is indicated, and the BMI SDS is a simple index of nutritional status that could be readily calculated using measurements routinely made at diagnosis. The same simple screening technique could also be used clinically to detect and manage or prevent overnutrition (obesity), which is common in these patients after diagnosis.","['Reilly, J J', 'Weir, J', 'McColl, J H', 'Gibson, B E']","['Reilly JJ', 'Weir J', 'McColl JH', 'Gibson BE']","['Department of Human Nutrition, University of Glasgow, Yorkhill Hospitals, Scotland, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr,Journal of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition,8211545,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Body Mass Index', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Nutritional Status', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/diagnosis', 'Prevalence', 'Protein-Energy Malnutrition/diagnosis/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",,1999/08/06 00:00,1999/08/06 00:01,['1999/08/06 00:00'],"['1999/08/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/06 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00005176-199908000-00017 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr. 1999 Aug;29(2):194-7. doi: 10.1097/00005176-199908000-00017.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to clarify its molecular mechanism of action, we used the yeast two-hybrid system to screen for proteins that interact with A20. A cDNA fragment was isolated which encoded a portion of a novel protein (TXBP151), which was recently found to be a human T-cell leukemia virus type-I (HTLV-I) Tax-binding protein. The full-length 2386 bp TXBP151 mRNA encodes a protein of 86 kDa. Like A20, overexpression of TXBP151 could inhibit apoptosis induced by tumour necrosis factor (TNF) in NIH3T3 cells. Moreover, transfection of antisense TXBP151 partially abolished the anti-apoptotic effect of A20. Furthermore, apoptosis induced by TNF or CD95 (Fas/APO-1) was associated with proteolysis of TXBP151. This degradation could be inhibited by the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk or by expression of the cowpox virus-derived inhibitor CrmA, suggesting that TXBP151 is a novel substrate for caspase family members. TXBP151 was indeed found to be specifically cleaved in vitro by members of the caspase-3-like subfamily, viz. caspase-3, caspase-6 and caspase-7. Thus TXBP151 appears to be a novel A20-binding protein which might mediate the anti-apoptotic activity of A20, and which can be processed by specific caspases.","['De Valck, D', 'Jin, D Y', 'Heyninck, K', 'Van de Craen, M', 'Contreras, R', 'Fiers, W', 'Jeang, K T', 'Beyaert, R']","['De Valck D', 'Jin DY', 'Heyninck K', 'Van de Craen M', 'Contreras R', 'Fiers W', 'Jeang KT', 'Beyaert R']","['Department of Molecular Biology, Flanders Interuniversity Institute for Biotechnology and University of Gent, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Serpins)', '0 (TAX1BP1 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '96282-35-8 (interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme inhibitor)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (TNFAIP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha-Induced Protein 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Tnfaip3 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', '*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Base Sequence', 'Carrier Proteins/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Genes', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', '*Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Protein Binding', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Proteins/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/genetics', 'Serpins/physiology', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha-Induced Protein 3', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology', '*Viral Proteins', '*Zinc Fingers', 'fas Receptor/physiology']",,1999/08/06 00:00,1999/08/06 00:01,['1999/08/06 00:00'],"['1999/08/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/06 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1202787 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1999 Jul 22;18(29):4182-90. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1202787.,,['GENBANK/U33821'],,,,,,,,,,,

RA and interferons (IFNs) are known inhibitors of proliferation in various cells including those from APL. In this report, we show that they can act cooperatively to inhibit growth and to induce differentiation of NB4 cells but not of two RA-resistant NB4 derived cell lines, NB4-R1 and NB4-R2. However, the resistant cell lines respond to IFN. In NB4 cells, RA increases the expression of Stat1, p48 and IRF-1, three transcription factors playing a central role in the IFN response and induces the synthesis and the secretion of IFN alpha. RA-induced IFN alpha seems to play a role in inhibition of NB4 cell growth but not in their differentiation. In the resistant cells, NB4-R1 and NB4-R2, both the induction of IFN and the increase of Statl and p48 expression by RA are completely blocked. In contrast, IRF-1 mRNA and protein expressions are induced in the three cell lines. This suggests that increase of IRF-1 expression is not sufficient for IFN induction. Our results identify some defects linked to RA-resistance in APL and support the hypothesis that RA-induced Stat1 expression and IFN secretion may be one of the mechanisms mediating growth inhibition by RA.","['Pelicano, L', 'Brumpt, C', 'Pitha, P M', 'Chelbi-Alix, M K']","['Pelicano L', 'Brumpt C', 'Pitha PM', 'Chelbi-Alix MK']","['CNRS, UPR 9051, Hopital St. Louis, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (IRF1 protein, human)', '0 (IRF3 protein, human)', '0 (IRF9 protein, human)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factor-1)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factor-3)', '0 (Interferon-Stimulated Gene Factor 3)', '0 (Interferon-Stimulated Gene Factor 3, gamma Subunit)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Growth Inhibitors/physiology', 'Humans', 'Interferon Regulatory Factor-1', 'Interferon Regulatory Factor-3', 'Interferon-Stimulated Gene Factor 3', 'Interferon-Stimulated Gene Factor 3, gamma Subunit', 'Interferon-alpha/*biosynthesis/pharmacology/physiology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Phosphoproteins/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Trans-Activators/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/08/06 00:00,1999/08/06 00:01,['1999/08/06 00:00'],"['1999/08/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/06 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1202802 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1999 Jul 8;18(27):3944-53. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1202802.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The molecular mechanism of Tax-mediated trans-activation has been well investigated. However, trans-repression by Tax remains to be studied in detail, although it is known to require a specific DNA element such as E-box or p53 binding site. Examining possible mechanisms of trans-repression, we found that co-expression of E47 and p300 activated E-box dependent transcription and this activation was efficiently repressed by Tax. In this system, Tax bound to p300 and decreased the level of p300 complexed on the E-box element. Similarly, Tax inhibited transcription directed by p53 and CBP, reducing the level of CBP on the p53 binding site. These results indicate that Tax interferes with recruitment of CBP/p300 into protein complexes on E-box and p53 binding site through its binding to CBP/p300. In contrast to these findings, we observed that Tax increased the level of CBP on the viral 21-bp enhancer which is trans-activated by Tax. From these observations, we propose a universal mechanism for Tax-mediated trans-repression and trans-activation of transcription in which Tax binds to CBP/p300 and determines the accessibility of CBP/p300 to protein complexes on specific DNA element.","['Suzuki, T', 'Uchida-Toita, M', 'Yoshida, M']","['Suzuki T', 'Uchida-Toita M', 'Yoshida M']","['Department of Cellular and Molecular Biology, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/*physiology', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Genes, pX', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Nuclear Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', '*Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Trans-Activators/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic/*physiology', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism']",,1999/08/06 00:00,1999/08/06 00:01,['1999/08/06 00:00'],"['1999/08/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/06 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1202766 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1999 Jul 15;18(28):4137-43. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1202766.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We used an ISH technique using a multiple digoxigenin-incorporating probe, which was constructed by means of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from the 18S ribosomal RNA of Aspergillus fumigatus. MATERIALS: We studied twelve formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded lung tissue sections from autopsy-confirmed invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) (5 acute myelocytic leukemias, 2 acute lymphocytic leukemias, 2 chronic myelocytic leukemias, 1 adult T-cell leukemia, 1 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and 1 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.), and 18 sections from other pulmonary infections as control. RESULTS: ISH using the probe and a low-viscosity hybridization buffer solution (LV) positively stained hyphal elements in 12 of 12 autopsy lung tissue specimens from subjects with IPA, while ISH using the probe and a high viscosity hybridization buffer solution (HV) positively stained the hyphal elements in 6 of 12. Specifically, ISH (LV) demonstrates hyphal elements of Aspergillus spp. in the center of Aspergillus abscess. While, ISH (HV) can detect hyphal elements located in the periphery of a suppurative abscess as well as those in the blood vessel. Conversely, ISH did not show positive results for any of the autopsy tissue specimens from subjects with other fungal pneumonia infections (Candida n=5, Mucor n=2, Cryptococcus n=2, and Pseudallescheria n=1), Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (n=5), and cytomegalovirus pneumonia (n=3). Dual staining by means of ISH and immunohistochemistry (IHC) using anti-neutrophil elastase (NE) and anti-CD68 monoclonal antibodies showed that NE positive cells were localized at the edge of the radial growth of the organism, but CD68 positive cells were located around the center of the abscess. The accumulation of NE positive cells was rarely seen in half of the cases (6/12). In contrast, CD68 positive cells were routinely present in the center of the abscess (12/12). CONCLUSION: ISH in conjunction with IHC is a useful tool for differentiating Aspergillus spp. from other fungal genera in tissue sections from patients with IPA and may have a certain role in the evaluation of the interactions between organisms and recruiting inflammatory cells.","['Kobayashi, M', 'Sonobe, H', 'Ikezoe, T', 'Hakoda, E', 'Ohtsuki, Y', 'Taguchi, H']","['Kobayashi M', 'Sonobe H', 'Ikezoe T', 'Hakoda E', 'Ohtsuki Y', 'Taguchi H']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Kochi Medical School, Nankoku.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Intern Med,"Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)",9204241,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (RNA, Fungal)', '0 (RNA, Ribosomal, 18S)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aspergillosis/*diagnosis/*microbiology', 'Aspergillus fumigatus/genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization/*methods', 'Lung Diseases, Fungal/*diagnosis/*microbiology', 'RNA, Fungal/*genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 18S/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Staining and Labeling/methods', 'Viscosity']",,1999/08/06 00:00,1999/08/06 00:01,['1999/08/06 00:00'],"['1999/08/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/06 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.2169/internalmedicine.38.563 [doi]'],ppublish,Intern Med. 1999 Jul;38(7):563-9. doi: 10.2169/internalmedicine.38.563.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: These blasts were analyzed for morphologic, karyotypic, immunophenotypic, and immunogenotypic features using Southern blot and polymerase chain reaction analysis. MATERIALS: Peripheral blood, bone marrow aspirates, or biopsied mediastinal tumor specimens of three CD56+CD7+ stem cell leukemia/lymphoma patients were investigated. RESULTS: The bone marrow of all patients showed myeloperoxidase (MPO) negative blast cells with basophilic cytoplasm and distinct nucleoli with no azurophilic granules. The blasts of two patients were classified as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (L2). The liver, spleen, and lymph nodes were unaffected in all patients. All had an aggressive clinical course. The blasts were strongly positive for both CD7 and CD56 but negative for other T-lineage associated antigens, including CD1, CD2, surface membrane CD3, cytoplasmic CD3c (2/2), CD4, CD5 and CD8. The additional antigens were recognized as follows: CD19 (1/3 cases) as a B lineage, CD33 (1/3) as a myeloid marker, CD34 (2/3) as a stem cell, CD38 (1/1) and HLA-DR (2/3). When the patients relapsed, the phenotypes changed to blasts positive for CD5, CD10 and CD13 in patient 1, CD5 in patient 2, and CD33 in patient 3. MPO, however, remained negative. Cytogenetic analysis showed no common abnormal karyotype. All had a common D2-Jdelta1 induced by T-cell specific enhancer. Rearrangement of TCR beta and gamma genes occurred in patient 2, and IgH and TCR beta underwent rearrangement in patient 3. CONCLUSION: Although a more comprehensive case analysis is necessary, these data suggest the possibility that the blasts of the present cases come from a common lymphoid precursor (T, NK, and B cell) or from a NKT precursor as the fourth lymphoid lineage.","['Yoshida, T', 'Kimura, N', 'Sawada, H', 'Suematsu, E', 'Nagano, M', 'Akiyoshi, T', 'Motomura, S', 'Kikuchi, M', 'Nishimura, J', 'Tamura, K']","['Yoshida T', 'Kimura N', 'Sawada H', 'Suematsu E', 'Nagano M', 'Akiyoshi T', 'Motomura S', 'Kikuchi M', 'Nishimura J', 'Tamura K']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Fukuoka University School of Medicine.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Intern Med,"Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)",9204241,"['0 (Antigens, CD7)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (DNA Primers)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD7/*metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', 'Base Sequence', 'CD56 Antigen/*metabolism', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', 'Gene Rearrangement, beta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', '*Gene Rearrangement, delta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Gene Rearrangement, gamma-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology/pathology', 'Leukemia/*genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*immunology/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology']",,1999/08/06 00:00,1999/08/06 00:01,['1999/08/06 00:00'],"['1999/08/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/06 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/06 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Intern Med. 1999 Jul;38(7):547-55.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Adenoviruses have many advantages as vectors, but remain poorly efficient in cells lacking fiber receptors. A promising strategy is the retargeting of adenoviruses to other cellular receptors. We report the dramatic enhancement of gene transfer efficiency in AML blasts using AdZ.F(pK7), a modified adenovirus containing a heparin/heparan sulfate binding domain incorporated into the fiber protein of the adenovirus. We transduced 25 AML blast samples with efficiency reaching 100% of the cells in most samples. Optimal results were obtained at 8400 physical particles per cell, corresponding to a multiplicity of infection of 100 plaque forming units per cell. Control AdZ.F adenovirus efficiently transduced leukemic cell lines but gave poor results in AML samples. Both addition of soluble heparin and cell treatment with heparinase inhibited AdZ.F(pK7) gene transfer, showing that heparan sulfates are the major receptors mediating AdZ.F(pK7) transduction of AML blasts. Although adenoviruses can infect nondividing cells, we observed that a combination of growth factors (GM-CSF, IL-3, stem cell factor) was required for efficient transduction in order to maintain AML blast cell viability. This study demonstrates that retargeting the adenovirus fiber protein to heparan sulfates can overcome the low efficiency of adenovirus in AML blast cells and may provide a useful tool for gene therapy approaches in AML.","['Gonzalez, R', 'Vereecque, R', 'Wickham, T J', 'Vanrumbeke, M', 'Kovesdi, I', 'Bauters, F', 'Fenaux, P', 'Quesnel, B']","['Gonzalez R', 'Vereecque R', 'Wickham TJ', 'Vanrumbeke M', 'Kovesdi I', 'Bauters F', 'Fenaux P', 'Quesnel B']","['INSERM U124, IRCL, Lille, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Gene Ther,Gene therapy,9421525,"['0 (Capsid Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (hexon capsid protein, Adenovirus)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '9005-49-6 (Heparin)', '9050-30-0 (Heparitin Sulfate)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adenoviridae/*genetics', 'Capsid/*genetics', '*Capsid Proteins', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Heparin/pharmacology', 'Heparitin Sulfate/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*therapy', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology', 'Transfection/*methods', 'beta-Galactosidase/genetics']",,1999/08/06 00:00,1999/08/06 00:01,['1999/08/06 00:00'],"['1999/08/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/06 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.gt.3300836 [doi]'],ppublish,Gene Ther. 1999 Mar;6(3):314-20. doi: 10.1038/sj.gt.3300836.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pilot study in 17 patients].,567-70,"PURPOSE: Though thalidomide in a dosage of 100 mg/day is the standard treatment for recurrent oral and genital ulcers (OGU), its toxicity would be less important with lower dosage, while its efficacy would be identical. Furthermore, duration of treatment might be a major risk factor for the development of subsequent polyneuropathy. To determine the dosage of thalidomide leading to the best efficacy/toxicity ratio, a pilot study was conducted from 1993 to 1996. METHODS: Seventeen patients with OGU (mean age: 43 years, sex-ratio: 12:5) were included in the study and presented either recurrent oral ulcerations (8 patients), oro-genital ulcerations (3 patients), Behcet disease (4 patients), or recurrent OGU associated with leukemia (2 patients). The initial dosage of thalidomide was 50 mg/day (1 tablet) for 1 month. If the patient's condition improved, the dosage was reduced to one tablet every other day for 1 month and one tablet every 3 days thereafter. Nerve conduction studies (EMG) were performed at inclusion in the study and every 6 months thereafter. RESULTS: Among the 17 patients, remission was observed in ten patients within the first month of treatment and the condition of seven patients improved. Complete remission was observed in six patients after a 2-month treatment and in one patient after 4 months. A 200-mg/8 days dosage induced prolonged remission in 12 patients. Among them, ten patients received a 150-mg dosage over 8 days thereafter and disease relapsed in four of them. Among the six patients who received a 100-mg dosage over 8 days, only one relapse was observed. EMG showed a decrease in sensory nerve action potentials in six patients after 8 months and a half on average. Only three patients had to discontinue their treatment due to the occurrence of either paresthesia (2 patients) or areflexia (1 patient). Our study shows that initially a 50-mg/day dose is efficacious in the treatment of OGU and that administration of one tablet every 2 or 3 days is efficacious in more than 60% of the patients to maintain remission. CONCLUSION: A dosage of 50 mg/day is initially efficacious in most cases, provided that the patient is carefully followed up to allow early detection of potential peripheral neuropathy.","['de Wazieres, B', 'Gil, H', 'Magy, N', 'Berthier, S', 'Vuitton, D A', 'Dupond, J L']","['de Wazieres B', 'Gil H', 'Magy N', 'Berthier S', 'Vuitton DA', 'Dupond JL']","['Service de medecine interne, hopital Jean-Minjoz, CHU, Besancon, France.']",['fre'],"['Clinical Trial', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Rev Med Interne,La Revue de medecine interne,8101383,"['0 (Dermatologic Agents)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Behcet Syndrome/complications', 'Dermatologic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Genital Diseases, Female/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Genital Diseases, Male/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Oral Ulcer/*drug therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Thalidomide/*therapeutic use', 'Ulcer/*drug therapy/etiology']",,1999/08/06 00:00,1999/08/06 00:01,['1999/08/06 00:00'],"['1999/08/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/06 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/06 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0248866399801052 [pii]', '10.1016/s0248-8663(99)80105-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Rev Med Interne. 1999 Jul;20(7):567-70. doi: 10.1016/s0248-8663(99)80105-2.,,,,,,Traitement de l'aphtose recurrente par thalidomide a faible dose.

We report our investigations to assess residual levels of translocation using a FISH probe designed to detect a gene split by the translocation. We used MLL (Oncor), a probe which spans the MLL gene at 11q23, in both metaphase and interphase preparations. At diagnosis, metaphase FISH showed 3 distinct cell lines-normal with 2 signals, abnormal with 3 signals and abnormal with 2 signals, while interphase FISH showed only 2 cell lines, one with 2 signals (which could be normal or abnormal) and one with 3 signals (split MLL). Following treatment, with the patient in clinical remission, 7 further cytogenetic analyses and 2 further FISH analyses were compared.

By appropriate chemical manipulation, specific human cancers, such as human melanoma, leukemia and neuroblastoma, can be induced to lose growth potential irreversibly and terminally differentiate. Treatment of HO-1 human melanoma cells with a combination of recombinant human fibroblast interferon (IFN-beta) and the antileukemic compound mezerein (MEZ) results in irreversible growth arrest, a suppression in tumorigenic properties and terminal cell differentiation. A potential mechanism underlying these profound changes in cancer cell physiology is the activation of genes that can suppress the cancer phenotype and/or the inactivation of genes that promote the cancer state. To define the repertoire of genes modulated as a consequence of induction of growth arrest and terminal differentiation in human melanoma cells, we are using a differentiation induction subtraction hybridization (DISH) approach. A subtracted cDNA library, differentiation inducer treated cDNAs minus uninduced cDNAs, was constructed that uses temporally spaced mRNAs isolated from HO-1 cells treated with IFN-beta+MEZ. Approximately 400 random clones were isolated from the subtracted DISH library and analyzed by reverse Northern and Northern blotting approaches. These strategies resulted in the identification and cloning of both 30 known and 26 novel cDNAs displaying elevated expression in human melanoma cells induced to growth arrest and terminally differentiate by treatment with IFN-beta+MEZ. The DISH scheme and the genes presently identified using this approach should provide a framework for delineating the molecular basis of growth regulation, expression of the transformed phenotype and differentiation in melanoma and other cancers.","['Huang, F', 'Adelman, J', 'Jiang, H', 'Goldstein, N I', 'Fisher, P B']","['Huang F', 'Adelman J', 'Jiang H', 'Goldstein NI', 'Fisher PB']","['GenQuest Incorporated, New York, NY 10032, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Gene,Gene,7706761,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Terpenes)', '34807-41-5 (mezerein)', '77238-31-4 (Interferon-beta)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*genetics', 'Cell Division/drug effects/*genetics', 'Cloning, Molecular/*methods', 'DNA, Complementary/analysis', '*Diterpenes', 'Gene Library', 'Humans', 'Interferon-beta/pharmacology', 'Melanoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization/*methods', 'Terpenes/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/08/06 00:00,1999/08/06 00:01,['1999/08/06 00:00'],"['1999/08/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/06 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/06 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0378-1119(99)00244-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0378-1119(99)00244-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene. 1999 Aug 5;236(1):125-31. doi: 10.1016/s0378-1119(99)00244-9.,,,['CA35675/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

Increase in bone mass precedes lymphomagenesis.,557-70,"Newborn NMRI strain mice were infected with Reilly-Finkel-Biskis (RFB) murine leukemia virus (MuLV), a murine leukemia virus that has been shown to induce lymphomas, osteosclerosis, and osteomas in susceptible strains of mice. Bone histomorphometry of the distal femoral metaphyses at 3-month intervals showed osteosclerosis 3 (100%), 6 (100%), and 9 (93%) months after infection. This was represented by significantly augmented cancellous bone mass and accompanied by distinct changes in bone architecture. High numbers of provirus copies were detected at 2-4 weeks in femora, humeri, and calvaria, and viral protein was highly expressed in trabecular and cortical bone cells, particularly in osteocytes. Infected mice showed enhanced bone formation and smaller numbers of osteoclasts relative to sex- and age-matched controls. Osteoclastic differentiation was significantly reduced in cocultures of spleen or bone marrow cells with RFB MuLV-infected osteoclastogenic, osteoblast-like cells. However, RFB MuLV did not impair the activity of mature osteoclasts. In infected mice lymphomas were only observed at 6 (22%) and 9 months (40%) of age. At 3 months, IgG gene and TCR-beta gene rearrangements were not detectable, and new proviruses showed a heterogeneous integration pattern, indicating the absence of lymphoma in early osteosclerotic mice. In contrast, lymphomas, which developed in 8- to 9-month-old infected mice, showed IgG rearrangements indicating development of B-cell lymphomas, together with mono- or oligoclonal expansion of distinct patterns of proviral integrations. These results indicate that RFB MuLV-induced osteosclerosis develops within 3 months after infection and precedes lymphomagenesis. It may therefore be considered an independent skeletal lesion in MuLV-infected mice.","['Schmidt, J', 'Lumniczky, K', 'Tzschaschel, B D', 'Guenther, H L', 'Luz, A', 'Riemann, S', 'Gimbel, W', 'Erfle, V', 'Erben, R G']","['Schmidt J', 'Lumniczky K', 'Tzschaschel BD', 'Guenther HL', 'Luz A', 'Riemann S', 'Gimbel W', 'Erfle V', 'Erben RG']","['Institute of Molecular Virology, GSF-National Research Center for Environment and Health, Neuherberg, Germany. schmidt@gsf.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/pharmacology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Femur/pathology', 'Hindlimb/diagnostic imaging', 'Humerus/pathology', 'Immunohistochemistry', '*Leukemia Virus, Murine', 'Lymphoma/*complications', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Osteoclasts/metabolism', 'Osteosclerosis/metabolism/*pathology/*virology', 'Radiography', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/analysis', 'Sex Factors', 'Skull/pathology', 'Spleen/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tissue Distribution']",PMC1866854,1999/08/06 00:00,1999/08/06 00:01,['1999/08/06 00:00'],"['1999/08/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/06 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/06 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0002-9440(10)65151-6 [pii]', '10.1016/S0002-9440(10)65151-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Pathol. 1999 Aug;155(2):557-70. doi: 10.1016/S0002-9440(10)65151-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An improved method for detecting clonal B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders.,355-63,"The clonal determination of B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders by immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) rearrangement by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is widely used. However, few attempts have been made to detect immunoglobulin kappa light chain (Igkappa) gene rearrangement using PCR. We studied 145 cases of B-cell neoplasms, along with 58 atypical and 18 reactive lymphoproliferative disorders, using newly designed degenerate oligoprimers recognizing the framework 3 (FR3kappa) and the joint (Jkappa) regions of the Igkappa gene. PCR products were analyzed on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (ndPAGE). Clonal B-cell determination was further investigated using IgH rearrangement and t(11:14) or t(14:18). By combining these methods, we detected either clonality or translocation in 117 of 137 cases (85%) in mature B-cell neoplasms. The additional analysis of Igkappa rearrangement improved sensitivity from 66% to 85%. To investigate whether the Ig gene configuration could be characterized using Igkappa PCR in B-cell neoplasms showing severe breakdown of genomic DNA, 18 selected cases were analyzed. Successful amplification was detected in 72% of the cases using either FR3/2-JH and/or FR3Jkappa oligoprimers. Finally, clonality was detected in 21 of 58 atypical B-cell proliferations, and among them, the atypical marginal cell (54%) and atypical large cell (50%) proliferations showed the highest frequency of clonal immunoglobulin gene products. We concluded that PCR/ndPAGE analysis of Igkappa is a sensitive, rapid, and efficient method for assessing clonality in conjunction with IgH and specific translocation analysis. This approach is particularly useful in the characterization of B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders in archival material with poor preservation of the genomic DNA.","['Gong, J Z', 'Zheng, S', 'Chiarle, R', 'De Wolf-Peeters, C', 'Palestro, G', 'Frizzera, G', 'Inghirami, G']","['Gong JZ', 'Zheng S', 'Chiarle R', 'De Wolf-Peeters C', 'Palestro G', 'Frizzera G', 'Inghirami G']","['Division of Hematopathology/Molecular Pathology Laboratory, Department of Pathology, Kaplan Comprehensive Cancer Center, New York, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,,IM,"['Clone Cells', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Light Chain', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/immunology', 'Lymph Nodes/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma/genetics/immunology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC1866846,1999/08/06 00:00,1999/08/06 00:01,['1999/08/06 00:00'],"['1999/08/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/06 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/06 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0002-9440(10)65132-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0002-9440(10)65132-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Pathol. 1999 Aug;155(2):355-63. doi: 10.1016/s0002-9440(10)65132-2.,,,"['CA14462/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA64033/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA66229/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

Transgenic studies have characterised spatially distinct 5' enhancers which direct lacZ expression to subdomains of the normal SCL expression pattern, but the same elements failed to produce appropriate haematopoietic expression. We now describe an SCL 3' enhancer with unique properties. It directed lacZ expression in transgenic mice to extra-embryonic mesoderm and subsequently to both endothelial cells and to a subset of blood cells at multiple sites of embryonic haematopoiesis including the yolk sac, para-aortic splanchnopleura and AGM region. The 3' enhancer also targeted expression to haematopoietic progenitors in both foetal liver and adult bone marrow. Purified lacZ(+ )cells were highly enriched for clonogenic myeloid and erythroid progenitors as well as day-12 spleen colony forming units (CFU-S). Within the total gated population from bone marrow, 95% of the myeloid and 90% of the erythroid colony-forming cells were contained in the lacZ(+) fraction, as were 98% of the CFU-S. Activation of the enhancer did not require SCL protein. On the contrary, transgene expression in yolk sacs was markedly increased in an SCL-/- background, suggesting that SCL is subject to negative autoregulation. Alternatively the SCL-/- environment may alter differentiation of extra-embryonic mesoderm and result in an increased number of cells capable of expressing high levels of the transgene. Our data represents the first description of an enhancer that integrates information necessary for expression in developing endothelium and early haematopoietic progenitors at distinct times and sites throughout ontogeny. This enhancer provides a potent tool for the manipulation of haematopoiesis and vasculogenesis in vivo.","['Sanchez, M', 'Gottgens, B', 'Sinclair, A M', 'Stanley, M', 'Begley, C G', 'Hunter, S', 'Green, A R']","['Sanchez M', 'Gottgens B', 'Sinclair AM', 'Stanley M', 'Begley CG', 'Hunter S', 'Green AR']","['University of Cambridge, Department of Haematology, MRC Centre, Hills Road, Cambridge CB2 2QH, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Development,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Endothelium, Vascular/*embryology/growth & development', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Helix-Loop-Helix Motifs/*genetics', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Lac Operon', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Pregnancy', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Yolk Sac/embryology']",,1999/08/06 00:00,1999/08/06 00:01,['1999/08/06 00:00'],"['1999/08/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/06 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/06 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Development. 1999 Sep;126(17):3891-904.,,,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,

The combination of immunostimulatory agents with antiviral drugs alters the course of murine retroviral infections. Previously, it was demonstrated that in vitro treatment of noninfected splenocytes and in vivo treatment of Friend leukemia virus (FLV)-infected mice with the combination of azidothymidine (AZT) and methionine enkephalin (MENK) significantly increases Type 1 cytokine levels and decreases Type 2 cytokines compared with treatment with only AZT. In order to study the effect of the time of initiation of immunomodulation on the course of retroviral infections, we examined the kinetics of cytokine production by isolated splenocytes from infected mice. BALB/c mice were infected with FLV, and spleen cells were removed at specified times postinfection (days 1, 3, 7, 10, and 14). Interleukin (IL)-2, interferon (IFN-gamma, IL-4, and IL-10 production by unstimulated or ConA-stimulated splenocytes treated in vitro with AZT, MENK, or AZT + MENK was determined after 48 h. The capacity of the isolated splenocytes to produce the Type 1 cytokines IL-2 and IFN-gamma in response to stimulation with ConA and combination therapy decreased over the course of infection. These results suggest that MENK treatment initiated later in the course of infection is unable to modulate the cytokine profile and would likely be ineffective in altering the course of FLV induced-disease. The results indicate the necessity to initiate antiretroviral therapy early in infection. Such information may be applicable in designing future regimens for HIV-1 infections in humans.","['Kang, L C', 'Kerben, M J', 'Ugen, K E', 'Specter, S C']","['Kang LC', 'Kerben MJ', 'Ugen KE', 'Specter SC']","['Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, University of South Florida, College of Medicine, Tampa 33612, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,DNA Cell Biol,DNA and cell biology,9004522,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)', '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)', '58569-55-4 (Enkephalin, Methionine)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Concanavalin A/pharmacology', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis', 'Enkephalin, Methionine/therapeutic use', 'Female', '*Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-2/biosynthesis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Retroviridae Infections/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Spleen/immunology/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Zidovudine/therapeutic use']",,1999/08/05 00:00,1999/08/05 00:01,['1999/08/05 00:00'],"['1999/08/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/05 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/104454999315132 [doi]'],ppublish,DNA Cell Biol. 1999 Jul;18(7):585-92. doi: 10.1089/104454999315132.,,,['DA-10161/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

Many of them become harmful only if they remain undetected, ultimately resulting in injury to the patient. Errors with cytotoxic drugs are especially dangerous because of the highly toxic potential of the drugs involved. For medico-legal reasons, only 1 case of accidental iatrogenic intoxication by cytotoxic drugs tends to be investigated at a time, because the focus is placed on individual responsibility rather than on system errors. The aim of our study was to investigate whether accidental iatrogenic intoxications by cytotoxic drugs are faults of either the individual or the system. The statistical analysis of distribution and quality of such errors, and the in-depth analysis of contributing factors delivered a rational basis for the development of practical preventive strategies. METHODS: A total of 134 cases of accidental iatrogenic intoxication by a cytotoxic drug (from literature reports since 1966 identified by an electronic literature survey, as well as our own unpublished cases) underwent a systematic error analysis based on a 2-dimensional model of error generation. Incidents were classified by error characteristics and point in time of occurrence, and their distribution was statistically evaluated. The theories of error research, informatics, sensory physiology, cognitive psychology, occupational medicine and management have helped to classify and depict potential sources of error as well as reveal clues for error prevention. RESULTS: Monocausal errors were the exception. In the majority of cases, a confluence of unfavourable circumstances either brought about the error, or prevented its timely interception. Most cases with a fatal outcome involved erroneous drug administration. Object-inherent factors were the predominant causes. A lack of expert as well as general knowledge was a contributing element. In error detection and prevention of error sequelae, supervision and back-checking are essential. Improvement of both the individual training and work environment, enhanced object identification by manufacturers and hospitals, increased redundancy, proper usage of technical aids, and restructuring of systems are the hallmarks for error prevention. CONCLUSIONS: Errors follow general patterns even in oncology. Complex interdependencies of contributing factors are the rule. Thus, system changes of the working environment are most promising with regard to error prevention. Effective error control involves adapting a set of basic principles to the specific work environment. The work environment should allow for rectification of errors without penalty. Regular and ongoing intra-organisational error analysis needs to be an integral part of any error prevention strategy. However, it seems impossible to totally eliminate errors. Instead, if the environment guarantees timely error interception, most sequelae are avoided, and errors transform into a system-wide learning tool.","['Zernikow, B', 'Michel, E', 'Fleischhack, G', 'Bode, U']","['Zernikow B', 'Michel E', 'Fleischhack G', 'Bode U']","[""Department of Paediatric Heamatology/Oncology, University Children's Hospital, Bonn, Germany.

There is increasing evidence, however, that oral phytomenadione prophylaxis is less effective for the prevention of late vitamin K deficiency bleeding (VKDB) than intramuscular prophylaxis. Following a report of an increased cancer risk after intramuscular phytomenadione, a series of papers on this issue appeared. Although an increased risk for solid tumours could almost certainly be excluded, a potential risk for acute lymphatic leukaemia in childhood could not be ruled out definitively. Almost all cases of late VKDB are preventable with intramuscular phytomenadione prophylaxis administered once at birth, whereas a single oral dose given at birth is much less effective. Repeated oral phytomenadione doses given to breast-fed infants either weekly (1 mg) or daily (25 microg) seem to be as effective as intramuscular phytomenadione prophylaxis. The efficacy of 3 oral 2mg doses with the new mixed micellar preparation ('Konakion MM') remains to be established. Although a number of studies have failed to confirm a cancer risk with phytomenadione, these studies have been unable to rule out a risk definitely because absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. A meta-analysis of the available studies might provide 95% confidence intervals narrow enough to exclude even a small cancer risk with some certainty. Oral prophylaxis will probably be as safe as the intramuscular prophylaxis if given daily (25 microg) or weekly (1 mg).","['von Kries, R']",['von Kries R'],"['Department of Epidemiology, Institute for Social Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munchen, Germany. ag.epi@lrz.uni-muenchen.de']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",New Zealand,Drug Saf,Drug safety,9002928,"['0 (Antifibrinolytic Agents)', '84-80-0 (Vitamin K 1)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Antifibrinolytic Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Blood Coagulation Disorders/*prevention & control', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intramuscular', 'Vitamin K 1/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Vitamin K Deficiency/*prevention & control']",,1999/08/05 00:00,1999/08/05 00:01,['1999/08/05 00:00'],"['1999/08/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/05 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.2165/00002018-199921010-00001 [doi]'],ppublish,Drug Saf. 1999 Jul;21(1):1-6. doi: 10.2165/00002018-199921010-00001.,,,,33,,,,,,,,,

The authors investigated the correlation of infusion schedules with MTX penetration into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), tumor response, and survival to develop a regimen that would lead to better clinical results. METHODS: In this study, 100 mg/kg MTX was administered on either a rapid (3-hour) or regular (6-hour) infusion schedule for two or three cycles. Of 28 assessable patients, a complete or partial response was achieved in 15 (93.8%) of 16 who received rapid and in seven (58.3%) of 12 who received regular infusion therapy (p = 0.034). Rapid infusion significantly increased levels of MTX in the CSF (p < 0.001) and resulted in significant tumor volume reduction (p < 0.001). The mean tumor volume after the first, second, and third cycle of rapid infusion therapy was reduced to 34%, 14%, and 9%, respectively, of the initial volume, whereas the corresponding values were 54%, 42%, and 37% for regular infusion. The reduction between the second and third cycle was small and not significant for either schedule. Despite the longer median survival time in patients who underwent rapid MTX infusion and irradiation (> 60 compared with 20 months), the difference in survival was not significant (p = 0.147) because of the small number of patients enrolled. The median survival time was 39.3 months for all assessable patients who received high-dose MTX and radiation therapy, and the median relapse-free survival time was 35.2 months. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid infusion enhanced both MTX penetration into the CSF and tumor response and may improve patient survival. Administration of three or more cycles of therapy should be carefully weighed in terms of cytoreductive benefits.","['Hiraga, S', 'Arita, N', 'Ohnishi, T', 'Kohmura, E', 'Yamamoto, K', 'Oku, Y', 'Taki, T', 'Sato, M', 'Aozasa, K', 'Yoshimine, T']","['Hiraga S', 'Arita N', 'Ohnishi T', 'Kohmura E', 'Yamamoto K', 'Oku Y', 'Taki T', 'Sato M', 'Aozasa K', 'Yoshimine T']","['Department of Neurosurgery, Osaka University Medical School, Suita, Japan. shiraga@nsurg.med.osakau.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Neurosurg,Journal of neurosurgery,0253357,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/adverse effects/cerebrospinal fluid/*therapeutic use', 'Brain Neoplasms/*drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Cranial Irradiation', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Dose Fractionation, Radiation', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Karnofsky Performance Status', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/adverse effects/cerebrospinal fluid/*therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Radiotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",,1999/08/05 00:00,1999/08/05 00:01,['1999/08/05 00:00'],"['1999/08/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/05 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3171/jns.1999.91.2.0221 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurosurg. 1999 Aug;91(2):221-30. doi: 10.3171/jns.1999.91.2.0221.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro models of osteoclastogenesis are well established in animal species; however, such assays do not necessarily reflect human osteoclastogenesis. We sought to establish a reproducible coculture model of human osteoclastogenesis using highly purified human marrow-derived MSCs (hMSCs) and CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). After 3 weeks, coculture of hMSCs and HSCs resulted in an increase in hematopoietic cell number with formation of multinucleated osteoclast-like cells (Ocls). Coculture of hMSCs with HSCs, transduced with a retroviral vector that expresses enhanced green fluorescent protein, produced enhanced green fluorescent protein+ Ocls, further demonstrating that Ocls arise from HSCs. These Ocls express calcitonin and vitronectin receptors and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase and possess the ability to resorb bone. Ocl formation in this assay is cell contact dependent and is independent of added exogenous factors. Conditioned medium from the coculture contained high levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-11, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and macrophage-colony stimulating factor. IL-6 and LIF were present at low levels in cultures of hMSCs but undetectable in cultures of HSCs alone. These data suggest that coculture with HSCs induce hMSCs to secrete cytokines involved in Ocl formation. Addition of neutralizing anti-IL-6, IL-11, LIF, or macrophage-colony stimulating factor antibodies to the coculture inhibited Ocl formation. hMSCs seem to support Ocl formation as undifferentiated progenitor cells, because treatment of hMSCs with dexamethasone, ascorbic acid, and beta-glycerophosphate (to induce osteogenic differentiation) actually inhibited osteoclastogenesis in this coculture model. In conclusion, we have developed a simple and reproducible assay using culture-expanded hMSCs and purified HSCs with which to study the mechanisms of human osteoclastogenesis.","['Mbalaviele, G', 'Jaiswal, N', 'Meng, A', 'Cheng, L', 'Van Den Bos, C', 'Thiede, M']","['Mbalaviele G', 'Jaiswal N', 'Meng A', 'Cheng L', 'Van Den Bos C', 'Thiede M']","['Osiris Therapeutics, Inc., Baltimore, Maryland 21231-3043, USA. gmbalaviele@osiristx.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Acid Phosphatase)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Tartrate-Resistant Acid Phosphatase)']",IM,"['Acid Phosphatase/analysis', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*cytology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/analysis', 'Kidney', 'Mesoderm/cytology/*physiology', 'Osteoclasts/*cytology/physiology', 'Stem Cells/cytology/*physiology', 'Tartrate-Resistant Acid Phosphatase']",,1999/08/05 00:00,1999/08/05 00:01,['1999/08/05 00:00'],"['1999/08/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/05 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/endo.140.8.6880 [doi]'],ppublish,Endocrinology. 1999 Aug;140(8):3736-43. doi: 10.1210/endo.140.8.6880.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to evaluate the occurrence of 6q27 deletion in chronic lymphatic leukemia (CLL) and multiple myeloma (MM). 6q27 deletion was detected in 21% of patients with CLL and in 28% of patients with MM. The percentage of cells containing deletions ranged between 25-49. Two patients with MM had progressive disease and the aberration was detected in both.

The accurate detection of this chromosomal rearrangement is vital due to its association with a favorable prognosis. Variant translocations exist; these may be hidden within an unusual or complex karyotype. In such cases, it is often difficult to confirm the presence of t(8;21)(q22;q22) by conventional cytogenetic analysis alone. The molecular detection of the AML1/ETO fusion gene is possible by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or dual-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using probes specific for AML1 and ETO. Four cases of AML M2, with unusual or complex structural chromosomal abnormalities, without cytogenetic evidence of the classical t(8;21)(q22;q22), were studied by FISH. Two were AML1/ETO positive by RT-PCR, one showed a rearrangement by AML1 by Southern analysis, and the fourth had morphological features characteristic of t(8;21). The FISH results showed a co-localization of one AML1 and one ETO signal in interphase and metaphase nuclei in all four cases, demonstrating the presence of variant t(8;21)(q22;q22) rearrangements. Therefore, FISH analysis with the AML1 and ETO probes is extremely valuable, in cases of AML M2, because of its ability to reveal masked t(8;21)(q22;q22) translocations and thus quickly confirm the diagnosis, allowing patients to be assigned to the correct risk group in terms of treatment.","['Harrison, C J', 'Radford-Weiss, I', 'Ross, F', 'Rack, K', 'le Guyader, G', 'Vekemans, M', 'Macintyre, E']","['Harrison CJ', 'Radford-Weiss I', 'Ross F', 'Rack K', 'le Guyader G', 'Vekemans M', 'Macintyre E']","[""Laboratoire Central d'Hematologie et Cytogenetique, Hopital Necker-Enfants Malades, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,,IM,"['Adult', 'Child', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,1999/08/05 00:00,1999/08/05 00:01,['1999/08/05 00:00'],"['1999/08/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/05 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/05 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0165460898002441 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-4608(98)00244-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1999 Jul 1;112(1):15-20. doi: 10.1016/s0165-4608(98)00244-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A report of three cases.,647-51,"BACKGROUND: Soft tissue tumors are rare in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and the role of fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology in their diagnosis has not been explored. CASES: Two patients with refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation (RAEB-t) developed soft tissue swellings during the course of the illness. In a third patient, soft tissue swelling was a presenting feature. The swellings in all three cases were diagnosed as extramedullary myeloid cell tumor (EMT) on FNA and showed increased blasts (10-14%), dyspoietic changes, Auer rods and monocytosis. CONCLUSION: Soft tissue tumors appearing in MDS are likely to be EMTs. FNA is therefore particularly valuable in their diagnosis as morphology, cytochemistry, immunophenotyping and flow cytometric analysis of hematopoietic cells are best studied on aspirated material. We suggest that FNA be preferred over excisional biopsy for the diagnosis of soft tissue swellings in MDS.","['Gujral, S', 'Kumar, R', 'Jain, P', 'Sharma, A', 'Gupta, S', 'Kumar, L', 'Raina, V', 'Kochupillai, V']","['Gujral S', 'Kumar R', 'Jain P', 'Sharma A', 'Gupta S', 'Kumar L', 'Raina V', 'Kochupillai V']","['Unit of Laboratory Oncology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India. sgujral@medinst.ernet.in']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,Acta Cytol,Acta cytologica,0370307,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/*pathology', '*Biopsy, Needle', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*pathology', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms/*pathology']",,1999/08/05 00:00,1999/08/05 00:01,['1999/08/05 00:00'],"['1999/08/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/05 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000331160 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Cytol. 1999 Jul-Aug;43(4):647-51. doi: 10.1159/000331160.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanism of death, massive pulmonary hemorrhage, has not been previously reported. Brodifacoum was quantitated in liver, spleen, lung, brain, bile, vitreous humor, heart blood, and femoral blood using HPLC with fluorescence detection. The highest brodifacoum concentrations were detected in bile (4276 ng/mL) and femoral blood (3919 ng/mL). No brodifacoum was detected in brain or vitreous humor. A brodifacoum concentration of 50 ng/g was observed in frozen liver while formalin fixed liver exhibited a concentration of 820 ng/g. A very high blood:liver brodifacoum concentration ratio suggested acute poisoning but the historical and pathologic findings suggested a longer period of anticoagulation. Though most cases of brodifacoum poisoning in humans are non-fatal, this compound can be deadly because of its very long half-life. Forensic pathologists and toxicologists should suspect superwarfarin rodenticides when confronted with cases of unexplained bleeding. Anticoagulant poisoning can mimic fatal leukemia or infectious diseases such as bacterial sepsis, rickettsioses, plague, and leptospirosis.

Another biological process that may involve selectins is the adhesion of circulating tumour cells to endothelium in cancer metastasis. This review discusses the evidence for the involvement of E-, P- and L-selectin in the metastasis of different tumour types. It is concluded that, with certain reservations and qualifications, selectins can play a role in metastasis. For example, the evidence for the involvement of E-selectin in breast and colon cancer metastasis is very strong. For the other selectins and tumour types the evidence is less convincing and further investigations are required to clarify the situation. Certainly, selectins are not the only mechanism available for tumours to metastasise. In the future, measurement of selectins could be useful prognostically and manipulation of their levels could lead to new cancer therapies.","['Krause, T', 'Turner, G A']","['Krause T', 'Turner GA']","['Department of Clinical Biochemistry, The Medical School, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Clin Exp Metastasis,Clinical & experimental metastasis,8409970,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Selectins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/physiology', 'Carcinoma/metabolism/pathology/physiopathology', 'Cattle', 'Cell Adhesion/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/metabolism/pathology/physiopathology', 'Ligands', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Metastasis/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Selectins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/08/04 00:00,1999/08/04 00:01,['1999/08/04 00:00'],"['1999/08/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/04 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/04 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1006626500852 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Metastasis. 1999 May;17(3):183-92. doi: 10.1023/a:1006626500852.,,,,69,,,,,,,,,

For patients with B-precursor ALL, the HR category includes patients more than 10 years of age who have a WBC count at diagnosis of more than the 50,000/microliter that is becoming a global standard for HR classification. Since 1981, the Children's Cancer and Leukemia Study Group (CCLSG) has developed a series of protocols for HR-ALL. These include the H811, H851, H874, H/HH911 and more recent H/HH941 protocols. With the H874 protocol in particular, patient outcomes with new intensive regimens strengthened by early treatment with cyclophosphamide (CPM) plus cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C), and reinduction therapy with THP-adriamycin, vincristine, prednisone and L-asparaginase seem to be better than outcomes of patients with the previous protocols. An intermediate-dose of CPM plus Ara-C showed a significantly higher event-free survival (EFS) rate than a high-dose regimen with the same drugs. The EFS rates at 4 years based on the H941 and HH941 protocols were 72.8% and 62.8%, respectively. Although the various prognostic factors for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) have been inconsistent, bone marrow chromosome abnormalities including monosomy 7 an 11q23 rearrangement have become indicators for a poor prognosis, whereas patients with t (15; 17), t (8; 21) and inv (16) have a decreased likelihood of relapse after achieving remission. The 11q23 abnormality is a very important prognostic factor for infant acute leukemia. Based on these findings renewal protocols for AML, including hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, have been conducted by our CCLSG and other study groups.","['Koizumi, S']",['Koizumi S'],"['Department of Pediatrics, Kanazawa University Faculty of Medicine, Japan.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

In rodents ventromedial hypothalamic damage causes hyperphagia, obesity, hyperinsulinism, and insulin resistance. Reduction of insulin secretion in humans may attenuate weight gain. METHODS: Eight children with intractable obesity after therapy for leukemia or brain tumors underwent oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) with simultaneous insulin levels before and after treatment with octreotide for 6 months. RESULTS: In comparison with a 6-month pre-study observation period, patients exhibited weight loss (+6.0 +/- 0.7 kg vs -4.8 +/- 1.8 kg; P =.04) and decrease in body mass index (+2.1 +/- 0.3 kg/m(2) vs -2.0 +/- 0.7 kg/m(2); P =.0001). Recall calorie count decreased during the 6 months of treatment (P =. 015). OGTT demonstrated biochemical glucose intolerance in 5 of 8 patients initially and in 2 of 7 at study end, whereas insulin response was decreased (281 +/- 47 microU/mL vs 114 +/- 35 microU/mL; P =.04). Percent weight change correlated with changes in insulin response (r = 0.72, P =.012) and changes in plasma leptin r = 0.76, P =.0004). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with hypothalamic obesity demonstrate excessive insulin secretion. Octreotide administration promoted weight loss, which correlated with reduction in insulin secretion on OGTT and with reduction in leptin levels. Pre-study biochemical glucose tolerance improved in several patients while they were receiving octreotide. These results suggest that normalization of insulin secretion may be an effective therapeutic strategy in this syndrome.","['Lustig, R H', 'Rose, S R', 'Burghen, G A', 'Velasquez-Mieyer, P', 'Broome, D C', 'Smith, K', 'Li, H', 'Hudson, M M', 'Heideman, R L', 'Kun, L E']","['Lustig RH', 'Rose SR', 'Burghen GA', 'Velasquez-Mieyer P', 'Broome DC', 'Smith K', 'Li H', 'Hudson MM', 'Heideman RL', 'Kun LE']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Tennessee, Memphis, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Pediatr,The Journal of pediatrics,0375410,"['0 (Hormones)', '0 (Insulin)', '51110-01-1 (Somatostatin)', 'RWM8CCW8GP (Octreotide)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Animals', 'Brain Damage, Chronic/*complications', 'Child', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Hormones/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Hyperphagia/drug therapy/etiology/physiopathology', 'Hypothalamic Diseases/*drug therapy/etiology/physiopathology', 'Insulin/blood', 'Male', 'Obesity/*drug therapy/etiology/physiopathology', 'Octreotide/*therapeutic use', 'Rats', 'Somatostatin/*agonists']",,1999/08/04 00:00,1999/08/04 00:01,['1999/08/04 00:00'],"['1999/08/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/04 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/04 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-3476(99)70017-X [pii]', '10.1016/s0022-3476(99)70017-x [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr. 1999 Aug;135(2 Pt 1):162-8. doi: 10.1016/s0022-3476(99)70017-x.,,,['M01-RR00211/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],,['J Pediatr. 1999 Aug;135(2 Pt 1):142-4.

One important feature of CML is decreased responsiveness of myeloid cells to apoptotic stimuli. Here we show that myeloid cells from mice deficient in ICSBP exhibit reduced spontaneous apoptosis and a significant decrease in sensitivity to apoptosis induced by DNA damage. In contrast, apoptosis in thymocytes from ICSBP-deficient mice is unaffected. We also show that overexpression of ICSBP in the human U937 monocytic cell line enhances the rate of spontaneous apoptosis and the sensitivity to apoptosis induced by etoposide, lipopolysaccharide plus ATP, or rapamycin. Programmed cell death induced by etoposide was specifically blocked by peptides inhibitory for the caspase-1 or caspase-3 subfamilies of caspases. Studies of proapoptotic genes showed that cells overexpressing ICSBP have enhanced expression of caspase-3 precursor protein. In addition, analyses of antiapoptotic genes showed that overexpression of ICSBP results in decreased expression of Bcl-X(L).

In this study, we have investigated whether IL-11 can maintain a graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect. Lethally irradiated B6D2F1 mice were transplanted with either T cell-depleted (TCD) bone marrow (BM) alone or with BM and splenic T cells from allogeneic B6 donors. Animals also received host-type P815 mastocytoma cells at the time of BMT. Recipients were injected subcutaneously with recombinant human IL-11 or control diluent twice daily, from 2 days before BMT to 7 days after BMT. TCD recipients all died from leukemia by day 23. All control- and IL-11-treated allogeneic animals effectively rejected their leukemia, but IL-11 also reduced GVHD-related mortality. Examination of the cellular mechanisms of GVL and GVHD in this system showed that IL-11 selectively inhibited CD4-mediated GVHD, while retaining both CD4- and CD8-mediated GVL. In addition, IL-11 treatment did not affect cytolytic effector functions of T cells after BMT either in vivo or in vitro. Studies with perforin-deficient donor T cells demonstrated that the GVL effect was perforin dependent. These data demonstrated that IL-11 can significantly reduce CD4-dependent GVHD without impairing cytolytic function or subsequent GVL activity of CD8(+) T cells. Brief treatment with IL-11 shortly after BMT may therefore represent a novel strategy for separating GVHD and GVL.","['Teshima, T', 'Hill, G R', 'Pan, L', 'Brinson, Y S', 'van den Brink, M R', 'Cooke, K R', 'Ferrara, J L']","['Teshima T', 'Hill GR', 'Pan L', 'Brinson YS', 'van den Brink MR', 'Cooke KR', 'Ferrara JL']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan Cancer Center, Ann Arbor 48109-0942, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '126465-35-8 (Perforin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/*immunology', 'CD4 Antigens/physiology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology/prevention & control/therapy', 'Graft vs Tumor Effect/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Interleukin-11/*physiology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/therapy', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Perforin', 'Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/immunology/therapy', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/drug effects/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fas Receptor/physiology']",PMC408425,1999/08/03 00:00,1999/08/03 00:01,['1999/08/03 00:00'],"['1999/08/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI7111 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1999 Aug;104(3):317-25. doi: 10.1172/JCI7111.,,,"['P01 CA039542/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-39542/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-55162/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

The recommended Phase II dose of raltitrexed administered as a single agent is 3 mg/m2 every 3 weeks. Paclitaxel also has a broad spectrum of activity. A Phase I study of both agents in combination therapy was conducted. METHODS: Eligible patients had refractory solid tumors and a Cancer and Leukemia Group B performance status of 0 to 2. Cohorts of patients were treated with escalating doses of raltitrexed as a 15-minute intravenous infusion immediately followed by 175 mg/m2 of paclitaxel administered over 3 hours. Dose-limiting toxicity was defined as World Health Organization Grade 4 neutropenia with fever, Grade 4 thrombocytopenia requiring platelet transfusion, a nonhematologic toxicity of Grade 3 or higher (excluding nausea, emesis, and alopecia), or failure of toxicities to recover to Grade 1 or lower within 21 days after causing a dose delay. RESULTS: A total of 33 patients enrolled in the study. Raltitrexed was escalated in increments of 0.5 mg/m2, from 0.5 mg/m2 to the recommended Phase II dose of 3 mg/m2. Dose-limiting toxicity first was observed at a raltitrexed dose of 2 mg/m2. At a dose of 3 mg/m2, dose-limiting neutropenia was observed in 2 of 12 patients.

Adult/Adolescent Spectrum of HIV Disease Project Group.,S11-7,"We examined incidence trends in seven HIV-associated cancers (Kaposi's sarcoma [KS], invasive cervical cancer, immunoblastic lymphoma, primary brain lymphoma [PBL], Burkitt's lymphoma, other non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, and Hodgkin's lymphoma) and the effects of antiretroviral therapy on these trends. Data were abstracted from medical records in 89 hospitals and clinics in nine U.S. cities from January 1994 through June 1997. The stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel statistic was used to test for trend. There were 19,684 HIV-infected persons representing 26,638 years of follow-up. Decreases in incidence per 1000 person-years were observed for KS (January through June 1994, 49.9; January through June 1997, 25.7; p = .001) and PBL (January through June 1994, 8.0; January through June 1997, 2.3; p = .01), especially during time on antiretroviral therapy, but changes in the incidence of other cancers were not significant. During the study, prescription of combination antiretroviral therapy increased from 16% to 57%. The incidences of KS and PBL are decreasing. Although for KS the decline occurred in both treated and untreated groups (difference in rate of decline not significant, p = .08), it was sharper in the treated group; additionally, KS declined faster in the era after highly active antiretroviral agents were introduced. Thus, these decreases may be due in part to the effect of antiretroviral therapy slowing the progression of HIV disease.","['Jones, J L', 'Hanson, D L', 'Dworkin, M S', 'Ward, J W', 'Jaffe, H W']","['Jones JL', 'Hanson DL', 'Dworkin MS', 'Ward JW', 'Jaffe HW']","['Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention--Surveillance and Epidemiology, National Center for HIV, STD, and TB Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia 30333, USA. jlj1@cdc.gov']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr,Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes (1999),100892005,['0 (Anti-HIV Agents)'],IM,"['AIDS-Related Opportunistic Infections/drug therapy/*epidemiology', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Anti-HIV Agents/administration & dosage', 'Brain Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/epidemiology', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Lymphoma, AIDS-Related/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology', 'Sarcoma, Kaposi/epidemiology', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/epidemiology']",,1999/08/03 00:00,1999/08/03 00:01,['1999/08/03 00:00'],"['1999/08/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/03 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr. 1999 Aug 1;21 Suppl 1:S11-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, two genes, p16INK4a and p15INK4b, encoding two cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor proteins of the INK4 family of Mr 15,000 and 16,000, respectively, have been localized to 9p21. Remarkably, the p16INK4a locus has been found to encode a second protein, p14ARF, known as p19ARF in mice, with a distinct reading frame. Like p16INK4a, p14ARF is involved in cell cycle regulation, blocking cells at the G1 restriction point through the activity of MDM-2 and p53. We studied bone marrow samples of 42 newly diagnosed and untreated patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia for the incidence of deletions of p16INK4a/p14ARF and p15INK4b using Southern blot analysis and determined the clinical outcome with regard to complete remission (CR) duration, event-free survival, and overall survival. We found deletions of p16INK4a/p14ARF in 17 of 42 patients (40%), with homozygous deletions in 11 of 42 patients (26%) and hemizygous deletions in 6 of 42 patients (14%). The gene for p15INK4b was codeleted in most, but not all, cases and was never deleted without deletion of p16INK4a/ p14ARF. No correlation was observed between molecular studies and karyotype abnormalities as determined by conventional cytogenetics. Furthermore, no difference was found in the CR rate, CR duration, event-free survival, and overall survival in patients with homozygous gene deletions compared to patients with no deletions or loss of only one allele.","['Faderl, S', 'Kantarjian, H M', 'Manshouri, T', 'Chan, C Y', 'Pierce, S', 'Hays, K J', 'Cortes, J', 'Thomas, D', 'Estrov, Z', 'Albitar, M']","['Faderl S', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Manshouri T', 'Chan CY', 'Pierce S', 'Hays KJ', 'Cortes J', 'Thomas D', 'Estrov Z', 'Albitar M']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (CDKN2B protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p14ARF)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15', '*Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16', 'Female', '*Gene Deletion', 'Genes, p16/*genetics', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Proteins/*genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p14ARF', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,1999/08/03 00:00,1999/08/03 00:01,['1999/08/03 00:00'],"['1999/08/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/03 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1999 Jul;5(7):1855-61.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine whether BCL2 expression is prognostic of patient outcome in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), we measured its level in 198 newly diagnosed, untreated AML patients by Western blotting using whole-cell lysates from low-density peripheral blood cells. BCL2 expression was not associated with the percentage of blasts (R2 = 0.10), French-American-British classification type, or cytogenetic abnormality. Smoothed martingale residual plots indicated that high BCL2 protein level was an adverse prognostic factor for patients with either favorable or intermediate prognosis cytogenetics [FIPC; inv(16), t(8:21), t(15:17), or diploid or insufficient metaphases] but was a favorable prognostic factor for patients with unfavorable prognosis cytogenetics (UC; -5, -7, +8, 11q23, Ph1, or miscellaneous changes). Patients with FIPC and high BCL2 (highest quartile) had a significantly shorter median survival (78 weeks versus not reached; P = 0.009) than did those with lower (lower three quartiles) levels of BCL2. Among those with UC, as BCL2 level decreased from the fourth quartile to the third or the combined first and second quartiles, the median survival decreased (from 94 to 45 or 17 weeks, respectively; P = 0.003). Lower expression of BCL2 in UC was associated with shorter remission duration (P = 0.05). In multivariate analyses performed using either overall or event-free survival as the end point, for either all patients or within either cytogenetic subgroup, BCL2 level was an independent prognostic factor. Similar analysis revealed that BCL2 level was an independent predictor of remission duration for UC patients as well. These data suggest that BCL2 is involved differently in different types (favorable versus unfavorable) of AML and that therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating BCL2 function may be more likely to work in patients with favorable cytogenetic abnormalities.","['Kornblau, S M', 'Thall, P F', 'Estrov, Z', 'Walterscheid, M', 'Patel, S', 'Theriault, A', 'Keating, M J', 'Kantarjian, H', 'Estey, E', 'Andreeff, M']","['Kornblau SM', 'Thall PF', 'Estrov Z', 'Walterscheid M', 'Patel S', 'Theriault A', 'Keating MJ', 'Kantarjian H', 'Estey E', 'Andreeff M']","['Department of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, The University of Texas M.

This study was designed to compare the prevalence of MRD with each agent in patients in CR by using conventional criteria and the relapse-free survival for patients with and without MRD. Bone marrow biopsies from 39 patients treated with a single cycle of 2-CdA and 27 patients treated with multiple cycles of 2'-DCF were studied. The monoclonal antibodies anti-CD20, DBA.44, and anti-CD45RO were used to evaluate the paraffin-embedded bone marrow core biopsies for MRD. Five of 39 patients (13%) treated with 2-CdA had MRD, as compared to 7 of 27 patients (26%) treated with 2'-DCF (two-tailed P = 0.21). Relapse has occurred in two of the five patients with MRD after 2-CdA treatment and in four of the seven patients with MRD after 2'-DCF treatment. In total, 6 of the 12 patients (50%) with MRD have relapsed, whereas 3 of 54 patients (6%) without MRD have relapsed, and 2 patients have died without evidence of relapse. The estimated 4-year relapse-free survival among patients with MRD is 55% (+/- 15%, SE), compared to 88% (+/- 5%, SE) among patients without MRD (two-tailed P = 0.0023). The prevalence of MRD detected in a subset of patients in CR after either 2-CdA or 2'-DCF treatment did not differ significantly.

Cotransduced cells showed reduced tumorigenicity, and tumor take was followed by regression in some mice. In vivo tumors were heavily infiltrated with DCs that were isolated, phenotyped, and tested in vitro for stimulation of tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). BALB/c C-26 carcinoma cells express the endogenous murine leukemia virus (MuLV) env gene as a tumor-associated antigen. This antigen is shared among solid tumors of BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice and contains two epitopes, AH-1 and KSP, recognized in the context of major histocompatibility complex class I molecules H-2Ld and H-2K(b), respectively. DCs isolated from C-26/GM/CD40L tumors grown in (BALB/c x C57BL/6)F1 mice (H-2d x b) stimulated interferon gamma production by both anti-AH-1 and KSP CTLs, whereas tumor-infiltrating DCs (TIDCs) of BALB/c mice stimulated only anti-AH-1 CTLs. Furthermore, TIDCs primed naive mice for CTL activity as early as 2 d after injection into the footpad, whereas double-transduced tumor cells required at least 5 d for priming; this difference may reflect direct DC priming versus indirect tumor cell priming. Immunohistochemical staining indicated colocalization of DCs and apoptotic bodies in the tumors. These data indicate that DCs infiltrating tumors that produce GM-CSF and CD40L can capture cellular antigens, likely through uptake of apoptotic bodies, and mature in situ to a stage suitable for antigen presentation. Thus, tumor cell-based vaccines engineered to favor the interaction with host DCs can be considered.","['Chiodoni, C', 'Paglia, P', 'Stoppacciaro, A', 'Rodolfo, M', 'Parenza, M', 'Colombo, M P']","['Chiodoni C', 'Paglia P', 'Stoppacciaro A', 'Rodolfo M', 'Parenza M', 'Colombo MP']","['Department of Experimental Oncology, Istituto Nazionale per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology/*metabolism', 'CD40 Ligand', 'Colonic Neoplasms/immunology', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*genetics', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC2195555,1999/08/03 00:00,1999/08/03 00:01,['1999/08/03 00:00'],"['1999/08/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.190.1.125 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1999 Jul 5;190(1):125-33. doi: 10.1084/jem.190.1.125.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Also discussed are the differences in the mechanisms of action among amrubicin, amrubicinol and doxorubicin in terms of their cellular pharmacokinetic character. In P388 cells, amrubicinol was about 80 times as potent as amrubicin, and about 2 times more potent than doxorubicin in a 1-h drug exposure growth-inhibition test. A clear cross-resistance was observed to both amrubicin and amrubicinol in doxorubicin-resistant P388 cells, though the resistance index was lower for amrubicin. The intracellular concentration of amrubicinol was about 6 times and 2 times higher than those of amrubicin and doxorubicin, respectively. Compared to doxorubicin, amrubicin and amrubicinol were released rapidly after removal of the drugs from the medium. A clear correlation was found between the growth-inhibiting activity and the cellular level of amrubicin and amrubicinol in P388 cells. About 10 to 20% of amrubicin or amrubicinol taken up by the cells was detected in the cell nuclear fraction, whereas 70 to 80% of doxorubicin was localized in this fraction.

RA is available for the treatment of acute promyeloleukemia, although the development of resistance to the agent is a serious problem for differentiation-inducing therapy. To approach the mechanisms of resistance to RA, we developed two novel cell lines, HL-60-R2 and R9, which were subcloned after exposure to increasing concentrations of RA. The growth rate of HL-60-R2 cells was significantly increased by RA treatment, whereas the growth rate of HL-60-R9 was not affected. RA induces apoptosis in the parental HL-60 cells. The number of apoptotic cells, however, was not increased and nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction was not altered by 1 microM RA in either of the cloned cell lines. Treatment with VD induced monocytic differentiation and increased the expression of CD11b in HL-60 and HL-60-R9 cells, but not in HL-60-R2 cells. Flow cytometric and G-banding analysis demonstrated that R2 cells were near-triploid. The sequencing analysis revealed a deletion of three nucleotides in the sequence of the RAR alpha gene in HL-60-R9 cells, resulting in deletion of codon 286. No mutation was found in HL-60-R2 cells. Taken together, these data indicate that the resistance to RA is caused by the mutation in RAR alpha of HL-60-R9, but by other factor(s), which also affect the VD-response pathways, in HL-60-R2. The abnormal response to VD may be associated with the abnormal ploidy of the R2 cells.","['Mori, J', 'Suzuki, S', 'Hara, M', 'Kaneko, A', 'Yamashita, K', 'Kumagai, M', 'Sakuma, T', 'Kakizawa, T', 'Yamazaki, M', 'Takeda, T', 'Miyamoto, T', 'Ichikawa, K', 'Hashizume, K']","['Mori J', 'Suzuki S', 'Hara M', 'Kaneko A', 'Yamashita K', 'Kumagai M', 'Sakuma T', 'Kakizawa T', 'Yamazaki M', 'Takeda T', 'Miyamoto T', 'Ichikawa K', 'Hashizume K']","['Department of Aging Medicine and Geriatrics, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Nagano.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Macrophage-1 Antigen)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Retinoid X Receptors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '1406-16-2 (Vitamin D)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Macrophage-1 Antigen/analysis', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/analysis', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Retinoid X Receptors', 'Transcription Factors/analysis', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Vitamin D/pharmacology']",PMC5926114,1999/08/03 00:00,1999/08/03 00:01,['1999/08/03 00:00'],"['1999/08/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/03 00:00 [entrez]']","['S091050509980132X [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.1999.tb00798.x [doi]']",ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 1999 Jun;90(6):660-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.1999.tb00798.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lymphadenophathy, splenomegaly, hypergammaglobulinemia and progressive immunodeficiency are prominent features of MAIDS. Previously, we showed that the ubiquitin proteolytic system was upregulated in infected lymph nodes [Crinelli, R., Fraternale, A., Casabianca, A. & Magnani, M. (1997) Eur. J. Biochem. 247, 91-97]. In this report, we demonstrate that increased 26S proteasome activity is responsible for accelerated turnover of the IkappaBalpha inhibitor in lymph node extracts derived from animals with MAIDS. The molecular mechanisms mediating IkappaBalpha proteolysis involved constitutive phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha at Ser32 and Ser36 and subsequent ubiquitination, suggesting persistent activation of an NF-kappaB inducing pathway. Interestingly, enhanced IkappaBalpha degradation did not result in enhanced NF-kappaB DNA binding activity, but rather in a different subunit composition. The modulation of NF-kappaB/IkappaB system may affect multiple immunoregulatory pathways and may in part explain the mechanisms leading to the profound immune dysregulation involved in MAIDS pathogenesis.","['Crinelli, R', 'Bianchi, M', 'Gentilini, L', 'Magnani, M', 'Hiscott, J']","['Crinelli R', 'Bianchi M', 'Gentilini L', 'Magnani M', 'Hiscott J']","[""Instuto di Chimica Biologica 'G.

LIF acts through a receptor complex composed of a low affinity LIF receptor (LIFRbeta) and gp130. We reported that the intracellular domain of gp130 plays an important role in self-renewal of ES cells. In the present study, we examined the signaling pathway through which gp130 contributes to the self-renewal of ES cells. Mutational analysis of the cytoplasmic domain of gp130 revealed that the tyrosine residue of gp130 responsible for STAT3 activation is necessary for self-renewal of ES cells, while that required for SHP2 and MAP kinase activation was dispensable. Next, we constructed a fusion protein composed of the entire coding region of STAT3 and the ligand binding domain of the estrogen receptor. This construction (STAT3ER) induced expression of junB (one of the targets of STAT3) in ES cells in the presence of the synthetic ligand 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4HT), thereby indicating that STAT3ER is a conditionally active form. ES cells transfected with STAT3ER cultured in the presence of 4HT maintained an undifferentiated state. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that STAT3 activation is required and sufficient to maintain the undifferentiated state of ES cells.","['Matsuda, T', 'Nakamura, T', 'Nakao, K', 'Arai, T', 'Katsuki, M', 'Heike, T', 'Yokota, T']","['Matsuda T', 'Nakamura T', 'Nakao K', 'Arai T', 'Katsuki M', 'Heike T', 'Yokota T']","['Department of Stem Cell Regulation, Center for Experimental Medicine, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Shirokanedai, Minato-Ku, Tokyo 108-8639, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Il6st protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '094ZI81Y45 (Tamoxifen)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', '17197F0KYM (afimoxifene)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Embryo, Mammalian/cytology/*metabolism', 'Growth Inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mutagenesis', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Tamoxifen/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism']",PMC1171502,1999/08/03 00:00,1999/08/03 00:01,['1999/08/03 00:00'],"['1999/08/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/08/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/emboj/18.15.4261 [doi]'],ppublish,EMBO J. 1999 Aug 2;18(15):4261-9. doi: 10.1093/emboj/18.15.4261.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunoblotting revealed that incubation of HL-60 cytosol at 30 degrees C in the presence of cytochrome c and ATP (or dATP) resulted in activation of procaspases-3, -6, and -7 but not -2 and -8. Although similar selectivity was observed in intact cells, affinity labeling revealed that the active caspase species generated in vitro and in situ differed in charge and abundance. ATP and dATP levels in intact HL-60 cells were higher than required for caspase activation in vitro and did not change before caspase activation in situ. Replacement of ATP with the poorly hydrolyzable analogs 5'-adenylyl methylenediphosphate, 5'-adenylyl imidodiphosphate, or 5'-adenylyl-O-(3-thiotriphos-phate) slowed caspase activation in vitro, suggesting that ATP hydrolysis is required. Caspase activation in vitro was insensitive to phosphatase and kinase inhibitors (okadaic acid, staurosporine, and genistein) but was inhibited by Zn(2+), aurintricarboxylic acid, and various protease inhibitors, including 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin, N(alpha)-p-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, N(alpha)-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone, and N-(N(alpha)-benzyloxycarbonylphenylalanyl)alanine fluoromethyl ketone, each of which inhibited recombinant caspases-3, -6, -7, and -9. Experiments with anti-neoepitope antiserum confirmed that these agents inhibited caspase-9 activation.

We now show that HIP1/PDGFbetaR oligomerizes, is constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated, and transforms the murine hematopoietic cell line, Ba/F3, to interleukin-3-independent growth. A kinase-inactive mutant is neither tyrosine-phosphorylated nor able to transform Ba/F3 cells. Oligomerization and kinase activation required the 55-amino acid carboxyl-terminal TALIN homology region but not the leucine zipper domain. Tyrosine phosphorylation of a 130-kDa protein and STAT5 correlates with transformation in cells expressing HIP1/PDGFbetaR and related mutants. A deletion mutant fusion protein that contains only the TALIN homology region of HIP1 fused to PDGFbetaR is incapable of transforming Ba/F3 cells and does not tyrosine-phosphorylate p130 or STAT5, although it is itself constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated. We have also analyzed cells expressing Tyr --> Phe mutants of HIP1/PDGFbetaR in the known PDGFbetaR SH2 docking sites and report that none of these sites are necessary for STAT5 activation, p130 phosphorylation, or Ba/F3 transformation. The correlation of factor-independent growth of hematopoietic cells with p130 and STAT5 phosphorylation/activation in both the HIP1/PDGFbetaR Tyr --> Phe and deletion mutational variants suggests that both STAT5 and p130 are important for transformation mediated by HIP1/PDGFbetaR.","['Ross, T S', 'Gilliland, D G']","['Ross TS', 'Gilliland DG']","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (BCAR1 protein, human)', '0 (Bcar1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Crk-Associated Substrate Protein)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (HIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Hip1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Retinoblastoma-Like Protein p130)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Talin)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Crk-Associated Substrate Protein', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*genetics', 'Mice', '*Milk Proteins', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Conformation', '*Proteins', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta', 'Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/*genetics', 'Retinoblastoma-Like Protein p130', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Talin', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism']",,1999/07/31 00:00,1999/07/31 00:01,['1999/07/31 00:00'],"['1999/07/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/31 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/31 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.274.32.22328 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)81545-9 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1999 Aug 6;274(32):22328-36. doi: 10.1074/jbc.274.32.22328.,,,"['K08 CA76025-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01DK50654/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL07623/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,

It is characterized by a biphasic or triphasic clinical course in which a benign chronic phase is followed by transformation into an accelerated and blastic phase. On a cytogenetic and molecular level, most patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia demonstrate BCR-ABL fusion genes in hematopoietic progenitor cells, which result from a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22; this translocation leads to a shortened chromosome 22, called the Philadelphia chromosome. Translation of the fusion products yields chimeric proteins of variable size that have increased tyrosine kinase activity. Conventional chemotherapy with hydroxyurea or busulfan can achieve hematologic control but cannot modify the natural disease course, which inevitably terminates in a rapidly fatal blastic phase. Since its introduction in the 1980s, allogeneic stem-cell transplantation has provided the groundwork for a cure of chronic myelogenous leukemia. However, few patients are eligible for this treatment because of donor availability and age restrictions. Therapy with interferon-alpha alone or in combination with cytarabine suppresses the leukemic clone, produces cytogenetic remissions, and prolongs survival. It is an effective alternative first-line treatment for patients ineligible for transplantation. New drugs active against chronic myelogenous leukemia may show increased activity in the transformed phases of the disease. Novel therapies and concepts are developing rapidly; targeted molecules are tyrosine kinases, ras, and messenger RNA through antisense oligonucleotides.

The cells readily undergo apoptosis in response to various agents, and the cell line has been suggested as a useful model to study apoptosis in MDS. The aims of the present study were to assess differentiation and apoptosis induced with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and etoposide, to characterize the mode of apoptosis in these two model systems, and to assess the influence of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), which in combination with erythropoietin has been shown to inhibit apoptosis in MDS. ATRA induced differentiation and apoptosis in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Differentiated cells were partially rescued (by 50%) from apoptosis with G-CSF. Etoposide induced apoptosis in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, but no signs of preceding maturation or G-CSF rescue were detected. ATRA- and etoposide-induced apoptosis were both mediated through the caspase pathway and were partially blocked with the general caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk. Simultaneous treatment with G-CSF and zVAD-fmk additively blocked ATRA-induced apoptosis. However, the two pathways differed in terms of substrate cleavage during apoptosis. ATRA-induced apoptosis caused actin cleavage, which was not affected by G-CSF, and Bcl-2 downregulation. Etoposide induced a caspase-dependent cleavage of Bcl-2, while actin remained intact. The Fas system did not seem to play a major role in any of these apoptotic pathways. Our results may provide new tools to study the mechanisms of apoptosis in MDS.","['Hassan, Z', 'Fadeel, B', 'Zhivotovsky, B', 'Hellstrom-Lindberg, E']","['Hassan Z', 'Fadeel B', 'Zhivotovsky B', 'Hellstrom-Lindberg E']","['Department of Hematology, Huddinge University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.

These cells conserve the ability to differentiate into megakaryocytes upon stimulation with PMA, while greatly increasing their HDC activity. We provide evidence that enhanced HDC activity reflects the basophil rather than the megakaryocytic differentiation potential of UT7DI cells. Indeed, in addition to HDC mRNA, they express spontaneously several other mRNA coding for molecules present in basophils (FcepsilonRI, CCR3, IL-4Ralpha, IL-5Ralpha). Furthermore, the basophil antigen Bsp-1 is displayed on the surface of some UT7D1 cells in response to PMA concomitantly with increased histamine synthesis and mRNA expression of typical basophil-derived cytokines (IL-6, IL-4, and IL-13). Nevertheless, PMA cannot sustain the differentiation of this lineage, because mRNAs for basophil markers gradually diminish during long-term culture, whereas molecules associated with the megakaryocytic lineage remain prominent. In support of the notion that HDC activity is not related with megakaryopoiesis, we show that PMA-induced CD41 expression and PDGF transcription occurs in the K562 cells, though neither HDC mRNA nor any known basophil marker are expressed in these conditions. In contrast, all these markers are expressed in the basophilic leukemia cell line KU812F. Interestingly, the megakaryocytic cell line HEL produces also substantial amounts of histamine and expresses FcepsilonRI, thus revealing its basophil differentiation potential. HEL as well as KU812F need not be stimulated with PMA to react with Bsp-1 mAb, suggesting that they are more engaged into the basophil differentiation scheme than UT7D1. Other leukemic cell lines unrelated to the megakaryocyte or basophil lineage, like HL60 and U937 do neither synthesize histamine nor express basophil markers before or after PMA stimulation. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence for a factor-dependent cell line with megakaryocyte/basophil bipotentiality with which early stages of basophil commitment can be analyzed.","['Dy, M', 'Pacilio, M', 'Arnould, A', 'Machavoine, F', 'Mayeux, P', 'Hermine, O', 'Bodger, M', 'Schneider, E']","['Dy M', 'Pacilio M', 'Arnould A', 'Machavoine F', 'Mayeux P', 'Hermine O', 'Bodger M', 'Schneider E']","['CNRS UMR 8603, Universite Rene Descartes Paris V, Hopital Necker, France. dy@necker.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Platelet Glycoprotein GPIIb-IIIa Complex)', '0 (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '820484N8I3 (Histamine)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 4.1.1.22 (Histidine Decarboxylase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Basophils/*cytology', 'Biomarkers', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells/metabolism', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Histamine/metabolism', 'Histidine Decarboxylase/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Megakaryocytes/*cytology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Platelet Glycoprotein GPIIb-IIIa Complex/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism']",,1999/07/31 00:00,1999/07/31 00:01,['1999/07/31 00:00'],"['1999/07/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/31 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/31 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(99)00070-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(99)00070-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1999 Aug;27(8):1295-305. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(99)00070-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we used the B-cell-associated antigens CD19 and CD20 as target structures on human leukemic cells. We found that a combination of bispecific antibody fragments (bsFab2) with target x CD3 and target x CD28 specificity induces vigorous autologous T-cell activation and killing of malignant cells in peripheral blood and bone marrow cultures from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and follicular lymphoma. The bsFab2 targeting CD20 were considerably more effective than those binding to CD19. The colony-forming capacity of treated bone marrow was impaired due to large amounts of tumor necrosis factor alpha produced during bsFab2-induced T-cell activation. Neutralizing tumor necrosis factor alpha antibodies were found to reverse this negative effect without affecting T-cell activation and tumor cell killing. CD20 x CD28 bsFab2, when used alone rather than in combination, markedly improved the recognition of leukemic cells by allogeneic T cells. Therefore, these reagents may be capable of enhancing the immunogenicity of leukemic cells in general and, in particular, of increasing the antileukemic activity of allogeneic donor buffy coat cells in relapsed bone marrow transplanted patients.","['Brandl, M', 'Grosse-Hovest, L', 'Holler, E', 'Kolb, H J', 'Jung, G']","['Brandl M', 'Grosse-Hovest L', 'Holler E', 'Kolb HJ', 'Jung G']","['Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Klinikum Grosshadern, University of Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments)', '0 (Receptor-CD3 Complex, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antigens, CD19/immunology', 'Antigens, CD20/*immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'CD28 Antigens/*immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments/*immunology', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*drug effects', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Receptor-CD3 Complex, Antigen, T-Cell/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",,1999/07/31 00:00,1999/07/31 00:01,['1999/07/31 00:00'],"['1999/07/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/31 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/31 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(99)00072-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(99)00072-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1999 Aug;27(8):1264-70. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(99)00072-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because some of these growth factors, especially TPO and IL-11, are now being evaluated clinically to reduce chemotherapy-associated thrombocytopenia in cancer patients, we evaluated 25 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples to test whether TPO, IL-11, and other early-acting megakaryocyte growth factors can affect leukemic cell proliferation, cell cycle activation, and programmed cell death (PCD) protection. TPO induced proliferation in the majority of AML samples from an overall mean proportion of S-phase cells of 7.8% +/-1.5% to 14.5% +/- 2.1% (p = 0.0006). Concurrent G0 cell depletion was found in 47.3% of AML samples. TPO-supported leukemic cell precursor (CFU-L) proliferation was reported in 5 of 17 (29.4%) of the samples with a mean colony number of 21.4 +/- 9.6 x 10(5) cells plated. In 13 of 19 samples, a significant protection from PCD (from an overall mean value of 13% +/-0.7% to 8.8% +/- 1.8%;p = 0.05) was detected after TPO exposure. Conversely, IL-11-induced cell cycle changes (recruitment from G0 to S phase) were detected in only 2 of 14 samples (14.2%). In addition, IL-11 showed little, if any, effect on CFU-L growth (mean colony number = 17.5 9.5) or apoptosis. Combination of TPO with IL-11 resulted in only a slight increase in the number of CFU-L, whereas IL-3 and stem cell factor significantly raised the mean colony numbers up to 119.2 +/- 68.3 and 52.9 +/- 22.1 x 10(5) cells plated, respectively. We conclude that TPO induces cell cycle activation in a significant proportion of cases and generally protects the majority of AML blast cells from PCD. On the other hand, IL-11 has little effect on the cell cycle or PCD. Combination of both TPO and IL-11 is rarely synergistic in stimulating AML clonogenic growth. These findings may be useful for designing clinical studies aimed at reducing chemotherapy-associated thrombocytopenia in AML patients.","['Tafuri, A', 'Lemoli, R M', 'Petrucci, M T', 'Ricciardi, M R', 'Fogli, M', 'Bonsi, L', 'Ariola, C', 'Strippoli, P', 'Gregorj, C', 'Petti, M C', 'Tura, S', 'Mandelli, F', 'Bagnara, G P']","['Tafuri A', 'Lemoli RM', 'Petrucci MT', 'Ricciardi MR', 'Fogli M', 'Bonsi L', 'Ariola C', 'Strippoli P', 'Gregorj C', 'Petti MC', 'Tura S', 'Mandelli F', 'Bagnara GP']","['Dipartimento di Biotecnologie Cellulari ed Ematologia, Universita La Sapienza di Roma, Rome, Italy. agotaf@bce.med.uniroma1.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Drug Interactions', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-11/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology', 'Thrombopoietin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",,1999/07/31 00:00,1999/07/31 00:01,['1999/07/31 00:00'],"['1999/07/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/31 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/31 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(99)00063-6 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(99)00063-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1999 Aug;27(8):1255-63. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(99)00063-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Taken together these results indicate that As2O3 would be a candidate as a therapeutic agent for treatment of neuroblastoma, which is a solid tumor, not only by systemic therapy but also by local therapy.","['Akao, Y', 'Nakagawa, Y', 'Akiyama, K']","['Akao Y', 'Nakagawa Y', 'Akiyama K']","['Gifu International Institute of Biotechnology, Kani-gun, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,FEBS Lett,FEBS letters,0155157,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Neuroblastoma/enzymology/*pathology', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/07/31 00:00,1999/07/31 00:01,['1999/07/31 00:00'],"['1999/07/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/31 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/31 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-5793(99)00841-8 [pii]', '10.1016/s0014-5793(99)00841-8 [doi]']",ppublish,FEBS Lett. 1999 Jul 16;455(1-2):59-62. doi: 10.1016/s0014-5793(99)00841-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No graft-versus-host disease has been observed so far and stable engraftment has been documented until day 100. METHODS: Weekly analysis of chimerism in different cellular subsets was performed using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay for nine short tandem repeat markers in leukocytes sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. RESULTS: No donor CD4+ or CD8+ T cells have been detected up to 3 months after transplantation, whereas a rapid increase of donor CD56+ natural killer (NK) cells was observed in parallel with circulating donor CD34+ progenitors and myeloid cells. CONCLUSIONS: Because the graft contained virtually no T and NK cells, we believe the rapid in vivo generation of NK cells supported stable engraftment across the HLA barrier. The differentiation of CD34+ progenitors into NK cells might be a distinct feature of megadose stem cell transplants.","['Bornhauser, M', 'Thiede, C', 'Brendel, C', 'Geissler, G', 'Oelschlagel, U', 'Neubauer, A', 'Ehninger, G']","['Bornhauser M', 'Thiede C', 'Brendel C', 'Geissler G', 'Oelschlagel U', 'Neubauer A', 'Ehninger G']","['University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Dresden, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (HLA Antigens)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD34/blood/genetics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Graft Survival/genetics/physiology', 'HLA Antigens/*blood', 'Haploidy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/physiology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy', 'Male', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",,1999/07/31 00:00,1999/07/31 00:01,['1999/07/31 00:00'],"['1999/07/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/31 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/31 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00007890-199907150-00017 [doi]'],ppublish,Transplantation. 1999 Jul 15;68(1):87-8. doi: 10.1097/00007890-199907150-00017.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We developed a strategy for reversibly immortalizing human primary myogenic cells, based on retrovirus-mediated integration of a wild-type SV40 large-T antigen (Tag), excisable by means of the Cre-Lox recombination system. Myogenic cells were transduced with a vector (LTTN-LoxP) expressing the SV40 Tag under the control of an LTR modified by the insertion of a LoxP site in the U3 region. Clonal isolates of Tag-positive cells showed modified growth characteristics and a significantly extended life span, while maintaining a full myogenic potential. Transient expression of Cre recombinase, delivered by transfection or adenoviral vector transduction, allowed excision of the entire provirus with up to >90% efficiency. Cultures of Cre-treated (Tag-) or untreated (Tag+) myogenic cells were genetically labeled with a lacZ retroviral vector, and injected into the regenerating muscle of SCID/bg immunodeficient mice. Tag- cells underwent terminal differentiation in vivo, giving rise to clusters of beta-Gal+ hybrid fibers with an efficiency comparable to that of control untransduced cells. Tag+ cells could not be detected after injection. Neither Tag+ nor Tag- cells formed tumor in this xenotransplantation model. Reversible immortalization by Tag therefore allows the expansion of primary myogenic cells in culture without compromising their ability to differentiate in vivo, and could represent a safe method by which to increase the availability of these cells for clinical application.","['Berghella, L', 'De Angelis, L', 'Coletta, M', 'Berarducci, B', 'Sonnino, C', 'Salvatori, G', 'Anthonissen, C', 'Cooper, R', 'Butler-Browne, G S', 'Mouly, V', 'Ferrari, G', 'Mavilio, F', 'Cossu, G']","['Berghella L', 'De Angelis L', 'Coletta M', 'Berarducci B', 'Sonnino C', 'Salvatori G', 'Anthonissen C', 'Cooper R', 'Butler-Browne GS', 'Mouly V', 'Ferrari G', 'Mavilio F', 'Cossu G']","['Dipartimento di Istologia ed Embriologia Medica, Universita di Roma La Sapienza, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (Antigens, Polyomavirus Transforming)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Cre recombinase)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Integrases)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Polyomavirus Transforming/*genetics', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child, Preschool', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', '*Integrases', 'Mice', '*Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Muscles/cytology', 'Oncogenes', '*Viral Proteins']",,1999/07/31 00:00,1999/07/31 00:01,['1999/07/31 00:00'],"['1999/07/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/31 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/31 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/10430349950017617 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 1999 Jul 1;10(10):1607-17. doi: 10.1089/10430349950017617.,,,"['A.067/Telethon/Italy', 'TGT06S01/Telethon/Italy']",,['Hum Gene Ther. 1999 Jul 1;10(10):1597-8.

Exposure of bone marrow-derived DC to Rauscher leukemia virus (RLV) provides a mouse model for studying retrovirally induced reduction in stimulatory capacity for T cells. Treatment with IL-12, a cytokine that promotes the development of Th1 cells, has been postulated as a treatment for AIDS and is effective at restoring cell-mediated immunity in mice infected with mouse AIDS virus or with RLV (see Knight, S. C. and Patterson, S., Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994. 15: 593-615 for references). Here we studied the direct effect of RLV and of IL-12 on bone marrow-derived DC. Normal DC produced IL-12 and IL-10 and stimulated primary allogeneic T cell proliferation. Exposure of DC to RLV caused reduced production of IL-12, production of IL-4 was seen in DC for the first time and T cell stimulation was inhibited. Addition of IL-12 reinstated and enhanced IL-12 synthesis in RLV-treated DC, abrogated production of IL-10 and IL-4 and restored stimulatory activity. Manipulation of cytokine production in DC could be a stratagem that has evolved in the retrovirus to avoid stimulation of cellular responses.","['Kelleher, P', 'Maroof, A', 'Knight, S C']","['Kelleher P', 'Maroof A', 'Knight SC']","['Antigen Presentation Research Group, Imperial College School of Medicine, Northwick Park Institute for Medical Research, Harrow, Middlesex, GB.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'DNA, Viral/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'HIV Infections/immunology', 'HIV-1', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interleukin-12/*biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-4/*biosynthesis', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Rauscher Virus/genetics/*immunology/pathogenicity', 'Th1 Cells/immunology', 'Th2 Cells/immunology']",,1999/07/31 10:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1999/07/31 10:00'],"['1999/07/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/07/31 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/(SICI)1521-4141(199907)29:07<2309::AID-IMMU2309>3.0.CO;2-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1999 Jul;29(7):2309-18. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1521-4141(199907)29:07<2309::AID-IMMU2309>3.0.CO;2-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The high-affinity human IL-6 receptor complex consists of two transmembrane anchored subunits: a ligand-specific, low-affinity IL-6 receptor and the high-affinity converter and signal transducing, gp130. Previously, using recombinant forms of human IL-6 and the extracellular ('soluble') domains of the IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) and gp130 (sgp130), we have shown that the high-affinity IL-6R complex is hexameric, consisting of two molecules each of IL-6, sIL-6R and sgp130 (Ward et al., 1994, J. Biol. Chem. 269: 23286-23289). This paper investigates the role of the N-terminal region of gp130 in the formation of the high-affinity IL-6R complex. Using recombinant sgp130 produced with a FLAG octapeptide epitope (DYKDDDDK) at the N-terminus (sgp130-FLAG), we demonstrate, using biosensor analysis and size-exclusion chromatography, that modification of the N-terminus of sgp130 interferes with the in vitro in solution formation of the stable hexameric IL-6 receptor complex. Rather, sgp130-FLAG interacts with IL-6 and sIL-6R with a much lower affinity and forms a stable lower-order ternary complex. However, this lower-order complex is inconsistent with the solution molecular weight of a trimeric complex, as measured by size-exclusion chromatography. In contrast, N-terminal modification of the sgp130 with the FLAG epitope did not interfere with the binding of leukemia inhibitory factor or oncostatin-M (other cytokines that signal through gp130) to sgp130.

METHODS: Administration of different doses of the antiprogestin mifepristone during the menstrual cycle; intermittent measurements of luteinizing hormone, progestin and estrogen in blood and/or urine; endometrial morphology and concentration of markers for endometrial receptivity; efficacy trials of the contraceptive effect of mifepristone. RESULTS: A high dose of mifepristone administered in the follicular phase will inhibit follicular development. If mifepristone is given immediately after ovulation, the secretory development of the endometrium and the expression of, for instance, leukemia inhibitory factor and integrins will be inhibited. Similar effects on the endometrium are obtained with small weekly doses (2.5 or 5.0 mg) or small daily doses (0.5 mg) of mifepristone, which do not inhibit ovulation. Once-monthly administration of 200 mg mifepristone on the day after ovulation, and emergency postcoital treatment, are highly effective methods for preventing pregnancy. Even 5 mg once weekly has a significant contraceptive effect. CONCLUSIONS: The antiprogestin mifepristone has a number of effects during the menstrual cycle which makes the compound suitable for contraceptive use. Treatment after a single act of unprotected intercourse, and once-a-month treatment immediately after ovulation, have shown high contraceptive efficacy. A low-dose regimen which does not influence ovulation also has a contraceptive effect, but the efficacy needs to be improved before routine clinical use.","['Bygdeman, M', 'Danielsson, K G', 'Marions, L', 'Swahn, M L']","['Bygdeman M', 'Danielsson KG', 'Marions L', 'Swahn ML']","['Department of Woman and Child Health, Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Eur J Contracept Reprod Health Care,The European journal of contraception & reproductive health care : the official journal of the European Society of Contraception,9712127,"['0 (Contraceptives, Oral, Synthetic)', '0 (Hormone Antagonists)', '320T6RNW1F (Mifepristone)', '4G7DS2Q64Y (Progesterone)']",IM,"['Contraceptives, Oral, Synthetic/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Endometrium/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Hormone Antagonists/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Menstrual Cycle', 'Mifepristone/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Ovulation/*drug effects', 'Progesterone/*antagonists & inhibitors']",,1999/07/31 00:00,1999/07/31 00:01,['1999/07/31 00:00'],"['1999/07/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/31 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/31 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/13625189909064011 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Contracept Reprod Health Care. 1999 Jun;4(2):103-7. doi: 10.3109/13625189909064011.,,,,24,,,,,,,,,

In addition, the MQ-580 cells had other metabolic alterations that were consistent with multidrug resistance. Neither the wild-type (WT) nor the MQ-580 cells showed a G0/G1 block in response to X-irradiation. Since the MQ-580 cells also showed resistance to adriamycin (ADR), the WT cells were more sensitive to the effects of ADR than the MQ-580 cells. However, when the MQ-580 cells were treated with the combination of ADR plus verapamil, the MQ-580 cells showed cellular responses that included cell cycle block in G2/M and increased apoptosis. The WT cells, in response to the combination of ADR plus verapamil, blocked in the S-phase of the cell cycle with an increased necrotic cell population in comparison to treatment with ADR alone. While MAIQ could be shown to cause an apoptotic response in the WT and MQ-580 cells, the concentrations of MAIQ required to induce apoptosis were 20- to 40-times the IC50 value. However, even though the MQ-580 cells were 8-fold more resistant to MAIQ than the WT cells, the MQ-580 cells were more sensitive to MAIQ-induced apoptosis. These data show that alterations at the RR site lead to phenotypic expressions not overtly related to RR. However, because of the critical role that RR plays in cell division and DNA repair, the changes observed with respect to cell cycle and apoptosis, may in fact, be a direct consequence of the alteration at RR.","['Crenshaw, T R', 'Cory, J G']","['Crenshaw TR', 'Cory JG']","['Department of Biochemistry, East Carolina University, School of Medicine, Greenville, NC 27834, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '59261-39-1 (4-methyl-5-amino-1-formylisoquinoline thiosemicarbazone)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 1.17.4.- (Ribonucleotide Reductases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/radiation effects', '*DNA Damage', 'Doxorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/genetics', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Genes, MDR', 'Isoquinolines/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy/pathology/radiotherapy', 'Mice', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Ribonucleotide Reductases/*antagonists & inhibitors']",,1999/07/31 00:00,1999/07/31 00:01,['1999/07/31 00:00'],"['1999/07/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/31 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/31 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3892/ijo.15.3.487 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 1999 Sep;15(3):487-90. doi: 10.3892/ijo.15.3.487.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Atypical lymphocytes may be seen in the peripheral blood of patients with reactive forms of erythroderma, so additional criteria are needed to establish the diagnosis of a T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. A wide variety of confirmatory tests have been proposed in the literature, but there has been no systematic attempt to compare the specificity and sensitivity of these different methods. Recent data indicate that T-cell receptor (TCR) gene analysis is the most useful test currently available and that methods based on polymerase chain reaction are more sensitive than Southern blot analysis. We propose that the diagnostic criteria for SS should include erythroderma, atypical circulating mononuclear cells, and evidence of a clonal T-cell population in the peripheral blood. Clonality can be established with certainty by cytogenetic or TCR gene analysis, but only the latter is sufficiently sensitive to be of value in routine diagnosis. Immunophenotypic data showing an expanded CD4(+)/CD7(-) population, an elevated CD4/CD8 ratio, or restricted V beta expression are not specific to T-cell malignancy and should not be used as a sole diagnostic criteria in SS.

Toxicity is thought to be exerted through oxidative metabolites formed in the liver, primarily via pathways mediated by cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1). Phenol, hydroquinone and trans-trans-muconaldehyde have all been hypothesized to be involved in benzene-induced toxicity. Recent reports indicate that benzene oxide is produced in vitro and in vivo and may be sufficiently stable to reach the bone marrow. Our goal was to improve existing mathematical models of microsomal benzene metabolism by including time course data for benzene oxide, by obtaining better parameter estimates and by determining if enzymes other than CYP2E1 are involved. Microsomes from male B6C3F1 mice and F344 rats were incubated with [(14)C]benzene (14 microM), [(14)C]phenol (303 microM) and [(14)C]hydroquinone (8 microM). Benzene and phenol were also incubated with mouse microsomes in the presence of trans-dichloroethylene, a CYP2E1 inhibitor, and benzene was incubated with trichloropropene oxide, an epoxide hydrolase inhibitor. These experiments did not indicate significant contributions of enzymes other than CYP2E1. Mathematical model parameters were fitted to rodent data and the model was validated by predicting human data. Model simulations predicted the qualitative behavior of three human time course data sets and explained up to 81% of the total variation in data from incubations of benzene for 16 min with microsomes from nine human individuals. While model predictions did deviate systematically from the data for benzene oxide and trihydroxybenzene, overall model performance in predicting the human data was good. The model should be useful in quantifying human risk due to benzene exposure and explicitly accounts for interindividual variation in CYP2E1 activity.","['Lovern, M R', 'Maris, M E', 'Schlosser, P M']","['Lovern MR', 'Maris ME', 'Schlosser PM']","['Chemical Industry Institute of Toxicology, 6 Davis Drive, PO Box 12137, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709-2137, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1 Inhibitors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Quaternary Ammonium Compounds)', '3083-23-6 (Trichloroepoxypropane)', 'CBU2X6BBJR (tetrabutylammonium)', 'EC 1.14.13.- (Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzene/*metabolism', 'Carcinogens/*metabolism', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1/*metabolism', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1 Inhibitors', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Microsomes, Liver/drug effects/*metabolism', '*Models, Biological', 'Quaternary Ammonium Compounds/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Trichloroepoxypropane/pharmacology']",,1999/07/30 00:00,1999/07/30 00:01,['1999/07/30 00:00'],"['1999/07/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/30 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/30 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/carcin/20.8.1511 [doi]'],ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 1999 Aug;20(8):1511-20. doi: 10.1093/carcin/20.8.1511.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

N-acetylcysteine increased the amount of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG), a characteristic oxidative DNA lesion, in human leukemia cell line HL-60, whereas the amount of 8-oxodG in HP100, which is a hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2))-resistant cell line derived from HL-60, was not increased. To clarify the mechanism of cellular DNA damage, we investigated DNA damage and its site specificity induced by N-acetylcysteine, using (32)P-labeled DNA fragments obtained from the human p53 tumor suppressor gene and the c-Ha-ras-1 protooncogene. N-acetylcysteine induced extensive DNA damage in the presence of Cu(II). The DNA cleavage was enhanced by piperidine treatment, suggesting that N-acetylcysteine plus Cu(II) caused not only deoxyribose phosphate backbone breakage but also base modification. N-acetylcysteine plus Cu(II) frequently modified thymine and guanine residues. Bathocuproine, a specific Cu(I) chelator, and catalase inhibited the DNA damage, indicating the participation of Cu(I) and H(2)O(2) in the DNA damage. Typical hydroxyl radical scavengers did not inhibit N-acetylcysteine plus Cu(II)-induced DNA damage, whereas methional completely inhibited it. These results suggest that reactive species derived from the reaction of H(2)O(2) with Cu(I) participates in N-acetylcysteine plus Cu(II)-induced DNA damage. The content of 8-oxodG in calf thymus DNA was increased by N-acetylcysteine in the presence of Cu(II). The present study has demonstrated that N-acetylcysteine could induce metal-dependent H(2)O(2) generation and, subsequently, damage to cellular and isolated DNA. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider that N-acetylcysteine may have the dual function of carcinogenic and anti-carcinogenic potentials.

In vitro, XK469 demonstrated selective cytotoxicity for several murine solid tumors including colorectal and mammary adenocarcinoma cell lines, when compared to both leukemia and normal epithelial cells. In vivo, XK469 was active against 7/7 murine tumors tested, including pancreatic ductal carcinomas #02 and #03, colon adenocarcinomas #38 and #51/A, mammary adenocarcinoma #16/C and the Adriamycin resistant mammary adenocarcinomas #16/C/ADR and #17/ADR. XK469 was efficacious both intravenously and orally. Regardless of dosing schedule, conventional mice tolerated higher total doses than SCID or nu/nu mice did. Despite these reduced doses, XK469 was active against xenografts of 4/6 human tumor lines including mammary adenocarcinoma MX-1, the small cell lung cancer DMS 273, the prostate model LNCaP and the CNS tumor SF295. The lower doses in the xenograft studies were below curative levels. The dose-limiting toxicity appeared to be myelosuppression with rapid host recovery (5-8 days), and in vitro assays of XK469 toxicity to murine bone marrow neutrophil progenitors CFU-GM (colony forming unit-granulocyte/macrophage) demonstrated concentration-dependent toxicity from 0.5-30 microg/mL. The difference in drug tolerance between BDF1 and SCID mice was detected in vitro as a 3-fold difference in the IC90 for CFU-GM, despite similar IC50 values. Comparative in vitro hematotoxicology studies revealed that human bone marrow CFU-GM tolerated XK469 as well as their SCID counterparts (IC90 values 5.7 vs. 7.4 microg/mL). Based on comparison with previously tested anti-cancer agents, these data suggest that humans will be able to tolerate XK469 doses that are efficacious against human tumor xenografts.","['LoRusso, P M', 'Parchment, R', 'Demchik, L', 'Knight, J', 'Polin, L', 'Dzubow, J', 'Behrens, C', 'Harrison, B', 'Trainor, G', 'Corbett, T H']","['LoRusso PM', 'Parchment R', 'Demchik L', 'Knight J', 'Polin L', 'Dzubow J', 'Behrens C', 'Harrison B', 'Trainor G', 'Corbett TH']","['Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI 48201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Quinoxalines)', '0 (XK 469)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Quinoxalines/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/07/30 00:00,1999/07/30 00:01,['1999/07/30 00:00'],"['1999/07/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/30 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/30 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1006206814025 [doi]'],ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 1998-1999;16(4):287-96. doi: 10.1023/a:1006206814025.,,,"['CA46560/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA46560/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UO1 CA62487/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,

HR was defined in children with ALL, younger than 2 or older than 10 years, with or without initial extrahematopoietic disease, with a leukocyte count higher than 25 x 10(9)L, or with L3 FAB type. The first group, LAL1, included 67 patients; they received induction with vincristine (VCR) and prednisone (PDN), early consolidation with 3 cycles of 6-mercaptopurine (6MP), citarabine (ARA) and VCR: central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis (PFX) consisted of both chemotherapy in induction, consolidation and maintenance, radiotherapy (RT) in consolidation. Maintenance was given with 6MP, methotrexate (MTX), VCR adriamycin (ADR), ARA, cyclophosphamide (CFA) and PDN. The second group, LAL2, with 45 patients, received induction with VCR, PDN, CFA, epirrubicin (EPI), L-Asparaginase (L-ASP); early and late consolidation with 6MP, ARA, VCR, carmustine (BCNU), CFA, EPI, MTX and teniposide 8VM26): CNS PFX consisted of both chemotherapy in induction, consolidation and maintenance, RT in consolidation, maintenance with 6MP, MTX, EPI, CFA, ARA VM26 and BCNU. At the time of diagnosis, both groups were comparable. Disease-free survival probability, for LAL1 group was 0.41 at 14 years and for LAL2 group 0.34 at 8 years (p = 0.45). In the LAL1 group there were three failures and 20 relapses, and in the LAL2 group, there were two failures and 22 relapses. CNS relapses were one and seven in LAL1 and LAL2 groups respectively (p = 0.04). In the LAL2, group relapses were more frequent in patients with dose reduction or difered dose due to marrow toxicity (p = 0.02). We believe that the increase in CNS relapse in the LAL2 group was caused by the late administration of CNS PFX. We also believe that although intensive chemotherapy can increase long-term survival, dose adjustments due to marrow toxicity have a negative effect on long-term, relapse-free survival.","['de Diego-Floreschapa, J', 'Lopez-Hernandez, M', 'Borbolla-Escoboza, J R', 'Trueba-Christy, E', 'Carrillo-Rosales, T', 'Gonzalez-Avante, M']","['de Diego-Floreschapa J', 'Lopez-Hernandez M', 'Borbolla-Escoboza JR', 'Trueba-Christy E', 'Carrillo-Rosales T', 'Gonzalez-Avante M']","['Servicio de Hematologia, Centro Medico Nacional 20 de Noviembre, Mexico, D.F.']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Mexico,Gac Med Mex,Gaceta medica de Mexico,0010333,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Recurrence']",,1999/07/30 00:00,1999/07/30 00:01,['1999/07/30 00:00'],"['1999/07/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/30 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/30 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Gac Med Mex. 1999 May-Jun;135(3):253-8.,,,,,,Seguimiento a largo plazo de dos programas terapeuticos para el tratamiento de la leucemia aguda linfoblastica infantil de riesgo alto.

Interpatient variations in concentrations of both metabolites were high; concentrations of 6-TGN varied from <60 to 833 pmol/8x10(8) RBC (median value, 144) and those of 6-mMP metabolites from <150 to 19000 pmol/8x10(8) RBC (median value, 3250). In two patients, 6-TGN appeared at concentrations below the limits of assay sensitivity, and 6-mMP metabolites were not detected. In another child the concentrations of both metabolites were at the limit of the assay sensitivity. In three other children the concentrations of both metabolites were below the median value of the group. In the analysed group of children, significant correlations were found between the white cell count (WBC) and RBC 6-TGN (r(s)=-0.72, P<0. 005) as well as between the neutrophil count and RBC 6-TGN (r(s)=-0.60, P<0.01). No significant correlation was found between the concentrations of 6-TGN and 6-mMP metabolites. The monitoring of concentrations of 6-TGN as well as of 6-mMP metabolites allows an early identification of patients who are at an increased risk of the disease relapse as indicated by the low levels of either 6-TGN itself or of its two metabolites.","['Chrzanowska, M', 'Kolecki, P', 'Duczmal-Cichocka, B', 'Fiet, J']","['Chrzanowska M', 'Kolecki P', 'Duczmal-Cichocka B', 'Fiet J']","['Department of Physical Chemistry, Karol Marcinkowski University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland. mchrzan@eucalyptus.usoms.Poznan.pl']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Eur J Pharm Sci,European journal of pharmaceutical sciences : official journal of the European Federation for Pharmaceutical Sciences,9317982,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotides)', '6V404DV25O (6-methylthiopurine)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*blood', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Erythrocytes/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Guanine Nucleotides/*blood', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/*blood', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/drug therapy', 'Thioguanine/*blood']",,1999/07/30 00:00,1999/07/30 00:01,['1999/07/30 00:00'],"['1999/07/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/30 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/30 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0928-0987(99)00027-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s0928-0987(99)00027-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharm Sci. 1999 Aug;8(4):329-34. doi: 10.1016/s0928-0987(99)00027-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the research in this methodological area is at an initial phase. Hence, adequate techniques for survival curve extrapolation still need to be devised for handling the different clinical settings that can be analysed by cost-effectiveness survival studies. After a brief overview of the two most commonly used extrapolation methods (Markov decision-tree model and Gompertz technique), we describe a new method for expressing lifetime survival in cost-effectiveness studies that evaluate cancer patients. Our method extrapolates to infinity a traditional survival curve by assigning a normal life expectancy to patients (or long-term survivors). In this way, the value of mean lifetime survival (MLS) for the patient cohort under study can be determined using a lifetime perspective. This value can be employed in lifetime cost-effectiveness analyses that compare different forms of intervention for that disease condition. A separate section of our method compares the overall survival pattern of cured and not cured patients with that of a reference healthy population to assess the impact of the disease on life expectancy. As an example of the application of our method, we reanalysed a survival data set reported by Spinolo et al in 1992, that refers to patients with acute leukaemia who relapsed after their first allogeneic bone marrow transplantation and who received a second transplant (n=17, mean age at relapse = 26 years). The use of our extrapolation method provided the following results: MLS for leukaemia patients = 105.9 months per patient or 8.8 years per patient; MLS for the reference cohort of healthy subjects = 583.8 months per patient or 48.6 years per patient. We conclude that the extrapolation technique described herein can be useful to handle lifetime survival data in cost-effectiveness analysis.","['Messori, A', 'Trippoli, S']","['Messori A', 'Trippoli S']","['Laboratorio di Farmacoeconomia, c/o Drug Information Centre, Azienda Careggi, 50134 Firenze, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,,IM,"['Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Humans', 'Life Expectancy', 'Methods', 'Neoplasms/*economics/*physiopathology', 'Survival Analysis']",,1999/07/30 00:00,1999/07/30 00:01,['1999/07/30 00:00'],"['1999/07/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/30 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/30 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3892/or.6.5.1135 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 1999 Sep-Oct;6(5):1135-41. doi: 10.3892/or.6.5.1135.,,,,34,,,,,,,,,

These findings suggest that HSC70 is necessary for the entry of HTLV-I into its target cells. Here we showed that HSC70 directly binds to gp46 by co-immunoprecipitation of HSC70 and gp46 from HTLV-I-producing human T-cell lysate. However, transduction of human HSC70 cDNA into BaF3 cells, which were found to be highly resistant to HTLV-I infection, did not support the HTLV-I entry, and HSC70 expressed in NIH3T3 cells, which were found to be almost resistant to syncytium formation upon cocultivation with HTLV-I-producing cells but sensitive to infection with cell-free HTLV-I, enhanced cell fusion induced by HTLV-I-producing cells, but did not enhance the entry of cell-free HTLV-I into these cells. The mAb against HSC70 inhibited syncytium formation in NIH3T3 cells expressing HSC70, but showed little effect on infection of these cells with cell-free HTLV-I. These findings indicate that HSC70 markedly enhances syncytium formation induced by HTLV-I but does not facilitate HTLV-I entry into target cells.","['Fang, D', 'Haraguchi, Y', 'Jinno, A', 'Soda, Y', 'Shimizu, N', 'Hoshino, H']","['Fang D', 'Haraguchi Y', 'Jinno A', 'Soda Y', 'Shimizu N', 'Hoshino H']","['Department of Virology and Preventive Medicine, Gunma University School of Medicine, Showa-machi, Maebashi, Gunma, 371-8511, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (HSC70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (HSPA8 protein, human)', '0 (Hspa8 protein, mouse)', '0 (Hspa8 protein, rat)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (gp46 protein, Human T-cell leukemia virus type I)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/immunology/*physiology', 'Cats', 'Cell Fusion/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Gene Products, env/genetics/physiology', 'Giant Cells/pathology/physiology', 'HSC70 Heat-Shock Proteins', '*HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Rats', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/genetics/physiology', 'Transduction, Genetic']",,1999/07/30 00:00,1999/07/30 00:01,['1999/07/30 00:00'],"['1999/07/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/30 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/30 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/bbrc.1999.1028 [doi]', 'S0006-291X(99)91028-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1999 Aug 2;261(2):357-63. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.1999.1028.,['Copyright 1999 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

There was an increased risk of leukaemia in relation to reported influenza infection of the child during the first year of life (adjusted odds ratio 6.8, 95% confidence interval 1.8-25.7). This could be a chance finding due to multiple comparisons, and it should be tested elsewhere.

Our results have shown that THP of ALL or NHL patients, in comparison with healthy subjects, have modified sugar chains. This is expressed in lower contents of N-acetylgalactosamine, alpha2,6-linked sialic acid and alpha1,6-linked fucose as well as in altered proportions of various N-glycans. We have shown that pathological processes also affect the carbohydrate unit of human immunoglobulin G (IgG) isolated from sera of ALL or NHL patients. As compared with healthy subjects, in IgG of the patient group, lower amounts of sialic acid and fucose were observed. These changes did not influence the biological properties of THP as judged by their unaltered ability to bind with interleukin-1alpha, alpha1-acid glycoprotein, serum albumin, transferrin, IgG1 and the light and heavy chains of IgG.

We therefore investigated the expression of redox-regulating proteins such as glutaredoxin (GRX) and thioredoxin (TRX) during the differentiation of murine monocytic leukemia cell line M1 cells and human monocytic leukemia cell line U937 cells. When M1 cells were treated by IL-6, GRX mRNA markedly increased and TRX mRNA also increased slightly. In contrast, there was no increase of GRX mRNA in D-cell, which is a sub-cell line derived from M1 lacking in the capacity of differentiation. GRX mRNA also increased in U937 cells differentiated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). By immunohistochemistry, unstimulated M1 cells showed strong staining of TRX and marginal staining of GRX. In contrast, TRX expression in IL-6 treated M1 cells is as strong as in unstimulated M1 cells, whereas GRX expression is slightly enhanced in IL-6 treated M1 cells. Phagocytosis is markedly enhanced and hydrogen peroxide production is slightly enhanced in IL-6 treated M1 cells. These results showed that TRX is steadily expressed whereas GRX is induced in association with the differentiation in macrophage-like cell line cells, suggesting differential roles of these redox regulators in macrophage lineage.","['Takashima, Y', 'Hirota, K', 'Nakamura, H', 'Nakamura, T', 'Akiyama, K', 'Cheng, F S', 'Maeda, M', 'Yodoi, J']","['Takashima Y', 'Hirota K', 'Nakamura H', 'Nakamura T', 'Akiyama K', 'Cheng FS', 'Maeda M', 'Yodoi J']","['Department of Biological Responses, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Sakyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Immunol Lett,Immunology letters,7910006,"['0 (GLRX protein, human)', '0 (Glutaredoxins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '52500-60-4 (Thioredoxins)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.- (Oxidoreductases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Glutaredoxins', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Macrophages/*cytology/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Monocytes/*cytology/drug effects', '*Oxidoreductases', '*Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proteins/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Thioredoxins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells']",,1999/07/29 00:00,1999/07/29 00:01,['1999/07/29 00:00'],"['1999/07/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/29 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/29 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0165-2478(99)00087-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-2478(99)00087-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Immunol Lett. 1999 Jun 1;68(2-3):397-401. doi: 10.1016/s0165-2478(99)00087-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So we report a neutropenic acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient complicated with otomycosis caused by superinfection. A 51-year-old male was admitted because a third relapse of AML in March 1998. Two years ago, he was diagnosed as having chronic otitis media involving the VII cranial nerve due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa coinciding with AML. Then, he had suffered from a right-sided earache and otic discharge in accord with every myelosuppression, which improved on treatment with otic administration of ofloxacin. After 1 course of induction chemotherapy, he developed a spiking fever with severe earache and otic discharge at a nadir period of WBC. Ear swab cultures yielded Aspergillus niger and yeast-like fungi. So, he was treated with intravenous administration of amphotericin B (AMPH-B): initial dose was 5 mg/day and was gradually increased to 30 mg/day. Thereafter, the otic symptoms subsided and never recurred. Subsequently, he was given another antifungal agent, itraconazole. Although induction chemotherapies resulted in failure, he did not suffer otic symptoms until his death due to cerebral bleeding in January 1999. For neutropenic patients without rapid hematological improvement, we recommend intensive antifungal therapy as the first-line of therapy for otomycosis rather than local therapy.","['Itoh, K', 'Takahashi, M', 'Yagasaki, F', 'Endoh, K', 'Wakao, D', 'Kawai, N', 'Tominaga, K', 'Kusumoto, S', 'Fukuda, M', 'Bessho, M', 'Enomoto, H']","['Itoh K', 'Takahashi M', 'Yagasaki F', 'Endoh K', 'Wakao D', 'Kawai N', 'Tominaga K', 'Kusumoto S', 'Fukuda M', 'Bessho M', 'Enomoto H']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Saitama Medical School.']",['jpn'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Kansenshogaku Zasshi,Kansenshogaku zasshi.

Bufalin induced apoptosis in human monocytic leukemia THP-1 cells, in human lymphoblastic leukemia MOLT-3 cells, and in human colon adenocarcinoma COLO320DM cells but not in normal human leukocytes, for example, polymorphonuclear cells and lymphocytes, and not in murine leukemia P388D1 and M1 cells. Treatment for 3 h with bufalin at 10(-6) M caused a decrease in the plasma membrane potential in several lines of human tumor cells but not in murine leukemia cells. No changes in mitochondrial membrane potential, as monitored with the fluorescent dye JC-1, and no release of cytochrome c were observed within at least 6 h after the start of treatment with bufalin. Moreover, overexpression of bcl-2 in human leukemia HL60 cells that had been transfected with cDNA for bcl-2 prevented bufalin-induced apoptosis but had no significant effect on the change in plasma membrane potential induced by bufalin. Since bufalin specifically inhibits the Na+,K(+)-ATPase of human but not murine tumor cells, and since this inhibition leads to a change in intracellular concentration of Na+ ions, our findings suggest that bufalin induces apoptosis in human tumor cells selectively via inhibition of the Na+,K(+)-ATPase, which acts upstream of the bcl-2 protein.","['Kawazoe, N', 'Aiuchi, T', 'Masuda, Y', 'Nakajo, S', 'Nakaya, K']","['Kawazoe N', 'Aiuchi T', 'Masuda Y', 'Nakajo S', 'Nakaya K']","['Laboratory of Biological Chemistry, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Showa University, Shinagawa-ku, Tokyo, 142-8555, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Biochem,Journal of biochemistry,0376600,"['0 (Bufanolides)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Ions)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', 'EC 7.2.2.13 (Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase)', 'U549S98QLW (bufalin)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Bufanolides/*pharmacology', 'Cytochrome c Group/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Ions', 'Kinetics', 'Leukocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Monocytes/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sodium/*metabolism', 'Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/07/29 00:00,1999/07/29 00:01,['1999/07/29 00:00'],"['1999/07/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/29 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a022446 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biochem. 1999 Aug;126(2):278-86. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a022446.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its cytostatic activity was found to be 8- to 20-fold more pronounced than that of PMEDAP and equivalent to that of the guanine derivative 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl)guanine (PMEG) against a variety of tumor cell lines. Unlike PMEDAP, but like PMEG, cPr-PMEDAP was equally cytostatic to wild-type and 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl)adenine/PMEDAP-resistant variants of the human erythroleukemia K562 and the murine leukemia L1210 cell lines. Also, cPr-PMEDAP and PMEG proved to be equipotent inducers of K562 and rat choriocarcinoma RCHO cell differentiation, whereas the differentiation-inducing activity of PMEDAP was 5- to 25-fold less pronounced. Furthermore, compared to PMEDAP, cPr-PMEDAP and PMEG were 10- to 25-fold more potent in inhibiting the progression of K562 cells through the S phase of the cell cycle, resulting in a marked accumulation of the four 2'-deoxyribonucleoside 5'-triphosphate pools. The biological effects of cPr-PMEDAP, but not PMEDAP, were reversed by the adenylate deaminase inhibitor 2'-deoxycoformycin (dCF). Formation of the deaminated derivative of cPr-PMEDAP (i.e. PMEG) was demonstrated in crude extracts from K562 and L1210 cells and in metabolism studies with radiolabeled cPr-PMEDAP and PMEG. This is the very first example of an acyclic nucleoside phosphonate analogue that is susceptible to deamination. However, cPr-PMEDAP was not recognized as a substrate by purified adenosine deaminase or by adenylate deaminase. These findings might point to an as yet unidentified cellular enzyme, sensitive to dCF but different from the common adenosine and AMP deaminases. Our data demonstrate the superior antiproliferative and differentiation-inducing effects of cPr-PMEDAP on tumor cells, as compared to the parent compound PMEDAP, based on the unique metabolic properties of this novel compound.","['Hatse, S', 'Naesens, L', 'De Clercq, E', 'Balzarini, J']","['Hatse S', 'Naesens L', 'De Clercq E', 'Balzarini J']","['Laboratory of Virology and Experimental Chemotherapy, Rega Institute for Medical Research, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Deoxyadenine Nucleotides)', '0 (N(6)-cyclopropyl-9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl)-2,6-diaminopurine)', '0 (Organophosphonates)', '0 (Organophosphorus Compounds)', '0 (Prodrugs)', '114088-58-3 (9-((2-phosphonylmethoxy)ethyl)guanine)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 3.5.4.4 (Adenosine Deaminase)', 'EC 3.5.4.6 (AMP Deaminase)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)', ""K8KCC8SH6N (2'-deoxyadenosine triphosphate)""]",IM,"['AMP Deaminase/metabolism', 'Adenine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Adenosine Deaminase/metabolism', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Deoxyadenine Nucleotides/metabolism', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Erythrocytes/drug effects/pathology', 'Guanine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia L1210/pathology', 'Mice', 'Organophosphonates/*pharmacology', 'Organophosphorus Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Pentostatin/pharmacology', 'Prodrugs/*pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/07/28 00:00,1999/07/28 00:01,['1999/07/28 00:00'],"['1999/07/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/28 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/28 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(99)00091-X [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(99)00091-x [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1999 Jul 15;58(2):311-23. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(99)00091-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The uptake of [14C]HMAF had two components: a rapid phase (0-10 min) and a slow phase. At 10 microM drug (37 degrees), the rapid and slower phase amounted to 0.86 and 0.13 pmol/min/10(6)cells, respectively. HMAF uptake was inhibited 82% by low temperature (4 degrees) at 4 hr. Cell-associated HMAF localized to nuclear (50%), cytoplasmic (37%), and membrane fractions (10%). Continued drug uptake appeared to be driven by covalent binding to cellular macromolecules. Approximately 1/4 and 2/3 of cell-associated HMAF formed covalent adducts after 10 min and 4 hr, respectively, as found by perchloric acid precipitation. Drug adducts were not readily reversible; 77% of the covalently bound radiolabel was retained by the cells 20 hr after drug treatment. Combinations of DNase, RNase, and proteinase K with perchloric acid precipitation showed that approximately 60, 30, and 10% of the covalently bound drug was associated with the protein, DNA, and RNA fractions, respectively.

Analyses of ATM mutations in A-T patients and in sporadic tumors suggest the existence of two classes of ATM mutation: null mutations that lead to A-T and dominant negative missense mutations that may predispose to cancer in the heterozygous state.","['Meyn, M S']",['Meyn MS'],"['Department of Paediatrics, University of Toronto, Genetics and Genomic Biology Program, The Hospital for Sick Children, ON, Canada. meyn@sickkids.on.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",Denmark,Clin Genet,Clinical genetics,0253664,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Atm protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia/diagnosis/*genetics/therapy', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Breast Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Male', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proteins/*genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,1999/07/28 00:00,1999/07/28 00:01,['1999/07/28 00:00'],"['1999/07/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/28 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/28 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1034/j.1399-0004.1999.550501.x [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Genet. 1999 May;55(5):289-304. doi: 10.1034/j.1399-0004.1999.550501.x.,,,['R01 CA60592/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],181,,,,,,,,,

Recent advances in molecular biology have allowed structural and functional characterization of many of these genomic rearrangements. In many instances, AML is associated with gene fusion, whereby segments from two different genes fuse to give rise to a chimeric structure consisting of the 5' end of one gene and the 3' end of another. Recombinant DNA technology has also permitted the creation of animal models for in vivo studies of the leukemogenic role of several of these chimeric proteins. This review presents current information on the molecular biology and the clinical significance of three of the most common molecular subtypes of AML. In the first two, t(8;21)(q22;q22) and inv(16)(p13q22), disruption of genes encoding for subunits of core-binding factor (CBF), a transcriptional regulator of normal hematopoiesis, occurs, suggesting a common leukemogenic pathway. The third subgroup is characterized by disruption of MLL, a gene that is located at chromosome band 11q23 and encodes a putative transcriptional regulator. This gene is commonly involved in reciprocal translocations of chromosome 11q23 with other gene partners, but, in some instances, MLL disruption occurs by a mechanism of partial tandem duplication, in the absence of any other partner gene. Current data suggest that identification of specific genetic abnormalities in newly diagnosed AML patients is important to predict clinical outcome and, perhaps, to select different therapeutic strategies. The predictive value of detecting these molecular markers to predict cure or relapse in AML patients in complete remission following definitive treatment is still uncertain.","['Strout, M P', 'Marcucci, G', 'Caligiuri, M A', 'Bloomfield, C D']","['Strout MP', 'Marcucci G', 'Caligiuri MA', 'Bloomfield CD']","['Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Core Binding Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Core Binding Factors', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', '*Neoplasm Proteins', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",,1999/07/28 00:00,1999/07/28 00:01,['1999/07/28 00:00'],"['1999/07/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/28 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/28 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002770050511 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 1999 Jun;78(6):251-64. doi: 10.1007/s002770050511.,,,['P30 CA16058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],123,,,,,,,,,

The inhibition was due to blocking the cell mitosis. The cell death was accompanied by internucleosomal degradation of the DNA nuclei i.e. the death was of the apoptosis type.

Our findings demonstrated: (1) Regardless of sensitivity to ADM, most of the cell lines, including ADM-resistant cell lines, carried wild-type p53. (2) Only one cell line, ED-S, which was the most sensitive to ADM carried non-functional mutated-type p53. (3) In the ATL cells carrying wild-type p53, regardless of sensitivity to ADM, ADM-treatment led to an elevation of p53 protein level with concomitant elevations of p21 and Bax protein levels. (4) In the cell line expressing mutated-type p53, ADM-treatment at the concentration of IC50 induced elevations of p53, and Bax protein levels but did not p21 protein level. (5) Expression of Bcl-2 protein did not change in any of the cell lines by treatment with ADM at their respective IC50 levels, but increased in the ADM-resistant cell line when it was treated with ADM at IC50 of its parent cell line. (6) In the cell cycle analysis, ADM-treatment induced G1- and G2-arrest and then apoptosis in the cell lines with wild-type p53, whereas it induced only G2-arrest and then apoptosis in the cell line with mutated-type p53 at the same time course as in those with wild-type p53. These findings suggest that p53 does not play a leading part either in the apoptosis induced by ADM, or in the acquisition of resistance to ADM in ATL cells, and that ADM-induced apoptosis is mediated by multiple pathways leading to the activation of effector molecules.","['Cho, Y']",['Cho Y'],"['Department of Pediatrics, Hokkaido University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Hokkaido Igaku Zasshi,[Hokkaido igaku zasshi] The Hokkaido journal of medical science,17410290R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['*Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', '*Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Genes, p53/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/07/28 00:00,1999/07/28 00:01,['1999/07/28 00:00'],"['1999/07/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/28 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/28 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Hokkaido Igaku Zasshi. 1999 May;74(3):239-48.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From these findings, we concluded that monitoring the WT1 expression level is a useful means of determining the effectiveness of chemotherapy, and that WT1 is an effective marker for the detection of MRD, especially in acute myeloid leukemia patients with AML1/MTG8.","['Kusumoto, S', 'Murohashi, I', 'Bessho, M', 'Matsumoto, H', 'Shimazu, M']","['Kusumoto S', 'Murohashi I', 'Bessho M', 'Matsumoto H', 'Shimazu M']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Saitama Medical School.']",['jpn'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*analysis', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/blood', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genes, Wilms Tumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis', '*Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/analysis/blood', 'Transcription Factors/*analysis/*blood', 'WT1 Proteins', 'Wilms Tumor/*genetics']",,1999/07/28 00:00,1999/07/28 00:01,['1999/07/28 00:00'],"['1999/07/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/28 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/28 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 1999 Jun;40(6):511-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: This exhaustive and retrospective survey was carried out between 1985 and 1995 in children aged under 14 at the time of diagnosis and living inside a 35 kilometer zone around the nuclear site. 656 practitioners, 109 medical analysis laboratories and 5 hospitals or cancer institutes were investigated. A panel of experts checked each case. RESULTS: 48 cases of acute leukemia (39 acute lymphoid leukemia and 9 acute myeloid leukemia), 15 cases of lymphoma (8 Hodgkin lymphomas--53%--and 7 non hodgkinian lymphomas including 5 Burkitt lymphomas), 1 case of chronic myeloid leukemia and 1 case of papillary thyroid cancer, appeared among the 1,116,442 children-years followed. The total incidences of leukemias and lymphomas were respectively 4.12 and 1.29.10(-5). Standardised Incidence Ratios, calculated according to Poisson methods and bayesian inference, with various reference rates did not show any excess of risk: 100.67 (95% confidence interval 72-131) for leukemia. Children under 5 years old and living in non exposed areas to dominant winds or downstream rhodanian water drawing presented a 3 or 4 fold decreased risk of leukemia than others (the latter still having an identical risk to that of the general population). This was not true for lymphomas, nor for the other age groups. CONCLUSION: Over the entire zone, children do not have an increased risk of malignant hematology disease but health monitoring by a systematic collection of cases remains useful around Marcoule. The assumption of aquiferous or air contamination thus still remains questionable: further studies investigating models of contamination are needed to take into account all other nonionizing leucemogenic factors (benzene and viral injection in particular) or correlation studies between health indicators and dosimetry.","['Bouges, S', 'Daures, J P', 'Hebrard, M']","['Bouges S', 'Daures JP', 'Hebrard M']","[""Laboratoire d'Epidemiologie et de Biostatistiques-Institut Universitaire de Recherche Clinique de l'Universite Montpellier I.""]",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",France,Rev Epidemiol Sante Publique,Revue d'epidemiologie et de sante publique,7608039,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Age Distribution', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'France/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Lymphoma/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', '*Nuclear Energy', 'Population Surveillance', '*Power Plants', 'Residence Characteristics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/*epidemiology/*etiology']",,1999/07/28 00:00,1999/07/28 00:01,['1999/07/28 00:00'],"['1999/07/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/28 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/28 00:00 [entrez]']",['MDOI-RESP-06-1999-47-3-0398-7620-101019-ART2 [pii]'],ppublish,Rev Epidemiol Sante Publique. 1999 Jun;47(3):205-17.,,,,,,"Incidence des leucemies aigues, lymphomes et cancers thyroidiens chez les enfants de moins de 15 ans vivant autour du site nucleaire de Marcoule de 1985 a 1995.",,,,,,,

A method based on electrospray mass spectrometry was developed for the determination of 4-HNE at cellular levels. Quantification was carried out by using HNE-d(11) as internal standard; the mass chromatograms were acquired in the single ion monitoring mode (SIM) on the [M + H](+) monoisotopic species for HNE and HNE-d(11). With this approach a higher precision and lower detection limit and biological sample size than those typical of the methods so far employed are achieved. Furthermore the determination of the analyte from the cell extract is directly performed without the need of any HNE derivatization.

Thoracic Surgeons of CALGB.,201-7,"BACKGROUND: Aggressive routine surgical staging is necessary to evaluate patients to be treated on cooperative oncology protocols. Less than 1% of lung cancer patients in the United States are currently being treated in a clinical trial. Only with results from large, prospective trials can the questions of neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy be answered. METHODS: An outline describing the schema of preoperative patient evaluation, surgical staging, and the definition of surgical staging and resection procedures appropriate for patients considered for cooperative group protocol is presented. Current Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) protocols are used in the discussion as examples of this systematic approach. CONCLUSIONS: Over the next few years, it will be important to enter the maximum number of patients into combined modality studies to identify the role of neoadjuvant treatment in lung cancer. Entry of patients into protocols will also make their pathological specimens and clinical information available for basic science research related to treatment results. Adherence to a logical sequence of patient evaluation as outlined above will optimize patient care, as well as accrual to cooperative group studies.","['Krasna, M J', 'Reed, C E', 'Nugent, W C', 'Olak, J', 'Sugarbaker, D J', 'Green, M R', 'Kohman, L J']","['Krasna MJ', 'Reed CE', 'Nugent WC', 'Olak J', 'Sugarbaker DJ', 'Green MR', 'Kohman LJ']","['Division of Thoracic Surgery, University of Maryland Medical School, Baltimore 21201, USA. mkrasna@surgery1.ab.umd.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Ann Thorac Surg,The Annals of thoracic surgery,15030100R,,IM,"['Clinical Trials as Topic/*standards', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/pathology/surgery/*therapy', 'Neoplasm Staging/standards', '*Patient Selection']",,1999/07/27 00:00,1999/07/27 00:01,['1999/07/27 00:00'],"['1999/07/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/27 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/27 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0003497599002271 [pii]', '10.1016/s0003-4975(99)00227-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Thorac Surg. 1999 Jul;68(1):201-7. doi: 10.1016/s0003-4975(99)00227-1.,,,,,['Ann Thorac Surg. 1999 Jul;68(1):2-3.

In this study, we investigate which protein is preferentially overexpressed in the function of doxorubicin concentrations in the acute myelogenous leukemia cell line (OCI/AML-2). Multidrug-resistant AML-2 sublines were isolated in doxorubicin concentrations of 20, 100, 250, and 500 ng/ml. MRP was at first expressed at low concentrations of less than 5 x IC50 (100 ng/ml) of doxorubicin followed by the overexpression of Pgp with concentrations of more than 12.5 x IC50 (250 ng/ml) of doxorubicin. In addition, it appeared that increased amounts of MRP and its mRNA in AML-2/DX20 and /DX100 decreased gradually in both AML-2/DX250 and /DX500 overexpressing Pgp. In conclusion, it is thought that the overexpression of MRP or Pgp is dependent upon drug concentrations.

Our results support the idea of the accumulation of DNA topoisomerase IIalpha at the end of the cell cycle. The extractions of nuclei with 25 mM Lis led to the complete depletion of DNA topoisomerase IIalpha from the residual nuclear matrix.

Genes related to trp (transient receptor potential) are proposed to encode store-operated channels. We examined the ionic permeation of recombinant channels formed by stable and transient expression of the TRP homologue bCCE1 in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (CHO(CCE1)) and rat basophilic leukaemia (RBL) cells, respectively. 2. Store-operated currents were activated in CHO(CCE1) cells by internal dialysis of IP3 under strong buffering of intracellular Ca2+. The action of IP3 was mimicked by thapsigargin but not by IP4. 3. With extracellular Ca2+, Na+ and Mg2+, the store-operated currents of CHO(CCE1) rectified inwardly in the presence of internal Cs+. Outward currents were not detected below +80 mV. Identical currents were recorded with external Ba2+ and also with no external Na+ and Mg2+. In the absence of external Mg2+, the inward currents showed an anomalous mole fraction behaviour between Ca2+ and Na+. Half-maximal inhibition of Na+ currents was observed with approximately 100 nM and full block with 2-5 microM external Ca2+. 4. In the parental CHO(-) cells, IP3 dialysis evoked inward currents that also displayed anomalous mole fraction behaviour between Ca2+ and Na+. However, half-maximal block of Na+ currents required 5 times higher Ca2+ concentrations in CHO(-) cells. Additionally, the density of Ca2+ and Na+ currents at -80 mV was 5 and 2 times larger in CHO(CCE1) cells, respectively. 5. In RBL cells, dialysis of IP3 evoked store-operated currents that showed 1.4-fold larger densities at -80 mV in cells expressing bCCE1. 6. The enhanced density of store-operated currents in CHO(CCE1) cells and in bCCE1-transfected RBL cells probably reflects the phenotype of CCE1. These results suggest a highly selective permeation of Ca2+ through recombinant channels formed by CCE1 either alone or in combination with endogenous channel proteins.","['Warnat, J', 'Philipp, S', 'Zimmer, S', 'Flockerzi, V', 'Cavalie, A']","['Warnat J', 'Philipp S', 'Zimmer S', 'Flockerzi V', 'Cavalie A']","['Institut fur Pharmakologie und Toxikologie, Universitat des Saarlandes, D-66421 Homburg/Saar, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Physiol,The Journal of physiology,0266262,"['0 (Calcium Channels)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '85166-31-0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CHO Cells', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calcium Channels/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cattle', 'Cricetinae', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate/pharmacology', 'Ion Channel Gating/physiology', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/metabolism', 'Magnesium/metabolism', 'Membrane Potentials/physiology', 'Patch-Clamp Techniques', 'Phenotype', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Sodium/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC2269459,1999/07/27 00:00,1999/07/27 00:01,['1999/07/27 00:00'],"['1999/07/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/27 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/27 00:00 [entrez]']","['PHY_9455 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1469-7793.1999.0631p.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Physiol. 1999 Aug 1;518 ( Pt 3):631-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1469-7793.1999.0631p.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the possibility of genetic alteration of p73 in leukemia and lymphoma, we examined 55 cell lines and 39 patient samples together with 17 nonhematopoietic cancer cell lines. Gene expression of p73 was detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in cell lines (5 of 7 pre B/B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL], 13 of 21 T-ALL/lymphoblastic lymphomas [LBL], 9 of 10 B-non-Hodgkin's lymphomas [B-NHL], 8 of 9 acute myelogenous leukemias [AML], 2 of 2 T-NHL, 3 of 3 multiple myeloma), and in patient samples (16 of 23 pre B-ALL, 5 of 8 T-ALL/LBL, 5 of 8 B-NHL). PCR-single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) of cDNAs showed no mutation in 43 p73-expressing cell lines within the regions that corresponded to the 5 mutational hotspots of the p53 gene. Neither homologous deletion nor rearrangement of the p73 gene were found by Southern blot analysis in any of the cell lines that lack expression of p73. In contrast to prior published data, analysis of a polymorphic site showed that the p73 gene was expressed biallelically in cell lines and normal peripheral blood. Notably, the p73-negative cell lines were hypermethylated at a CpG island in the 5' untranslated region of the p73 mRNA, and treatment of these cell lines with 5-azacytidine (5-AC), a demethylation reagent, induced p73 expression. Taken together, we found that a sizable proportion (32%) of ALL/B-NHL cell lines and primary tumors had negligible or limited expression of the p73 gene associated with hypermethylation of the gene. These findings suggest that silencing of the p73 gene by hypermethylation may contribute to development and/or progression of lymphoid neoplasms.","['Kawano, S', 'Miller, C W', 'Gombart, A F', 'Bartram, C R', 'Matsuo, Y', 'Asou, H', 'Sakashita, A', 'Said, J', 'Tatsumi, E', 'Koeffler, H P']","['Kawano S', 'Miller CW', 'Gombart AF', 'Bartram CR', 'Matsuo Y', 'Asou H', 'Sakashita A', 'Said J', 'Tatsumi E', 'Koeffler HP']","['Hematology/Oncology, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA, USA. kawanos@csmc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (TP73 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Protein p73)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['DNA Methylation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Protein p73', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,1999/07/27 00:00,1999/07/27 00:01,['1999/07/27 00:00'],"['1999/07/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/27 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)67414-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 Aug 1;94(3):1113-20.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In BCR-Abl transformed K562 cells, STAT5A and 5B are constitutively phosphorylated on tyrosine and are transcriptionally active.

In some malignancies such as B-cell lymphoma, there is evidence that high expression of Bcl-2 is an independent negative prognostic marker and the overexpression of Bcl-2 has been shown to confer resistance to cytotoxic drugs by preventing drug-induced apoptosis. This function of Bcl-2 can be antagonized by apoptosis-promoting members of the Bcl-2 family. We previously showed that overexpression of Bax restores the chemosensitivity of Bax-deficient breast cancer cell lines. Therefore, we investigated whether the death-promoting Bcl-2 homologue Bik/Nbk can enhance cytostatic drug-induced apoptosis. As a model, we used the T-cell leukemia H9 (CD3(+) and CD4(+)CD8(-)), which is resistant to corticosteroid-induced cell death and does not express endogenous Bik/Nbk. Sensitivity for drug-induced apoptosis was increased 10- to 39-fold in cells transfected with the full-length coding sequence of Bik/Nbk. In addition, apoptosis induced via CD95/Fas or heat shock was increased to a similar extent. These data show that Bik/Nbk, which, unlike Bax, carries only a BH3 but no BH1 or BH2 domain may be a target to enhance chemosensitivity. The complete suppression of tumor growth in a severe combined immunodeficient mouse xenotransplant model suggests that, in analogy to Bax, Bik/Nbk may function as a tumor suppressor gene.","['Daniel, P T', 'Pun, K T', 'Ritschel, S', 'Sturm, I', 'Holler, J', 'Dorken, B', 'Brown, R']","['Daniel PT', 'Pun KT', 'Ritschel S', 'Sturm I', 'Holler J', 'Dorken B', 'Brown R']","['Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine; the Department of Hematology, Oncology and Tumor Immunology, Charite-Campus Berlin-Buch, Humboldt University, Berlin-Buch, Germany. pdaniel@mdc-berlin.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BIK protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)']",IM,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*genetics', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Cell Division/genetics', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, bcl-2', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', '*Membrane Proteins', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mitochondrial Proteins', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proteins/*genetics']",,1999/07/27 00:00,1999/07/27 00:01,['1999/07/27 00:00'],"['1999/07/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/27 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)67412-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 Aug 1;94(3):1100-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such resistance has been associated with rapid drug efflux mediated by the multidrug resistance gene 1 (MDR1; encoding P-glycoprotein) and more recently with expression of other novel proteins conferring multidrug resistance such as MRP1 (multidrug resistance-associated protein 1) and LRP (lung resistance protein). To determine the frequency and clinical significance of MDR1, MRP1, and LRP in younger AML patients, we developed multiparameter flow cytometric assays to quantify expression of these proteins in pretreatment leukemic blasts from 352 newly diagnosed AML patients (median age, 44 years) registered to a single clinical trial (SWOG 8600). Protein expression was further correlated with functional efflux by leukemic blasts [assessed using two substrates: Di(OC)(2) and Rhodamine 123] and with the ability of MDR-reversing agents to inhibit efflux in vitro. MDR1/P-glycoprotein expression, which was highly correlated with cyclosporine-inhibited efflux, was noted in only 35% of these younger AML patients, distinctly lower than the frequency of 71% we previously reported in AML in the elderly (Blood 89:3323, 1997). Interestingly, MDR1 expression and functional drug efflux increased with patient age, from a frequency of only 17% in patients less than 35 years old to 39% in patients aged 50 years (P =.010). In contrast, MRP1 was expressed in only 10% of cases and decreased with patient age (P =. 024). LRP was detected in 43% of cases and increased significantly with increasing white blood cell counts (P =.0015). LRP was also marginally associated with favorable cytogenetics (P =.012) and French-American-British (FAB) AML FAB subtypes (P =.013), being particularly frequent in M4/M5 cases. Only MDR1/P-glycoprotein expression and cyclosporine-inhibited efflux were significantly associated with complete remission (CR) rate (P(MDR1) =.012; P(efflux) =.039) and resistant disease (RD; P(MDR1) =.0007; P(efflux) =.0092). No such correlations were observed for MRP1 (P(CR) =.93; P(RD) =.55) or LRP (P(CR) =.50; P(RD) =.53). None of these parameters were associated with overall or relapse-free survival. Unexpectedly, a distinct and nonoverlapping phenotype was detected in 18% of these cases: cyclosporine-resistant efflux not associated with MDR1, MRP1, or LRP expression, implying the existence of other as yet undefined efflux mechanisms in AML. In summary, MDR1 is less frequent in younger AML patients, which may in part explain their better response to therapy. Neither MRP1 nor LRP are significant predictors of outcome in this patient group. Thus, inclusion of MDR1-modulators alone may benefit younger AML patients with MDR1(+) disease.","['Leith, C P', 'Kopecky, K J', 'Chen, I M', 'Eijdems, L', 'Slovak, M L', 'McConnell, T S', 'Head, D R', 'Weick, J', 'Grever, M R', 'Appelbaum, F R', 'Willman, C L']","['Leith CP', 'Kopecky KJ', 'Chen IM', 'Eijdems L', 'Slovak ML', 'McConnell TS', 'Head DR', 'Weick J', 'Grever MR', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Willman CL']","['Department of Pathology and the Cancer Center, University of New Mexico School of Medicine, Albuquerque, NM, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Vault Ribonucleoprotein Particles)', '0 (major vault protein)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*genetics/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/immunology', 'Prognosis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vault Ribonucleoprotein Particles/*genetics/immunology']",,1999/07/27 00:00,1999/07/27 00:01,['1999/07/27 00:00'],"['1999/07/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/27 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)67411-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 Aug 1;94(3):1086-99.,,,"['CA30206/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33752/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA 32102/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

Among those are pancytopenia, bone marrow fibrosis, and the appearance of a defined tumor cell phenotype in peripheral blood (PB), bone marrow (BM), and spleen. Hairy cells (HC) coexpress antigens specific for B lymphocytes and monocytes/macrophages and thus the malignant cell does not seem to be restricted to a defined lineage. When serum or bone marrow aspirate was screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), specimen derived from HCL (serum: mean value, 29 pg/mL; BM aspirate: mean value, 641 pg/mL) contained significantly higher levels than those from healthy subjects. To study whether peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) derived from patients suffering from HCL and healthy donors (HD) were capable of producing bFGF, culture supernatant (conditioned medium, [CM]) was tested for the presence of this cytokine. While bFGF was not detectable in cell cultures from HD, HCL-derived CM contained relatively high levels of bFGF. CM was successfully used for stimulation of mesenchymal cell proliferation, which could be inhibited by a neutralizing anti-bFGF antibody. Cellular activation by pokeweed mitogen (PWM) or the combination of 12-o-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) plus calcium ionophore (Ca-Ip) led to an enhanced mRNA expression. Results of Western blot experiments showed that HC synthesize at least three isoforms (approximately 18, 23, and 25 kD), but only the 23-kD isoform is exported. To assess the nature of the producer cell, double immunofluorescence analysis using a bFGF-specific and an anti-CD11c monoclonal antibody (MoAb) was undertaken. The majority of cells scoring positive for CD11c were also reactive with the anti-bFGF MoAb. Furthermore, enrichment of CD19/CD11c-positive cells correlated with enhanced bFGF levels, thereby supporting the argument for HC being the producer cells of bFGF. A biological function of bFGF in HCL might be mediation of chemoresistance, as 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (2-CdA)-induced inhibition of cell proliferation can be reversed by bFGF. Endogenous bFGF production by HC is not affected by this purine analogue and 2-CdA-induced apoptosis is diminished in bFGF-producing HC as compared with normal PBMC. Therefore, bFGF expression by HC might be important for resistance to chemotherapy and survival of the malignant cells.","['Gruber, G', 'Schwarzmeier, J D', 'Shehata, M', 'Hilgarth, M', 'Berger, R']","['Gruber G', 'Schwarzmeier JD', 'Shehata M', 'Hilgarth M', 'Berger R']","['Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Cytokine Research and the Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology, University of Vienna Medical School, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Integrin alphaXbeta2)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Antigens, CD19', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis', 'Cladribine/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', '*Integrin alphaXbeta2', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/drug therapy/immunology/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",,1999/07/27 00:00,1999/07/27 00:01,['1999/07/27 00:00'],"['1999/07/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/27 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)67410-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 Aug 1;94(3):1077-85.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When the usage of each TCRBV gene within the CD8(+) T cells of the patients was compared with that of the controls, no statistically significant difference was noted except for BV 6S1-3. In contrast, within the CD4(+) T cells of the CLL patients, a statistically significant overexpression for four BV families (2, 3, 5S1, 6S1-3) was seen while an underrepresentation was noted for five BV families (10, 11, 15, 16, 19). Based on the criterion that a value of any BV higher than the mean + 3 standard deviation (SD) of healthy controls indicated an overexpression, individual patients were shown to overexpress several TCRBV genes compared with the controls. Analyses of the CDR3 length polymorphism showed a significantly higher degree of restriction within CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells of the patients, as compared with the corresponding control T-cell population. There was a significant difference in the CDR3 size distribution pattern with a more polymorphic CDR3 length pattern in the age-matched controls as compared with CLL patients, suggesting different mechanisms driving the T cells towards a clonal/oligoclonal TCRBV usage in patients and controls, respectively. The results show major perturbations of T cells in CLL patients, more frequently seen in the CD4(+) T-cell subset, indicating that nonmalignant CD4(+) T cells may be involved in the pathogenesis of CLL, but also CD8(+) T cells.","['Rezvany, M R', 'Jeddi-Tehrani, M', 'Osterborg, A', 'Kimby, E', 'Wigzell, H', 'Mellstedt, H']","['Rezvany MR', 'Jeddi-Tehrani M', 'Osterborg A', 'Kimby E', 'Wigzell H', 'Mellstedt H']","['Immune and Gene Therapy Lab, CCK, Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*pathology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*genetics']",,1999/07/27 00:00,1999/07/27 00:01,['1999/07/27 00:00'],"['1999/07/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/27 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)67408-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 Aug 1;94(3):1063-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unusually, their diagnoses were spaced 9 years apart at ages 5 and 14. Leukemic cells in both twins had a TEL-AML1 rearrangement, which was characterized at the DNA level by an adaptation of a long distance polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. The genomic fusion sequence was identical in the two leukemias, indicative of a single cell origin in one fetus, in utero. At the time twin 1 was diagnosed (aged 5 years), the bone marrow of twin 2 was hematologically normal. However, retrospective scrutiny of the DNA from an archived slide with clonotypic TEL-AML1 primers showed that the presumptive preleukemic clone was present and disseminated 9 years before a clinical diagnosis. These data provide novel insight into the natural history of childhood leukemia and suggest that consequent to a prenatal initiation of a leukemic clone, most probably by TEL-AML fusion itself, the latency of ALL can be both extremely variable and protracted. This, in turn, is likely to reflect the timing of critical secondary events.","['Wiemels, J L', 'Ford, A M', 'Van Wering, E R', 'Postma, A', 'Greaves, M']","['Wiemels JL', 'Ford AM', 'Van Wering ER', 'Postma A', 'Greaves M']","['Leukaemia Research Fund Centre, Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Base Sequence', 'Child, Preschool', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', '*Diseases in Twins', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', '*Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Time Factors', 'Twins']",,1999/07/27 00:00,1999/07/27 00:01,['1999/07/27 00:00'],"['1999/07/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/27 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)67407-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 Aug 1;94(3):1057-62.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To address this question, we compared the activity of these proteins to the in vitro resistance to daunorubicin (DNR), etoposide, and cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C), using the calcein-AM uptake and the 3-[4, 5-di-methyl-thiazol-2, 5-diphenyl] tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay in 80 adult AML patients. We found no correlation or only a weak correlation between the in vitro drug resistance to DNR and etoposide and MRP1 or Pgp expression or function when tested separately. However, a strong correlation was observed between the simultaneous activity of MRP1 and Pgp (quantified as the modulation of calcein-AM uptake by cyclosporin A and probenecid) and the LC50 of DNR (r =.77, P <.0001). This emphasized the role of these two proteins, not separately, but together in the resistance to DNR. In contrast, Mvp/LRP expression did not correlate with the LC50 of DNR. A high level of simultaneous activity of Pgp and MRP1 was predictive of a poor treatment outcome (for achievement of CR [P =.008], duration of relapse-free survival [RFS; P =.01], and duration of overall survival [OS; P =.02]). In addition, high LC50 of DNR and high LC50 of etoposide together were also predictive of a poor treatment outcome (for duration of RFS [P =.02] and duration of OS [P =.02]). The unfavorable cytogenetic category was more closely associated with the combined activity of both MRP1 and Pgp (P =.002) than with the activity of Pgp or MRP1 separately. This could explain the poor prognosis and the in vitro resistance to daunorubicin in this group of patients. These data suggest that treatment outcome may be improved when cellular DNR and etoposide resistance can be circumvented or modulated. Modulation of not only Pgp but also MRP1 could be essential to attain this aim in adult AML.","['Legrand, O', 'Simonin, G', 'Beauchamp-Nicoud, A', 'Zittoun, R', 'Marie, J P']","['Legrand O', 'Simonin G', 'Beauchamp-Nicoud A', 'Zittoun R', 'Marie JP']","[""Universite Paris 6, Formation de Recherche Claude Bernard, E 9912 INSERM, and Service d'Hematologie, Hopital Hotel-Dieu, Paris, France. olivier.legrand@htd.ap-hop-paris.fr""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MSH3 protein, human)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (MutS Homolog 3 Protein)', 'Y49M64GZ4Q (multidrug resistance-associated protein 1)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Daunorubicin/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', '*Drug Resistance, Microbial', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/genetics/physiopathology', 'Middle Aged', '*Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins', 'MutS Homolog 3 Protein']",,1999/07/27 00:00,1999/07/27 00:01,['1999/07/27 00:00'],"['1999/07/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/27 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)67406-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 Aug 1;94(3):1046-56.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The biologic functions of AML1 and AML3 have been well characterized; however, the functional role of AML2 remains unknown. In this study, we found that AML2 protein expressed predominantly in cells of hematopoietic origin is a nuclear serine phosphoprotein associated with the nuclear matrix, and its expression is not cell cycle-related. In HL-60 cells AML2 expression can be induced by all three natural retinoids, all-trans-retinoic acid (RA), 13-cis-RA, and 9-cis-RA in a dose-dependent manner. A synthetic retinoic acid derivative, 4HPR, which neither activates RA receptor (RAR) alpha nor retinoic X receptor alpha was unable to induce the expression of AML2. A RAR-selective activator, TTNPB, induced AML2 expression similar to RA. Our study further showed that AGN193109, a potent RARalpha antagonist, suppressed AML2 expression induced by RA and that a retinoic X receptor pan agonist AGN194204 had no effect on its expression. Taken together, these studies conclusively demonstrated that the expression of AML2 in HL-60 cells is regulated through the RARalpha-specific signaling pathway. Our study further showed that after all-trans-retinoic acid priming, AML2 expression could be augmented by vitamin D(3). Based on these studies we hypothesize that AML2 expression is normally regulated by retinoid/vitamin D nuclear receptors mainly through the RARalpha-dependent signaling pathway and that it may play a role in hematopoietic cell differentiation.","['Le, X F', 'Groner, Y', 'Kornblau, S M', 'Gu, Y', 'Hittelman, W N', 'Levanon, D', 'Mehta, K', 'Arlinghaus, R B', 'Chang, K S']","['Le XF', 'Groner Y', 'Kornblau SM', 'Gu Y', 'Hittelman WN', 'Levanon D', 'Mehta K', 'Arlinghaus RB', 'Chang KS']","['Division of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, the University of Texas M.

According to his manifestations, chemical allergens, microorganisms or HCL progression were unlikely to have been the precipitating factors for development of Sweet's syndrome. Because immunologic disorders and opportunistic infection are not uncommon in patients with HCL, a skin biopsy should be taken as early as possible when cutaneous lesions and fever develop in order to establish a correct diagnosis.

We investigated the chimerism after T-cell-depleted BMT (n = 32) in comparison with T-cell-depleted PBPCT (n = 39). BM grafts were T-cell depleted using the Campath-IgM antibody plus complement. For T-cell depletion of the PBPC grafts, a selection of CD34+ cells with or without a subsequent CD2/3 depletion was performed. In all patients, the T-cell dose of the transplant was < 10(6)/kg body weight. Between day 13 and day 120 after transplantation, chimerism analysis was done by RFLP or amplified fragment length polymorphism (PCR-AFLP), with a detection limit of 1%-5% recipient cells. In the BMT group, 8 of 32 (25%) patients showed a mixed chimerism, but only one graft rejection and no leukemic relapse occurred after a median follow-up of 41 (3-84) months. All patients with PBPCT revealed a complete chimerism of their granulocytes, and 38 of 39 patients showed complete chimerism of their lymphocytes. Follow-up time in these patients is 7 (2-21) months, with no graft rejection and two leukemic relapses. G-CSF-mobilized PBPC are superior to BM cells for full engraftment even after T-cell-depleted transplantation. The more relevant factor for developing complete chimerism seems to be the quantity and possibly the quality of the stem cells rather than the residual T-cell load of the graft. However, a mixed chimerism of the lymphocytes early after transplantation does not predict a higher rate of graft rejection or leukemic relapse.","['Wiesneth, M', 'Schreiner, T', 'Bunjes, D', 'Bischof, C', 'Erne, E', 'Maccari, B', 'Kubanek, B']","['Wiesneth M', 'Schreiner T', 'Bunjes D', 'Bischof C', 'Erne E', 'Maccari B', 'Kubanek B']","['Department of Transfusion Medicine and Red Cross Blood Center, Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Hematother,Journal of hematotherapy,9306048,['9007-49-2 (DNA)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*physiology', 'DNA/analysis/blood', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft Rejection', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', '*Transplantation Chimera', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",,1999/07/23 00:00,1999/07/23 00:01,['1999/07/23 00:00'],"['1999/07/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/23 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/106161299320299 [doi]'],ppublish,J Hematother. 1999 Jun;8(3):269-74. doi: 10.1089/106161299320299.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whether the trans-gene expressing 32DTNF-alpha cells produce toxicities commonly associated with systemic TNF-alpha therapy was determined by examining the effect of TNF-alpha-secreting progenitor cells on body weight, tissue histology, growth of HPC, and engraftment of BMT. Administration of a low or high dose of TNF-alpha-secreting 32DTNF-alpha cells to mice failed to produce loss in body weight, a measure of TNF-alpha-related cachexia. There was also no evidence of tissue necrosis or mononuclear cell (MNC) infiltration in lung, liver, kidney, or intestine of mice injected with transduced progenitor cells. Furthermore, 32DTNF-alpha cells showed no effect on the clonal growth of HPC in colony-forming assays or loss of cellularity in BM, spleen, or blood.

We conclude from these findings that unlike systemic administration of TNF-alpha, TNF-alpha gene therapy with transduced HPC is nontoxic and may have a role in eradicating residual leukemia after BMT.","['Gautam, S C', 'Xu, Y X', 'Pindolia, K R', 'Yegappan, R', 'Janakiraman, N', 'Chapman, R A']","['Gautam SC', 'Xu YX', 'Pindolia KR', 'Yegappan R', 'Janakiraman N', 'Chapman RA']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Henry Ford Health System, Detroit, MI 48202, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Hematother,Journal of hematotherapy,9306048,['0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Body Weight/drug effects', 'Cachexia/chemically induced', 'Cell Line', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Graft Survival/drug effects', 'Hematologic Diseases/chemically induced', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology/*toxicity']",,1999/07/23 00:00,1999/07/23 00:01,['1999/07/23 00:00'],"['1999/07/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/23 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/106161299320253 [doi]'],ppublish,J Hematother. 1999 Jun;8(3):237-45. doi: 10.1089/106161299320253.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The threshold temperature for the onset of apoptosis was 42 degrees C. Whereas hyperthermia exerted no effect on the expression of Bcl-2 and Bax, heat induced a >30-fold increase of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha mRNA expression and a significant increase in TNF-alpha protein secretion. This endogenous production of TNF-alpha correlated directly with the temperature-induced apoptode effect. Blocking TNF-alpha expression via treatment with pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate or blocking TNF-alpha activity with neutralizing antibodies abrogated heat-provoked apoptosis. In addition, exposure of cell culture supernatant of heat-treated PLB-985 cells to untreated cells induced an apoptotic effect. These data indicate a TNF-a-mediated self eradication of the leukemia cells after heat exposure. Inducing apoptosis with wild-type TNF-alpha or p55 and p75 protein muteins demonstrated that this effect was mediated by the p55 receptor. Interestingly, the autocrine suicidal loop found in immature leukemia cells was lost after granulocytic differentiation with 0.5% N,N-dimethylformamide.

Because p73 encodes for a protein that is both structurally and functionally homologous to the p53 protein, p73 has been postulated to be a candidate tumor suppressor gene. To date, however, mutations of p73 have not been found. To study methylation of the p73 5'CpG island, a human bacterial artificial chromosome clone containing exon 1 and the 5' region of p73 was isolated. There was no evidence for p73 exon 1 methylation in normal tissues. In contrast, p73 was aberrantly methylated in approximately 30% of primary acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALLs) and Burkitt's lymphomas. There was no evidence for methylation in any other types of hematological malignancies or solid tumors examined. In both leukemia cell lines and primary ALLs, methylation was associated with transcriptional loss of p73 by reverse transcription-PCR. We used single-strand conformational polymorphisms to screen for point mutations in a series of primary ALLs and found no mutations leading to a change in protein structure. Our results show that methylation of p73 is a frequent event in specific types of hematological malignancies and suggest that epigenetic silencing of p73 could have important consequences for cell-cycle regulation.","['Corn, P G', 'Kuerbitz, S J', 'van Noesel, M M', 'Esteller, M', 'Compitello, N', 'Baylin, S B', 'Herman, J G']","['Corn PG', 'Kuerbitz SJ', 'van Noesel MM', 'Esteller M', 'Compitello N', 'Baylin SB', 'Herman JG']","['The Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Baltimore, Maryland 21231, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (TP73 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Protein p73)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Child', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1/*genetics', '*CpG Islands', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/chemistry/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/physiology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/genetics/pathology', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/genetics/pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Protein p73', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,1999/07/23 00:00,1999/07/23 00:01,['1999/07/23 00:00'],"['1999/07/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/23 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/23 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1999 Jul 15;59(14):3352-6.,,,"['5T32CA09071-19/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA43318/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: There were three (9%) regressions of evaluable disease. The median survival was five months (95% confidence interval (95% CI): 1.9-9.6 months), the one-year survival rate was 14% and the two-year survival rate was 6%. Toxicity was tolerable with one death from pneumonia (without neutropenia) on day 18 and a 23% rate of grade 4 granulocytopenia.

In this phase I study, we investigated the toxicity profile, pharmacokinetics, and activity of a prolonged continuous infusion schedule of the colloidal dispersion formulation of 9-amino-camptothecin (9-AC/CD) in patients with acute leukemia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with refractory or relapsed AML, acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) or chronic myelogenous leukemia in blastic phase (CML-BP) were included in the study. Eligibility criteria were age greater than 15 years, performance status of 2 or better, creatinine < 1.5 mg/dl, and bilirubin < 1.5 mg/dl. 9-AC/CD was given as a continuous intravenous infusion over seven days every three to four weeks. The starting dose was 0.2 mg/m2/d (1.4 mg/m2/course). Courses were given every three to four weeks according to toxicity and anti leukemic efficacy. This phase I study used the classical 3 + 3 design. The dose was escalated by 50% until grade I toxicity was observed, and then by 30% to 35% until the dose limiting toxicity was defined. At the maximal tolerated dose (MTD), 8 to 10 patients were planned to be treated to better define the toxicity and early-activity profiles. RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients (AML thirty-six patients; ALL two patients; CML-BP one patient), median age 56 years, were treated. Severe mucositis was the dose limiting toxicity; it occurred in three of six patients treated at a dose of 1.6 mg/m2/d. The MTD was defined as 1.4 mg/m2/day by the phase I design. Upon expansion of the number of patients, 3 of 10 patients had grade 4 mucositis and 1 of 10 patients had grade 3 diarrhea. Nausea and vomiting were uncommon. No complete or partial remission was observed in 37 evaluable patients. However, 9-AC/CD exhibited antileukemic activity, as reflected by the finding of marrow hypoplasia on day 14 in 46% of the patients. Average steady-state concentration of 9-AC lactone was close to 10 nmol/l, and the of 9-AC lactone area under curve (AUC) was 1409 +/- 705 nmol/l. hr. CONCLUSION: The MTD of 9-AC/CD given as a seven-day continuous infusion was 1.4 mg/m2/d (9.8 mg/m2/course) in patients with acute leukemia. This represents three to fourfold dose escalation compared with the MTD of 9-AC given as shorter continuous infusion (three days) in patients with solid tumors. Future studies will determine the activity of prolonged administration of 9-AC/CD in patients with better prognosis acute leukemia.","['Vey, N', 'Kantarjian, H', 'Tran, H', 'Beran, M', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Bivins, C', 'Giles, F', 'Cortes, J', 'Cheson, B', 'Arbuck, S', 'Estey, E']","['Vey N', 'Kantarjian H', 'Tran H', 'Beran M', ""O'Brien S"", 'Bivins C', 'Giles F', 'Cortes J', 'Cheson B', 'Arbuck S', 'Estey E']","['Leukemia Department, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article']",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Colloids)', '5MB77ICE2Q (9-aminocamptothecin)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Camptothecin/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics', 'Colloids', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality']",,1999/07/23 00:00,1999/07/23 00:01,['1999/07/23 00:00'],"['1999/07/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/23 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/23 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1023/a:1026406920321 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(19)57197-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 1999 May;10(5):577-83. doi: 10.1023/a:1026406920321.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Standard-dose chemotherapy (SDC) consisting of etoposide (500 mg/m2), ifosfamide (4000 mg/m2), cisplatin (50 mg/m2) and epirubicin (50 mg/m2) (VIP-E), followed by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), was given to 100 patients with SCLC. Thirty patients with qualifying responses to VIP-E proceeded to high-dose chemotherapy (HDC) with autologous peripheral blood stem-cell transplantation (PBSCT) after etoposide (1,500 mg/m2), ifosfamide (12,000 mg/m2), carboplatin (750 mg/m2) and epirubicin (150 mg/m2) (VIC-E) conditioning. RESULTS OF STANDARD-DOSE VIP-E: Ninety-seven patients were evaluable for response. The objective response rate was 81% in LD SCLC (33% CR, 48% PR; excluding patients in surgical CR) and 77% in ED SCLC (18% CR, 58% PR). The treatment-related mortality (TRM) of SDC was 2%. Two additional patients in CR from their SCLC developed secondary non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLC), and both were cured by surgery. The median survival was 19 months in LD SCLC and 6 months in ED SCLC. The five-year survivals were 36% in LD and 0% in ED SCLC. RESULTS OF HIGH-DOSE VIC-E: HDC was feasible in 16% of ED-, and 58% of LD-patients. All HDC patients (n = 30) improved or maintained prior responses. Four patients died of early treatment-related complications (TRM 13%). Two additional patients in CR from their SCLC developed secondary malignancies (esophageal cancer, secondary chronic myelogenous leukemia). The median survivals were 26 months in LD SCLC, and 8 months in ED SCLC. The five-year survival was 50% in LD and 0% in ED SCLC. CONCLUSIONS: Despite high response rates, survival after VIP-E SDC and VIC-E HDC in patients with ED SCLC is not superior to that achieved with less toxic traditional regimens. The high five-year survival rates achieved with these protocols in LD SCLC probably reflect both patient selection (high proportion of patients with prior surgical resection) and the high activity of our chemotherapy regimen in combination with radiotherapy. A study comparing protocols using simultaneous radiation therapy and chemotherapy, and other dose-escalated forms of SDC with HDC is needed to further define the role of this treatment modality in SCLC. Given the high rate of secondary malignancies observed in patients in CR > 2 years in our study, close follow-up and early treatment of these neoplasms may contribute to maintaining overall survival in patients with SCLC.","['Fetscher, S', 'Brugger, W', 'Engelhardt, R', 'Kanz, L', 'Hasse, J', 'Frommhold, H', 'Lange, W', 'Mertelsmann, R']","['Fetscher S', 'Brugger W', 'Engelhardt R', 'Kanz L', 'Hasse J', 'Frommhold H', 'Lange W', 'Mertelsmann R']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Freiburg Medical Center, Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article']",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,"['3Z8479ZZ5X (Epirubicin)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'UM20QQM95Y (Ifosfamide)', 'VIC-E protocol', 'VIP-E protocol']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Carboplatin/administration & dosage', 'Carcinoma, Small Cell/*drug therapy/mortality/surgery', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Epirubicin/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Ifosfamide/administration & dosage', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/mortality/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/etiology']",,1999/07/23 00:00,1999/07/23 00:01,['1999/07/23 00:00'],"['1999/07/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/23 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/23 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1023/a:1026453922931 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(19)57195-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 1999 May;10(5):561-7. doi: 10.1023/a:1026453922931.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A sensitive, noninvasive screening technique to identify the magnitude of this problem is needed. Ultrasound (US) cannot always adequately image the innominate veins or the superior vena cava. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) can be noninvasive and may be useful for screening these patients. OBJECTIVE: We examined the suitability of US and MRA to identify venous occlusion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used MRA and ultrasound to examine 11 pediatric patients previously treated for ALL. CVADs had been in place a median of 2.5 years (range, 0.4-2.8 years) and removed a median of 2.1 years (range, 0.6-2.9 years) previously. We also performed 2D time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography (TOF MRA) on two healthy young adult women with no history of venous abnormality or CVAD use. RESULTS: MRA suggested central venous abnormalities in 8 of the 11 ALL survivors and in both healthy control subjects. US results were negative in all 11 survivors. CONCLUSION: Further investigation is warranted to develop a sensitive and specific noninvasive method for identifying venous occlusion caused by prior CVAD use. Such a method would allow prospective studies of this complication in pediatric ALL survivors.","['Kaste, S C', 'Gronemeyer, S A', 'Hoffer, F A', 'Mandrell, B N', 'Wilimas, J A']","['Kaste SC', 'Gronemeyer SA', 'Hoffer FA', 'Mandrell BN', 'Wilimas JA']","[""Department of Diagnostic Imaging, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, 332 N.

This paper describes a continuously dividing multipotent population of progenitor cells in the human embryonic forebrain that can be propagated in vitro. These cells can be maintained and expanded using a serum-free defined medium containing basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and epidermal growth factor (EGF). Using these three factors, the cell cultures expand and remain multipotent for at least 1 year in vitro. This period of expansion results in a 10(7)-fold increase of this heterogeneous population of cells. Upon differentiation, they form neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes, the three main phenotypes in the CNS. Moreover, GABA-immunoreactive and tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive neurons can be identified. These results demonstrate the feasibility of long-term in vitro expansion of human neural progenitor cells. The advantages of such a population of neural precursors for allogeneic transplantation include the ability to provide an expandable, well-characterized, defined cell source which can form specific neuronal or glial subtypes.","['Carpenter, M K', 'Cui, X', 'Hu, Z Y', 'Jackson, J', 'Sherman, S', 'Seiger, A', 'Wahlberg, L U']","['Carpenter MK', 'Cui X', 'Hu ZY', 'Jackson J', 'Sherman S', 'Seiger A', 'Wahlberg LU']","['Cell and Molecular Neurobiology, CytoTherapeutics, Inc., Lincoln, Rhode Island, 02865, USA. mcarpenter@geron.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Exp Neurol,Experimental neurology,0370712,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)']",IM,"['Brain/cytology/*embryology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/pharmacology', 'Fetus', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/pharmacology', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Growth Substances/*pharmacology', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Neurons/*cytology/drug effects/*physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/*physiology', 'Time Factors']",,1999/07/23 00:00,1999/07/23 00:01,['1999/07/23 00:00'],"['1999/07/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/23 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/23 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/exnr.1999.7098 [doi]', 'S0014-4886(99)97098-X [pii]']",ppublish,Exp Neurol. 1999 Aug;158(2):265-78. doi: 10.1006/exnr.1999.7098.,['Copyright 1999 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Two known mediators of activation-induced cell death are Fas(CD95) ligand (FasL) and APO2 ligand (APO2L)/TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). We show here that upon mitogenic stimulation, bioactive FasL and APO2L are released from the T cell leukemia Jurkat and from normal human T cell blasts as intact, nonproteolyzed proteins associated with a particulate, ultracentrifugable fraction. We have characterized this fraction as microvesicles of 100-200 nm in diameter. These microvesicles are released from Jurkat and T cell blasts shortly (</=1 h) after PHA stimulation, well before the cell enters apoptosis. FasL- and APO2L-containing vesicles are also present in supernatants from PHA-activated fresh human PBMC. These observations provide the basis for a new and efficient mechanism for the rapid induction of autocrine or paracrine cell death during immune regulation.","['Martinez-Lorenzo, M J', 'Anel, A', 'Gamen, S', 'Monle n, I', 'Lasierra, P', 'Larrad, L', 'Pineiro, A', 'Alava, M A', 'Naval, J']","['Martinez-Lorenzo MJ', 'Anel A', 'Gamen S', 'Monle n I', 'Lasierra P', 'Larrad L', 'Pineiro A', 'Alava MA', 'Naval J']","['Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular y Cellular, Facultad de Ciencias, Servicio de Inmunologia, Hospital Clinico Universitario, Universidad de Zaragoza, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '3CHI920QS7 (Cytochalasin B)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*immunology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Cell-Free System/chemistry/immunology/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Cytochalasin B/pharmacology', 'Endopeptidases', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Ligands', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism/toxicity', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning Transmission', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/chemistry/*immunology/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism/toxicity', 'Ultracentrifugation', 'Vacuoles/chemistry/immunology/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'fas Receptor/*metabolism/toxicity']",,1999/07/22 00:00,1999/07/22 00:01,['1999/07/22 00:00'],"['1999/07/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/22 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/22 00:00 [entrez]']",['ji_v163n3p1274 [pii]'],ppublish,J Immunol. 1999 Aug 1;163(3):1274-81.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A direct serine phosphorylation and activation of Syk by ERK was observed in in vitro experiments. Moreover the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK) inhibitors markedly decreased the Ag-induced phosphorylation of the tyrosyl residues of Syk and its activation as well as suppressed the degranulation of the cells.

We report the frequency and characteristics of HZO following BMT, including the timing of infection, treatment, ocular complications, and visual outcome. Between 1983 and 1997, 572 patients underwent BMT and seven children developed HZO at a median of 150 days following transplantation. All but one of the children had undergone allogeneic BMT. All of the children were treated with acyclovir after onset of the rash but none had received prophylactic therapy. All seven children developed ocular complications within the first 4 weeks following the onset of the dermatomal rash but none reported any symptoms during this period. Complications included keratitis in six, anterior uveitis in three and scleritis in one. Keratitis was an early complication developing within the first 4 weeks, while anterior uveitis and scleritis occurred later in the course of the disease. The high frequency of ocular complications and lack of symptoms in children with HZO following BMT suggests that early ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted in this group of patients.

Here we present a study in which the feasibility of mobilizing stem cells was investigated in newly diagnosed AML. Among 96 AML patients, 76 patients (79%) entered complete remission. Mobilization was undertaken with low dose and high dose schedules of G-CSF in 63 patients, and 54 patients (87%) were leukapheresed. A median of 2.0 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg (range 0.1-72.0) was obtained in a median of three leukaphereses following a low dose G-CSF schedule (150 microg/m2) during an average of 20 days. Higher dose regimens of G-CSF (450 microg/m2 and 600 microg/m2) given during an average of 11 days resulted in 28 patients in a yield of 3.6 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg (range 0-60.3) also obtained following three leukaphereses. The low dose and high dose schedules of G-CSF permitted the collection of 2 x 10(6) CD34-positive cells in 46% and 79% of cases respectively (P = 0.01). Twenty-eight patients were transplanted with a peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) graft and hemopoietic repopulation was compared with the results of a previous study with autologous bone marrow. Recovery of granulocytes (>0.5 x 10(9)/l, 17 vs 37 days) and platelets (>20 x 10(9)/l; 26 vs 96 days) was significantly faster after peripheral stem cell transplantation compared to autologous bone marrow transplantation.

In the last 2 years 19 patients >60 years old with several oncological conditions, mostly hematological, underwent PBSC autotransplant either as salvage therapy following relapse or resistance to conventional treatment, or as consolidating therapy as a part of a well defined protocol. There were 13 males and six females; the mean age was 66.9 years (range 61-76 years); nine patients had resistant or relapsed lymphoma, six myeloma, two acute leukemia, one Waldenstrom's disease and one lung cancer. Myeloablative schemes included BEAM exclusively for lymphomas, busulfan and melphalan (Bu-MPH) mainly for myeloma, busulfan and cyclophosphamide (Bu-CTX) for lymphomas and leukemia and VP-16 and CTX for lung cancer. Mobilization of CD34+ cells was achieved in all patients with the combination of high-dose CTX and G-CSF with collections between 2.83 to 19.04 x 10(6)/kg (mean 7.1). All patients engrafted with a median time for recovery of PMN (>0.5 x 10(3)/microl) of 10 days (range 8-12 days) and for PLT (>20 x 10(3)/microl) of 12 days (range 10-17 days). Major responses were obtained in 15 of 16 patients evaluable for response and eight patients entered CR; overall eight patients are in CR, five are alive with disease, five are dead from disease progression and one is dead because of congestive heart failure 7 months following PBSC autotransplant. No early deaths following the procedure occurred; major side-effects were grade I-II mucositis (58%), fever with documented sepsis (10%), pneumonia (5%), cardiac, renal and liver toxicity (5%). Cardiac function was evaluated before and after myeloablative therapy by VEF in all patients; no significant modifications were necessary.

Ten years on we have clinically revised outcome to firmly establish the role of each treatment, to analyse the importance of length of first remission and to provide long-term actuarial results for disease-free survival (DFS) and relapse rate in each group. For 21 patients within the transplantation group, probability of DFS and relapse are 42.8 +/- 10.8% and 40.2 +/- 11.7% (s.e.), respectively. In the chemotherapy group, probability of DFS is 10.0 +/- 4.74% (P = 0.001) and probability of relapse 87.5 +/- 5.2% (P = 0.0004). These results strongly reflect those at initial analysis, confirming a key role of BMT in the management of ALL in second remission. Moreover, on univariate analysis only two factors influenced DFS: treatment group and length of first complete remission (less or more than 30 months from first CR). Thus, it seems clear that the best therapeutic option in early relapse is BMT, whereas DFS in late relapse is at the limit of significance (P = 0.07), with a higher relapse rate in the CT group. Although encouraging results using intensified rotational combination chemotherapy have been published, prospective randomised studies are needed to assess with certainty the best therapeutic option in these patients.","['Torres, A', 'Alvarez, M A', 'Sanchez, J', 'Flores, R', 'Martinez, F', 'Gomez, P', 'Rojas, R', 'Herrera, C', 'Garcia, J M', 'Andres, P', 'Velasco, F', 'Serrano, J', 'Roman, J', 'Rodriguez, A', 'Martin, C', 'Tabares, S', 'Rodriguez, J M', 'Parody, R', 'Plaza, E', 'Leon, A', 'Romero, R', 'Jean-Paul, E', 'Prados, D', 'Aljama, R', 'Fernandez, A']","['Torres A', 'Alvarez MA', 'Sanchez J', 'Flores R', 'Martinez F', 'Gomez P', 'Rojas R', 'Herrera C', 'Garcia JM', 'Andres P', 'Velasco F', 'Serrano J', 'Roman J', 'Rodriguez A', 'Martin C', 'Tabares S', 'Rodriguez JM', 'Parody R', 'Plaza E', 'Leon A', 'Romero R', 'Jean-Paul E', 'Prados D', 'Aljama R', 'Fernandez A']","['Department of Haematology, University Hospital Reina Sofia Cordoba, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate']",,1999/07/22 00:00,1999/07/22 00:01,['1999/07/22 00:00'],"['1999/07/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/22 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/22 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1701802 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1999 Jun;23(12):1257-60. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1701802.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, a potentially fatal complication of retinoic acid (RA) syndrome occurs in about a quarter of patients and its pathophysiology is still unclear. In order to investigate whether or not the treatment with ATRA leads to increased elaboration of inflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules by the APL cells, the expression of interleukin (IL)-1beta, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, IL-8, L-selectin and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) was examined in the APL cells after induction of differentiation with ATRA in the presence or absence of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) or IL-3 in the present study. Cytokine elaboration by the treated cells was detected using both Northern blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Our results have shown that ATRA induces an increased expression of IL-8, IL-1beta, TNF-alpha and ICAM-1 in APL cells, which can be amplified by the addition of G-CSF. These data imply that the induction of inflammatory cytokines in APL cells may play an important role in the pathogenesis of RA syndrome. Furthermore, G-CSF, through its potent differentiating activity, may increase the risk of such complications during ATRA treatment.","['Hsu, H C', 'Tsai, W H', 'Chen, P G', 'Hsu, M L', 'Ho, C K', 'Wang, S Y']","['Hsu HC', 'Tsai WH', 'Chen PG', 'Hsu ML', 'Ho CK', 'Wang SY']","['Department of Medicine, Veterans General Hospital-Taipei and National Yang-Ming University, Taiwan, Republic of China. hchsu@vghtpe.gov.tw']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', '126880-86-2 (L-Selectin)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*biosynthesis', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-1/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-8/biosynthesis', 'L-Selectin/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis']",,1999/07/22 00:00,1999/07/22 00:01,['1999/07/22 00:00'],"['1999/07/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/22 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/22 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1999.tb01844.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1999 Jul;63(1):11-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1999.tb01844.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The role of these cytokines in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) has been investigated. A distinctive pattern of cytokine secretion has been found in chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase (CML-CP), in blastic crisis (CML-BC) and in normal subjects. Serum IL-6 levels in CML-CP and CML-BC were significantly raised compared with normal controls (p = 0.0026 for CML-CP and p = 0.0011 for CML-BC). IL-6 was significantly elevated in blastic crisis of CML (103.5 +/- 20.77 pg ml-1) compared with CML-CP (37.35 +/- 10.88 pg ml-1; p = 0.014). IL-6 serum levels were found to correlate significantly with peripheral blood monocyte counts and bone marrow blast and basophil counts. We have analysed monocyte/macrophage function with respect to their ability to produce IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-alpha, spontaneously as well as in response to LPS, in comparison with normal controls. A direct correlation of IL-6 levels in unstimulated and stimulated cultures with bone marrow blast and basophil counts has been observed. From these results it is inferred that the monocyte function is impaired in CML patients, and the cytokine secretion is deficient. Our limited data suggest that serum IL-6 levels may play an important role as a prognostic marker for CML.","['Anand, M', 'Chodda, S K', 'Parikh, P M', 'Nadkarni, J S']","['Anand M', 'Chodda SK', 'Parikh PM', 'Nadkarni JS']","['Immuno-Biochem Laboratory, Tata Memorial Hospital, Parel, Bombay, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Blast Crisis/*blood', 'Cytokines/*blood', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/blood', 'Interleukin-6/blood', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*blood/pathology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Macrophages/metabolism/physiology', 'Monocytes/*metabolism/physiology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",,1999/07/22 10:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1999/07/22 10:00'],"['1999/07/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/07/22 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1099-1069(199812)16:4<143::AID-HON628>3.0.CO;2-U [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1099-1069(199812)16:4<143::aid-hon628>3.0.co;2-u [doi]']",ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 1998 Dec;16(4):143-54. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1099-1069(199812)16:4<143::aid-hon628>3.0.co;2-u.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we examined the expression of CD44 mRNA in 20 acute myelocytic leukemias by semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis and assessed its prognostic value. In all leukemic cells the predominant isoform was the 'standard' form of CD44 (CD44H), and intense bands were found in eight cases. CD44v6 was expressed in 11 cases, although its levels and those of other variants containing exon v7 through to v10 were much lower than those of CD44H. Isoforms containing exon v4 or v5 could not be detected. The expression of CD44v6 correlated with the death rate from leukemia (p > 0.05), but was not related to other risk factors.

Changes in blood zinc and copper have also been found in malignant diseases. OBJECTIVE: To describe the protein-energy nutritional status and serum zinc and copper of children with newly diagnosed leukemia. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: University referral center. PARTICIPANTS: 23 children with newly diagnosed acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) or acute non-lymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) between the ages of 1 and 10 years. The control subjects were 31 healthy school children of similar age from local schools. MAIN MEASURES: Anthropometric measurements of height/age and weight/height, food intake and serum levels of zinc and copper. RESULTS: Almost the entire group of children were eutrophic.

The cellular distribution of three types of prosomes characterized by the presence of subunits with molecular masses of 23, 27, and 30 kDa was analyzed using an immunocytochemical approach on cultured chicken erythroblasts. The prosomes containing the p27K and p30K subunits were found in diffuse distribution in both nuclei and cytoplasm. In contrast, the prosomes containing the p23K subunit, although relatively rare in the nuclear space, were found concentrated in one or two large spots. Using in situ hybridization with an alpha(A)-globin gene-specific riboprobe we found that the p23K-type prosomes colocalize in the nucleus with centers of globin (pre-)mRNA processing, and of mRNA accumulation in the cytoplasm. This result suggests there is local coincidence of specific-type prosome function with processing and, possibly, transport of a particular kind of (pre-)mRNA.","['De Conto, F', 'Razin, S V', 'Geraud, G', 'Arcangeletti, C', 'Scherrer, K']","['De Conto F', 'Razin SV', 'Geraud G', 'Arcangeletti C', 'Scherrer K']","['Institut Jacques Monod, Universite Paris 7, 2, Place Jussieu, Tour 43, Paris Cedex 05, 75251, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (RNA Precursors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'EC 3.4.99.- (ATP dependent 26S protease)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Nucleus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Chickens', 'Cytoplasm/genetics/*metabolism', 'Erythrocytes/cytology/*metabolism', 'Globins/*genetics', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Molecular Weight', 'Peptide Hydrolases/chemistry/*metabolism', '*Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'RNA Precursors/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/07/22 00:00,1999/07/22 00:01,['1999/07/22 00:00'],"['1999/07/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/22 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/22 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/excr.1999.4556 [doi]', 'S0014-4827(99)94556-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1999 Aug 1;250(2):569-75. doi: 10.1006/excr.1999.4556.,['Copyright 1999 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Growth inhibition studies were performed using the human CEM leukemia cell line and the colon-cancer cell lines HCT 116 and Colo 320 DM. Gemcitabine-oxaliplatin combinations were compared with gemcitabine-cisplatin combinations in the same cell lines using similar experimental settings. Cells were exposed for 2 h to gemcitabine and then for 24 h to oxaliplatin or cisplatin, and vice versa. RESULTS: The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50 values) in single-drug experiments using 2 h of exposure to gemcitabine and 24 h of exposure to oxaliplatin or cisplatin were, respectively, 89 pM, 11.1 microM, and 10.3 microM for CEM cells; 46 pM, 10.2 microM, and 2.7 microM for HCT 116 cells; and 102 pM, 4.6 microM, and 8.6 microM for Colo 320 DM cells. Gemcitabine-oxaliplatin combinations displayed supraadditive effects in human leukemia and colon-cancer cell lines. The sequence of gemcitabine followed by oxaliplatin was more effective than the opposite sequence in HCT 116 and Colo 320 DM colon-cancer cell lines, whereas the sequence of oxaliplatin followed by gemcitabine yielded to synergistic effects in CEM cells. The cytotoxic effects of gemcitabine-oxaliplatin combinations were better than (HCT 116 cells) or equal to (CEM and Colo 320 DM cells) those of gemcitabine-cisplatin combinations. CONCLUSION: Our data show that the combination of gemcitabine with oxaliplatin exerts potent antiproliferative effects in human leukemia and colon cancer cells, warranting further investigations in the framework of phase I-II trials as an alternative for the treatment of solid malignancies.","['Faivre, S', 'Raymond, E', 'Woynarowski, J M', 'Cvitkovic, E']","['Faivre S', 'Raymond E', 'Woynarowski JM', 'Cvitkovic E']","['Department of Medicine, Institut Gustave-Roussy, Villejuif, France. faivres@aol.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Organoplatinum Compounds)', '04ZR38536J (Oxaliplatin)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'DNA/drug effects', 'Deoxycytidine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Organoplatinum Compounds/*administration & dosage', 'Oxaliplatin', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/07/21 00:00,1999/07/21 00:01,['1999/07/21 00:00'],"['1999/07/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/21 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002800050955 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1999;44(2):117-23. doi: 10.1007/s002800050955.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Sixty-two patients suffering from hematological and non-hematological malignancies entered the study. After conditioning therapy, 28 patients received bone marrow stem cells, 21 received peripheral blood stem cells, and 13 received both. The dynamic of hematological engraftment was calculated as recovery probability of leukocytes and neutrophils. Statistics was done using Kaplan-Meier method and multivariate Cox's proportional regression. RESULTS: Numerous clinical and laboratory parameters correlated with hematological recovery, but only two variables were found to be independently associated. Faster reconstitution correlated with greater number of progenitors and patients who received bone marrow cells recovered significantly later than others. Faster recovery could be expected in patient s receiving >13x10(4) CFU-GM/kg body weight, and significantly slower in those receiving <8.5x10(4) CFU-GM/kg. CONCLUSION: The quantity of progenitor cells and transplant type are variables significantly associated with the speed of postransplant engraftment, but these two parameters are mutually independent. The number of stem cells estimated by CFU-GM assay is a good and reliable routine test for predicting hematopoietic recovery.","['Rogulj, D', 'Batinic, D', 'Nemet, D', 'Petrovecki, M']","['Rogulj D', 'Batinic D', 'Nemet D', 'Petrovecki M']","['Dubrava University Hospital, Av.

The transplantation of human acute myeloid leukemia into nonobese diabetic/severe combined immune deficient (SCID) mice has identified a rare leukemic progenitor termed the SCID leukemia-initiating cell, which is present in low frequency in the leukemic population and is essential for establishing leukemic hematopoiesis. Thus, this transplant model may be ideally suited to identify effector T cells with antileukemic activity. We report that CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) clones specific for minor histocompatibility antigens inhibit the engraftment of human acute myeloid leukemia cells in nonobese diabetic/SCID mice and demonstrate that this inhibition is mediated by direct CTL recognition of SCID leukemia-initiating cells. These results indicate that CD8(+) minor histocompatibility antigen-specific CTL may be mediators of the graft-versus-leukemia effect associated with allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation and provide an experimental model to identify and select T cell clones for immunotherapy to prevent or treat relapse after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation.","['Bonnet, D', 'Warren, E H', 'Greenberg, P D', 'Dick, J E', 'Riddell, S R']","['Bonnet D', 'Warren EH', 'Greenberg PD', 'Dick JE', 'Riddell SR']","['Programs in Cancer/Blood Research and Developmental Biology, The Hospital for Sick Children, 555 University Avenue, Toronto M5G 1X8, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,['0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)'],IM,"['Animals', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Transplantation', 'Clone Cells/immunology', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Graft Rejection/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/*immunology', 'Stem Cells/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology']",PMC17569,1999/07/21 00:00,1999/07/21 00:01,['1999/07/21 00:00'],"['1999/07/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/21 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.96.15.8639 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1999 Jul 20;96(15):8639-44. doi: 10.1073/pnas.96.15.8639.,,,"['P01 CA018029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

The uptake displays first-order kinetics and leads to a build-up of an outward concentration gradient which is stable in the absence of extracellular vitamin. The transport is faster than reduction by extracellular glutathione or by added cytosolic extract, and glutathione-depleted cells show the same uptake rates as control cells. In addition, energy depletion or oxidation of intracellular sulfhydryls does not inhibit accumulation of ascorbate. The accumulation, however, always occurs in the reduced form. The affinity for dehydroascorbate is lower (Km 450 microM vs 60 microM) than for reduced ascorbate, but the maximal rate is more than 30 times higher (581 compared to 19 pmol.min-1 per 106 cells), and it is independent of sodium, whereas the uptake of ascorbate is not. The sodium gradient also allows accumulation of reduced ascorbate. Inhibitors of glucose transport by the GLUT-1 transporter also inhibit uptake of dehydroascorbate (DHA), but there are some inconsistencies, because the Ki-values are higher than reported for the isolated transporter and one inhibitor (deoxyglucose) is noncompetitive. The preferential uptake of the dehydro-form of the vitamin may be useful for situations where this short-lived metabolite is formed by oxidation in the environment.","['Laggner, H', 'Besau, V', 'Goldenberg, H']","['Laggner H', 'Besau V', 'Goldenberg H']","['Institut fur Medizinische Chemie, University of Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['0 (Ferricyanides)', '0 (Monosaccharide Transport Proteins)', '0 (Reducing Agents)', '0 (Sulfhydryl Compounds)', '13408-62-3 (hexacyanoferrate III)', '9G2MP84A8W (Deoxyglucose)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)', 'Y2Z3ZTP9UM (Dehydroascorbic Acid)']",IM,"['Ascorbic Acid/analysis/*metabolism', 'Dehydroascorbic Acid/analysis/*metabolism', 'Deoxyglucose/pharmacology', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Extracellular Space/chemistry/metabolism', 'Ferricyanides/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Glutathione/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Monocytes/chemistry/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Monosaccharide Transport Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Reducing Agents/pharmacology', 'Sulfhydryl Compounds/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1999/07/20 00:00,1999/07/20 00:01,['1999/07/20 00:00'],"['1999/07/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/20 00:00 [entrez]']","['ejb403 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1432-1327.1999.00403.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1999 Jun;262(3):659-65. doi: 10.1046/j.1432-1327.1999.00403.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first stage of acid hydrolysis of these four oxazaphosphorines is a P-N bond cleavage of the six-membered ring leading to the phosphoramidic acid monoesters (2a-d) of type R'HN(CH(2))(3)OP(O)(OH)NHR, with R and/or R' = H or (CH(2))(2)Cl. The electron-withdrawing chloroethyl group at the endocyclic and/or exocyclic nitrogens counteracts the endocyclic P-N bond hydrolysis. This effect is even more marked when the N-chloroethyl group is in the exocyclic position since the order of stability is 1d > 1c > 1b > 1a. In the second stage of hydrolysis, the remaining P-N bond is cleaved together with an intramolecular attack at the phosphorus atom by the non-P-linked nitrogen of the compounds 2a-d. This leads to the formation of a 2-hydroxyoxazaphosphorine ring with R = H (3a coming from compounds 2a,c) or (CH(2))(2)Cl (3b coming from compounds 2b,d) and to the release of ammonia or chloroethylamine. The third step is the P-N ring opening of the oxazaphosphorines 3a,b leading to the phosphoric acid monoesters, H(2)N(CH(2))(3)OP(O)(OH)(2) (4a) and Cl(CH(2))(2)HN(CH(2))(3)OP(O)(OH)(2) (4b-1), respectively. For the latter compound, the chloroethyl group is partially (at pH 5.5) or totally (at pH 7.0) cyclized into aziridine (4b-2), which is then progressively hydrolyzed into an N-hydroxyethyl group (4b-3). Compounds 3a,b are transient intermediates, which in strongly acidic medium are not observed with (31)P NMR. In this case, cleavage of the P-N bond of the type 2 phosphoramidic acid monoesters leads directly to the type 4 phosphoric acid monoesters. The phosphate anion, derived from P-O bond cleavage of these latter compounds, is only observed at low levels after a long period of hydrolysis. Compounds 1a-c and some of their hydrolytic degradation products (4b-1, 4b-2, diphosphoric diester [Cl(CH(2))(2)NH(CH(2))(3)OP(O)(OH)](2)O (5), and chloroethylamine) did not exhibit, as expected, any antitumor efficacy in vivo against P388 leukemia. (31)P NMR determination of the N-dechloroethylated metabolites of IF or its structural isomer, cyclophosphamide (CP), and their degradation compounds could provide an indirect and accurate estimation of chloroacetaldehyde amounts formed from CP or IF.","['Gilard, V', 'Martino, R', 'Malet-Martino, M', 'Niemeyer, U', 'Pohl, J']","['Gilard V', 'Martino R', 'Malet-Martino M', 'Niemeyer U', 'Pohl J']","['Biomedical NMR Group, IMRCP Laboratory, Universite Paul Sabatier, 118, route de Narbonne, 31062 Toulouse, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (2,3-didechloroethylifosfamide)', '0 (Amides)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Phosphoramide Mustards)', '0 (Phosphoric Acids)', '0 (Phosphorus Isotopes)', '059QF0KO0R (Water)', '9Q189608GB (phosphoramidic acid)', 'IIB78D4DQA (dechloroethylifosfamide)', 'UM20QQM95Y (Ifosfamide)']",IM,"['Amides/chemistry', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry/pharmacology/toxicity/urine', 'Drug Stability', 'Female', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Hydrolysis', 'Ifosfamide/*analogs & derivatives/*chemistry/pharmacology/toxicity/urine', 'Kinetics', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Phosphoramide Mustards/*chemistry/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Phosphoric Acids/chemistry', 'Phosphorus Isotopes', 'Rats', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Water']",,1999/07/20 00:00,1999/07/20 00:01,['1999/07/20 00:00'],"['1999/07/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/20 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1021/jm980587g [doi]', 'jm980587g [pii]']",ppublish,J Med Chem. 1999 Jul 15;42(14):2542-60. doi: 10.1021/jm980587g.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS: A total of 1147 Danish patients diagnosed between 1978 and 1993 as having Bowen disease at nongenital sites were followed up for 6463 person-years for cancer occurrence up to 16 years after the skin lesion. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs)--the ratios of observed-to-expected numbers of cancer--served as measures of relative risk. RESULTS: The observed number of noncutaneous cancers occurring in the cohort (n = 115) was close to expected (n = 103.0) (SIR = 1.1; 95% confidence interval, [CI], 0.9-1.3).

In the HL 60 cells, characteristic apoptosis morphology could be observed 4 h after the cells were treated with 50 microM PAN. Exposure of HL-60 cells to increasing concentrations of PAN (from 1 microM to 100 microM) confirmed the concentration dependence of apoptosis as evidenced by DNA fragmentation in HL-60 cells, chromatin condensation by acridine-orange staining, and the appearance of the DNA apoptotic peak in flow cytometry. During apoptosis in HL-60 cells, 3-nitrotyrosine and 3,5-dinitrotyrosine were detected by high-performance liquid chromatography and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-mass spectrometry. We hypothesized that PAN might induce cell death in human leukemia cells by releasing peroxynitrite and other reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide and hydrogen peroxide. Moreover, exogenous superoxide dismutase promoted PAN-induced apoptosis, and in contrast, a combination of superoxide dismutase and catalase suppressed this apoptosis. We also hypothesize that the generation of ROS during PAN-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells could activate stress-activated protein kinase/jun N-terminal kinase activity. The formation of H2O2 produced from the dismutation of PAN-elicited superoxide anion contributed to the apoptotic mechanism in HL-60 cells through ROS pathways. These findings suggested that induction of apoptosis by the air pollutant PAN might occur as a result of the release of ROS.","['Liu, G Y', 'Chen, K J', 'Lin-Shiau, S Y', 'Lin, J K']","['Liu GY', 'Chen KJ', 'Lin-Shiau SY', 'Lin JK']","['Institute of Biochemistry, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Republic of China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Carcinog,Molecular carcinogenesis,8811105,"['0 (Air Pollutants)', '0 (Free Radical Scavengers)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '3OWL53L36A (Mannitol)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'I6KPI2E1HD (Peracetic Acid)', 'SQ8V0P4N89 (peroxyacetyl nitrate)']",IM,"['Air Pollutants/*toxicity', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Catalase/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Free Radical Scavengers/toxicity', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'K562 Cells', 'Mannitol/pharmacology', 'Mice', '*Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Peracetic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/toxicity', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', '*Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Superoxide Dismutase/pharmacology']",,1999/07/20 00:00,1999/07/20 00:01,['1999/07/20 00:00'],"['1999/07/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/20 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1098-2744(199907)25:3<196::AID-MC6>3.0.CO;2-J [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1098-2744(199907)25:3<196::aid-mc6>3.0.co;2-j [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Carcinog. 1999 Jul;25(3):196-206. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1098-2744(199907)25:3<196::aid-mc6>3.0.co;2-j.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Concurrently, developments in the laboratory have improved our understanding of the biology of childhood malignancies. The availability of new imaging techniques, particularly advances in magnetic resonance imaging, have enabled more accurate assessments of tumor extent and staging. Such imaging techniques are now routinely used in radiotherapy planning to maximize treatment to tumor sites, while minimizing the exposure of normal tissues. Progress in surgery has allowed for better reconstructive techniques to repair defects created by tumor resections. The availability of blood component transfusions and hematopoietic cytokines, and advances in supportive care such as isolation techniques and preventive high-dose antibiotic therapy for infections, have allowed for the administration of increasingly intensive chemotherapies. Advances in our understanding of hematopoietic stem cells have enabled for significant extension of the techniques of bone marrow transplantation. Many of the advances in diagnosis, treatment, and our understanding of the biology of childhood cancers have emerged from studies conducted at centers with the required expertise, where multidisciplinary teams are available to coordinate the diagnosis, treatment, supportive care, and follow-up of children with cancer. The increasing population of children who survive into adulthood has renewed concern for the long-term consequences of therapy. Current studies focus on ""risk-adapted"" therapy, where the most intensive treatment is reserved for patients at highest risk of treatment failure, whereas treatment of children with a more favorable prognosis is designed to minimize the acute and late toxicities of therapy.","['Fujimoto, T']",['Fujimoto T'],"['Dept. of Pediatrics, Aichi Medical University.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

Secondary effects were attributed to growth factors only when not coincidental with infection, chemotherapy or hemoderivative transfusion. RESULTS: 34 patients were included in the G-CSF arm and 37 in the GM-CSF arm. Distribution by sex, age, type of acute leukemia, induction or post-induction therapy, as well as initial neutrophil count were comparable among the two groups. Mean time for ANC > 500/microL was 19 days for G-CSF group and 16 days for GM-CSF group (p = 0.08). There were no statistically significant differences in secondary unwanted side effects between the two groups. There were two cases of growth factor-related-fever in the G-CSF group and five in the GM-CSF group (p = 0.25). There was a case of systemic reaction in the G-CSF group. Twenty-nine patients in each group presented febrile neutropenia episodes (p = 0.45). The only factor that showed significance on neutrophil recovery speed was type of leukemia (p = 0.04).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A survey of long-term survivors of childhood cancer (acute leukemia, Wilms' tumor, sympathetic nervous system tumors) diagnosed before 15 years of age and between 1971 and 1985 in a single tertiary care center was performed. Final height, target height and body mass index were measured at evaluation. Height and body mass index, at diagnosis and at the end of treatment, was retrieved from their clinical records. All parameters are expressed as standard deviation scores of the mean of the population reference. Survivors were grouped according to diagnosis and type of treatment. Comparisons between groups and within each group were made at the time of diagnosis, at the end of treatment and at the time of evaluation. RESULTS: Sixty-one survivors of acute leukemia and 62 of solid tumors were included (32 Wilms' tumors, 20 neuroblastomas, 4 ganglioneuroblastomas and 6 ganglioneuromas). Eighty survivors had attained final height at the time of evaluation and their target height was available. Fourteen had at least one relapse. The mean height standard deviation score was positive at diagnosis and negative at the time of evaluation in all groups. Mean height loss ranged from -0.84 for the non-irradiated acute leukemia group to -1.34 for the non-irradiated solid tumor group. Adjusted final height for target height showed stature loss only in irradiated groups. Height loss was equivalent in cranially irradiated survivors (-0.32 after 18 Gy, -0.34 after 24-25.5 Gy). The age at menarche correlated negatively with the dose of cranial radiotherapy (r = -0.6, p = 0.002) and positively with stature loss (r = 0.5, p = 0.006). The mean body mass index standard deviation score was negative at diagnosis and positive at the time of evaluation in all groups. Twenty percent of solid tumor survivors and 12.5% of acute leukemia survivors were malnourished at diagnosis. Nutritional status improved in all groups at the time of evaluation. Obesity was more frequent in those who received cranial radiotherapy (14%) or intensified therapy (21%) compared with those non-cranially irradiated (none) or whose therapy was less intense (9%). CONCLUSIONS: Most survivors of childhood cancer attained their target height. Stature loss was related to cranial radiotherapy in acute leukemia survivors and to spinal irradiation in solid tumor survivors. At diagnosis, malnourishment was more frequent in solid tumor patients, while at the time of evaluation obesity was associated with a more intensified therapy.","['Lopez Andreu, J A', 'Albiach Mesado, V', 'Ferris i Tortajada, J', 'Rodriguez Ineba, A', 'Antonio Oriola, P', 'Verdeguer Miralles, A']","['Lopez Andreu JA', 'Albiach Mesado V', 'Ferris i Tortajada J', 'Rodriguez Ineba A', 'Antonio Oriola P', 'Verdeguer Miralles A']","['Unidad de Oncologia Pediatrica, Hospital Universitario La Fe, Valencia.']",['spa'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Spain,An Esp Pediatr,Anales espanoles de pediatria,0420463,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', '*Body Height', '*Body Weight', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*physiopathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*physiopathology/therapy', 'Nutritional Status', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', '*Survivors/statistics & numerical data']",,1999/07/20 00:00,1999/07/20 00:01,['1999/07/20 00:00'],"['1999/07/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/20 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,An Esp Pediatr. 1999 Jun;50(6):555-61.,,,,,,Estudio comparativo del desarrollo pondoestatural de los supervivientes a largo plazo de leucemia aguda y tumores solidos.,,,,,,,

Here we investigated the signaling modulations required for induction of erythroid differentiation of K562 cells. When the K562 cells were treated with herbimycin A (an inhibitor of protein tyrosine kinase), ras antisense oligonucleotide, and PD98059 (a specific inhibitor of MEK), inhibition of ERK/MAPK activity and cell growth, and induction of erythroid differentiation were observed. The ras mutant, pZIPRas61leu-transfected cells, K562-Ras61leu, have shown a markedly decreased cell proliferation rate with approximately 2-fold doubling time, compared with the parental K562 cells, and about 60% of these cells have shown the phenotype of erythroid differentiation. In addition, herbimycin A inhibited the growth rate and increased the erythroid differentiation, but did not affect the elevated activity of ERK/MAPK in the K562-Ras61leu cells. On the other hand, effects of PD98059 on the growth and differentiation of K562-Ras61leu cells were biphasic. At low concentration of PD98059, which inhibited the elevated activity of ERK/MAPK to the level of parental cells, the growth rate increased and the erythroid differentiation decreased slightly, and at high concentration of PD98059, which inhibited the elevated activity of ERK/MAPK below that of the parental cells, the growth rate turned down and the erythroid differentiation was restored to the untreated control level. Taken together, these results suggest that an appropriate activity of ERK/MAPK is required to maintain the rapid growth and transformed phenotype of K562 cells.","['Kang, C D', 'Do, I R', 'Kim, K W', 'Ahn, B K', 'Kim, S H', 'Chung, B S', 'Jhun, B H', 'Yoo, M A']","['Kang CD', 'Do IR', 'Kim KW', 'Ahn BK', 'Kim SH', 'Chung BS', 'Jhun BH', 'Yoo MA']","['Pusan Cancer Research Center, Pusan National University, Korea. kcdshbw@hyowon.cc.pusan.ac.kr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Mol Med,Experimental & molecular medicine,9607880,"['0 (Androstadienes)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Quinones)', '1W306TDA6S (Rifabutin)', '70563-58-5 (herbimycin)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'XVA4O219QW (Wortmannin)']",IM,"['Androstadienes/pharmacology', 'Benzoquinones', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/cytology/*physiology', '*Erythropoiesis', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Quinones/pharmacology', 'Rifabutin/analogs & derivatives', 'Wortmannin', 'ras Proteins/*metabolism']",,1999/07/20 00:00,1999/07/20 00:01,['1999/07/20 00:00'],"['1999/07/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/emm.1999.13 [doi]'],ppublish,Exp Mol Med. 1999 Jun 30;31(2):76-82. doi: 10.1038/emm.1999.13.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ionizing radiation generates reactive oxygen derived species (ROS) that can be removed by antioxidants. Our purpose is to determine the antioxidant status of patients undergoing TBI by evaluating the oxidant stress and their antioxidant capacity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) the total antioxidant capacity (TAC) in plasma of 14 patients undergoing TBI prior to BMT. The levels of the antioxidants, ascorbic acid (AA) and uric acid (UA) were determined by HPLC-ECD. The oxidant stress level was calculated by the ratio [dehydro ascorbic acid]/total ascorbic acid]. RESULTS: TAC was reduced by 36% (p < 0.02) but after 4 months recovered to a level 22% higher than before the treatment (p < 0.05). Both, AA and UA, decreased following irradiation by 84% (p < 0.02) and 24% (p < 0.05) respectively, but returned to a level of 21% and 320% after 4 months compared to baseline values. The changes in [UA] were affected by Allopurinol (xanthine oxidase inhibitor), given as a routine pretransplant therapy until day -1. The [dehydroascorcbic acid]/[total ascorbic acid] (%) was 45% (range of normal controls = 13.2 +/- 1.5%) and increased by 69% following TBI. In order to obtain a decrease in the TAC of plasma in vitro, comparable to that in vivo, a 1000 fold higher dose of irradiation was required. CONCLUSIONS: TBI caused a pronounced decrease in antioxidant capacity and an excessive increase in oxidant stress. We assume that TBI alters antioxidant homeostasis greatly enhancing the stress damage. CV measurements may lead to a better understanding of the balance between oxidant stress and antioxidant utilization, and to a reconsideration of the routine use of Allopurinol as pretreatment for TBI, and antioxidant support before and/or after TBI.","['Chevion, S', 'Or, R', 'Berry, E M']","['Chevion S', 'Or R', 'Berry EM']","['Department of Human Nutrition and Metabolism, Hebrew University-Hadassah School of Medicine, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Mol Biol Int,Biochemistry and molecular biology international,9306673,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '268B43MJ25 (Uric Acid)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)', 'Y2Z3ZTP9UM (Dehydroascorbic Acid)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/therapy', 'Antioxidants/*analysis', 'Ascorbic Acid/blood', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Dehydroascorbic Acid/blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Uric Acid/blood', '*Whole-Body Irradiation']",,1999/07/20 00:00,1999/07/20 00:01,['1999/07/20 00:00'],"['1999/07/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/15216549900202143 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem Mol Biol Int. 1999 Jun;47(6):1019-27. doi: 10.1080/15216549900202143.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To evaluate the effect they were scored according to 4 grades, and evaluated every 24 hours from the start of chemotherapy to 5 days after its completion. The complete inhibition rate of vomiting was as high as 71.4% and 92.3% in the single and combination groups, respectively, showing no significant difference. The grade of vomiting was mild in both groups. Nausea was noted in 71.4% and 46.2%, respectively, and the inhibitory effect tended to be higher in the combination group. Appetite loss developed in 92.9% and 41.7%, respectively, and the prevention effect was clearly higher in the combination group. The prevention effects on nausea 7, 8 and 10 days after the start of chemotherapy, on appetite loss 2-10 days after it, and 2-5 days after its completion, were higher in the combination group. Granisetron revealed an excellent inhibitory effect on vomiting induced by remission induction chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia, but combination with granisetron and methylprednisolone was considered useful for nausea in the latter half of the treatment period and for appetite loss during the whole period.","['Ono, K', 'Uchida, I', 'Uno, N', 'Ohno, E', 'Hirota, K', 'Nakayama, T', 'Ohtuka, E', 'Saburi, Y', 'Kikuchi, H', 'Nasu, M']","['Ono K', 'Uchida I', 'Uno N', 'Ohno E', 'Hirota K', 'Nakayama T', 'Ohtuka E', 'Saburi Y', 'Kikuchi H', 'Nasu M']","['Dept. of Hematology, Almeida Memorial Hospital.']",['jpn'],"['Clinical Trial', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

Both mutant proteins exhibited a significant loss in their polymerase and pyrophosphorolysis activities with a more pronounced effect noted with the Gln --> Asn substitution. The catalytic efficiencies of the mutants exhibited a 40-70-fold reduction with poly(rC) and poly(dC) templates in the presence of Mg(2+) and a 10-20-fold reduction with poly(rA) template in the presence of Mn(2+). Interestingly, the K(m) for NTP exhibited only a moderate 3-10-fold increase irrespective of the template-primer and the metal ion. Photoaffinity labeling of both the mutant and the WT enzymes exhibited an identical affinity for RNA.DNA and DNA.DNA template-primers. However, unlike the WT enzyme, the mutant enzymes exhibited a significantly reduced ability to catalyze the nucleotidyltransferase reaction on the covalently immobilized template-primer. An examination of the rate constants for the first and the second nucleotide for the mutant enzymes indicated dissimilar rates, indicating that Gln(190) may be involved in a rate-limiting, conformational change step both before and after the phosphodiester bond formation. Furthermore, the processivity of DNA synthesis by the mutant enzymes was decreased severely, which may result from the lower catalytic efficiency as well as translocation defect.","['Jin, J', 'Kaushik, N', 'Singh, K', 'Modak, M J']","['Jin J', 'Kaushik N', 'Singh K', 'Modak MJ']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Medicine and Dentistry-New Jersey Medical School and Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Newark, New Jersey 07103, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0RH81L854J (Glutamine)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Catalysis', 'Glutamine/metabolism', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*enzymology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/genetics/*metabolism']",,1999/07/20 00:00,1999/07/20 00:01,['1999/07/20 00:00'],"['1999/07/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/20 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.274.30.20861 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)72517-4 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1999 Jul 23;274(30):20861-8. doi: 10.1074/jbc.274.30.20861.,,,['GM 36307/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

The objectives of this work are to investigate the incorporation of AA into K562 cells and to assess the effects of the exogenous addition of AA and lipoxygenase products on their growth. The mechanism of acylation of [3H]-AA indicates that K562 cells incorporate AA into their membrane phospholipids and triglycerides. PLA2-treatment and base hydrolysis experiments confirm that [3H]-AA is incorporated unmodified into K562 phospholipids and is linked by an ester bond. Prelabelling-chase experiments indicate a transfer of labelled AA from phosphatidylcholine to phosphatidylethanolamine. The addition of AA and lipoxygenase products of AA (leukotriene B4 and C4, lipoxin B4, 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE) and 15-HETE) has no effect on K562 cell proliferation assessed by [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA.

One reason for the alteration of pharmacokinetics may be the modulation of the function of P-glycoprotein, whose efflux pump occurs in resistant cancer cells, in human intestine and in the blood-brain barrier. For this reason we tested the effect of several anti-psychotic drugs on the multidrug-resistant pump, P-glycoprotein. We found that in the MDR gene transfected L121C MDR, L5178 MDR and in the KB-V-1 cells selected for resistance some antipsychotic drugs block the function of P-glycoprotein. Blood cells of two treatment-resistant leukemic patients also showed increased uptake of daunorubicin if treated ex vivo with the anti-psychotic drugs.

In this context, factors related to the child's immune system are of special interest. Information on such factors was obtained in a recent German case-control study comprising more than 1000 children with acute leukaemia. Neither being the first-born child, nor a short duration of breastfeeding, indicators of a deficit in viral contacts during infancy or the number of infectious diseases, were significant risk factors. We observed a strong association with fewer routine immunizations with a 3.2-fold increase for those children getting less than four immunizations, but this association could partly be explained by reporting bias. While tonsillectomy or appendectomy increased the risk of leukaemia in our studies, a protective effect of allergies could be seen. In summary, we found only weak support for the delayed exposure hypothesis. To some extent this may be due to the chosen surrogate markers which reflect, rather indirectly, immunological isolation in infancy and delayed exposure to common viruses. However, the significant findings for routine immunizations, tonsillectomy and allergies of the child or its parents merit further investigation.","['Schuz, J', 'Kaletsch, U', 'Meinert, R', 'Kaatsch, P', 'Michaelis, J']","['Schuz J', 'Kaletsch U', 'Meinert R', 'Kaatsch P', 'Michaelis J']","['Institut fur Medizinische Statistik und Dokumentation der Johannes Gutenberg-Universitat Mainz, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Germany/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Hypersensitivity/epidemiology/immunology', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Infections/epidemiology/immunology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/classification/epidemiology/*immunology', 'Risk Factors']",PMC2362320,1999/07/17 00:00,1999/07/17 00:01,['1999/07/17 00:00'],"['1999/07/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/17 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bjc.6690395 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1999 May;80(3-4):585-90. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6690395.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since human sera are polyclonal in nature, one cannot readily discriminate between an immunoglobulin-specific recognition and multiple bindings of diverse antibodies. To overcome this difficulty we generated murine monoclonal antibodies to synthetic peptides mimicking all or portions of these gp46 regions. The reactivity of some of these antibodies to synthetic peptides harboring (or not harboring) the preceding amino acid substitutions at position 192 or 250, to denatured gp46 by Western blotting, and to live (variously substituted) HTLV-I-infected cells, combined with blocking experiments with various peptides, allow us to conclude that the major epitopes (positions 183-191, 190-197, 190-199, and 246-252) in the two immunodominant regions may elicit different antibody responses according to their sequences. It is worth noting that in a reporter gene inhibition assay, it was found that a neutralizing monoclonal antibody (MF1), the epitope for which is located between residues 190 and 197, had a high level of activity when cells (2060) harboring a gp46 with proline at position 192 were used and had no activity toward cells (1010) with a serine at this position. Therefore our results establish that certain amino acid substitutions of gp46 may drastically affect the antigenicity of the molecule and the biological activity of the antibodies elicited.","['Londos-Gagliardi, D', 'Jauvin, V', 'Armengaut, M H', 'Astier-Gin, T', 'Goetz, M', 'Huet, S', 'Guillemain, B J']","['Londos-Gagliardi D', 'Jauvin V', 'Armengaut MH', 'Astier-Gin T', 'Goetz M', 'Huet S', 'Guillemain BJ']","['INSERM, U328, Structures et Fonctions des Retrovirus Humains, Institute Bergonie, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses,AIDS research and human retroviruses,8709376,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Deltaretrovirus Antibodies)', '0 (Deltaretrovirus Antigens)', '0 (Epitopes, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Immunodominant Epitopes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Isotypes)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (gp46 protein, Human T-cell leukemia virus type I)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Cricetinae', 'Deltaretrovirus Antibodies/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'Deltaretrovirus Antigens/chemistry/*immunology', 'Epitope Mapping', 'Epitopes, B-Lymphocyte/*immunology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Gene Products, env/chemical synthesis/*immunology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunodominant Epitopes/chemistry/*immunology', 'Immunoglobulin Isotypes/immunology', 'Liver/cytology/immunology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptides/chemical synthesis/*immunology', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/chemical synthesis/*immunology', 'Vero Cells']",,1999/07/17 00:00,1999/07/17 00:01,['1999/07/17 00:00'],"['1999/07/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/17 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/088922299310629 [doi]'],ppublish,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses. 1999 Jul 1;15(10):909-20. doi: 10.1089/088922299310629.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These results indicate that caspase 3 and 6 activation and their regulation by Bcl-2 may play important roles in photodynamic therapy (PDT)-induced cell killing.","['Granville, D J', 'Jiang, H', 'An, M T', 'Levy, J G', 'McManus, B M', 'Hunt, D W']","['Granville DJ', 'Jiang H', 'An MT', 'Levy JG', 'McManus BM', 'Hunt DW']","['QLT Photo Therapeutics, Vancouver, BC, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Porphyrins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '113719-89-4 (benzoporphyrin D)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/*genetics', '*Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', '*Photochemotherapy', 'Porphyrins', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC2362171,1999/07/17 00:00,1999/07/17 00:01,['1999/07/17 00:00'],"['1999/07/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/17 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bjc.6690017 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1999 Jan;79(1):95-100. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6690017.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Swedish Child Leukaemia Group.,30-3,"A population-based sample of acute childhood leukaemia cases in Sweden 1973-94 was analysed by a geographical information system (GIS) for spatial leukaemia distribution in relation to population density. The annual incidence rate for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) was 3.6, and for acute non-lymphoblastic leukaemia (ANLL) 0.7, cases per 100,000 children. Incidence rates in population centres, constituting 1.3% of Sweden's land area and approximately 80% of the population, compared with the rest of Sweden showed a statistically significant excess of ALL [odds ratio (OR) 1.68; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.44-1.95], but not ANLL (OR 1.13; 95% CI 0.98-1.32). An increasing trend, however not statistically significant, was found for ALL incidence with both increasing population density in parishes and increasing degree of urbanity in municipalities. These findings support the theories that some environmental factors associated with high population density, such as infectious agents, may be of aetiological importance for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.","['Hjalmars, U', 'Gustafsson, G']","['Hjalmars U', 'Gustafsson G']","['Department of Pediatrics, Ostersunds Hospital, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,,IM,"['Child', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology/etiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Sweden/epidemiology']",PMC2362158,1999/07/17 00:00,1999/07/17 00:01,['1999/07/17 00:00'],"['1999/07/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/17 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bjc.6690007 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1999 Jan;79(1):30-3. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6690007.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a result, trends in survival over time are difficult to interpret because changes in overall survival may well reflect changes in the risk of death from other causes, rather than from the cancer of interest. One way of overcoming this problem is to use some form of 'relative survival' defined as a measure of survival corrected for the effect of other independent causes of death. Since this concept was first introduced, various methods for calculating relative survival have been proposed and this had led to some confusion as to the most appropriate choice of estimate. This paper aims to provide an introduction to the concept of relative survival and reviews some of the suggested methods of estimation. In addition, a particularly simple, but robust approach, is highlighted based on expected and observed mortality. This method is illustrated using preliminary data from the Office for National Statistics on cancer survival in patients born after 1939 and diagnosed with cancer during 1972-84. The examples presented, although limited to analyses on a small number of selected sites, highlight some encouraging trends in survival in people aged under 35 diagnosed with leukaemia, Hodgkin's disease and testicular cancer during this period.","['Reeves, G K', 'Beral, V', 'Bull, D', 'Quinn, M']","['Reeves GK', 'Beral V', 'Bull D', 'Quinn M']","['Imperial Cancer Research Fund Cancer Epidemiology Unit, University of Oxford, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,,IM,"['Cohort Studies', 'England/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/*mortality', 'Registries', 'Survival Rate/*trends', 'Wales/epidemiology']",PMC2362154,1999/07/17 00:00,1999/07/17 00:01,['1999/07/17 00:00'],"['1999/07/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/17 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bjc.6690005 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1999 Jan;79(1):18-22. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6690005.,,,,16,,,,,,,,,

This effect may be due to the presence of high levels of isoflavones derived from the soya bean, particularly genistein which has been shown to be a protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) inhibitor and have both oestrogenic and anti-oestrogenic properties. We have examined the effect of genistein and a number of novel synthetic analogues on both normal (IEC6, IEC18) and transformed (SW620, HT29) intestinal epithelial cell lines. Responses were compared to those elicited by oestradiol, the anti-oestrogen tamoxifen, and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor tyrphostin. Genistein and tamoxifen were potent inhibitors of cell proliferation. Of seven novel isoflavones tested, none were more potent inhibitors than genistein, and all displayed similar relative activities across the different cell lines. In addition to inhibiting cell proliferation, cell death via apoptosis was observed when the cells were exposed to the isoflavones and all but one exhibited PTK inhibitory activity. These data suggest that by reducing proliferation and inducing apoptosis, possibly due in part to PTK inhibition, isoflavones may have a role in protecting normal intestinal epithelium from tumour development (reducing the risk) and may reduce colonic tumour growth.","['Booth, C', 'Hargreaves, D F', 'Hadfield, J A', 'McGown, A T', 'Potten, C S']","['Booth C', 'Hargreaves DF', 'Hadfield JA', 'McGown AT', 'Potten CS']","['Epithelial Biology Group, Paterson Institute for Cancer Research, Christie Hospital NHS Trust, Manchester, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Isoflavones)', '0 (Tyrphostins)', '094ZI81Y45 (Tamoxifen)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Intestinal Mucosa/cytology/*drug effects', 'Isoflavones/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia P388/enzymology/pathology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Rats', 'Tamoxifen/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrphostins/pharmacology']",PMC2363089,1999/07/17 00:00,1999/07/17 00:01,['1999/07/17 00:00'],"['1999/07/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/17 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bjc.6690559 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1999 Jul;80(10):1550-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6690559.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The occurrence of ecto-PK on the surface of human leukemia cell lines was described [Paas, Y., Fishelson, Z., 1995. Shedding of tyrosine and serine/threonine ecto-PK from human leukemic cells. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 316 780-788.]. These ecto-PKs have been shown to phosphorylate several exogenous substrates, including the complement C9 protein, an essential component of the terminal complement system. C9 is phosphorylated by ecto-PK of K562 cells on serine residue(s). Phosphorylation occurs in the N-terminal C9a portion produced by cleavage of phosphorylated C9 with human alpha-thrombin. C9 polymers generated upon incubation of C9 with ZnCl2 do not serve as substrates for the K562 ecto-PK. In contrast, unfolded C9, obtained by reduction and alkylation, serves as a superior substrate for the K562 ecto-PK. Native C9 phosphorylation produced a rather low stoichiometry of incorporated phosphate (around 3%) per C9. Despite that, the phosphorylated C9 expressed reduced hemolytic activity. The complement-sensitive variant of K562 (K562/S) did not express the C9 phosphorylating activity. Various PK inhibitors tested failed to block C9 phosphorylation. Only heparin and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (dpGA) prevented C9 phosphorylation, indicating that the ecto-PK is related to the casein kinase CK2. C9 can be phosphorylated by ecto-PK from other tumor cells, including Jurkat, SK-OV-3 and BT-474. These results suggest that extracellular phosphorylation of C9 may serve as a protective mechanism against complement in tumor cells.","['Paas, Y', 'Bohana-Kashtan, O', 'Fishelson, Z']","['Paas Y', 'Bohana-Kashtan O', 'Fishelson Z']","['Department of Neurobiology, The Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Immunopharmacology,Immunopharmacology,7902474,"['0 (Complement C9)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (ectoprotein kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Casein Kinase II)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Casein Kinase II', 'Complement C9/*metabolism', 'Hemolysis', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*enzymology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Sheep']",,1999/07/17 00:00,1999/07/17 00:01,['1999/07/17 00:00'],"['1999/07/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/17 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/17 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0162-3109(99)00027-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0162-3109(99)00027-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Immunopharmacology. 1999 May;42(1-3):175-85. doi: 10.1016/s0162-3109(99)00027-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Six hundred and seven non-exposed patients with meningioma were also studied. Treatment dates were from 1975 to 1992.
