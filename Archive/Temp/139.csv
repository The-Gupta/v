MATERIAL AND METHODS: Treatment outcomes on the protocol AML-01.01 are presented for 354 AML patients from 29 hematological centers located in 22 towns of Russia and 2 towns of Ukraine. The patients were randomized into 3 groups by variant of therapy: 124 patients (62 males and 62 females; age median 42 years) received 4 courses of 7+3+VP-16 and 5 courses of maintenance therapy (7+3 with thioguanin); 130 patients (65 males and 65 females, age median 41 year) received 2 courses of 7+3+VP-16, 2 courses 7+3, maintenance--5 courses 7+3 with thioguanin; 126 patients (57 males and 68 females, age median 40 years) were given 2 courses of 7+3+VP-16, 2 HAD courses, treatment discontinuation. RESULTS: A complete remission after the first course of 7+3+VP-16 was achieved in 55% patients, after the second course--in 30% after the course 7+3+VP-16 or 7+3 with mitoxantron, in 70%--after NAM. Overall and recurrence-free survival were 18 and 35%; 30 and 20%; 36 and 30%, respectively. There was no significant difference in efficacy of the treatment scheme. CONCLUSION: The multivariate analysis has shown that a leading factor having impact on treatment results was the number of randomized patients: the less patients were randomized, the worse were the results.","['Parovichnikova, E N', 'Savchenko, V G', 'Isaev, V G', 'Sokolov, A N', 'Kulikov, S M', 'Kliasova, G A', 'Ryzhko, V V', 'Kravchenko, S K', 'Khoroshko, N D', 'Konstantinova, T S', 'Zagoskina, T P', 'Ziuzgin, I S', 'Rekhtman, G B', 'Moskov, V I', 'Sokolova, I V', 'Anchukova, L V', 'Lapin, V A', 'Loginov, A B', 'Tumakov, V A', 'Korobkin, A V', 'Miliutina, G I', 'Samoilova, O S', ""Mal'tsev, V I"", 'Pristupa, A S', ""Men'shakova, S N"", 'Domnikova, N P', 'Gavrilova, L V', 'Obidina, N A', 'Porokhina, O V', 'Kaplanov, K D', 'Medvedeva, L I', 'Khuazheva, N K', 'Pilipenko, G I', 'Golubeva, M E', 'Maksimov, A G', 'Ploskikh, M A', 'Khlevnaia, N V']","['Parovichnikova EN', 'Savchenko VG', 'Isaev VG', 'Sokolov AN', 'Kulikov SM', 'Kliasova GA', 'Ryzhko VV', 'Kravchenko SK', 'Khoroshko ND', 'Konstantinova TS', 'Zagoskina TP', 'Ziuzgin IS', 'Rekhtman GB', 'Moskov VI', 'Sokolova IV', 'Anchukova LV', 'Lapin VA', 'Loginov AB', 'Tumakov VA', 'Korobkin AV', 'Miliutina GI', 'Samoilova OS', ""Mal'tsev VI"", 'Pristupa AS', ""Men'shakova SN"", 'Domnikova NP', 'Gavrilova LV', 'Obidina NA', 'Porokhina OV', 'Kaplanov KD', 'Medvedeva LI', 'Khuazheva NK', 'Pilipenko GI', 'Golubeva ME', 'Maksimov AG', 'Ploskikh MA', 'Khlevnaia NV']",['rus'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",Russia (Federation),Ter Arkh,Terapevticheskii arkhiv,2984818R,"['BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/*mortality', 'Male', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Recurrence', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage', 'Treatment Outcome']",2007/09/07 09:00,2007/09/29 09:00,['2007/09/07 09:00'],"['2007/09/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/29 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/07 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ter Arkh. 2007;79(7):14-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Age-distributed models are the simplest way to account for varied behavior of individual cells. However, this simplicity is offset by difficulties in making observations of age distributions, so age-distributed models are difficult to fit to experimental data. Herein, the proposed methodology is implemented to identify an age-structured model for human leukemia cells (Jurkat) based only on measurements of the total number density after the addition of bromodeoxyuridine partitions the total cell population into two subpopulations. Each of the subpopulations will temporarily undergo a period of unbalanced growth, which provides sufficient information to extract age-dependent transition rates, while the total cell population remains in balanced growth. The stipulation of initial balanced growth permits the derivation of age densities based on only age-dependent transition rates. In fitting the experimental data, a flexible transition rate representation, utilizing a series of cubic spline nodes, finds a bimodal G(0)/G(1) transition age probability distribution best fits the experimental data. This resolution may be unnecessary as convex combinations of more restricted transition rates derived from normalized Gaussian, lognormal, or skewed lognormal transition-age probability distributions corroborate the spline predictions, but require fewer parameters. The fit of data with a single log normal distribution is somewhat inferior suggesting the bimodal result as more likely. Regardless of the choice of basis functions, this methodology can identify age distributions, age-specific transition rates, and transition-age distributions during balanced growth conditions.","['Sherer, E', 'Tocce, E', 'Hannemann, R E', 'Rundell, A E', 'Ramkrishna, D']","['Sherer E', 'Tocce E', 'Hannemann RE', 'Rundell AE', 'Ramkrishna D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biotechnol Bioeng,Biotechnology and bioengineering,7502021,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle/*physiology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cellular Senescence/*physiology', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', '*Models, Biological']",2007/09/06 09:00,2008/02/22 09:00,['2007/09/06 09:00'],"['2007/09/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biotechnol Bioeng. 2008 Mar 1;99(4):960-74. doi: 10.1002/bit.21633.,['10.1002/bit.21633 [doi]'],"['Copyright 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['School of Chemical Engineering, Forney Hall of Chemical Engineering, 480 Stadium Mall Way, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana 47907, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent data report the presence of CD38 in different cellular compartments raising new questions about its effective role in cellular metabolism. In rat hepatocyte nuclei, CD38 has been proposed as a responsive to cADPR integral inner membrane protein suggesting that the nuclear envelope may also be an important source of Ca2+ stores. Further reports indicating that CD38 is localized in nuclear compartments in a variety of cell types and tissues including brain, liver, eye, spleen, and bone raise the condition of resolving the question concerning the effective presence of CD38 within the nucleus. Here we report data supporting the presence of CD38 at nuclear level independently of expression of surface CD38. We utilized two different human leukemia cell lines expressing or not expressing CD38 molecule on their cell surface. The morphological and biochemical results including enzymatic activity and proteomic determinations explain the effective nuclear localization of CD38 in human Raji and K562 cells. Since cell nucleus is a complex and highly dynamic environment with many functionally specialized regions, the nuclear localization of specific proteins represents an important mechanism in signal transduction. The presence of CD38 at the interchromatin region whether linked to nuclear scaffold or stored in nuclear structures as micronuclei and Cajal bodies co-localizing with coilin, suggests its involvement in nuclear processes including transcription, replication, repairing and splicing.","['Trubiani, Oriana', 'Guarnieri, Simone', 'Eleuterio, Enrica', 'Di Giuseppe, Fabrizio', 'Orciani, Monia', 'Angelucci, Stefania', 'Di Primio, Roberto']","['Trubiani O', 'Guarnieri S', 'Eleuterio E', 'Di Giuseppe F', 'Orciani M', 'Angelucci S', 'Di Primio R']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '136882-81-0 (p80-coilin)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Chromatin/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Coiled Bodies/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Microscopy, Immunoelectron', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism']",2007/09/06 09:00,2008/06/21 09:00,['2007/09/06 09:00'],"['2007/09/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2008 Mar 1;103(4):1294-308. doi: 10.1002/jcb.21510.,['10.1002/jcb.21510 [doi]'],,"['Department of Oral Science, University ""G.

This study was designed to describe mortality trends in childhood leukemia and the impact of social inequalities on these trends in Brazil from 1980 to 2002. METHODS: Cancer mortality data by cause and estimates of resident population stratified by age and sex were obtained from the Brazilian Mortality Information System (SIM) for the years 1980 to 2002. Age-standardized (ages 0-19 years) mortality rates were calculated by the direct method using the 1960 world standard population. Trends were modeled using linear regression with 3-year moving average rates as the dependent variable and with the midpoint of the calendar year interval (1991) as the independent variable. The Index of Social Exclusion was used to classify the 27 Brazilian states. Pearson correlation was used to describe the correlation between social exclusion and variations in mortality in each state. RESULTS: Age-standardized mortality rates for boys decreased from 2.05 per 100,000 habitants in 1984 to 1.44 100,000 habitants in 1995, whereas the observed corresponding decline among girls was from 1.60 per 100,000 habitants in 1986 to 1.14 per 100,000 habitants in 1995. Statistically significant declining trends in mortality rates were observed for boys (adjusted correlation coefficient [r(2)] = 0.68; P < .001) and girls (adjusted r(2) = 0.62; P < .001). Significant negative correlations between social inequality and changes in mortality were noted for boys (r = -0.66; P = .001) and for girls (r = -0.78; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: A consistent decrease in mortality rates from childhood leukemia was noted in Brazil. Higher decreases in mortality were observed in more developed states, possibly reflecting better health care.","['Ribeiro, Karina B', 'Lopes, Luiz F', 'de Camargo, Beatriz']","['Ribeiro KB', 'Lopes LF', 'de Camargo B']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Brazil/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease Management', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/*mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Mortality/*trends', 'Prejudice', '*Social Class']",2007/09/06 09:00,2007/11/14 09:00,['2007/09/06 09:00'],"['2007/09/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 2007 Oct 15;110(8):1823-31. doi: 10.1002/cncr.22982.,['10.1002/cncr.22982 [doi]'],,"['Hospital Cancer Registry, Hospital A.

This conclusion is based mainly on indoor exposure measurements. We therefore regarded it important to map outdoor magnetic flux densities in public areas in Trondheim, Norway. Because of seasonal power consumption variations, the fields were measured during both summer and winter. Magnetic flux density was mapped 1.0 m above the ground along 17 km of pavements in downtown Trondheim. The spectrum was measured at some spots and the magnetic flux density emanated mainly from the power frequency of 50 Hz. In summer less than 4% of the streets showed values exceeding 0.4 microT, increasing to 29% and 34% on cold and on snowy winter days, respectively. The average levels were 0.13 microT (summer), 0.85 microT (winter, cold), and 0.90 microT (winter, snow), with the highest recorded value of 37 microT. High spot measurements were usually encountered above underground transformer substations. In winter electric heating of pavements also gave rise to relatively high flux densities.

Posterior fossa malformations such as cerebellar hypoplasia or Joubert syndrome are known to be related to developmental problems in a marked to moderate extent. More detailed analyses reveal special deficits in attention, processing speed, visuospatial functions and language. A study about Dandy Walker syndrome states a relationship of abnormalities in vermis lobulation with developmental problems. Further lobulation or volume abnormalities of the cerebellum and/or vermis can be detected in disorders as fragile X syndrome, Downs's syndrome or William's syndrome. Neuropsychological studies reveal a relation of dyslexia and attention deficit disorder with cerebellar functions. These functional studies are supported by structural abnormalities in neuroimaging in these disorders. Acquired cerebellar or vermis atrophy was found in groups of children with developmental problems such as prenatal alcohol exposure or extreme prematurity. Also focal lesions during childhood or adolescence such as cerebellar tumour or stroke are related with neuropsychological abnormalities, which are most pronounced in visuo-spatial, language and memory functions. In addition, cerebellar atrophy was shown to be a bad prognostic factor considering cognitive outcome in children after brain trauma and leukaemia. In ataxia teleangiectasia, a neurodegenerative disorder affecting primarily the cerebellar cortex, a reduced verbal IQ and problems of judgment of duration are a hint of the importance of the cerebellum in cognition. In conclusion, the cerebellum seems to play an important role in many higher cognitive functions especially in learning. There is a suggestion that the earlier the incorrect influence the more pronounced the problems.","['Steinlin, Maja']",['Steinlin M'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cerebellum,"Cerebellum (London, England)",101089443,,IM,"['Cerebellar Diseases/etiology/physiopathology', 'Cerebellum/*physiology', 'Child', 'Child Development/*physiology', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cognition/*physiology', 'Humans']",2007/09/06 09:00,2007/12/07 09:00,['2007/09/06 09:00'],"['2007/09/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cerebellum. 2007;6(3):237-41. doi: 10.1080/14734220701344507.,"['777417103 [pii]', '10.1080/14734220701344507 [doi]']",,"[""Neuropaediatrics, University Children's Hospital, Inselspital, Bern, Switzerland. maja.steinlin@insel.ch""]",,43,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In November 1984, following a diagnosis of acceleration, he received an autologous hemopoietic transplant after conditioning with cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation. The autologous marrow was purged with mafosfamide. Over 20 years, the patient remained in chronic phase of CML. Multiple nonrecurrent clonal chromosomal abnormalities appeared leading to a very complex karyotype, including among others involvement of chromosomes 1, 7, 9, 13, 19, and X. Fluorescent in situ hybridization showed that the two chromosomes 9 were involved. Acute myeloid crisis was diagnosed in February, 2004. Treatment with imatinib mesylate resulted within 6 months in a total disappearance of all chromosomal abnormalities with a complete cytogenetic and molecular response, which persists 3 years later. We question whether the ex vivo purging procedure with mafosfamide has favored the occurrence of these particular cytogenetic abnormalities (with no independent oncogenic potential) within the original leukemic stem cell pool. It remains unclear whether the autologous transplantation has indeed resulted into some prolongation of the duration of the chronic phase, which lasted for 20 years. At time of acute crisis, the dramatic response to imatinib mesylate leading to a complete cytogenetic and molecular response is noteworthy.","['Van Den Akker, J', 'Coppo, P', 'Portnoi, M F', 'Barbu, V', 'Bories, D', 'Gorin, N C']","['Van Den Akker J', 'Coppo P', 'Portnoi MF', 'Barbu V', 'Bories D', 'Gorin NC']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Letter']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",2007/09/06 09:00,2007/11/09 09:00,['2007/09/06 09:00'],"['2007/09/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/09 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2007 Sep;48(9):1858-65. doi: 10.1080/10428190701534440.,"['781799798 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190701534440 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A link between SV40 and NHL is biologically plausible since SV40 causes hematological malignancies in laboratory rodents. We investigated 266 Egyptian cases of hematological malignancies (158 NHL, 54 HD, 26 ALL, 13 AML, 8 CLL, 7 CML) and 34 subjects as a control for detection of SV40 DNA using nested PCR. SV40 DNA sequences were found in (53.8%) of NHL, (29.6%) of HD and in (40.7%) of different types of leukemia cases. Frequency of SV40 DNA sequences was higher in NHL patients compared with those with the other tumors and control group (p < 0.05). The highest frequency was in Burkitt's lymphoma followed by diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The present study suggests that SV40 is significantly associated with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and most probably acts as a cofactor in the pathogenesis of these tumors.

Apoptosis was partially attributed to an imbalance in nucleosides with some protection upon the addition of pyrimidines. The effect of guanosine on cell proliferation and viability was biphasic whereby cells were able to recover from an initial cell cycle arrest and re-enter the cell cycle upon removal of guanosine in a time-dependent fashion. However, exposure to guanosine beyond 24 h prevented recovery and ultimately led to death. Death occurred with a decrease in bcl-2 protein expression, thus suggesting that the pathway to apoptosis involved change(s) in the intracellular environment that were ultimately sensed by the mitochondria. Expression of the unique guanosine-specific nucleoside transporter csg in NB4 cells may provide an opportunity to harness guanosine-mediated cell death in the treatment of APL and related malignancies while sparing normal cells.","['Flanagan, Sheryl A', 'Gandhi, Varsha', 'Meckling, Kelly A']","['Flanagan SA', 'Gandhi V', 'Meckling KA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '12133JR80S (Guanosine)', '64ALC7F90C (Dipyridamole)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'K8CXK5Q32L (pyrimidine)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Biological Transport', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA/analysis', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Dipyridamole/pharmacology', 'Guanosine/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology']",2007/09/06 09:00,2007/11/09 09:00,['2007/09/06 09:00'],"['2007/09/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/09 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2007 Sep;48(9):1816-27. doi: 10.1080/10428190701528491.,"['781803793 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190701528491 [doi]']",,"['Department of Human Health and Nutritional Sciences, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario, Canada. sflan@umich.edu']",['CA57629/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is mainly due to poor quality DNA because of degradation and hence difficulties to amplify products of the needed length. Therefore, most previous attempts to determine clonality have depended on primers binding to framework region 3 thus producing amplification products of relatively short length. In order to improve clonality analyses, we have developed a sensitive monoplex PCR-protocol using primers binding to framework region 1 with extended cycling (42 cycles) and subsequent heteroduplex analysis. For comparison, multiplex reactions with alternative primers binding to framework region 1 according to the BIOMED-2 protocol were analyzed. By the two methods combined, we were able to detect clonality of 94% (16/17) of mature small B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas. The results suggest that PCR with primers binding to frame work region 1 may be the method of choice when assessing clonality of mature small B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas on formalin-fixed tissue.","['Nelson, Dick', 'Nelson, Axel', 'Hjorthagen, Lena', 'Sjovall, Elisabet', 'Ehinger, Mats']","['Nelson D', 'Nelson A', 'Hjorthagen L', 'Sjovall E', 'Ehinger M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '1HG84L3525 (Formaldehyde)']",IM,"['DNA Primers', 'Formaldehyde', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/genetics', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2007/09/06 09:00,2007/11/09 09:00,['2007/09/06 09:00'],"['2007/09/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/09 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2007 Sep;48(9):1806-15. doi: 10.1080/10428190701493894.,"['781804357 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190701493894 [doi]']",,"['Department of Clinical Chemistry, Helsingborg Hospital, Helsingborg, Sweden.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The incidence of CLL is lower in Asian countries than in Western countries, where CLL is the most common leukemia. To investigate CLLU1 expression in CLL and explore the relationship between CLLU1 expression and alternative prognostic markers, we measured CLLU1 expression levels by semiquantitative RT-PCR in a cohort of 50 Chinese patients with CLL. Analyses of IgVH somatic mutational status, ZAP-70 expression, CD38 expression, and chromosomal aberrations were also performed. The expression of CLLU1 mRNA was determined in 26 of the 50 cases (52%), among which 7 at Binet A (7/21, 33.33%) and 19 at Binet B + C (19/29, 65.52%). The expression levels of CLLU1 were significantly increased in B + C CLL patients at Binet stage compared with those at Binet stage A (P = 0.005). Data for the IgVH somatic mutational status were available for 20 patients with known CLLU1 expression. Five (25%) patients, all expressed CLLU1 mRNA, displayed unmutated IgVH gene usage. While in 15 patients (15/20, 75%) with mutated IgVH gene, only 6 were CLLU1 positive. Patients with unmutated IgVH genes expressed higher levels of CLLU1 than did those with IgVH mutations (P < 0.05). Among 24 CD38(+)-CLL cases, 17 (70.83%) were CLLU1 positive, whereas only 9 (34.62%) positive cases were identified in 26 CD38(-)-CLL patients. Thus, the expression of CLLU1 in CD38(+)-CLL was significantly higher than that in CD38(-)-CLL. However, no significant difference of CLLU1 expression was found between ZAP-70(+) (14/22, 63.64%) and ZAP-70(-) (12/28, 42.86%) patients (P > 0.05).

Identifying agents to use in combination with TRAIL to enhance apoptosis in leukemia cells would increase the potential utility of this agent as a therapy for leukemia. Here, we show that 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14)-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2), a natural ligand for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma), can sensitize TRAIL-resistant leukemic HL-60 cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. The sensitization to TRAIL-induced apoptosis by 15d-PGJ2 was not blocked by a PPARgamma inhibitor (GW9662), suggesting a PPARgamma-independent mechanism. This process was accompanied by activation of caspase-8, caspase-9, and caspase-3 and was concomitant with Bid and PARP cleavage. We observed significant decreases in XIAP, Bcl-2, and c-FLIP after cotreatment with 15d-PGJ2 and TRAIL. We also observed the inhibition of Akt expression and phosphorylation by cotreatment with 15d-PGJ2 and TRAIL. Furthermore, inactivation of Akt by Akt inhibitor IV sensitized human leukemic HL-60 cells to TRAIL, indicating a key role for Akt inhibition in these events. Taken together, these findings indicate that 15d-PGJ2 may augment TRAIL-induced apoptosis in human leukemia cells by down-regulating the expression and phosphorylation of Akt.","['Han, Hoon', 'Shin, Sung-Won', 'Seo, Chi-Yeon', 'Kwon, Hyuk-Chan', 'Han, Jin-Yeong', 'Kim, In-Hoo', 'Kwak, Jong-Young', 'Park, Joo-In']","['Han H', 'Shin SW', 'Seo CY', 'Kwon HC', 'Han JY', 'Kim IH', 'Kwak JY', 'Park JI']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (15-deoxy-delta(12,14)-prostaglandin J2)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'RXY07S6CZ2 (Prostaglandin D2)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Down-Regulation/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Prostaglandin D2/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*physiology']",2007/09/06 09:00,2007/12/22 09:00,['2007/09/06 09:00'],"['2007/09/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Apoptosis. 2007 Nov;12(11):2101-14. doi: 10.1007/s10495-007-0124-2.,['10.1007/s10495-007-0124-2 [doi]'],,"['Department of Biochemistry, Dong-A University College of Medicine, 3 Ga 1, Dongdaesin-Dong, Seo-Gu, Busan 602-714, South Korea.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously reported a remarkable antitumoral effect of the retinoid 6-OH-11-O-hydroxyphenantrene (IIF) on neuroblastoma, leukemia and colon carcinoma cells. In this study we examined the effect of IIF on proliferation, apoptosis and cell invasion in the human glioblastoma cell line U87MG, in comparison with all-trans-retinoic acid (RA). Our results showed that both retinoids induced cell growth inhibition and apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner. We also demonstrated that the invasive ability of glioblastoma cells decreased after treatment with IIF or RA. Since cell invasion involves a complex system of tightly regulated proteases, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their specific inhibitors, tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs), we analysed the effect of IIF on MMP and TIMP expression in comparison with RA. Treatment with both retinoids resulted in a marked decrease of MMP2 and MMP9 expression and of lytic activity of MMP2. In addition, exposure to IIF led to enhanced expression of TIMP2. Collectively, our results demonstrated the effectiveness of both IIF and RA in inhibiting proliferation, cell migration, and the invasive potential of glioblastoma U87MG cells. Notably, the anticancer activity of IIF, on the whole, was more pronounced than that of RA. Therefore, these findings, besides providing further evidence that IIF may be a powerful tool in the development of cancer treatments, suggest that IIF may have therapeutic potential against the invasiveness of brain tumors.","['Papi, A', 'Bartolini, G', 'Ammar, K', 'Guerra, F', 'Ferreri, A M', 'Rocchi, P', 'Orlandi, M']","['Papi A', 'Bartolini G', 'Ammar K', 'Guerra F', 'Ferreri AM', 'Rocchi P', 'Orlandi M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (IIF compound)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '127497-59-0 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-2)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.4.24.24 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 2)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)']",IM,"['Annexin A5/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Brain Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Cell Movement/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Glioblastoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Humans', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 2/genetics/metabolism', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/pathology']",2007/09/06 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2007/09/06 09:00'],"['2007/09/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2007 Oct;18(4):1015-21. doi: 10.3892/or.18.4.1015.,['10.3892/or.18.4.1015 [doi]'],,"['Department of Experimental Evolutive Biology, University of Bologna, 40126 Bologna, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No significant association was found between in vitro sensitivtity to C1311 and doxorubicin or taxol. Moreover, the activity of C1311 was independent of the p53 gene status of the cell line. Twenty-four-hour exposure to C1311 led to a marked increase in the number of cells in the G2M phase in the majority of cell lines, although the extent of such accumulation was independent of the level of drug cytotoxic activity. C1311 did not generally affect the expression level of cyclin B1 or Cdk1 (p34cdc2) proteins. Conversely, when normalised on the basis of the number of cells arrested in the G2M compartment, Cdk1 kinase activity appeared lower than that of untreated cells in the 4 cell lines showing the most pronounced accumulation in G2M.

In this study, we found that MM-1 was bound to a component of proteasome and stimulated degradation of c-Myc in human cells. Knockdown of endogenous MM-1 in human HeLa cells by introduction of siRNA against MM-1 stabilized the endogenous c-Myc. To identify proteins that participate in c-Myc degradation by MM-1, in vivo and in vitro binding assays were carried out. The results showed that MM-1 directly bound to Rpt3, a subunit of 26S proteasome, and that c-Myc directly bound to Skp2, which recruited ElonginC, ElonginB and Cullin2, thereby forming a novel ubiquitin E3 ligase.

Lym-1 Ab mimics (synthetic high afinity ligands; SHALs) were generated and studied in vitro, using live cell binding assays, and/or pharmacokinetic studies over 24 h in xenografted mice given 1 or 20 microg SHAL doses i.v. Multimilligram amounts of each of the dimeric (bis) SHALs were synthesized at high purity, and labeled with indium-111 at high specific activity and purity.

Highly pure, dimeric mimics for HLA-DR Ab were synthesized, biotinylated and radiolabeled, and showed selectivity in vitro. Pharmacokinetic behavior in mice was influenced by the ligands and by the linker length of the dimeric SHALs. Nanomolar or better functional affinity was observed when a suitably long linker was used to connect the two bidentate SHALs.

ATF5 gene expression in CLL was further studied because of its role in the regulation of cell cycle progression/differentiation and apoptosis. The overexpression of ATF5 was confirmed by real-time PCR using 39 CLL samples from the poor and good outcome groups. ATF5 was significantly (p<0.001) overexpressed in the poor outcome group. Furthermore, ATF5 expression was significantly higher in the 11q deletion as well as trisomy 12 group alone compared to the 13q deletion and normal karyotype groups. ATF5 overexpression was also associated with significantly (p=0.04) shorter time to treatment. Similarly, expression of five underexpressed genes also correlated with longer time to treatment. Thus, this report demonstrates that ATF5 may be one of the key genes involved in increased proliferation and survival in 11q deletion or trisomy 12, whereas CD16, CD86, SLAM, MNDA and ATF2 may be involved in the decreased proliferation of CLL cells with 13q deletion or normal karyotype.","['Mittal, Amit K', 'Hegde, Ganapati V', 'Aoun, Patricia', 'Bociek, Robert G', 'Dave, Bhavana J', 'Joshi, Avadhut D', 'Sanger, Warren G', 'Weisenburger, Dennis D', 'Joshi, Shantaram S']","['Mittal AK', 'Hegde GV', 'Aoun P', 'Bociek RG', 'Dave BJ', 'Joshi AD', 'Sanger WG', 'Weisenburger DD', 'Joshi SS']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Mol Med,International journal of molecular medicine,9810955,"['0 (ATF5 protein, human)', '0 (Activating Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Activating Transcription Factors/metabolism', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12/*genetics', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*genetics/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Trisomy/*genetics']",2007/09/06 09:00,2007/12/12 09:00,['2007/09/06 09:00'],"['2007/09/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Mol Med. 2007 Oct;20(4):461-9.,,,"['Department of Genetics, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198-6395, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, immediately after RTX infusions, there is substantial loss (shaving) of CD20 from circulating malignant cells. Because shaving can compromise efficacies of anticancer immunotherapeutic mAbs, we investigated whether shaving occurs in SCID mouse models. Z138 cells, a B cell line derived from human mantle cell lymphoma, were infused i.v. or s.c. The i.v. model recapitulates findings we previously reported for therapeutic RTX in CLL: i.v. infused RTX rapidly binds to Z138 cells in lungs, and binding is accompanied by deposition of C3 fragments. However, within 1 h targeted cells lose bound RTX and CD20, and these shaved cells are still demonstrable 40 h after RTX infusion. Z138 cells grow in tumors at s.c. injection sites, and infusion of large amounts of RTX (0.50 mg on each of 4 days) leads to considerable loss of CD20 from these cells. Human i.v. Ig blocked shaving, suggesting that FcgammaRI on cells of the mononuclear phagocytic system promote shaving. Examination of frozen tumor sections from treated mice by immunofluorescence revealed large areas of B cells devoid of CD20, with CD20 intact in adjacent areas; it is likely that RTX had opsonized Z138 cells closest to capillaries, and these cells were shaved by monocyte/macrophages. The shaving reaction occurs in neoplastic B cells in tissue and in peripheral blood, and strategies to enhance therapeutic targeting and block shaving are under development.","['Li, Yongli', 'Williams, Michael E', 'Cousar, John B', 'Pawluczkowycz, Andrew W', 'Lindorfer, Margaret A', 'Taylor, Ronald P']","['Li Y', 'Williams ME', 'Cousar JB', 'Pawluczkowycz AW', 'Lindorfer MA', 'Taylor RP']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Complement C3)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/*metabolism', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Complement C3/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Injections, Subcutaneous', 'Lung Neoplasms/*immunology/*metabolism/pathology/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/immunology/metabolism/pathology/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/*immunology/*metabolism/pathology/therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Peptide Fragments/metabolism', 'Rituximab']",2007/09/06 09:00,2007/11/06 09:00,['2007/09/06 09:00'],"['2007/09/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2007 Sep 15;179(6):4263-71. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.179.6.4263.,"['179/6/4263 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.179.6.4263 [doi]']",,"['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA 22908, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of primary AML, blast crisis CML (bcCML), ALL, and chronic lymphoblastic leukemia (CLL) specimens showed rapid induction of cell death upon treatment with TDZD-8. In addition, for myeloid leukemias, cytotoxicity was observed for phenotypically primitive cells, in vitro colony-forming progenitors, and LSCs as defined by xenotransplantation assays. In contrast, no significant toxicity was observed for normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Notably, cell death was frequently evident within 2 hours or less of TDZD-8 exposure. Cellular and molecular studies indicate that the mechanism by which TDZD-8 induces cell death involves rapid loss of membrane integrity, depletion of free thiols, and inhibition of both the PKC and FLT3 signaling pathways.

The overexpression of Apollon, a member of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins, is intuitively expected to be associated with unfavorable clinical features in malignant diseases; however, there have been no clinical studies reporting the prognostic relevance of Apollon expression in human malignancies. This study was done to investigate the clinical relevance of the expression of Apollon in childhood de novo acute myeloid leukemia. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In 55 pediatric patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia, the level of Apollon expression was determined by using quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR and was analyzed with respect to the patients' clinical features and treatment outcomes. RESULTS: Apollon expression was found to be higher in patients with a leukocyte number of >or=10,000/microL, patients with extramedullary disease, and patients with the French-American-British classification subtype M7. In addition, Apollon overexpression (>or=median expression) was associated with an unfavorable day 7 response to induction chemotherapy and also associated with a poorer 3-year relapse-free survival rate (48.3 +/- 11.2% versus 78.7 +/- 8.5%, P = 0.040).

We aimed to study the role of DNA methylation as an inducer of HOX gene silencing in leukemia. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Three hundred and seventy-eight samples of myeloid and lymphoid leukemia were quantitatively analyzed (by COBRA analysis and pyrosequencing of bisulfite-modified DNA) for methylation of eight HOXA and HOXB cluster genes. The biological significance of the methylation identified was studied by expression analysis and through re-expression of HOXA5 in a chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) blast crisis cell line model. RESULTS: Here, we identify frequent hypermethylation and gene inactivation of HOXA and HOXB cluster genes in leukemia. In particular, hypermethylation of HOXA4 and HOXA5 was frequently observed (26-79%) in all types of leukemias studied. HOXA6 hypermethylation was predominantly restricted to lymphoid malignancies, whereas hypermethylation of other HOXA and HOXB genes was only observed in childhood leukemia. HOX gene methylation exhibited clear correlations with important clinical variables, most notably in CML, in which hypermethylation of both HOXA5 (P = 0.00002) and HOXA4 (P = 0.006) was strongly correlated with progression to blast crisis. Furthermore, re-expression of HOXA5 in CML blast crisis cells resulted in the induction of markers of granulocytic differentiation. CONCLUSION: We propose that in addition to the oncogenic role of some HOX family members, other HOX genes are frequent targets for gene inactivation and normally play suppressor roles in leukemia development.","['Strathdee, Gordon', 'Holyoake, Tessa L', 'Sim, Alyson', 'Parker, Anton', 'Oscier, David G', 'Melo, Junia V', 'Meyer, Stefan', 'Eden, Tim', 'Dickinson, Anne M', 'Mountford, Joanne C', 'Jorgensen, Heather G', 'Soutar, Richard', 'Brown, Robert']","['Strathdee G', 'Holyoake TL', 'Sim A', 'Parker A', 'Oscier DG', 'Melo JV', 'Meyer S', 'Eden T', 'Dickinson AM', 'Mountford JC', 'Jorgensen HG', 'Soutar R', 'Brown R']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (HOXA5 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '127609-92-1 (HOXA4 protein, human)']",IM,"['Blast Crisis', 'CpG Islands', '*DNA Methylation', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Transcription Factors']",2007/09/06 09:00,2007/09/26 09:00,['2007/09/06 09:00'],"['2007/09/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/26 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2007 Sep 1;13(17):5048-55. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-0919.,"['13/17/5048 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-0919 [doi]']",,"['Centre for Oncology and Applied Pharmacology, Cancer Research UK.

The lack of high-throughput methods with high specificity and sensitivity to detect changes in DNA methylation has limited its application for clinical profiling. Here we overcome this limitation and present an improved method to identify methylated genes genome-wide by hybridizing a CpG island microarray with amplicons obtained by the methylated CpG island amplification technique (MCAM). We validated this method in three cancer cell lines and 15 primary colorectal tumors, resulting in the discovery of hundreds of new methylated genes in cancer. The sensitivity and specificity of the method to detect hypermethylated loci were 88% and 96%, respectively, according to validation by bisulfite-PCR. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering segregated the tumors into the expected subgroups based on CpG island methylator phenotype classification. In summary, MCAM is a suitable technique to discover methylated genes and to profile methylation changes in clinical samples in a high-throughput fashion.","['Estecio, Marcos R H', 'Yan, Pearlly S', 'Ibrahim, Ashraf E K', 'Tellez, Carmen S', 'Shen, Lanlan', 'Huang, Tim H-M', 'Issa, Jean-Pierre J']","['Estecio MR', 'Yan PS', 'Ibrahim AE', 'Tellez CS', 'Shen L', 'Huang TH', 'Issa JP']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Genome Res,Genome research,9518021,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/classification/genetics', '*CpG Islands', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Humans', 'Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques/*methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/methods', 'Phenotype', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2007/09/06 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2007/09/06 09:00'],"['2007/09/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Genome Res. 2007 Oct;17(10):1529-36. doi: 10.1101/gr.6417007.

METHODS: A total of 309 infection episodes occurred in patients with acute leukemia were retrospectively analyzed. The patients admitted in ward A (group A, n = 149) received oral ofloxacin as antibacterial prophylaxis during the neutropenia phase; no antibacterial prophylaxis was administered to the patients in ward B (group B, n = 160). The influences of prophylactic ofloxacin were determined by comparative evaluation on the clinical characteristics and the microbiological profile in both groups' patients. RESULTS: Almost all enrolled patients experienced severe neutropenia. The median durations of ANC (absolute neutrophil count, ANC) < 0.2 x 10(9)/L were 11 (range 0 - 43) days. The median persistence time of fever was 8(range 1 - 46) days. Prophylaxis of ofloxacin decreased the proportion of normal flora (P = 0.00). The frequency of Escherichia coli was higher in group A than group B (23.9%, 12.5%, respectively, P = 0.00). Exposure to ofloxacin didn't affect the distributions of other pathogenic bacteria. No difference in the rate of ESBL (+) Escherichia coli was discovered between ofloxacin and no ofloxacin prophylaxis groups (31.9%, 35.4%, respectively, P = 0.61). Commonly used antibiotics had similar activity against the major strains isolated from two groups. Patients who received antibacterial prophylaxis showed a lower incidence (10.7%) of upper respiratory infections/tonsillitis and a relative higher incidence (14.4%) of gastrointestinal tract infections than those without intervention measure. The prophylactic use of ofloxacin couldn't cut down the risk of septicemia. Ofloxacin prophylaxis did not display negative effect on initial clinical response (65.8% in group A, 60.6% in group B, respectively, P = 0.35) and final efficacy (96.0% in group A, 91.9% in group A, P = 0.14) to the same empirical antimicrobial treatment schemes. CONCLUSION: The fluoroquinolone prophylaxis induces diminishing proportion of normal flora and increasing frequency of Escherichia coli in severely neutropenic patients with acute leukemia, may not influence the distribution of other bacteria. The susceptibility of main pathogens may not be affected by antibiotic prophylaxis. The fluoroquinolone don't decrease the incidence of septicemia and infection in gastrointestinal tract. Our data suggest that more prudent use of antibiotic prophylaxis may be reasonable even in patients at high-risk for developing infection.","['Qin, Tie-jun', 'Mi, Ying-chang', 'Feng, Si-zhou', 'Li, Da-peng', 'Wei, Jia-lin', 'Yang, Dong-lin', 'Han, Ming-zhe', 'Wang, Jian-xiang', 'Bian, Shou-geng']","['Qin TJ', 'Mi YC', 'Feng SZ', 'Li DP', 'Wei JL', 'Yang DL', 'Han MZ', 'Wang JX', 'Bian SG']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,7511141,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Fluoroquinolones)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', '*Antibiotic Prophylaxis', 'Bacteria/drug effects/isolation & purification', 'Bacterial Infections/complications/drug therapy/*prevention & control', 'Female', 'Fluoroquinolones/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications/*pathology', 'Male', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Neutropenia/complications/*pathology', 'Retrospective Studies']",2007/09/06 09:00,2008/11/01 09:00,['2007/09/06 09:00'],"['2007/09/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/01 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2007 May 29;87(20):1389-93.,,,"['Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A total of 44 AML patients were enrolled in this study. Genotype of MDR1 C1236T, G2677T/A and C3435T were analyzed with PCR/PFLP assay. Bone marrow smear was made at the end of the first induction chemotherapy to estimate whether complete remission (CR) has been achieved with the clinical characteristics. The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for the MDR1 C1236T, G2677T/A and C3435T were tested using a chi(2) analysis. Frequencies of genotype and allele in MDR1 C1236T, G2677T/A and C3435T were compared using a chi(2) test or Fisher's test in terms of the clinical characteristics or achievement of CR.

Our results showed that MSCs derived from ALL, HD, and NHL were similar to normal adult bone marrow-derived MSCs in morphology, growth properties, surface epitopes, and differentiation ability in vitro. Moreover, MSCs derived from ALL, NHL, and HD had a normal karyotype and ultrastructure. These cells could express hematopoietic cytokines and support hematopoiesis in long-term culture. However, adherent cells isolated from bone marrow of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) showed abnormal biological properties, including heterogeneity in morphology, limited proliferation capacity, and impaired differentiation and hematopoiesis support ability. These results indicate that there are differences in the characteristics of adherent cells derived from different disease states, which may be important for reasonable MSC selection in stem cell-based therapy.","['Zhao, Zhi-Gang', 'Liang, Yan', 'Li, Kai', 'Li, Wei-Ming', 'Li, Qiu-Bai', 'Chen, Zhi-Chao', 'Zou, Ping']","['Zhao ZG', 'Liang Y', 'Li K', 'Li WM', 'Li QB', 'Chen ZC', 'Zou P']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Stem Cells Dev,Stem cells and development,101197107,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*cytology/pathology', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Division', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/genetics/*pathology', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Hodgkin Disease/genetics/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/cytology/pathology/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/pathology', 'Reference Values', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2007/09/06 09:00,2007/12/14 09:00,['2007/09/06 09:00'],"['2007/09/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Stem Cells Dev. 2007 Aug;16(4):637-48. doi: 10.1089/scd.2007.0008.,['10.1089/scd.2007.0008 [doi]'],,"['Department of Hematology, Oncology Hospital of Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HoxB4- expanded HSCs have also been shown to retain their normal potential for differentiation and longterm self-renewal in vivo without the development of leukemia, suggesting that manipulation of HoxB4 expression might represent an effective way to expand functional HSCs for use in transplantation medicine. However, the genetic modification of cells poses clinical concerns, including a potentially increased risk of tumor genicity. Constitutive high-level ectopic viral expression of HoxB4 can also produce perturbations in the lineage differentiation of HSCs, an indication that uncontrolled HoxB4 manipulation may not be a satisfactory therapeutic strategy. Here we demonstrate that recombinant HoxB4 protein fused with a triple protein transduction domain (tPTD) promotes hematopoietic development of hES cells. The tPTD-HoxB4 protein enhanced the development of erythroid, myeloid, and multipotential progenitors in both early- and late-stage embryoid bodies (EBs). This effect varied considerably between different hES cell lines. Addition of the tPTD-HoxB4 protein did not alter the globin gene expression pattern; progeny derived from hES cells expressed high levels of embryonic (epsilon) and fetal (gamma) globin genes with or without tPTD-HoxB4 treatment. CD34+ cells derived from hES cells engrafted in bone marrow when transplanted into fetal CD1 mice, although supplementation of the differentiation medium with tPTD-HoxB4 protein did not result in increased repopulating capacity. This suggests that other gene(s), together with HoxB4, are required for generating more competitive HSCs. In summary, our study demonstrates that the tPTD-HoxB4 protein can be used with other recombinant proteins to efficiently generate transplantable HSCs from human ES cells.","['Lu, Shi-Jiang', 'Feng, Qiang', 'Ivanova, Yordanka', 'Luo, Chenmei', 'Li, Tong', 'Li, Fei', 'Honig, George R', 'Lanza, Robert']","['Lu SJ', 'Feng Q', 'Ivanova Y', 'Luo C', 'Li T', 'Li F', 'Honig GR', 'Lanza R']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Stem Cells Dev,Stem cells and development,101197107,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Antisense)', '0 (HOXB4 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Antisense', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/*physiology', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism']",2007/09/06 09:00,2007/12/14 09:00,['2007/09/06 09:00'],"['2007/09/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Stem Cells Dev. 2007 Aug;16(4):547-59. doi: 10.1089/scd.2007.0002.,['10.1089/scd.2007.0002 [doi]'],,"['Advanced Cell Technology, Worcester, MA 01605, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The silicon compounds 1 b and 2 b were synthesized in multiple steps, and their identities were established by elemental analyses, multinuclear NMR experiments, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies. Like TTNPB (1 a) and 3-methyl-TTNPB (2 a), the analogous silicon-based arotinoids 1 b and 2 b are strong pan-RAR agonists and display the same strong differentiation and apoptosis-inducing activity in NB4 promyelocytic leukemia cells as the parent carbon compounds.

Recently, latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1), an EBV oncoprotein, was reported to activate the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway for cell survival. Because geldanamycin (GA) and its derivative, 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG), exhibit anti-tumour activity by degrading HSP90 client proteins, including Akt, we investigated the effect of GA and 17-AAG on the survival of NKTL cell lines. EBV-positive NKTL cell lines, Hank-1 and NK-YS, and an EBV-negative NK leukaemia cell line, NK-L, were treated with PI3K and Akt inhibitors, GA, and 17-AAG, and were subjected to apoptosis and cell viability assays, and immunoblot analysis. EBV-positive B-lymphoblastoid cell lines IM9 and LMP1-transfected IM9 (IM9-LMP1) were also included. Hank-1 and NK-YS cell viability was compromised and apoptosis was induced by LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor) or Akt inhibitor II. GA or 17-AAG administration resulted in the apoptosis of NKTL cells, accompanied by Akt and pAkt down-regulation, caspase 3 activation, and mitochondrial membrane potential disruption. The intrinsic level of pAkt was higher in EBV-positive NKTL cells than in EBV-negative NK-L, and GA or 17-AAG decreased the viability of NKTL cells more efficiently than NK-L. Moreover, IM9-LMP1 was more sensitive to Akt inhibitor II or HSP90 inhibitors than IM9. Importantly, GA showed little effect on the viability of normal peripheral NK cells as non-neoplastic counterparts for comparison. In conclusion, this study suggests that the PI3K/Akt pathway is frequently activated in EBV-positive NKTL and that therapeutic modalities based on targeting the PI3K/Akt pathway with HSP90 inhibitors could be useful for achieving NKTL control.","['Jeon, Y K', 'Park, C H', 'Kim, K-Y', 'Li, Y C', 'Kim, J', 'Kim, Y A', 'Paik, J-H', 'Park, B-K', 'Kim, C-W', 'Kim, Y-N']","['Jeon YK', 'Park CH', 'Kim KY', 'Li YC', 'Kim J', 'Kim YA', 'Paik JH', 'Park BK', 'Kim CW', 'Kim YN']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Pathol,The Journal of pathology,0204634,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '4GY0AVT3L4 (tanespimycin)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Oncogene Protein v-akt)', 'Z3K3VJ16KU (geldanamycin)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzoquinones/*pharmacology', 'Cell Survival', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic/*pharmacology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/metabolism/pathology/virology', 'Lymphoma, Extranodal NK-T-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/physiology', 'Oncogene Protein v-akt/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2007/09/05 09:00,2007/12/08 09:00,['2007/09/05 09:00'],"['2007/09/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/08 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/05 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Pathol. 2007 Oct;213(2):170-9. doi: 10.1002/path.2219.,['10.1002/path.2219 [doi]'],,"['Department of Pathology and Tumor Immunity Medical Research Center, Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This current trial was done to document the toxicity of the aminopterin within a multiagent therapeutic regimen for children with newly diagnosed ALL. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients at high risk of relapse were non-randomly assigned to therapy including oral aminopterin 4 mg/m(2), in two doses 12 h apart, in place of methotrexate 100 mg/m(2) in four divided doses. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients, 22 with pre-B ALL and ten with T-lineage ALL, have been treated with aminopterin, with median follow up of 40 months. Hematologic, mucosal and hepatic toxicity has been tolerable and reversible. There have been no toxic deaths among patients in remission. During weekly AMT therapy, higher mean neutrophil counts were observed among patients who were wild type for polymorphisms in methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase and methionine synthase reductase.

In order to maintain their numbers, HSCs must establish a balance between the opposing cell fates of self-renewal (in which the ability to function as HSCs is retained) and initiation of hematopoietic differentiation. Multiple signaling pathways have been implicated in the regulation of HSC cell fate. One such set of pathways are those activated by the Wnt family of ligands. Wnt signaling pathways play a crucial role during embryogenesis and deregulation of these pathways has been implicated in the formation of solid tumors. Wnt signaling also plays a role in the regulation of stem cells from multiple tissues, such as embryonic, epidermal, and intestinal stem cells. However, the function of Wnt signaling in HSC biology is still controversial. In this review, we will discuss the basic characteristics of the adult HSC and its regulatory microenvironment, the ""niche"", focusing on the regulation of the HSC and its niche by the Wnt signaling pathways.","['Nemeth, Michael J', 'Bodine, David M']","['Nemeth MJ', 'Bodine DM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', 'Review']",England,Cell Res,Cell research,9425763,['0 (Wnt Proteins)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Lineage', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/physiopathology', 'Osteoblasts/cytology/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Wnt Proteins/*metabolism']",2007/09/05 09:00,2008/03/18 09:00,['2007/09/05 09:00'],"['2007/09/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/18 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/05 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Res. 2007 Sep;17(9):746-58. doi: 10.1038/cr.2007.69.,"['cr200769 [pii]', '10.1038/cr.2007.69 [doi]']",,"['Hematopoiesis Section, Genetics and Molecular Biology Branch, National Human Genome Research Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892-4442, USA. mnemeth@nhgri.nih.gov']",['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],159,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Between 1 and 11 days following inoculation of BALB/c mice with 10(5)-10(8) B-cell leukemia (BCL1) cells (simulating pre-transplant leukemia loads), each group received an 'induction-like' irradiation and/or cytotoxic regimen. Animals were either followed without treatment, or an adoptive transfer (AT) was performed to untreated BALB/c mice. Administered alone without AT, high-dose TH did not change the time to appearance of leukemia. Nevertheless, in the AT experiments, TH as a single agent showed better antileukemic activity than busulfan (BU). Cyclophosphamide (CY)-containing regimens were the most effective, and the TH-CY combination was as effective as the commonly used BU-CY combination, and more effective than the BU-TH combination. Moreover, a synergistic effect was seen in the TH-CY combination (none of the animals developed leukemia, whereas 4/10 animals in the CY-TBI group developed leukemia (P=0.029)). In conclusion, although TH produced only a moderate effect against BCL1 leukemia when used alone, its combination with CY is promising and should be tested further in allogeneic murine models and clinical studies.","['Abdul-Hai, A', 'Weiss, L', 'Ergas, D', 'Resnick, I B', 'Slavin, S', 'Shapira, M Y']","['Abdul-Hai A', 'Weiss L', 'Ergas D', 'Resnick IB', 'Slavin S', 'Shapira MY']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '905Z5W3GKH (Thiotepa)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Busulfan/therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Synergism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Thiotepa/*therapeutic use', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2007/09/05 09:00,2007/12/20 09:00,['2007/09/05 09:00'],"['2007/09/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/20 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/05 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2007 Nov;40(9):891-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1705838.

Vital status was determined through 2004 and standardised mortality analyses conducted for 1905 men and women alive after 1978 who lived for at least 6 months between 1936 and 1984 in Uravan. Overall, mortality from all causes (standardised mortality ratio (SMR) 0.90) and all cancers (SMR 1.00) was less than or as expected based on US mortality rates. Among the 459 residents who had worked in underground uranium mines, a significant increase in lung cancer was found (SMR 2.00; 95% CI 1.39-2.78). No significant elevation in lung cancer was seen among the 767 female residents of Uravan or the 622 uranium mill workers. No cause of death of a priori interest was significantly increased in any group, i.e. cancers of the kidney, liver, breast, lymphoma or leukaemia or non-malignant respiratory disease, renal disease or liver disease. This community cohort study revealed a significant excess of lung cancer among males who had been employed as underground miners. We attribute this excess to the historically high levels of radon in uranium mines of the Colorado Plateau, coupled with the heavy use of tobacco products. There was no evidence that environmental radiation exposures above natural background associated with the uranium mill operations increased the risk of cancer. Although the population studied was relatively small, the follow-up was long, extending up to 65 years after first residence in Uravan, and nearly half of the study subjects had died.","['Boice, John D Jr', 'Cohen, Sarah S', 'Mumma, Michael T', 'Chadda, Bandana', 'Blot, William J']","['Boice JD Jr', 'Cohen SS', 'Mumma MT', 'Chadda B', 'Blot WJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Radiol Prot,Journal of radiological protection : official journal of the Society for Radiological Protection,8809257,"['4OC371KSTK (Uranium)', 'Q74S4N8N1G (Radon)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Causality', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colorado/epidemiology', 'Demography', 'Environmental Exposure/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/etiology/*mortality', 'Male', 'Mining', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Radon/*toxicity', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sex Distribution', 'Uranium/*toxicity']",2007/09/05 09:00,2008/02/26 09:00,['2007/09/05 09:00'],"['2007/09/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/26 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/05 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Radiol Prot. 2007 Sep;27(3):299-319. doi: 10.1088/0952-4746/27/3/004.

However, the ability of the extracellular matrix of articular cartilage to harbor and transmit a retrovirus has not been examined. We hypothesized that articular cartilage fragments, but not isolated chondrocytes, from cats systemically infected with feline leukemia virus (FeLV) are capable of transmitting infectious retrovirus. METHODS: Fresh cartilage segments and chondrocytes isolated from cats systemically infected with feline leukemia virus were used in this study. Feline embryonic fibroblast cells were cocultured with segments of cartilage, isolated chondrocytes, or fragments of cortical bone from each infected cat. The FeLV p27 antigen was measured in the coculture media by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In addition, FeLV proviral nucleic acids were quantified by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction with use of DNA extracted from feline embryonic fibroblast cell cocultures as well as isolated chondrocytes. Immunohistochemistry was used to assess for FeLV p27 antigen in both intact cartilage fragments and isolated chondrocytes. RESULTS: Feline embryonic fibroblast cells cocultured with cartilage fragments from each of the five FeLV-infected cats all demonstrated high levels of proviral DNA, indicating transmission of infective virus. In addition, media from all cocultures of feline embryonic fibroblast cells and chondral fragments became positive for p27 antigen, indicating active viral replication. In contrast, cocultures of feline embryonic fibroblast cells and isolated chondrocytes from all FeLV-infected cats were negative for proviral DNA and p27 antigen. Likewise, no proviral nucleic acids could be detected in isolated chondrocytes from any infected cats. Cocultures of feline embryonic fibroblast cells with cortical bone fragments were positive for proviral DNA and p27 antigen. Immunohistochemical staining of cartilage fragments from FeLV-infected cats demonstrated the presence of p27 antigen throughout the extracellular matrix, but the p27 antigen was not detected in isolated chondrocytes. CONCLUSIONS: Articular cartilage fragments can readily transmit infectious retrovirus, but isolated chondrocytes were likely not the source of the infectious virus because they did not harbor proviral DNA or p27 antigen.","['Arnoczky, Steven P', 'Swenson, Cheryl', 'Egerbacher, Monika', 'Gardner, Keri', 'Caballero, Oscar', 'Burns, Meghan']","['Arnoczky SP', 'Swenson C', 'Egerbacher M', 'Gardner K', 'Caballero O', 'Burns M']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Bone Joint Surg Am,The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

BM angiogenesis is significantly decreased in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) treated with fludarabine. The anti-angiogenic potential of alemtuzumab in CLL has not yet been investigated. We, therefore, evaluated BM angiogenesis in CLL patients treated sequentially with fludarabine and low doses of alemtuzumab. DESIGN AND METHODS: BM microvessel area was sequentially evaluated in 20 patients with advanced B-cell CLL who received, after a clinical response obtained with fludarabine-induction therapy, alemtuzumab, three times weekly for 6 weeks at a dose of 10 mg. RESULTS: The complete response rate improved from 45% after fludarabine induction to 90% after alemtuzumab consolidation. The extent of BM angiogenesis decreased continuously after either fludarabine or alemtuzumab (p=0.0002; Kruskal-Wallis test). Thirteen out of 20 (65%) patients changed from having a monoclonal to a polyclonal pattern of IgH sequences after alemtuzumab consolidation. A separate evaluation carried out in patients who achieved molecularly undetectable disease, as defined by polymerase chain reaction negativity, and in patients who remained with minimal residual disease after therapy with alemtuzumab showed a significant reduction of BM microvessel area only in the former (p=0.0002). Finally, molecular responses and a significant reduction of BM angiogenesis were more common in patients who received the cumulative planned dose of alemtuzumab (i.e.,180 mg) than in patients who received reduced doses (p=0.007 and p=0.0001, respectively). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these data demonstrate a decrease in BM vascularity that characterized CLL patients who received low doses of subcutaneous alemtuzumab consolidation therapy after a clinical response to fludarabine induction therapy.

Distinct clinical entities have been described according to the primary treatment, corresponding to defined genetic lesions. Chromosome 7 and/or 5 losses or deletions are typical of alkylating agent-induced AML, while development of t-AML with balanced translocations involving chromosome bands 11q23 and 21q22 has been related to previous therapy with drugs targeting DNA-topoisomerase II. In addition, antimetabolites, and in particular the immunosuppressant azathioprine, have been shown to induce defective DNA-mismatch repair. This could promote survival of misrepaired cells giving rise to the leukemic clone. Individual predisposing factors, including polymorphisms in detoxification and DNA repair enzymes have been identified. Their combination may significantly increase the risk of t-MDS/AML. Among patients with hematologic malignancies, long-term survivors of Hodgkin's lymphoma are exposed to an increased risk of t-MDS/AML, particularly when receiving MOPP-based, and escalated BEACOPP regimens, and when alkylators are combined with radiotherapy. Patients with Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma are at highest risk when total body irradiation followed by autologous stem cell transplantation is used as rescue or consolidation therapy. The addition of granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor and radiotherapy plays a significant role in t-AML following treatment of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In non-hematologic malignancies, treatment for breast cancer and germ-cell tumors has been associated with a 1-5% lifetime risk of both lymphoid as well as myeloid leukemia. In all cases the risk of t-MDS/AML drops sharply by 10 years after treatment.","['Leone, Giuseppe', 'Pagano, Livio', 'Ben-Yehuda, Dina', 'Voso, Maria Teresa']","['Leone G', 'Pagano L', 'Ben-Yehuda D', 'Voso MT']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA/genetics', 'DNA Repair/genetics', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/metabolism', '*Disease Susceptibility', '*Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced/*complications/genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*chemically induced/*complications', 'Polymorphism, Genetic/genetics', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Risk Factors', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors']",2007/09/05 09:00,2007/12/14 09:00,['2007/09/05 09:00'],"['2007/09/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/05 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2007 Oct;92(10):1389-98. doi: 10.3324/haematol.11034.,"['92/10/1389 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.11034 [doi]']",,"[""Istituto di Ematologia, Universita' Cattolica S.

METHODS: A population-based cancer registration system was established in Qidong region with 1.1 millions residents to collect data of cancer incident cases. 70,646 cases were registered during the years from 1972 to 2005, and ICD-10 was administrated for classification and coding, and crude rate (CR) and age-standardized rate (ASR), percent change (PC), annual percent change (APC) were calculated using annual data on population size. Changes within age-groups for different periods of incidence, and for different years of birth (birth cohort) for the leading sites of cancers were analyzed. RESULTS: The average annual incidence for cancers during the years of 1972-2005 was 184.77 per 100,000 (ASR: 109.32 per 100,000), of which, the incidence for male was 239.22 (ASR: 136.08), and 131.58 (ASR: 79.26) per 100,000 for female. The cumulative risk of cancer occurrence was 16.31% (21.62% in males, and 11.11% in females). The most common leading sites in rank in this area were liver (CR: 60.69 per 100,000), stomach (32.97), lung (27.59), oesophagus (9.34), rectum (8.06), breast (6.48), pancreas (5.97), leukaemia (3.84), bran and CNS (3.43), and colon (2.93). Female breast cancer (12.59) and cervix cancer (4.62) were the forth and the eighth in rank among all sites for women. Liver cancer accounted for almost one third (32.84) of the malignancies. Furthermore, the cancers from digestive organs accounted for 65.85% of all sites. CR rates were rising overall, at 87.19% for PC, and at 1.85% for APC. The ASR, however, reduced by 12.14% for PC, and by 0.51% for APC. The rising trends were also observed for the ASR from cancers in lung, female breast, and colon-rectum, while the decreasing trends were observed for stomach and oesophagus cancer. Birth cohort analysis showed that there was a decline in ages under 35 for the incidence of liver cancer, in ages over 40 for stomach cancer, and in those aged over 45 for bladder cancer and over 50 for oesophagus cancer. Rising trends existed for incidence rates from lung cancer in the aged over 30, pancreas cancer in aged 45-59, and female breast cancer in those aged 40 and above. CONCLUSION: Monitoring of cancer incidence rates through population-based cancer registration in 34 years did help to show the burden and patterns of main cancer sites and time trends, which provides some references to future aetiological study, and policy making on cancer control in Qidong.","['Chen, Jian-Guo', 'Zhu, Jian', 'Zhang, Yong-Hui', 'Lu, Jian-Hua', 'Zhu, Yuan-Rong']","['Chen JG', 'Zhu J', 'Zhang YH', 'Lu JH', 'Zhu YR']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Zhonghua Yu Fang Yi Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yu fang yi xue za zhi [Chinese journal of preventive medicine],7904962,,IM,"['China/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Liver Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', '*Registries']",2007/10/25 09:00,2009/05/13 09:00,['2007/10/25 09:00'],"['2007/10/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/13 09:00 [medline]', '2007/10/25 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Zhonghua Yu Fang Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2007 Jun;41 Suppl:47-55.,,,"['Department of Epidemiology, Qidong Liver Cancer Institute, Jiangsu 226200, China. qdchenjg@gmail.com']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is mounting evidence suggesting that these genetic associations may in fact be associated with distinct phenotypes in SSc based on autoantibody pattern rather than with SSc as a single disease entity. This may ultimately have implications for approaches to therapy as well as responses to therapy. The most promising candidate genes are those involved in pathways that lead to the vascular damage and fibrosis that are the hallmarks of this disease. There is uncertainty, however, regarding the nature of the key pathological mechanisms that link these two disease processes. Recent studies have focused on Fli1 (friend leukaemia integration 1), a transcription factor that is found in immune cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells that regulates collagen gene function and angiogenesis. Fli1 is dysregulated in SSc skin and dermal blood vessels, and appears to play a pathological role in SSc skin fibrosis and vessel degeneration. Whether this dysregulation is due to genetic polymorphisms in the Fli1 pathway or to epigenetic mechanisms is not clear.","['Mayes, Maureen D', 'Trojanowska, Maria']","['Mayes MD', 'Trojanowska M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Arthritis Res Ther,Arthritis research & therapy,101154438,,IM,"['Animals', 'Fibroblasts/pathology/physiology', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Genetic Linkage/genetics', 'Humans', 'Scleroderma, Systemic/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology']",2007/09/15 09:00,2007/10/24 09:00,['2007/09/15 09:00'],"['2007/09/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/24 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/15 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arthritis Res Ther. 2007;9 Suppl 2:S5. doi: 10.1186/ar2189.,"['ar2189 [pii]', '10.1186/ar2189 [doi]']",,"['Division of Rheumatology and Clinical Immunogenetics, University of Texas, Houston Health Science Center, Fannin, Houston, Texas 77030, USA. maureen.d.mayes@uth.tmc.edu']",,41,,,,,PMC2072883,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is exceptional to the general findings in cancer cells, and the mechanisms for its upregulation remain unclear. It has been reported that promyelocytic leukemia (PML) proto-oncogene controls the transcription of multiple class I antigen presentation genes in murine cancer cells. To find out the functional role of PML gene on the increased HLA class I antigen expression in HCC cells, we analyzed the expression of proto-oncogene PML and multiple class I antigen presentation genes in HCC specimens obtained in China. The results showed concordant changes of proto-oncogene PML and cell surface HLA-A expression in 44 paraffin-embedded HCC tissues. Furthermore, co-upregulated expression of PML genes and class I antigen presentation genes could be detected in 9 of 15 fresh HCC tissues by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In addition, studies using HCC cell lines showed that increased expression of HLA class I molecules paralleled with PML upregulation were detected in QGY-7701 HCC cell line with RT-PCR, western blot, and flow cytometry, and that the overexpression of exogenous PML in a low-expression class I cell line BEL-7405 could induce the expression of multiple class I antigen-presenting molecule genes and slightly but significantly increase the expression of cell surface HLA class I molecules. In conclusion, the expression of proto-oncogene PML and HLA class I molecules were concordantly upregulated and the expression of PML gene might be one of the mechanisms that leads to the increased expression of class I antigen in HCC.","['Xia, M', 'Zhang, J Q', 'Shen, Y-Q', 'Xu, L H', 'Chen, A Q', 'Miao, F Q', 'Xie, W']","['Xia M', 'Zhang JQ', 'Shen YQ', 'Xu LH', 'Chen AQ', 'Miao FQ', 'Xie W']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Tissue Antigens,Tissue antigens,0331072,"['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'China', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/immunology/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",2007/09/05 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2007/09/05 09:00'],"['2007/09/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/05 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Tissue Antigens. 2007 Oct;70(4):272-82. doi: 10.1111/j.1399-0039.2007.00892.x.,"['TAN892 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1399-0039.2007.00892.x [doi]']",,"['Key Laboratory of the Education Ministry of China for Developmental Genes and Human Diseases, Southeast University Medical School, 87 Dingjiaqiao Road, Nanjing 210009, Jiangsu, China.']",['TW 005900-01A2/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The functional calcein assay (MultiDrug Quant Assay, Solvo Biotechnology, Budaors, Hungary) has been proven to be clinically valuable in hematological malignancies by determining the transporter activity of MDR protein 1 (MDR1, ATP-binding cassette protein [ABC] B1, P-glycoprotein-170) and MDR-related protein 1 (MRP1, ABCC1). In this study, we evaluated if the same functional test was adaptable for the analysis of MDR activity in solid tumors. For this purpose, tissue specimens of human colorectal cancer samples were subjected to limited enzymatic digestion by collagenase to provide a single-cell suspension; dead cells were excluded by 7-aminoactinomycin D staining, and epithelial cancer cells were detected by Cy5-conjugated anti-BerEP4 monoclonal antibody. The transporter functions of MDR1 and MRP1 in viable epithelial cells were assessed by flow cytometry detecting the intracellular accumulation of calcein dye after exposing cells to various MDR inhibitors. Collagenase disintegration preserved the MDR activity and the antigenicity of tumor cells. Thus using the extended calcein assay provided sufficient viable and functionally active tumor cells from surgical biopsies to determine the functional MDR activity.

Adverse events in a gene therapy clinical trial for X-linked severe combined immune deficiency have led to the realization that the enhancer/promoter elements contained within integrated vectors may also act outside the vector genome to trans-activate host genes. Ideally, the gene expression system chosen for a vector should possess a low probability of trans-activation while still being able to support adequate levels of transgene expression. However, the parameters that define these specific characteristics are unknown. To gain insight into the mechanism of trans-activation, we compared a panel of commonly used retroviral LTRs and cellular and viral promoters for their ability to drive gene expression and to trans-activate a nearby minimal promoter in three different cell lines. These studies identified two elements, the cytomegalovirus enhancer/chicken beta-actin (CAG) and elongation factor (EF)-1alpha promoters, as being of potential value for use in vectors targeting lymphoid cells, as these elements exhibited both high levels of reporter gene expression and relatively low levels of trans-activation in T cells.","['Weber, Erin L', 'Cannon, Paula M']","['Weber EL', 'Cannon PM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,['147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)'],IM,"['Cell Line', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Dosage', 'Genes, Reporter', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Kidney/cytology', 'Models, Genetic', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Plasmids', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences/genetics', '*Transcription, Genetic', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection']",2007/09/05 09:00,2007/11/10 09:00,['2007/09/05 09:00'],"['2007/09/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/05 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2007 Sep;18(9):849-60. doi: 10.1089/hum.2007.067.,['10.1089/hum.2007.067 [doi]'],,"['Saban Research Institute of Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90027, USA.']","['P01 CA059318/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R42 RR019834/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It comprises a phosphorothioate backbone linking 18 modified DNA bases. Oblimersen targets the first six codons of Bcl-2 mRNA to form a DNA/RNA complex. The duplex is subsequently recognised as a foreign message and is cleaved enzymatically, thereby destroying the Bcl-2 message. The Bcl-2 protein, which is a potent inhibitor of apoptosis, is overexpressed in many cancers, including follicular lymphomas, breast, colon and prostate cancers, and intermediate-/high-grade lymphomas. By reducing the amount of Bcl-2 protein in cancer cells, oblimersen may enhance the effectiveness of conventional anticancer treatments. Genta has reported results from randomised phase III trials of oblimersen in four different indications: malignant melanoma, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), multiple myeloma and acute myleoid leukaemia (AML). A negative opinion has been issued for the company's MAA for the product in the treatment of malignant melanoma in the EU; the EMEA has indicated an additional confirmatory trial is needed in this indication for approval. An NDA for CLL was deemed non-approvable by the US FDA; the company is appealing this decision. The phase III trials in multiple myeloma and AML did not meet their primary endpoints. Phase I and II trials are also underway or have been completed for a range of other cancer types. Genta and sanofi-aventis (formerly Aventis) entered into a collaboration agreement in 2002; however, this agreement was terminated by sanofi-aventis in May 2005. Genta became solely responsible for all costs relating to oblimersen at this time. Genta expanded its Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the National Cancer Institute in November 2001. The expanded collaboration was to investigate the use of oblimersen in combination with standard anticancer therapy in a broad range of cancers. This expansion occurred following the Gensynergy project, which showed that oblimersen was synergistic with other anticancer therapies. Genta signed a 5-year manufacturing agreement with Avecia Ltd in December 2002 to supply it with oblimersen. Genta's NDA was submitted to the FDA in December 2005 and accepted for review in March 2006. The application was based on data from a phase I/II trial (NCT00021749) of oblimersen alone in approximately 40 patients and a phase III study (NCT00024440) of 241 patients who received fludarabine and cyclo-phosphamide with or without oblimersen. Genta received a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) from the FDA in October 2006 for a randomised, pivotal, clinical trial of oblimersen in CLL. The trial will be conducted in patients who have not received prior chemotherapy and who would be randomised to receive fludarabine and rituximab with or without oblimersen. This trial has not yet begun.Fast-track status was given to oblimersen for CLL in June 2003 by the FDA. Oblimersen previously obtained orphan drug status in the US and EU for CLL in September 2001. Genta previously submitted the MAA under the centralised licensing procedure and Spain and France were assigned as rapporteur and co-rapporteur countries, respectively. It was supported by an extended 24-month follow-up of patients from a phase III study (NCT00016263) of oblimersen plus dacarbazine. The EMEA validated the MAA for review in January 2006. Genta received a number of scientific questions from the EMEA in June 2006, which the company responded to. Genta intends to file a formal complaint and a request for correction of information with the FDA under the Federal Data Quality Act. The complaint is related to a key statistical analysis of the company's data for oblimersen in the treatment of melanoma used by the FDA at the Oncology Drug Advisory Committee (ODAC) in May 2004. Genta believes that analysis sought to discredit the finding that treatment with oblimersen significantly increased progression-free survival; ODAC previously agreed this endpoint would support full approval in the absence of a survival improvement in patients with advanced melanoma.A rolling NDA submission was submitted to the FDA in the third quarter of 2003; however, Genta and Aventis withdrew the NDA after the application failed to gain marketing approval from the FDA's Oncology Drug Advisory Committee (ODAC). In May 2004, ODAC voted that phase III trial results did not provide substantial evidence of effectiveness to outweigh toxicity of oblimersen treatment in patients with metastatic melanoma. Genta has the option to resubmit this application. The FDA gave oblimersen orphan drug status for malignant melanoma in August 2000. In October 1999, fast-track status was given to oblimersen by the FDA for malignant melanoma when used in combination with dacarbazine. In addition, oblimersen received orphan drug status for malignant melanoma in Australia in October 2006.A phase III study (NCT00016263) of oblimersen in combination with dacarbazine was conducted in patients with malignant melanoma. The combination treatment did not significantly increase overall survival time, but did significantly increase progression-free survival time, compared with dacarbazine treatment alone. The phase III trial enrolled 771 patients at 140 sites in 12 different countries. Patients were randomly assigned to receive dacarbazine alone or in combination with oblimersen. The primary endpoint of this trial was to compare the overall survival between the two treatment arms. Secondary endpoints included comparative analyses of progression-free survival and tumour response. Genta will conduct another phase III study of oblimersen in patients with advanced melanoma. The trial is designed to provide additional safety and efficacy evidence of the drug, in combination with dacarbazine, in patients who have not previously received chemotherapy. Approximately 300 patients are expected to be enrolled in the trial, which is planned to begin during mid-2007, at sites throughout Europe, Australia, and North and South America. Genta is conducting a phase I clinical trial (NCT00409383) to evaluate the combination of oblimersen, ABI 007, and temozolomide in chemotherapy-naive patients with advanced melanoma. This trial was initiated in November 2006 and is the first follow-on study to Genta's phase III trial of oblimersen plus dacarbazine. Oblimersen received orphan drug status in the US and EU for multiple myeloma in September 2001. In addition, fast-track designation was given to oblimersen by the FDA in the same month.A phase I/II clinical study (NCT00062244) of oblimersen was conducted by the NCI in patients with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinaemia, a disease that is similar to multiple myeloma. The study results indicated that oblimersen may be a useful treatment in this group of patients (all had high levels of Bcl-2 expression). In June 2003, Genta and Aventis announced the presentation of clinical data from a phase II trial of oblimersen in combination with docetaxel injection concentrate for patients with advanced HRPC. Researchers reported that these findings validated progression into phase III trials. Genta has licensed eight US patents relating to oblimersen and its backbone chemistry and these expire between 2008 and 2015. Genta has two pending US patent applications that relate to oblimersen. Corresponding patent applications have been filed in Canada, Europe and Japan. Genta owns three US patents relating to methods of using oblimersen that will expire in 2020, and also has approximately 45 corresponding foreign patent applications.",,,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",New Zealand,Drugs R D,Drugs in R&D,100883647,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', '85J5ZP6YSL (oblimersen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics', 'Thionucleotides/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use']",2007/09/05 09:00,2007/11/07 09:00,['2007/09/05 09:00'],"['2007/09/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/05 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Drugs R D. 2007;8(5):321-34. doi: 10.2165/00126839-200708050-00006.,"['856 [pii]', '10.2165/00126839-200708050-00006 [doi]']",,,,72,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients that presented to the medical and surgical units of the UBTH within the period of the study and who had histologically confirmed malignant conditions and also tested to HIV were included in the study. RESULTS: The male: female ratio of HIV-seropositivity within the period of study was 1:1.2. The highest incidence of HIV-seropositivity was in 2003 (65.1%). Of the patients that tested positive for HIV, Hodgkin's lymphoma was the commonest form of malignancy while leukaemia was the least common.

Wnt signaling pathways are aberrantly activated in many tumor types, including solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression profile of a large number of Wnt genes in leukemic cells from Iranian patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia. METHODS: RT-PCR method was used to determine the Wnt genes expression in bone marrow (BM) and/or peripheral blood (PB) samples from 16 patients with AML and PB samples of 36 normal subjects. RESULTS: Among 14 Wnt molecules included in this study, Wnt-7A and Wnt-10A were significantly down-regulated (p = 0.002 and p < 0.0001, respectively) and Wnt-3 was significantly over-expressed (p < 0.02) in AML patients compared to normal subjects. No significant association was found between Wnt expression and FAB classification of the patients. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated for the first time aberrant expression of Wnt-7A, Wnt-10A and Wnt-3 genes in Iranian AML patients.

DESIGN: We analyzed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the LARG gene in the 55-74-year-old individuals of the population-based German Caucasian Cooperative Health Research in the region of Augsberg (KORA) survey 4 (S4). METHODS: Sequencing of Tyr1306Cys, which was of functional relevance in Pima Indians, in 48 randomly selected individuals and genotyping of 11 additional LARG SNPs in 1653 subjects were performed. Four linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks (r(2)> or =0.8) were established and each block was statistically analyzed for association with metabolic traits. The association with T2DM and the MetS was analyzed by logistic regression in 1462 subjects, and HOMA-IR (homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance) as a measure of insulin sensitivity was analyzed by the Kruskal-Wallis test in 1346 fasting subjects. RESULTS: The polymorphism Tyr1306Cys, which was significantly associated with insulin sensitivity in Pima Indians, was not found in the KORA S4 population. Statistical analysis yielded no significant associations (P>0.05) between the analyzed LARG variants and T2DM, the MetS, or related parameters such as insulin sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: Caucasian individuals and Pima Indians differ in their genetic variance pattern in the LARG gene region.

O was previously approved in February 1994 for the treatment of patients with ALL who were hypersensitive to native forms of L-asparaginase. The trial supporting this new indication was an open label, randomized, multicenter clinical trial that enrolled 118 children (age, 1-9 years) with previously untreated, standard risk ALL. Patients received either native Escherichia coli asparaginase (Elspar; Merck, Whitehouse Station, NJ; hereafter, E) or O along with multiagent chemotherapy during remission induction and delayed intensification (DI) phases of treatment. O, at a dose of 2,500 IU/m(2), was administered i.m. on day 3 of the 4-week induction phase and on day 3 of each of two 8-week DI phases. E, at a dose of 6,000 IU/m(2), was administered i.m. three times weekly for nine doses during induction and for six doses during each DI phase. This study allowed direct comparison of O and E for asparagine depletion, asparaginase activity, and development of asparaginase antibodies. An unplanned comparison of event-free survival (EFS) was conducted to rule out a deleterious O efficacy effect. Following induction and DI treatment there was complete (</=1 microM) or moderate (1-10 microM) depletion of serum asparagine levels in the large majority of samples tested over the 4-week period in both O-treated and E-treated subjects. Similarly, depletion of cerebrospinal fluid asparagine levels during induction was similar between O-treated and E-treated subjects. The number of days asparaginase activity exceeded >0.03 IU/ml in O-treated subjects was greater than the number of days in E-treated subjects during both the induction and DI phases of treatment. There was no correlation, however, between asparaginase activity and serum asparagine levels, making the former determination less clinically relevant. Using the protocol-prespecified threshold for a positive result of >2.5 times the control, 7 of 56 (12%) O subjects tested at any time during the study demonstrated antiasparaginase antibodies and 16 of 57 (28%) E subjects tested at any time during the study had antiasparaginase antibodies. In both study arms EFS was in the range of 80% at 3 years. The most serious, sometimes fatal, O toxicities were anaphylaxis, other serious allergic reactions, thrombosis (including sagittal sinus thrombosis), pancreatitis, glucose intolerance, and coagulopathy. The most common adverse events were allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis), hyperglycemia, pancreatitis, central nervous system thrombosis, coagulopathy, hyperbilirubinemia, and elevated transaminases.

In human cells telomeres progressively shorten with each cell division leading to eventual chromosome instability and cell death. Telomerase is a DNA polymerase which is required for the maintenance of telomeres. Therefore, telomeres and telomerase play a role in the regulation of the life span of the cell. Human cells express low levels of telomerase, however when telomere length reaches a critical level abnormal activation of telomerase can lead to immortalization and uncontrolled proliferation.

Static fields produce health effects only in very rare and exceptional circumstances at extremely high field intensities. As for low-frequency EMF, the results of epidemiological research with respect to childhood leukaemia prompted the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) in 2001 to classify these fields as ""possibly carcinogenic to humans"". Current hypotheses on the mechanism of such action are presented. The effect, if existent, appears to be not very important in relation to established other causes of childhood leukaemia. High-frequency EMF, as used in mobile and wireless communication (mobile telephony according to the GSM and UMTS standard, cordless DECT phones, wireless local area networks (WLAN), Bluetooth) and since many decades also in radio and television technology, are practically omnipresent. At high intensities, the generation of heat is the principal effect. Current guidelines, limits and regulations prevent any such effect. Mobile phone calls may, in certain circumstances, lead to local exposures close to limit values. Base stations typically produce exposures lower by 2-5 magnitudes. The discussion centres on the so-called non-thermal effects, which are supposedly occurring at field intensities, which are by orders of magnitude lower than those responsible for thermal effects. The reproducibility of these effects is usually poor, and no physiologic or pathogenic mechanism, so far, has been found to explain the alleged effects. Equally, epidemiologic studies have not furnished clear and reproducible data as arguments for negative health effects. Final results of the INTERPHONE study on the risk of brain tumours, acoustic neurinoma and parotid gland tumours associated with the use of mobile phones will be soon available. Preliminary results do not seem to indicate a substantial increase in risk. There are presently no scientific data supporting the concept of a special vulnerability of children and adolescents to high-frequency EMF, even if the usual caveats (developing organisms and structures may be more vulnerable, decades of life to come) are considered. The concept of precautionary measures adapted to such concerns is critically discussed.","['Otto, Matthias', 'von Muhlendahl, Karl Ernst']","['Otto M', 'von Muhlendahl KE']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Int J Hyg Environ Health,International journal of hygiene and environmental health,100898843,,IM,"['Cell Phone', 'Child', '*Child Welfare', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', '*Environmental Health', 'Humans', '*Hypersensitivity', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/etiology', 'Microwaves', '*Public Health']",2007/09/04 09:00,2008/01/16 09:00,['2007/09/04 09:00'],"['2007/09/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/16 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/04 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Hyg Environ Health. 2007 Oct;210(5):635-44. doi: 10.1016/j.ijheh.2007.07.007.

Antiproliferative effects are commonly ascribed to such compounds but ambiguity exists as to the principal mechanism of action and the universal benefit of exposure, particularly at high concentrations. Here, we identify heterogeneous responses within HL-60 promyelocytic leukaemia cells that explain contradictions in the reported origin of the antiproliferative action of kaempferol, a dietary abundant flavonoid. At > or =10 microM, kaempferol exposure is predominantly characterised by cell cycle alterations, notably a significant increase in S-phase and a progressive accumulation in G2-M with 10 and > or =20 microM kaempferol, respectively. However, a limited but consistent membrane damage is observed across the 1-100 microM exposure and at 1 microM occurs devoid from indices of apoptosis which are only consistently observed with > or =10 microM kaempferol treatment. At the most cytotoxic exposures, multiparametric flow cytometric analysis revealed distinct sub populations of cells. Cells with decreased size, typical of apoptosis and necrosis, possessed heightened caspase-3 activity, decreased anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 expression and changes to membrane asymmetry and integrity. The remaining population had elevated active caspase-3 but no change or a moderate increase in Bcl-2 expression and no plasma membrane alterations. Differentiation was not a significant factor in HL-60 growth inhibition. In conclusion, kaempferol-induced growth inhibition is dominated by cell cycle changes but involves a limited cytotoxicity, which we propose results from a membrane damage centred as well as an apoptotic process. This heterogeneity of response may confound the disease-preventative role and pharmacological application of this flavonoid.","['Bestwick, Charles S', 'Milne, Lesley', 'Duthie, Susan J']","['Bestwick CS', 'Milne L', 'Duthie SJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,"['0 (Kaempferols)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '731P2LE49E (kaempferol)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Kaempferols/*pharmacology', 'Mitochondria/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism']",2007/09/04 09:00,2008/01/30 09:00,['2007/09/04 09:00'],"['2007/04/24 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/09 00:00 [revised]', '2007/07/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/09/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/30 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/04 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 2007 Nov 20;170(2):76-85. doi: 10.1016/j.cbi.2007.07.002.

METHODS: Translocation breakpoints were identified by fluorescence in situ hybridization and a novel fusion gene identified by rapid amplification of cDNA ends polymerase chain reaction. Functional analysis of the fusion was performed using the Ba/F3 transformation assay and specific inhibition demonstrated using small molecule inhibitors. RESULTS: Fluorescence in situ hybridization indicated that FLT3 at 13q12 was disrupted and 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends polymerase chain reaction identified a novel in-frame mRNA fusion between exon 3 of SPTBN1 (spectrin, beta, nonerythrocytic 1) at chromosome 2p16 and exon 13 of FLT3. Expression of SPTBN1-FLT3 transformed Ba/F3 cells to growth factor independence and was accompanied by constitutive phosphorylation of the fusion protein and the downstream substrate extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2. The growth of transformed cells was inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion by SU11657, PKC412, and TKI258 (CHIR-258), but not by imatinib.

We found that a history of breastfeeding was associated with a reduction in the risk of acute otitis media, non-specific gastroenteritis, severe lower respiratory tract infections, atopic dermatitis, asthma (young children), obesity, type 1 and 2 diabetes, childhood leukemia, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and necrotizing enterocolitis. There was no relationship between breastfeeding in term infants and cognitive performance. The relationship between breastfeeding and cardiovascular diseases was unclear. Similarly, it was also unclear concerning the relationship between breastfeeding and infant mortality in developed countries. For maternal outcomes, a history of lactation was associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, breast, and ovarian cancer. Early cessation of breastfeeding or not breastfeeding was associated with an increased risk of maternal postpartum depression. There was no relationship between a history of lactation and the risk of osteoporosis. The effect of breastfeeding in mothers on return-to-pre-pregnancy weight was negligible, and the effect of breastfeeding on postpartum weight loss was unclear. CONCLUSIONS: A history of breastfeeding is associated with a reduced risk of many diseases in infants and mothers from developed countries. Because almost all the data in this review were gathered from observational studies, one should not infer causality based on these findings. Also, there is a wide range of quality of the body of evidence across different health outcomes. For future studies, clear subject selection criteria and definition of ""exclusive breastfeeding,"" reliable collection of feeding data, controlling for important confounders including child-specific factors, and blinded assessment of the outcome measures will help. Sibling analysis provides a method to control for hereditary and household factors that are important in certain outcomes. In addition, cluster randomized controlled studies on the effectiveness of various breastfeeding promotion interventions will provide further opportunity to investigate any disparity in health outcomes as a result of the intervention.","['Ip, Stanley', 'Chung, Mei', 'Raman, Gowri', 'Chew, Priscilla', 'Magula, Nombulelo', 'DeVine, Deirdre', 'Trikalinos, Thomas', 'Lau, Joseph']","['Ip S', 'Chung M', 'Raman G', 'Chew P', 'Magula N', 'DeVine D', 'Trikalinos T', 'Lau J']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Evid Rep Technol Assess (Full Rep),Evidence report/technology assessment,101082681,,IM,"['Asthma/epidemiology', '*Breast Feeding', 'Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/epidemiology', 'Child Development', 'Depression, Postpartum/epidemiology', 'Dermatitis, Atopic/epidemiology', 'Developed Countries', 'Diabetes Mellitus/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant Mortality', '*Infant Welfare', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Infant, Premature', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', '*Maternal Welfare', 'Obesity/epidemiology', 'Osteoporosis/epidemiology', 'Otitis Media/epidemiology', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Postpartum Period/physiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Respiratory Tract Diseases/epidemiology', 'Sudden Infant Death/epidemiology']",2007/09/04 09:00,2008/02/27 09:00,['2007/09/04 09:00'],"['2007/09/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/27 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/04 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Evid Rep Technol Assess (Full Rep). 2007 Apr;(153):1-186.,,,,,218,,,,,PMC4781366,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PROCEDURE: We retrospectively compared cytochemical MPO results with outcome in 154 patients younger than 21 years treated on three consecutive institutional protocols for newly diagnosed AML (1987-2001). Patients with FAB M0 and M7 AML (no MPO expression) or M3 AML (100% MPO expression) and Down's syndrome were excluded. RESULTS: Median MPO expression was higher in FAB M2 subtype than in other subtypes (P < 0.0001) and differed significantly across cytogenetic risk groups (P = 0.002) with highest MPO expression among those with favorable karyotypes. The percentage of MPO-positive blasts was not significantly associated with the probability of complete remission (P = 0.97), event-free survival (P = 0.72), or survival (P = 0.76) in multivariate analyses that accounted for age, FAB subtype, presenting WBC count, cytogenetic and protocol treatment risk group. In analysis limited to patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics, higher MPO expression appeared to be associated with improved EFS (P = 0.06) but was not associated with remission induction rate (P = 0.16) or overall survival (P = 0.38).

PROCEDURE: Muscle strength was assessed with a hand-held dynamometer and ankle dorsiflexion with a goniometer in 92 and 64 survivors, respectively. Motor performance was measured with the Movement Assessment Battery for Children (movement-ABC). Age at testing: 6.1-12.9 years. Mean time since completing treatment: 3.3 years. Results were compared to 155 healthy controls. RESULTS: Muscle strength of the survivors was reduced in ankle dorsiflexors on both sides (P < 0.001), wrist dorsiflexors on the non-dominant side (P < 0.001), and pinch grip on the non-dominant (P = 0.001) and dominant side (P = 0.01).

CONCLUSION: Peripheral muscle strength and ankle dorsiflexion are reduced in the long-term in children treated for cancer with chemotherapy.

This investigation was intended to gain further insight into the role of leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) in intrauterine contraception. We evaluated the immunohistochemical distribution patterns of LIF in women wearing a copper T380A IUD. METHODS: The immunohistochemical distribution patterns of LIF in women who had been using a copper T380A IUD for different periods of time, two months after removal of the IUD, and in normal fertile women were evaluated. Endometrial biopsies were obtained from four groups of patients according to the duration of T Cu380A IUD use (group I: <5 years, n = 15, and group II: > or = 5 years, n = 15), after IUD removal (group III, n = 15) and normal fertile women (controls, n = 15) during the window of implantation (WOI). Staining intensity of LIF was evaluated using semi-quantitative IRS-scores. RESULTS: The lowest expression of LIF was observed in women using a copper T380A IUD, being statistically significant compared with the control group (p < 0.05). LIF immunostaining remained abnormal two months after IUD removal. CONCLUSIONS: Copper IUDs can inhibit expression of LIF and they may cause inhibition of the implantation stage, which is crucial for pregnancy.","['Guney, Mehmet', 'Oral, Baha', 'Karahan, Nermin', 'Mungan, Tamer']","['Guney M', 'Oral B', 'Karahan N', 'Mungan T']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Contracept Reprod Health Care,The European journal of contraception & reproductive health care : the official journal of the European Society of Contraception,9712127,"['0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '4G7DS2Q64Y (Progesterone)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Biopsy', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Embryo Implantation/*physiology', 'Endometrium/cytology/*metabolism', 'Estradiol/analysis/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', '*Intrauterine Devices, Copper/adverse effects', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*metabolism', 'Menstrual Cycle/*immunology', 'Progesterone/analysis/metabolism', 'Turkey']",2007/09/01 09:00,2008/03/06 09:00,['2007/09/01 09:00'],"['2007/09/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/01 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Contracept Reprod Health Care. 2007 Sep;12(3):212-9. doi: 10.1080/13625180701441261.,"['780491294 [pii]', '10.1080/13625180701441261 [doi]']",,"['Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Suleyman Demirel University, Isparta, Turkey. mguney@med.sdu.edu.tr']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we used flow cytometry to determine the frequency of the immunologic types of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in Moroccan children. We analyzed 100 samples from ALL patients within an age ranging from 6 months to 16 years presented over a 4-year period (1996 to 2000). Immunophenotyping allowed classification into 2 major categories: T-ALL (37%) and B-ALL (63%), with a higher percentage of males (69%). Comparison of the clinical characteristics showed that the frequency of splenomegaly was similar in B-ALL and T-ALL patients (53% and 47%, respectively). Hepatomegaly and mediastinal masses were more often associated with T-ALL (62% and 71%, respectively). Splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and mediastinal masses were more frequent in immature than mature B-ALL, whereas the reverse was observed for T-ALL. Complete remission was obtained in 88% and 84% of B-ALL and T-ALL, respectively and relapse after 1 year occurred in 30% and 37% of cases, respectively. CD10 expressing B-ALL showed a slightly higher complete remission rate, whereas the reverse was observed for CD10 expressing T-ALL. The overall 5-year survival rate of ALL was 38%, whereas patients with B-ALL showed better survival than children with T-ALL.","['Dakka, Nadia', 'Bellaoui, Hicham', 'Khattab, Mohammed', 'Brahimi-Horn, Marie C', 'Aoued, Leila', 'Bouzid, Nadia', 'Bakri, Youssef', 'Benjouad, Abdelaziz']","['Dakka N', 'Bellaoui H', 'Khattab M', 'Brahimi-Horn MC', 'Aoued L', 'Bouzid N', 'Bakri Y', 'Benjouad A']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,['EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Morocco/epidemiology', 'Neprilysin/analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/classification/*immunology/*mortality']",2007/09/01 09:00,2007/09/29 09:00,['2007/09/01 09:00'],"['2007/09/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/29 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/01 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2007 Aug;29(8):574-80. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e3181256b8f.,"['10.1097/MPH.0b013e3181256b8f [doi]', '00043426-200708000-00012 [pii]']",,"['Laboratoire de Biochimie-Immunologie, Universite Mohammed V, Faculte des Sciences, Rabat, Morocco. nadiadakka@yahoo.fr']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although much attention has been given to the significant neurocognitive sequelae that can occur after ALL therapy, limited investigation is found addressing fine motor function in these children and motor function that may contribute to neurocognitive deficits in ALL survivors. METHODS: Fine motor and sensory-perceptual performances were examined in 82 children with ALL within 6-months of diagnosis and annually for 2 years (year 1 and year 2, respectively) during therapy. RESULTS: Purdue Pegboard assessments indicated significant slowing of fine motor speed and dexterity for the dominant hand, nondominant hand, and both hands simultaneously for children in this study. Mean Visual-Motor Integration (VMI) scores for children with low-risk and high-risk ALL decreased from the first evaluation to year 1 and again at year 2. Mean VMI scores for children with standard risk ALL increased from the first evaluation to year 1 and then decreased at year 2. Significant positive correlations were found between the Purdue and the VMI at both year 1 and year 2, suggesting that the Pegboard performance consistently predicts the later decline in visual-motor integration. Significant correlations were found between the Purdue Pegboard at baseline and the Performance IQ during year 1, though less consistently during year 2. A similar pattern was also observed between the baseline Pegboard performance and performance on the Coding and Symbol Search subtests during year 1 and year 2. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, children with ALL experienced significant and persistent visual-motor problems throughout therapy. These problems continued during the first and second years of treatment. These basic processing skills are necessary to the development of higher-level cognitive abilities, including nonverbal intelligence and academic achievement, particularly in arithmetic and written language.","['Hockenberry, Marilyn', 'Krull, Kevin', 'Moore, Ki', 'Gregurich, Mary Ann', 'Casey, Marissa E', 'Kaemingk, Kris']","['Hockenberry M', 'Krull K', 'Moore K', 'Gregurich MA', 'Casey ME', 'Kaemingk K']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', '*Motor Skills', 'Perception', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*physiopathology/*therapy']",2007/09/01 09:00,2007/09/29 09:00,['2007/09/01 09:00'],"['2007/09/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/29 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/01 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2007 Aug;29(8):535-9. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e3180f61b92.,"['10.1097/MPH.0b013e3180f61b92 [doi]', '00043426-200708000-00005 [pii]']",,"['Department of Pediatric/Hematology/Oncology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA. mjhocken@txccc.org']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thirty-one SCT long-term survivors, transplanted for leukemia (n=26) or nonmalignant hematologic diseases (n=5) were evaluated by oral glucose tolerance test and assessment of serum lipids at a median age of 15 (range 7 to 34) years. Hyperinsulinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and abdominal obesity were required for the diagnosis of metabolic syndrome. Growth hormone (GH) secretion was evaluated either with GH releasing hormone and arginine (n=14), clonidine (n=15), or insulin-tolerance (n=2) test. A GH peak level of <20 mU/L was considered insufficient. The thyroid and gonadal functions were assessed. Twelve patients (39%) had metabolic syndrome. Nine out of 12 (75%) patients with metabolic syndrome had insufficient GH response in provocative testing as opposed to 6/19 (31%) of those without it (P=0.02). No difference was observed in thyroid or gonadal function between patients with versus without metabolic syndrome. In conclusion, metabolic syndrome is frequently associated with insufficient GH secretion in the SCT long-term survivors. This should implicate a close follow-up of the metabolic parameters in SCT patients with either frank GH insufficiency or signs of inadequate GH response in provocative testing.","['Taskinen, Mervi', 'Lipsanen-Nyman, Marita', 'Tiitinen, Aila', 'Hovi, Liisa', 'Saarinen-Pihkala, Ulla M']","['Taskinen M', 'Lipsanen-Nyman M', 'Tiitinen A', 'Hovi L', 'Saarinen-Pihkala UM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['0 (Lipids)', '9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Female', 'Glucose Tolerance Test', 'Gonads/physiopathology', 'Growth Hormone/blood/*deficiency/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/surgery', 'Lipids/blood', 'Male', 'Metabolic Syndrome/*diagnosis/*etiology', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Thyroid Gland/physiopathology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2007/09/01 09:00,2007/09/29 09:00,['2007/09/01 09:00'],"['2007/09/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/29 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/01 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2007 Aug;29(8):529-34. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e3180f61b67.,"['10.1097/MPH.0b013e3180f61b67 [doi]', '00043426-200708000-00004 [pii]']",,"['Hospital for Children and Adolescents, University of Helsinki, Helsinkil, Finland. mervi.taskinen@hus.fi']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the study was to investigate the hair Se status in children with newly diagnosed lymphoid malignancies and the relation between malnutrition and Se deficiency. Thirty patients with leukemia (n=17) and lymphoma (n=13), and 25 healthy controls were enrolled to the study. Se was determined with atomic absorption spectrophotometrical method. Hair Se levels of the patients were significantly lower than those of control group [666.96+/-341.46 ng/g vs. 1019.22+/-371.83 ng/g (P<0.001)]. Children with lymphoma had lower Se than the children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia but not statistically significant [547.03+/-283.67 ng/g vs. 758.67+/-361.05 ng/g (P>0.05)].

Therefore, new agents that increase the sensitivity of chronic myeloid leukemia cells to STI571 are urgently required. SK-7041 is a novel hybrid synthetic histone deacetylase inhibitor derived from the hydroxamic acid of trichostatin A and pyridyl ring of MS-275. Its cytotoxic effects were examined both as a single agent and in combination with STI571 in acute and chronic myeloid leukemia. SK-7041 exhibited growth inhibition of leukemia cells by downregulation of CDK4, cyclin E and cyclin B1 expression, and by upregulation of p21 expression with subsequent activation of the mitochondria-mediated caspase pathway. SK-7041 showed synergism on growth inhibition, cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis in chronic myeloid leukemia (K562) when combined with STI571. The synergistic effect was mediated through the same mechanism as in SK-7041 alone, involving reduction of cyclin D1 and induction of p21. Taken together, our findings suggest that SK-7041 is active against leukemia and offers new prospects for overcoming STI571 resistance in chronic myeloid leukemia.","['Kim, Byung-Su', 'Bae, Eunkyung', 'Kim, Young-Ju', 'Ahn, Kwang-Sung', 'Park, Juwon', 'Rhee, Ji Young', 'Lee, Young Yiul', 'Kim, Youngsoo', 'Lee, Dongsoon', 'Kim, Byoung Kook', 'Yoon, Sung-Soo']","['Kim BS', 'Bae E', 'Kim YJ', 'Ahn KS', 'Park J', 'Rhee JY', 'Lee YY', 'Kim Y', 'Lee D', 'Kim BK', 'Yoon SS']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (Amides)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (SK-7041)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Amides/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Benzamides', 'Biphenyl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'HL-60 Cells', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology', 'Piperazines', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology']",2007/09/01 09:00,2007/09/28 09:00,['2007/09/01 09:00'],"['2007/09/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/01 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2007 Jul;18(6):641-7. doi: 10.1097/CAD.0b013e3280761a8a.,"['10.1097/CAD.0b013e3280761a8a [doi]', '00001813-200707000-00003 [pii]']",,"['Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: From October 1986 to December 2002, 2,381 patients (median age, 9.37 years; range, 0.2 to 23.8 years; female-to-male ratio, 1:2.7) from Germany, Austria, and Switzerland were registered. A total of 2,086 patients were eligible for the consecutive multicenter protocols NHL-Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster [BFM] -86, NHL-BFM-90, and NHL-BFM-95, and could be evaluated for outcome. RESULTS: CNS involvement was diagnosed in 141 (5.9%) of 2,381 patients and was associated with an advanced stage of NHL. The percentage of CNS-positive patients was 8.8% for Burkitt's lymphoma/Burkitt's leukemia (BL/B-ALL), 5.4% for precursor B-lymphoblastic lymphoma (pB-LBL), 3.3% for anaplastic large-cell lymphoma, 3.2% for T-cell-LBL, 2.6% for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and 0% for primary mediastinal large B-cell NHL (P < .001). Most CNS-positive patients with pB-LBL, T-LBL, or BL/B-ALL had meningeal disease. The probability of event-free survival (pEFS; +/- SE) at 5 years was 85% +/- 1% for the 2,086 protocol patients (median follow-up, 6.5 years; range, 0.3 to 17.7 years). For the 112 CNS-positive patients, pEFS was 64% +/- 5%, compared with 86% +/- 1% for the 1,927 CNS-negative patients (P < .001). Although CNS disease had no impact on pEFS for advanced-stage T-LBL patients, CNS-positive patients with BL/B-ALL had a worse average outcome than CNS-negative patients with stage IV BL/B-ALL (60% +/- 5% v 81% +/- 3%; P < .001). In multivariate analysis, CNS disease was the strongest predictor for relapse in BL/B-ALL patients with advanced-stage disease.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed 138 patients with CML treated with dasatinib from November 2003 to January 2006 in one phase I (n = 50) and four phase II (n = 88) studies for the development of pleural effusion. RESULTS: Pleural effusion occurred in 48 patients (35%; grade 3/4 in 23 [17%]), including 29% of those treated in chronic phase (CP), 50% in accelerated phase (AP), and 33% in blast phase (BP). By multivariate analysis, history of cardiac disease, hypertension, and use of a twice-daily schedule (v once daily) were identified as factors associated with development of pleural effusions. Effusions were exudative in 78% of the assessable cases. In some patients, effusions were associated with reversible increments of right ventricular systolic pressure.

UTX occupies the promoters of HOX gene clusters and regulates their transcriptional output by modulating the recruitment of polycomb repressive complex 1 and the monoubiquitination of histone H2A. Moreover, UTX associates with mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) 2/3 complexes, and during retinoic acid signaling events, the recruitment of the UTX complex to HOX genes results in H3K27 demethylation and a concomitant methylation of H3K4.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a case-control study including 160 cases of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and 162 matched controls to test the impact of six genomic polymorphisms on the risk to develop AML and/or therapy-related AML. RESULTS: We found a significantly higher prevalence of the polymorphic variants RAD51-G135C and CYP3A4-A-290G genes in AML cases, when compared with controls (P = 0.02 and P = 0.04), increasing the risk of AML 2.1-folds (95% CI: 1.1-4.0) and 3.2-fold (95% CI: 1.1-11.5), respectively. Carriers of both the RAD51-G135C and CYP3A4-A-290G variants were at highest AML risk (P = 0.003; OR:13,6; 95% CI: 2.0-585.5), suggesting a synergistic effect between these polymorphisms.

Recent studies indicate an additional role for FTY720 in inducing cell apoptosis. We demonstrate here that FTY720 mediates toxic effects in cell lines representing different B-cell malignancies and primary B cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). In contrast to previous reports in T-cell lines, FTY720-induced toxicity in the Raji cell line and primary CLL B cells is independent of activation of caspases or poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase processing. Further, pancaspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk failed to rescue these cells from apoptosis mediated by FTY720. FTY720 induced down-regulation of Mcl-1 but not Bcl-2 in CLL B cells. Overexpression of Bcl-2 failed to protect transformed B cells from FTY720-induced apoptosis, suggesting a Bcl-2-independent mechanism. Interestingly, FTY720 induced protein phosphatase 2a (PP2a) activation and downstream dephosphorylation of ERK1/2, whereas okadaic acid at concentrations that inhibited the FTY720-induced PP2a activation also resulted in inhibition of FTY720-mediated apoptosis and restoration of baseline ERK1/2 phosphorylation in primary CLL cells, indicating a role for PP2a activation in FTY720-induced cytotoxicity. Further, FTY720 treatment resulted in significant prolonged survival in a xenograft severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mouse model of disseminated B-cell lymphoma/leukemia. These results provide the first evidence for the potential use of FTY720 as a therapeutic agent in a variety of B-cell malignancies, including CLL.","['Liu, Qing', 'Zhao, Xiaobin', 'Frissora, Frank', 'Ma, Yihui', 'Santhanam, Ramasamy', 'Jarjoura, David', 'Lehman, Amy', 'Perrotti, Danilo', 'Chen, Ching-Shih', 'Dalton, James T', 'Muthusamy, Natarajan', 'Byrd, John C']","['Liu Q', 'Zhao X', 'Frissora F', 'Ma Y', 'Santhanam R', 'Jarjoura D', 'Lehman A', 'Perrotti D', 'Chen CS', 'Dalton JT', 'Muthusamy N', 'Byrd JC']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Lysophospholipids)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Propylene Glycols)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '26993-30-6 (sphingosine 1-phosphate)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 2)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'G926EC510T (Fingolimod Hydrochloride)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Fingolimod Hydrochloride', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*toxicity', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Lysophospholipids/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Propylene Glycols/*toxicity', 'Protein Phosphatase 2/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sphingosine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/toxicity', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2007/09/01 09:00,2008/02/19 09:00,['2007/09/01 09:00'],"['2007/09/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/01 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Jan 1;111(1):275-84. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-10-053884.

Here, we use loss-of-function approaches in zebrafish to compare the roles of Smad1 and Smad5 during embryonic hematopoiesis. We show that knockdown of Smad1 or Smad5 generates distinct and even opposite hematopoietic phenotypes. Embryos depleted for Smad1 have an increased number of primitive erythrocytes, but fail to produce mature embryonic macrophages. In contrast, Smad5-depleted embryos are defective in primitive erythropoiesis, yet have normal numbers of macrophages. Loss of either Smad1 or Smad5 causes a failure in the generation of definitive hematopoietic progenitors. To investigate the mechanism behind these phenotypes, we used rescue experiments and found that Smad5 is unable to rescue the Smad1 loss-of-function phenotype, indicating that the 2 highly related proteins have inherently distinct activities. Microarray experiments revealed that the 2 proteins redundantly regulate the key initiators of the hemato-vascular program, including scl, lmo2, and gfi1.

A rare complication of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is donor cell-derived leukemia (DCL). The donors remain cancer free and the causes of these DCL are unknown. Stem cells must repopulate the bone marrow and then give rise to all hematopoietic cells for the rest of the transplant recipient's life. No procedure is acceptable that might introduce precancerous or cancerous mutations in cells performing such a critical function. Medical disposable sets consisting of bags, tubing sets and freezing containers are used to collect, purify and store stem cells. Sterilization of disposables with ethylene oxide is widespread, even though those sets unavoidably retain residual amounts of ethylene oxide which is a potent, direct-acting mutagen and clastogen that has been demonstrated to induce hematopoietic cancer in mice, rats and human beings. Potential exposure levels to ethylene oxide during processing under proposed US FDA guidelines for residual ethylene oxide would be biologically active and present a significant risk factor for DCL. For direct-acting mutagens, there is no recognized ""no effect"" dose using currently accepted cancer risk assessment models. The safety concerns with ethylene oxide can be eliminated by the use of alternative technologies including electron beam, gamma irradiation, or steam for the sterilization of all products used for stem cell processing and storage.","['Butterworth, Byron E', 'Chapman, John R']","['Butterworth BE', 'Chapman JR']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Regul Toxicol Pharmacol,Regulatory toxicology and pharmacology : RTP,8214983,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Mutagens)', 'JJH7GNN18P (Ethylene Oxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinogens/*toxicity', 'Disposable Equipment', 'Equipment Contamination/prevention & control', 'Ethylene Oxide/*toxicity', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Mutagens/toxicity', 'Risk Assessment/methods', 'Risk Factors', 'Sterilization/methods/standards', 'Transplantation', 'United States', 'United States Environmental Protection Agency/standards', 'United States Food and Drug Administration/standards']",2007/09/01 09:00,2008/03/12 09:00,['2007/09/01 09:00'],"['2007/06/08 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/17 00:00 [revised]', '2007/07/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/09/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/01 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Regul Toxicol Pharmacol. 2007 Dec;49(3):149-53. doi: 10.1016/j.yrtph.2007.07.004.

We report a case of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma and malignant melanoma (MM) occurring synchronously in the same lymph node. Several cases of an association between cutaneous malignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders have been reported. Some of which included CLL and MM, occurring in the same patient often CLL after MM. The risk of having CLL after MM has been reported to be increased. Various genetic and environmental etiologies have been postulated, but have as yet not been proven. To our knowledge this is the first time that synchronous occurrence of these two malignant processes in the same tissue is described.

The clinical records of 42 children with LPHL treated between 1982 and 2000 were reviewed retrospectively. All 42 had histology reviewed centrally and confirmed as LPHL by an expert panel. In both trials, only patients with stage IA disease had the option of being treated with either involved field radiation alone or combination chemotherapy consisting of chlorambucil, vinblastine, procarbazine and prednisolone (ChlVPP). Patients with all other stages were treated with ChlVPP chemotherapy. Thirty-five patients (83%) presented with early stage disease (Stages I & II). All 42 patients achieved a complete remission (CR). Six children relapsed after primary therapy. The 5- and 10-year relapse-free survival rates were 87% and 82% respectively. Forty-one are currently alive in CR.

Few studies, however, have analysed normal haematopoietic cell populations to identify altered gene expression in ALL. We used oligonucleotide microarrays to compare the gene expression profile of paediatric precursor-B (pre-B) ALL specimens with two control cell populations, normal CD34(+) and CD19(+)IgM(-) cells, to focus on genes linked to leukemogenesis. A set of eight genes was identified with a ninefold higher average expression in ALL specimens compared with control cells. All of these genes were significantly deregulated in an independent cohort of 101 ALL specimens. One gene, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF, also known as CCN2), had exceptionally high expression, which was confirmed in three independent leukaemia studies. Further analysis of CTGF expression in ALL revealed exclusive expression in B-lineage, not T-lineage, ALL. Within B-lineage ALL approximately 75% of specimens were consistently positive for CTGF expression, however, specimens containing the E2A-PBX1 translocation showed low or no expression. Protein studies using Western blot analysis demonstrated the presence of CTGF in ALL cell-conditioned media. These findings indicate that CTGF is secreted by pre-B ALL cells and may play a role in the pathophysiology of this disease.","['Boag, Joanne M', 'Beesley, Alex H', 'Firth, Martin J', 'Freitas, Joseph R', 'Ford, Jette', 'Brigstock, David R', 'de Klerk, Nicholas H', 'Kees, Ursula R']","['Boag JM', 'Beesley AH', 'Firth MJ', 'Freitas JR', 'Ford J', 'Brigstock DR', 'de Klerk NH', 'Kees UR']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (CCN2 protein, human)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '139568-91-5 (Connective Tissue Growth Factor)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Connective Tissue Growth Factor', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/chemistry', 'Fetal Blood/chemistry', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/analysis/*genetics', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/analysis/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism']",2007/09/01 09:00,2007/11/07 09:00,['2007/09/01 09:00'],"['2007/09/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/01 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2007 Sep;138(6):740-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2007.06739.x.,"['BJH6739 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2007.06739.x [doi]']",,"[""Division of Children's Leukaemia and Cancer Research, Telethon Institute for Child Health Research, and Centre for Child Health Research, The University of Western Australia, West Perth, WA, Australia.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The microenvironment that sustains leukaemic cells in vivo contains both stromal cell elements and T cells. We defined changes in Bcl-2 family protein expression on culture with CD40 ligand (CD154) expressed on mouse fibroblast L cells, and interleukin-4 (IL-4; CD154/IL-4 system): conditions that support survival and proliferation. Unexpectedly, Bcl-2 protein expression decreased whilst pro-survival Bcl-x(L) (as well as A1 and Mcl-1) increased. However, the CD154-L cell/IL-4 system also increased the pro-apoptotic proteins, Bid and Noxa, suggesting that an increased pool of pro-survival factors and not the effects of a single protein mediate survival. Most pro-apoptotic proteins were not induced in drug or spontaneous apoptosis, but expression of Bcl-x(S), a pro-apoptotic BCL2L1 isoform, was associated with cell death. This was post-transcriptionally controlled, and, therefore, alternative splicing at the Bcl-x locus appears to have a role in the regulation of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) cell survival. This study demonstrated a switch in pro-survival proteins associated with the transition from quiescence to CD154-driven proliferation. CLL therapies targeting Bcl-2 may need to be modified to antagonize proliferation centre-specific pro-survival proteins.","['Willimott, Shaun', 'Baou, Maria', 'Naresh, Kikkeri', 'Wagner, Simon D']","['Willimott S', 'Baou M', 'Naresh K', 'Wagner SD']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BBC3 protein, human)', '0 (BCL2-related protein A1)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/analysis/metabolism', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'CD40 Ligand/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Gene Expression', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Lymph Nodes/chemistry', 'Mice', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/analysis/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Staurosporine/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'bcl-X Protein/analysis/metabolism']",2007/09/01 09:00,2007/11/07 09:00,['2007/09/01 09:00'],"['2007/09/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/09/01 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2007 Sep;138(6):721-32. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2007.06717.x.,"['BJH6717 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2007.06717.x [doi]']",,"['Division of Investigative Sciences, Department of Haematology, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital, London, UK.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PROCEDURE: Self-reported age of menarche was determined among 949 female ALL survivors participating in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS), a cohort of 5-year survivors of common pediatric cancers diagnosed from 1970 to 1986, and compared with 1,128 siblings. RESULTS: The majority of survivors (92%) and siblings (97%) reported menarche between the ages of 10 and 16. Survivors treated with chemotherapy alone, including those exposed to alkylating agents, experienced menarche at a similar rate to siblings. However, compared to chemotherapy alone, cranial radiotherapy was associated with early menarche (age < 10; OR 6.2, 95% CI 2.1, 18.5) while craniospinal radiotherapy was associated with both early (OR 8.6, 95% CI 1.9, 38.6) and late (age > 16; OR 4.8, 95% CI 1.4, 16.7) menarche. There were no differences in effect between <20 and >/=20 Gy radiotherapy doses. In multivariable analysis, younger age at diagnosis was an independent risk factor for early menarche. CONCLUSIONS: Few female childhood ALL survivors experienced menarche outside of the normal range. Alkylating agent exposure was not associated with abnormal timing. However, those exposed to cranial and craniospinal radiotherapy, especially at a young age, should be monitored closely for abnormal timing of menarche.","['Chow, Eric J', 'Friedman, Debra L', 'Yasui, Yutaka', 'Whitton, John A', 'Stovall, Marilyn', 'Robison, Leslie L', 'Sklar, Charles A']","['Chow EJ', 'Friedman DL', 'Yasui Y', 'Whitton JA', 'Stovall M', 'Robison LL', 'Sklar CA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Age of Onset', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Menarche/*drug effects/*radiation effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/therapy', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects/methods', 'Risk Factors', 'Survivors', 'Time']",2007/08/31 09:00,2008/03/26 09:00,['2007/08/31 09:00'],"['2007/08/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/26 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/31 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2008 Apr;50(4):854-8. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21316.,['10.1002/pbc.21316 [doi]'],"['(c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA. ericchow@u.washington.edu']","['T32-CA009351/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24-CA55727/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, low MBL levels were not associated with an increased cumulative incidence of infection or with a shorter time to first infection.

To characterize further the genotype of PMBL, we analyzed 37 tumor samples and PMBL cell lines Med-B1 and Karpas1106P using array-based comparative genomic hybridization (matrix- or array-CGH) to a 2.8k genomic microarray. Due to a higher genomic resolution, we identified altered chromosomal regions in much higher frequencies compared with standard CGH: for example, +9p24 (68%), +2p15 (51%), +7q22 (32%), +9q34 (32%), +11q23 (18%), +12q (30%) and +18q21 (24%). Moreover, previously unknown small interstitial chromosomal low copy number alterations (for example, -6p21, -11q13.3) and a total of 19 DNA amplifications were identified by array-CGH. For 17 chromosomal localizations (10 gains and 7 losses), which were altered in more than 10% of the analyzed cases, we delineated minimal consensus regions based on genomic base pair positions. These regions and selected immunohistochemistries point to candidate genes that are discussed in the context of NF-kappaB transcription activation, human leukocyte antigen class I/II defects, impaired apoptosis and Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) activation.

Here, we report that the fusion protein BCR/ABL1 increases expression of WT1 mRNA and protein via the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathway. Inhibition of BCR/ABL1 or PI3K activity strongly suppressed transcription from WT1 promoter/enhancer reporters. Forced expression of BCR/ABL1 in normal human progenitor CD34+ cells increased WT1 mRNA and protein, further supporting the notion of BCR/ABL1-driven expression of WT1 in human haematopoietic cells. Forced expression of WT1 in K562 cells provided protection against cytotoxic effects of the ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib, as judged by effects on viability measured by trypan blue exclusion, metabolic activity, annexin V and DAPI (4', 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) staining. None of the isoforms provided any detectable protection against apoptosis induced by arsenic trioxide and only very weak protection against etoposide, indicating that WT1 interferes with specific apoptotic signalling pathways. Our data demonstrate that WT1 expression is induced by oncogenic signalling from BCR/ABL1 and that WT1 contributes to resistance against apoptosis induced by imatinib.","['Svensson, E', 'Vidovic, K', 'Lassen, C', 'Richter, J', 'Olofsson, T', 'Fioretos, T', 'Gullberg, U']","['Svensson E', 'Vidovic K', 'Lassen C', 'Richter J', 'Olofsson T', 'Fioretos T', 'Gullberg U']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (1L-6-hydroxymethyl-chiro-inositol 2(R)-2-O-methyl-3-O-octadecylcarbonate)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Chromones)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', '4L6452S749 (Inositol)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Genes, Wilms Tumor', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Inositol/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*physiology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/physiology', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'WT1 Proteins/biosynthesis/*physiology']",2007/08/31 09:00,2007/12/28 09:00,['2007/08/31 09:00'],"['2007/08/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/31 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Dec;21(12):2485-94. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404924.

Their antiviral activity can be mediated by at least two cytotoxic pathways, namely, the granule exocytosis pathway, involving perforin and granzymes, and the Fas-FasL pathway. However, the viral factor(s) that influences the selection of one or the other pathway for pathogen control is elusive. Here we investigate the role of viral replication levels in the induction and activation of CTL, including their effector potential, during acute Friend murine leukemia virus (F-MuLV) infection. F-MuLV inoculation results in a low-level infection of adult C57BL/6 mice that is enhanced about 500-fold upon coinfection with the spleen focus-forming virus (SFFV). Both the low- and high-level F-MuLV infections generated CD8+ effector T cells that were essential for the control of viral replication. However, the low-level infection induced CD8+ T cells expressing solely FasL but not the cytotoxic molecules granzymes A and B, whereas the high-level infection resulted in induction of CD8+ effector T cells secreting molecules of the granule exocytosis pathway. By using knockout mouse strains deficient in one or the other cytotoxic pathway, we found that low-level viral replication was controlled by CTL that expressed FasL but control of high-level viral replication required perforin and granzymes. Additional studies, in which F-MuLV replication was enhanced experimentally in the absence of SFFV coinfection, supported the notion that only the replication level of F-MuLV was the critical factor that determined the differential expression of cytotoxic molecules by CD8+ T cells and the pathway of CTL cytotoxicity.","['Zelinskyy, Gennadiy', 'Balkow, Sandra', 'Schimmer, Simone', 'Werner, Tanja', 'Simon, Markus M', 'Dittmer, Ulf']","['Zelinskyy G', 'Balkow S', 'Schimmer S', 'Werner T', 'Simon MM', 'Dittmer U']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Granzymes)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/*virology', 'Exocytosis', 'Fas Ligand Protein/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Granzymes/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Retroviridae/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spleen/metabolism/virology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/virology', '*Virus Replication']",2007/08/31 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2007/08/31 09:00'],"['2007/08/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/31 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2007 Nov;81(21):11881-90. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01554-07.

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed patients receiving remission induction therapy for AML at the Cleveland Clinic between January 1997 and December 2005. Demographic data were obtained from medical records. Income and DTC were determined using online databases. Known prognostic factors (age, WBC count at diagnosis, cytogenetics, AML etiology) were collected and controlled for in Cox proportional hazards analysis. RESULTS: Induction chemotherapy was administered to 281 patients; 91% were Caucasian (C), 8% were African American (AA), and 1% were neither (non-AA non-C). The median DTC was 24 miles (range, 0.9-2058), and median annual household income was USD 38,972 (range, USD17,496-143,220). With a median follow up of 22.6 months, the median overall survival (OS) was 11.3 months. In multivariable analyses, age >or=60 years, unfavorable cytogenetics, initial WBC count and secondary AML significantly influenced survival (p<0.001, p<0.001, p=0.035, and p=0.010, respectively). OS was similar for AAs and non-AA non-Cs compared to Cs (HR=1.12, 95% CI=.61-2.07, p=.71, and HR=0.87, CI=0.21-3.62, p=.84, respectively). Neither DTC (HR=1.00, 95%CI=0.98-1.01, p=.96 per 20 mile increment) nor SES (HR=1.02, 95%CI=0.92-1.13, p=.77 per USD10,000 annual income increase) had an impact on OS. CONCLUSION: Unlike with many solid tumors, SES and DTC are not predictive of outcome in AML patients.","['Rodriguez, Cristina P', 'Baz, Rachid', 'Jawde, Rony Abou', 'Rybicki, Lisa A', 'Kalaycio, Matt E', 'Advani, Anjali', 'Sobecks, Ronald', 'Sekeres, Mikkael A']","['Rodriguez CP', 'Baz R', 'Jawde RA', 'Rybicki LA', 'Kalaycio ME', 'Advani A', 'Sobecks R', 'Sekeres MA']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*psychology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Racial Groups', 'Remission Induction', 'Social Class', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2007/08/31 09:00,2008/05/07 09:00,['2007/08/31 09:00'],"['2007/05/09 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/15 00:00 [revised]', '2007/07/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/08/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/31 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2008 Mar;32(3):413-20. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2007.07.015.

The design of this formulation was aimed at selective targeting of tumor cells, reducing cardiotoxicity of DOX and VER, as well as overcoming P-glycoprotein (Pgp)-mediated multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype. METHODS: The liposomes were prepared by polycarbonate membrane extrusion, followed by pH-gradient driven remote loading and Tf conjugation. Kinetics of in vitro release of DOX and VER from liposomes was determined by measuring changes in the concentration of encapsulated drugs. Uptake of Tf-conjugated liposomes by K562 cells was evaluated by fluorescence microscopy and by fluorometry. Cytotoxicities of various formulations of DOX were determined by a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolum bromide (MTT) assay. RESULTS: Efficiencies for liposomal loading of DOX and VER were 95% and 70%, respectively. The mean particle diameter for the liposomes was approximately 110nm. Rates of release for DOX and VER were similar in singly-loaded and co-loaded liposomes. Tf-L-DOX/VER showed efficient uptake by the TfR+ K562 cells. In DOX-resistant K562 cells (K562/DOX), Tf-L-DOX/VER showed 5.2 and 2.8 times greater cytotoxicity (IC50 = 4.18 muM) than non-targeted liposomes (L-DOX/VER) (IC50 = 21.7 muM) and Tf-targeted liposomes loaded with DOX alone (Tf-L-DOX) (IC50 = 11.5 muM), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of TfR targeting and co-encapsulation of DOX and VER was highly effective in overcoming drug resistance in K562 leukemia cells.","['Wu, Jun', 'Lu, Yanhui', 'Lee, Alice', 'Pan, Xiaogang', 'Yang, Xiaojuan', 'Zhao, Xiaobin', 'Lee, Robert J']","['Wu J', 'Lu Y', 'Lee A', 'Pan X', 'Yang X', 'Zhao X', 'Lee RJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Canada,J Pharm Pharm Sci,"Journal of pharmacy & pharmaceutical sciences : a publication of the Canadian Society for Pharmaceutical Sciences, Societe canadienne des sciences pharmaceutiques",9807281,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Calcium Channel Blockers)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Transferrin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/adverse effects/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Calcium Channel Blockers/administration & dosage/adverse effects/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Drug Combinations', '*Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Fluorometry', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'K562 Cells', 'Liposomes', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Particle Size', 'Transferrin/chemistry', 'Verapamil/administration & dosage/adverse effects/chemistry/*pharmacology']",2007/08/31 09:00,2007/10/05 09:00,['2007/08/31 09:00'],"['2007/08/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/31 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Pharm Pharm Sci. 2007;10(3):350-7.,,,"['Division of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this communication, we examined the effect of soy isoflavones on the growth of adult T-cell leukemia cells in vitro and in vivo. In the in vitro study, daidzein and genistein but not glycitein significantly inhibited the proliferation of ED-40515 and Hut102 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Among the isoflavones studied, genistein had the highest growth-inhibitory effect; however, genistein did not exert an apparent growth-inhibitory effect on Jurkat and Molt-4 cells, which were non-adult T-cell leukemia cells. Genistein prevented the G(1)/S or G(2)/M transition at 3 and 10 or 30 microM, respectively. Genistein upregulated p21 protein expression together with p53 accumulation. In addition, treatment with 30 microM genistein strongly induced phosphorylation of checkpoint kinase (CHK) 2 and p53 at serines 15, 20 and 37. Caffeine, an inhibitor of ataxia-telangiectasia mutated protein kinase, alleviated the genistein-induced p53 and CHK2 phosphorylation, suggesting the involvement of DNA damage at 30 microM. However, marked phosphorylation of CHK2 and p53 could not be detected at 3 and 10 microM genistein. These data indicate that genistein has biphasic growth-inhibitory properties. The in vivo studies demonstrated that soy-derived isoflavones significantly inhibit ED-40515 cell growth and infiltration into various organs in non-obese diabetic severe combined-immunodeficiency common gamma-chain knockout mice. Taken together, it is evident that soy isoflavones might serve as a promising compound for the treatment of adult T-cell leukemia.","['Yamasaki, Masao', 'Fujita, Satoshi', 'Ishiyama, Erina', 'Mukai, Ayako', 'Madhyastha, Harishkumar', 'Sakakibara, Yoichi', 'Suiko, Masahito', 'Hatakeyama, Kinta', 'Nemoto, Takayuki', 'Morishita, Kazuhiro', 'Kataoka, Hiroaki', 'Tsubouchi, Hirohito', 'Nishiyama, Kazuo']","['Yamasaki M', 'Fujita S', 'Ishiyama E', 'Mukai A', 'Madhyastha H', 'Sakakibara Y', 'Suiko M', 'Hatakeyama K', 'Nemoto T', 'Morishita K', 'Kataoka H', 'Tsubouchi H', 'Nishiyama K']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Isoflavones)', '6287WC5J2L (daidzein)', '92M5F28TVF (glycitein)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Genistein/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Isoflavones/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, SCID', '*Soybeans', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",2007/08/31 09:00,2007/12/15 09:00,['2007/08/31 09:00'],"['2007/08/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/15 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/31 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2007 Nov;98(11):1740-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2007.00595.x.

The BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib is highly effective in patients with CML, but hardly crosses the blood-brain barrier. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report on two CML patients who developed a myeloid CNS relapse during treatment with imatinib. One patient was in major cytogenetic response at the time of CNS relapse. In both cases, the myeloid origin of neoplastic cells in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was demonstrable by immunophenotyping, and their leukaemic origin by detection of the BCR/ABL oncoprotein. No BCR/ABL kinase domain mutations were found. Both patients received intrathecal liposomal cytarabine (50 mg each cycle; 6 cycles). In one patient, additional CNS radiation was performed, whereas in the other, consecutive treatment with dasatinib (70 mg per os twice daily) was started. RESULTS: In response to therapy, the clinical symptoms resolved, and the leukaemic cells in the CSF disappeared in both cases. After three months of observation, both patients are in complete cytogenetic and major molecular response, without evidence for a systemic or a CNS relapse. CONCLUSIONS: 'Anatomic' resistance against imatinib in the CNS can lead to a myeloid CNS relapse. Liposomal cytarabine with or without radiation is effective as local therapy in these patients. For systemic treatment and prophylaxis, BCR/ABL kinase inhibitors crossing the blood-brain barrier such as dasatinib should be considered in patients with CNS relapse.","['Aichberger, K J', 'Herndlhofer, S', 'Agis, H', 'Sperr, W R', 'Esterbauer, H', 'Rabitsch, W', 'Knobl, P', 'Haas, O A', 'Thalhammer, R', 'Schwarzinger, I', 'Sillaber, C', 'Jager, U', 'Valent, P']","['Aichberger KJ', 'Herndlhofer S', 'Agis H', 'Sperr WR', 'Esterbauer H', 'Rabitsch W', 'Knobl P', 'Haas OA', 'Thalhammer R', 'Schwarzinger I', 'Sillaber C', 'Jager U', 'Valent P']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Clin Invest,European journal of clinical investigation,0245331,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/*drug therapy/secondary', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Dasatinib', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Liposomes', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Thiazoles/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",2007/08/31 09:00,2008/03/15 09:00,['2007/08/31 09:00'],"['2007/08/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/15 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/31 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Clin Invest. 2007 Oct;37(10):808-13. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2362.2007.01859.x.

Increased levels have also been described in hematological malignancies, especially in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). METHODS: We investigated the value of sTfR in the assessment of tumor mass in 61 previously untreated CLL patients. Both hemolysis and iron deficiency were excluded. sTfR was measured nephelometrically (normal 0.81-1.75 mg/L). RESULTS: All Binet A patients had normal sTfR values (1.36+/-0.22 mg/L). In Binet B patients, the sTfR was increased (3.08+/-1.70 mg/L, p<0.0001) compared to Binet A patients. Binet B patients with normal sTfR had a small tumor load and no abdominal involvement. A further increase of sTfR in Binet C (3.75+/- 2.32 mg/L) was not significant compared to Binet B patients. sTfR values decreased or even normalized after successful treatment, whereas relapse or disease progression was associated with another increase of sTfR. CONCLUSIONS: The sTfR concentration directly reflects the tumor burden in CLL. Therefore, sTfR may be of clinical value in monitoring disease activity, response to treatment and disease progression.","['Metzgeroth, Georgia', 'Schultheis, Beate', 'Kuhn, Christian', 'Dorn-Beineke, Alexandra', 'LaRosee, Paul', 'Hehlmann, Rudiger', 'Hastka, Jan']","['Metzgeroth G', 'Schultheis B', 'Kuhn C', 'Dorn-Beineke A', 'LaRosee P', 'Hehlmann R', 'Hastka J']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Clin Chem Lab Med,Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,9806306,"['0 (Receptors, Transferrin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nephelometry and Turbidimetry', 'Receptors, Transferrin/*blood/chemistry', 'Solubility', 'Tumor Burden/*physiology']",2007/08/31 09:00,2008/01/18 09:00,['2007/08/31 09:00'],"['2007/08/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/18 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/31 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Chem Lab Med. 2007;45(10):1313-8. doi: 10.1515/CCLM.2007.287.,['10.1515/CCLM.2007.287 [doi]'],,"['III.

Haemostatic disturbances and infections are the main causes of death in CML. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We investigated 22 patients with CML aged 38-55 years (median 45.0). Twenty nine healthy controls were sex and age-matched. Patients underwent following examination: whole blood count, blood smear, platelets count, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), euglobulin lysis time (ELT), fibrin degradation products (FDP), thrombin-antithrombin complexes (TAT), plasmin-alpha2-antiplasmin complexes (PAP), antigen and urokinase plasminogen activators (t-PA:Ag, u-PA:Ag), antigen of tissue plasminogen activator inhibitors type 1 and 2 (PAI-1:Ag, PAI-2:Ag), fibrinogen concentrations, antitrombin (AT) and alpha2-antiplasmin (alpha2-AP) activity. RESULTS: TAT concentration (35.46 ng/ml) was significantly higher in examined group than in controls (3.41 ng/ml). Significantly higher fibrinogen concentration (3.31 g/l) and elevated platelet count (611.0 G/1) was observed in patients with CML. We also showed significantly higher concentrations of u-PA:Ag (0.67 ng/ml), PAI-1:Ag (34.8 ng/ml), PAP complexes (473.10 ng/ml) and FDP (17.10 microg/ml) in patients with CML. CONCLUSION: High TAT, fibrinogen concentrations and elevated platelet count in patients with CML are the evidences of an activation of coagulation.

By using 2D-gel electrophoresis, mass spectrometry and Western blotting we investigate in this paper the functional consequences of RhoGDI2 processing. We can show that loss of the N-terminal 19 amino acids results in a shift of the isoelectric point of the truncated RhoGDI2 (NDelta19) to a more basic value due to the removal of 9 acidic amino acids from the N-terminus, which may be responsible for enhanced retention of the N-terminally truncated protein within the nuclear compartment. Fusion of the p53 nuclear export signaling sequence MFRELNEALELK to NDelta19 (NDelta19NES) abolished its apoptosis promoting properties, while overexpression of NDelta19 significantly increased the susceptibility to apoptosis induction by the proteasome inhibitor PSI and by staurosporine. These results suggest that cleavage of RhoGDI2 by caspase-3 is not a functionally irrelevant bystander effect of caspase activation during apoptosis, but rather expedites progression of the apoptotic process.","['Choi, Mi-Ran', 'Groot, Marcel', 'Drexler, Hannes C A']","['Choi MR', 'Groot M', 'Drexler HC']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (ARHGDIB protein, human)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide Dissociation Inhibitors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (rho Guanine Nucleotide Dissociation Inhibitor beta)', '0 (rho-Specific Guanine Nucleotide Dissociation Inhibitors)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Apoptosis/genetics/*physiology', 'Caspases/*physiology', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Guanine Nucleotide Dissociation Inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'U937 Cells', 'rho Guanine Nucleotide Dissociation Inhibitor beta', 'rho-Specific Guanine Nucleotide Dissociation Inhibitors']",2007/08/30 09:00,2007/12/22 09:00,['2007/08/30 09:00'],"['2007/08/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/30 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Apoptosis. 2007 Nov;12(11):2025-35. doi: 10.1007/s10495-007-0121-5.,['10.1007/s10495-007-0121-5 [doi]'],,"['Max-Planck-Institute for Heart and Lung Research, Parkstr.1, Bad Nauheim 61231, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The susceptibility of tumor cells to artesunate can be enhanced by ferrous iron. The transferrin receptor (TfR) is involved in iron uptake by internalization of transferrin and is over-expressed in rapidly growing tumors. The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters ABCB6 and ABCB7 are also involved in iron homeostasis. To investigate whether these proteins play a role for sensitivity towards artesunate, Oncotest's 36 cell line panel was treated with artesunate or artesunate plus iron(II) glycine sulfate (Ferrosanol). The majority of cell lines showed increased inhibition rates, for the combination of artesunate plus iron(II) glycine sulfate compared to artesunate alone. However, in 11 out of the 36 cell lines the combination treatment was not superior. Cell lines with high TfR expression significantly correlated with high degrees of modulation indicating that high TfR expressing tumor cells would be more efficiently inhibited by this combination treatment than low TfR expressing ones. Furthermore, we found a significant relationship between cellular response to artesunate and TfR expression in 55 cell lines of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), USA. A significant correlation was also found for ABCB6, but not for ABCB7 in the NCI panel. Artesunate treatment of human CCRF-CEM leukemia and MCF7 breast cancer cells induced ABCB6 expression but repressed ABCB7 expression. Finally, artesunate inhibited proliferation and differentiation of mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cells.

Furthermore, we debate whether the integration near the LMO2 locus is sufficient to result in T-ALL-like proliferations or whether the gamma-retroviral viral expression of the therapeutic IL2RG gene contributes to leukemogenesis.

However, it has been suggested that p21 may also act as an oncogene because it often inhibits apoptosis. For example, deletion of p21 from p53-deficient mice resulted in longer survival and in a significantly reduced number of thymic lymphomas that was explained by higher apoptotic rates in these mice. However, recently it has been shown that a p53 mutant that had lost its ability to induce apoptosis, but retained its ability to induce p21 and cell cycle arrest, was able to suppress lymphomagenesis in different cancer models. Tumor suppression by this p53 mutant was modulated by p21, which induced senescence and preserved chromosomal stability.

However, the molecular mechanism of the anticancer effect of IP6 has not been fully elucidated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using K-562 human leukemia cells we analysed the induction of the erythroid differentiation program, as well as modulation of the gene expression profile of K-562 leukemia cells treated with IP6. RESULTS: A single treatment with IP6 (0.75 or 5.0 mM) resulted in a time- and dose-dependent growth inhibition of K-562 cells and also activation of the erythroid differentiation program. K-562 cells expressed a concomitant differentiation after 12 hours of exposure. Possible molecular mechanisms and key signaling pathways, as well as gene expression behind this anticancer effect were examined using oligonucleotide microarrays and quantitative real-time PCR. Treatment with IP6 (750 microM, 5 mM) had a marked impact, resulting in early (60 min) and late (12 h) modulation of expression of about 1800 and 1200 transcripts (at p<0.05). Through microarray analysis, the anticancer effect of IP6 in K-562 was found to be associated with the modulation of multiple genes involved in immunity, Wnt and IGF pathways, PI3 kinase signaling and apoptosis. Using selected subsets of genes, the microarray hits could be validated by Q-PCR. A 2-fold upregulation of the apoptosis pathway, measured using the BAX/BCL-2 ratio was observed for 12 hours. IP6 (5 mM) induced up to 6-fold increases in differentiation measured by hemoglobin synthesis, yielding up to 70% of benzidine-positive cells at 120 hours. CONCLUSION: The results of this study show that IP6 is a strong inducer of differentiation (cytostatic effect) and a moderately strong inducer of apoptosis (cytotoxic effect). Evidence has been provided to show that the growth inhibitory effects of IP6 are mediated through the modulation of key signaling pathways.","['Bozsik, Aniko', 'Kokeny, Szabolcs', 'Olah, Edith']","['Bozsik A', 'Kokeny S', 'Olah E']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Cancer Genomics Proteomics,Cancer genomics & proteomics,101188791,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzidines)', '2X02101HVF (benzidine)', '7IGF0S7R8I (Phytic Acid)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Benzidines', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Erythroid Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'K562 Cells', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Phytic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Reproducibility of Results']",2007/08/30 09:00,2007/10/05 09:00,['2007/08/30 09:00'],"['2007/08/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/30 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Genomics Proteomics. 2007 Jan-Feb;4(1):43-51.,,,"['National Institute of Oncology, Department of Molecular Genetics, Budapest, H-1122, Hungary.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, recent studies showed deregulation of some of Eph/ephrin genes in human malignancies, suggesting the involvement of this signaling pathway in tumorigenesis. The ALL1 (also termed MLL) gene on human chromosome 11q23 was isolated by virtue of its involvement in recurrent chromosome translocations associated with acute leukemias with poor prognosis. The translocations fuse ALL1 to any of >50 partner genes and result in production of chimeric proteins composed of the ALL1 N terminus and the C terminus of the partner protein. The most common translocations in ALL1-associated leukemias are t(4;11) and t(9;11), which generate ALL1/AF4 and ALL1/AF9 fusion protein, respectively. In the present study, we sought to determine whether ALL1 fusion proteins are involved in regulation of Eph/ephrin genes. Screening of K562 cells producing recombinant ALL1/AF4 or ALL1/AF9 fusion protein revealed transcriptional up-regulation of the EphA7. Consistent with this finding, siRNA-mediated suppression of ALL1/AF4 in SEMK2 cells carrying the t(4;11) chromosome translocation resulted in down-regulation of EphA7. ChIP analysis demonstrated the occupancy of tagged ALL1 fusion proteins on the EphA7 promoter, pointing to EphA7 as a direct target of the formers. Further studies demonstrate that EphA7 up-regulation is accompanied by ERK phosphorylation. Finally, we show apoptotic cell death, specific for leukemic cells carrying the t(4;11) chromosome translocation, after treatment of the cells with an ERK phosphorylation blocker.","['Nakanishi, Hiroshi', 'Nakamura, Tatsuya', 'Canaani, Eli', 'Croce, Carlo M']","['Nakanishi H', 'Nakamura T', 'Canaani E', 'Croce CM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '24386-93-4 (5-iodotubercidin)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, EphA7)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'M351LCX45Y (Tubercidin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4/genetics', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genome, Human/genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Receptor, EphA7/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics', 'Tubercidin/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",2007/08/30 09:00,2007/10/25 09:00,['2007/08/30 09:00'],"['2007/08/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/25 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/30 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2007 Sep 4;104(36):14442-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0703211104.

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In five end-stage AML patients, a leukapheresis procedure was performed with a cell separator (either COBE Spectra [Gambro BCT] or Amicus [Baxter]). For large-scale AML-DC generation, the MNCs of a single leukapheresis concentrate were isolated by density gradient and plated into a cell factory under GMP conditions. The AML-DCs were harvested on Day 8 of culture, and their viability, the mature morphology, and the phenotype were evaluated. The AML-DCs were injected subcutaneously into five AML patients up to four times at a biweekly interval. RESULTS: All AML patients entered the leukapheresis procedure with a highly pathologic blood count. In a mean separation time of 198 +/- 33 minutes, a mean of 1.3 +/- 0.2-fold the total blood volume was processed with a white blood cell (WBC) yield of 9 x 10(9) to 70 x 10(9) per collection dependent on the precollection WBC count. After density gradient a mean of 2.2 x 10(9) +/- 0.3 x 10(9) MNCs were plated into a cell factory. This resulted in a mean viable and mature DC yield of 0.01 x 10(9) of MNCs. CONCLUSION: The leukapheresis procedure is a feasible and safe procedure even in patients with hematologic malignancies and highly pathologic blood counts. Sufficient amounts of MNCs can be collected in leukopenic patients and the large-scale generation of AML-DCs in cell factories under GMP conditions yields in an adequate quantity of viable and mature AML-DCs.","['Schmitt, Anita', 'Reinhardt, Peter', 'Hus, Iwona', 'Tabarkiewicz, Jacek', 'Rolinski, Jacek', 'Barth, Thomas', 'Giannopoulos, Krzysztof', 'Dmoszynska, Anna', 'Wiesneth, Markus', 'Schmitt, Michael']","['Schmitt A', 'Reinhardt P', 'Hus I', 'Tabarkiewicz J', 'Rolinski J', 'Barth T', 'Giannopoulos K', 'Dmoszynska A', 'Wiesneth M', 'Schmitt M']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,,IM,"['Aged', '*Blood Transfusion, Autologous', 'Dendritic Cells/*transplantation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', '*Immunotherapy', 'Leukapheresis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/pathology/*surgery/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",2007/08/30 09:00,2007/10/18 09:00,['2007/08/30 09:00'],"['2007/08/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/18 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/30 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Transfusion. 2007 Sep;47(9):1588-94. doi: 10.1111/j.1537-2995.2007.01328.x.,"['TRF01328 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1537-2995.2007.01328.x [doi]']",,"['Institute for Clinical Transfusion Medicine and Immunogenetics, Department of Pathology, and the Clinic for Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Genetic alterations of each are associated with abnormal platelet development, as well as predisposition to leukemia. In addition, in vitro and animal studies indicate that both factors are involved in megakaryopoiesis. We and others have previously shown that RUNX1 and GATA-1 physically interact and cooperate in the activation of megakaryocytic promoters such as alpha IIb integrin and glycoprotein Ibalpha. Moreover, transcriptional cooperation of RUNX1 with GATA-1 is conserved back to Drosophila in which RUNX1 and GATA-1 homologs cooperate in crystal cell development. In this article, we will review the molecular and functional significance of the transcriptional cross talk between RUNX1 and GATA-1. In particular, we will elaborate on recent data which suggest that GATA-1 targets RUNX1 for modification, in particular phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinases. Furthermore, targeting of RUNX1 by GATA-1 for phosphorylation may convert RUNX1 from a repressor to an activator. This is a potential mechanism of transcriptional cooperation and may be an essential step in megakaryocytic differentiation.","['Elagib, Kamaleldin E', 'Goldfarb, Adam N']","['Elagib KE', 'Goldfarb AN']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",United States,Crit Rev Eukaryot Gene Expr,Critical reviews in eukaryotic gene expression,9007261,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Gata1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/genetics/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Megakaryocytes/cytology', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Transcription, Genetic/*physiology']",2007/08/30 09:00,2007/10/25 09:00,['2007/08/30 09:00'],"['2007/08/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/25 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/30 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Crit Rev Eukaryot Gene Expr. 2007;17(4):271-80. doi: 10.1615/critreveukargeneexpr.v17.i4.20.,"['584e67ca401a7c57,3aa5b1eb2e264d5e [pii]', '10.1615/critreveukargeneexpr.v17.i4.20 [doi]']",,"['Department of Pathology, University of Virginia School of Medicine, PO Box 800904, Charlottesville, VA 22908, USA. ka8b@virginia.edu']","['CA100057/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA93735/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009109/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",58,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Earlier clinical trials have yielded conflicting results and possibly a minor survival benefit, often offset by a longer hospitalization time. METHODS: To evaluate the role of IC in patients with AML, a case control study of patients 60 years or older treated at the Cleveland Clinic Taussig Cancer Center between 1997 and 2005 was conducted. Forty-four patients who did not receive IC were matched by a propensity analysis to 138 patients who received an anthracycline-based regimen. RESULTS: The unadjusted median survival of patients who did not receive IC was 53 days, compared with 197 days (P < .001) for those who did. After further adjusting for age, gender, race, leukocyte count at presentation, AML cytogenetics, history of prior hematologic disorder, and assessing for comorbidities, not receiving IC was still associated with worse survival (hazards ratio of 1.88; 95% confidence interval, 1.15-3.05 [P = .01]). Additional predictors of poor outcomes in older adults with AML included higher leukocyte count at presentation, poor-risk cytogenetics, and African-American race (compared with Caucasians).

The ability to predict children at differing risk of TLS would be an early step toward risk-based approaches. The objectives of the current study were 1) to describe the prevalence and predictors of TLS in childhood ALL and 2) to develop a sensitive prediction rule to identify patients at lower risk of TLS. METHODS: Health records of children aged </=18 years who were diagnosed with ALL between 1998 and 2004 were reviewed. TLS was defined by the presence of >/=2 laboratory abnormalities occurring in the time frame of interest. Predictors of TLS were determined using univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Among 328 patients, 23% met criteria for TLS. Factors predictive of TLS were male sex (odds ratio [OR], 1.8; P = .041), age >/=10 years (OR, 4.5; P < .0001), splenomegaly (OR, 3.3; P < .0001), mediastinal mass (OR, 12.2; P < .0001), T-cell phenotype (OR, 8.2; P < .0001), central nervous system involvement (OR, 2.8; P = .026), lactate dehydrogenase >/=2000 U/L (OR, 7.6; P < .0001), and white blood count (WBC) >/=20 x 10(9)/L (OR, 4.7; P < .0001). Among variables that were available at presentation, multiple regression analysis identified age >/=10 years, splenomegaly, mediastinal mass, and initial WBC >/=20 x 10(9)/L as independent predictors of TLS. When all 4 of those predictors were absent at presentation (n = 114 patients), the negative predictive value of developing TLS was 97%, with a sensitivity of 95%. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical and laboratory features at the time of presentation identified a group of children with ALL at low risk for TLS that may benefit from a risk-stratified approach directed at reduced TLS monitoring and prophylaxis.","['Truong, Tony H', 'Beyene, Joseph', 'Hitzler, Johann', 'Abla, Oussama', 'Maloney, Anne Marie', 'Weitzman, Sheila', 'Sung, Lillian']","['Truong TH', 'Beyene J', 'Hitzler J', 'Abla O', 'Maloney AM', 'Weitzman S', 'Sung L']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', 'Tumor Lysis Syndrome/*diagnosis/prevention & control/therapy']",2007/08/29 09:00,2007/11/14 09:00,['2007/08/29 09:00'],"['2007/08/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/29 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 2007 Oct 15;110(8):1832-9. doi: 10.1002/cncr.22990.,['10.1002/cncr.22990 [doi]'],,"['Division of Hematology/Oncology, the Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we report the characterization of ARC on a panel of neuroblastoma cell lines. We found that these cell lines were more than 10-fold sensitive to ARC than to the well-known nucleoside analog DRB (5,6-dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole), and that ARC-induced apoptosis proceeds through mitochondrial injury. Also, we observed that ARC-mediated cell death was accompanied by caspase-3 cleavage and repression of antiapoptotic proteins such as Mcl-1 and survivin. Conversely, we found that overexpression of Mcl-1-protected neuroblastoma cell line NB-1691 from ARC-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, we found that while ARC inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt Ser-473 in multiple cancer cell lines, forced expression of myristoylated Akt promoted resistance to ARC-induced apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells. In addition, we observed that ARC was able to downregulate the protein levels of N-myc, a commonly amplified oncogene in neuroblastomas, and Akt protected N-myc from ARC-induced downregulation. These data suggest that ARC may antagonize different antiapoptotic pathways and induce apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells via multiple mechanisms. Overall, ARC could represent an attractive candidate for anticancer drug development against neuroblastomas.","['Radhakrishnan, S K', 'Halasi, M', 'Bhat, U G', 'Kurmasheva, R T', 'Houghton, P J', 'Gartel, A L']","['Radhakrishnan SK', 'Halasi M', 'Bhat UG', 'Kurmasheva RT', 'Houghton PJ', 'Gartel AL']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0', '(4-amino-6-hydrazino-7-beta-D-ribofuranosyl-7H-pyrrolo(2,3-d)-pyrimidine-5-carbox', 'amide)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nucleosides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Survivin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/metabolism', 'Mitochondria/drug effects', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Neuroblastoma/*pathology', 'Nucleosides/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Survivin', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2007/08/29 09:00,2008/04/23 09:00,['2007/08/29 09:00'],"['2007/08/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/23 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/29 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2008 Jan 24;27(5):694-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1210692.

To better understand how Bfl-1 functions, we investigated its interaction with proapoptotic multidomain proteins Bax and Bak, and the BH3-only proteins Bid and tBid. We demonstrate that in living cells Bfl-1 selectively interacts with Bak and tBid, but not with Bax or Bid. Bfl-1/Bak interaction is functional as Bfl-1 suppressed staurosporine (STS)-induced apoptosis in wild-type and Bax-deficient cells, but not in Bak-/- cells. We also show that Bfl-1 blocks tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha)-induced activation of Bax indirectly, via association with tBid. C-terminal deletion decreased Bfl-1's interaction with Bak and tBid and reduced its ability to suppress Bak- and tBid-mediated cell death. These data indicate that Bfl-1 utilizes different mechanisms to suppress apoptosis depending on the stimulus. Bfl-1 associates with tBid to prevent activation of proapoptotic Bax and Bak, and it also interacts directly with Bak to antagonize Bak-mediated cell death, similar to Mcl-1. Thus, part of the protective function of NF-kappaB is to induce Mcl-1-like activity by upregulating Bfl-1.","['Simmons, M J', 'Fan, G', 'Zong, W-X', 'Degenhardt, K', 'White, E', 'Gelinas, C']","['Simmons MJ', 'Fan G', 'Zong WX', 'Degenhardt K', 'White E', 'Gelinas C']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (BAK1 protein, human)', '0 (BCL2-related protein A1)', '0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/physiology', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism/*physiology', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",2007/08/29 09:00,2008/04/02 09:00,['2007/08/29 09:00'],"['2007/08/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/02 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/29 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2008 Feb 28;27(10):1421-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1210771.

Refined risk stratification is required to design prospective trials. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We stratified outcomes among patients with AML (n = 391) or MDS (n = 186) who received either nonmyeloablative (n = 125) or myeloablative (n = 452) allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) based on comorbidities, as assessed by a HCT-specific comorbidity index (HCT-CI), as well as disease status. Patients receiving nonmyeloablative conditioning were older, more frequently pretreated, more often received unrelated grafts, and more often had HCT-CI scores of 3 compared with patients who received myeloablative conditioning. RESULTS: Patients with HCT-CI scores of 0 to 2 and either low or high disease risks had probabilities of overall survival at 2 years of 70% and 57% after nonmyeloablative conditioning compared with 78% and 50% after myeloablative conditioning, respectively. Patients with HCT-CI scores of 3 and either low or high disease risks had probabilities of overall survival of 41% and 29% with nonmyeloablative conditioning compared with 45% and 24% with myeloablative regimens, respectively. After adjusting for pretransplantation differences, stratified outcomes were not significantly different among patients receiving nonmyeloablative compared with myeloablative conditioning, with the exception of lessened nonrelapse mortality (hazard ratio, 0.50; P = .05) in the highest risk group. CONCLUSION: Patients with low comorbidity scores could be candidates for prospective randomized trials comparing nonmyeloablative and myeloablative conditioning regardless of disease status. Additional data are required for patients with low-risk diseases and high comorbidity scores. Novel antitumor agents combined with nonmyeloablative HCT should be explored among patients with high comorbidity scores and advanced disease.","['Sorror, Mohamed L', 'Sandmaier, Brenda M', 'Storer, Barry E', 'Maris, Michael B', 'Baron, Frederic', 'Maloney, David G', 'Scott, Bart L', 'Deeg, H Joachim', 'Appelbaum, Frederick R', 'Storb, Rainer']","['Sorror ML', 'Sandmaier BM', 'Storer BE', 'Maris MB', 'Baron F', 'Maloney DG', 'Scott BL', 'Deeg HJ', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Storb R']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Comorbidity', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'HLA Antigens/metabolism', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neural Tube Defects/*complications/*therapy', '*Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2007/08/29 09:00,2007/10/10 09:00,['2007/08/29 09:00'],"['2007/08/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/29 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2007 Sep 20;25(27):4246-54. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2006.09.7865.

Recent studies have suggested that nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2)/caspase recruitment domain 15 (CARD15) gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), implicated in innate immunity and Crohn's disease, may also affect immune function post-HSCT. PATIENTS AND METHODS: NOD2/CARD15 genotypes were analyzed in 196 patients diagnosed with acute leukemia and their unrelated donors. The pairs are part of a previously well-characterized cohort with a median follow-up of 2.2 years (range, 0.42 to 6.61 years). T-cell depletion was used in 83% of pairs. RESULTS: NOD2/CARD15 SNPs were associated with a reduction in overall survival (44% v 22%; log-rank P = .0087) due to an increase in disease relapse (32% v 54%; Gray's test P = .001) as compared with wild-type pairs. In multivariate analyses, the two most significant factors impacting outcome were transplantation in relapse and the presence of SNPs. The incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease was low and there was no significant difference due to the presence of SNPs. CONCLUSION: These data indicate an unrecognized role for the NOD2/CARD15 gene in unrelated donor HSCT for acute leukemia. The increased risk of disease relapse suggests that the wild-type gene product may contribute to a graft-versus-leukemia effect. These data suggest that NOD2/CARD15 genotyping before transplantation may contribute to prognosis and influence clinical management.","['Mayor, Neema P', 'Shaw, Bronwen E', 'Hughes, Derralynn A', 'Maldonado-Torres, Hazael', 'Madrigal, J Alejandro', 'Keshav, Satish', 'Marsh, Steven G E']","['Mayor NP', 'Shaw BE', 'Hughes DA', 'Maldonado-Torres H', 'Madrigal JA', 'Keshav S', 'Marsh SG']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (NOD2 protein, human)', '0 (Nod2 Signaling Adaptor Protein)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'HLA Antigens/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nod2 Signaling Adaptor Protein/*genetics', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*mortality/*therapy', 'Recurrence']",2007/08/29 09:00,2007/10/10 09:00,['2007/08/29 09:00'],"['2007/08/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/29 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2007 Sep 20;25(27):4262-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2007.12.1897.

HSCs are divided into an active pool and a quiescent reserve. Cells selected for the active pool contribute to hematopoiesis for many years. Mutations in HSCs can lead to neoplasms such as chronic myeloid leukemia, although the risk of neoplastic HSC disorders varies across mammals. We use allometric scaling relations combined with mutation-selection evolutionary dynamics to determine which mammalian species is most resistant to HSC disorders. We find that the advantage of large mammals at escaping the selective pressure of cancer cells is insufficient to overcome the increased risk of acquiring mutations. Hence, mutation dominates, which favors smaller stem-cell pools and, consequently, smaller mammals, since these minimize the development of mutations in the active stem-cell pool. Consequently, the smaller the active stem-cell pools, the better.","['Lopes, Joao V', 'Pacheco, Jorge M', 'Dingli, David']","['Lopes JV', 'Pacheco JM', 'Dingli D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Animals', '*Biological Evolution', '*Body Size', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Hematopoiesis', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/etiology/genetics/metabolism', '*Mammals/genetics/metabolism', '*Models, Biological', 'Mutation']",2007/08/29 09:00,2007/12/27 09:00,['2007/08/29 09:00'],"['2007/08/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/27 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/29 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Dec 1;110(12):4120-2. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-05-089805.

METHODS The mortality data of cancer between 1994 and 2003 in an environmental crocidolite-contaminated area was obtained from hospital medical records of Dayao Center for Disease Prevention and Control, and Dayao Public Health Bureau. The years of life lost with premature death (YLLs), was used to measure and assess the death, health losses and social burden of cancer in this area. RESULTS: In the environmental crocidolite-contaminated area, lung cancer was the prime cause of death in all kinds of cancers between 1994 and 2003, followed by liver cancer, mesothelioma stomach cancer and colorectal cancer, with mortality 10.15/10(5), 9.04/10(5), 8.48/10(5), 3.96/10(5) and 3.55/10(5) respectively. The mortality of main cancer in male and female increased with age growing except that of breast cancer in female. Results showed that the types of leading cancers of YLLs were liver cancer, lung cancer, mesothelioma, leukemia and stomach cancer with YLLs 1981.39 person-year, 1886.63 person-year, 1799.23 person-year, 948.01 person-year and 754.18 person-year respectively. The distribution of YLLs was similar in both sexes, higher in the middle age group (aged from 15 to 44 years and 45 to 59 years) and lower in other age groups. The indirect economic loss resulting from lung cancer (15.02% of the total loss), liver cancer (13.98% of the total loss) and mesothelioma (13.01% of the total loss) was relatively great. The YLLs and the indirect economic loss attributable to environmental low-dose exposure to crocidolite were 3092.23 person-year and 5,175,800 Yuan respectively. CONCLUSION: Lung cancer, liver cancer, mesothelioma, leukemia and breast cancer are the major cancers with an important impact on people's health and premature mortality in the environmental crocidolite-contaminated area. The impact of cancer mortality is more severer in those aged over 45 years. Social burden of cancer is the greatest in persons aged from 15 to 59 years. Policies and plans should be worked out for the protection of environment and the prevention of cancer.","['Zou, Hua', 'Luo, Su-qiong', 'Yang, Chang-yue', 'Zhang, Mei-bian']","['Zou H', 'Luo SQ', 'Yang CY', 'Zhang MB']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Zhonghua Lao Dong Wei Sheng Zhi Ye Bing Za Zhi,Zhonghua lao dong wei sheng zhi ye bing za zhi = Zhonghua laodong weisheng zhiyebing zazhi = Chinese journal of industrial hygiene and occupational diseases,8410840,"['12001-28-4 (Asbestos, Crocidolite)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Asbestos, Crocidolite/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'China/epidemiology', 'Cost of Illness', '*Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Pollution/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Life Expectancy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Young Adult']",2007/08/29 09:00,2011/11/09 06:00,['2007/08/29 09:00'],"['2007/08/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/09 06:00 [medline]', '2007/08/29 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Zhonghua Lao Dong Wei Sheng Zhi Ye Bing Za Zhi. 2007 Jun;25(6):326-30.,,,"['Zhejiang Center for Disease Prevention and Control, Hangzhou 310009, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dissection of genetic abnormalities critical to leukemia initiation provides insights into the elusive leukemogenesis, identifies distinct subsets of leukemia and predicts prognosis individually, and can also provide rational therapeutic targets for curative approaches. The past three decades have seen tremendous advances in the analysis of genotype-phenotype connection of leukemia, and in the identification of molecular biomarkers for leukemia subtypes. Intriguingly, differentiation therapy, targeted therapy and chemotherapy have turned several subtypes of leukemia from highly fatal to highly curable. The use of all-trans retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide, which trigger degradation of PML-RARalpha, the causative fusion protein generated by t (15;17) translocation in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), has led to a dramatic improvement of APL clinical outcome. Imatinib mesylate/ Gleevec/STI571, which inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of BCR-ABL oncoprotein, has now become the new gold standard for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia. Optimal use of chemotherapeutic agents together with a stringent application of prognostic factors for risk-directed therapy in clinical trials has resulted in a steady improvement in the treatment outcome of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Hence, the pace of progress extrapolates to a prediction of leukemia control in the twenty-first century.","['Zhou, Guang-biao', 'Li, Guo', 'Chen, Sai-juan', 'Chen, Zhu']","['Zhou GB', 'Li G', 'Chen SJ', 'Chen Z']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Acta Pharmacol Sin,Acta pharmacologica Sinica,100956087,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/genetics/*physiopathology', 'Oxides/*therapeutic use', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Tretinoin/*therapeutic use']",2007/08/29 09:00,2009/05/05 09:00,['2007/08/29 09:00'],"['2007/08/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/29 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Acta Pharmacol Sin. 2007 Sep;28(9):1434-49. doi: 10.1111/j.1745-7254.2007.00684.x.,['10.1111/j.1745-7254.2007.00684.x [doi]'],,"['State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics and Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.']",,137,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specification and differentiation of these two cell layers are among the earliest events in heart development, but the embryonic origins and genetic regulation of early endocardial development remain largely undefined. We have analyzed early endocardial development in the zebrafish using time-lapse confocal microscopy and show that the endocardium seems to originate from a region in the lateral plate mesoderm that will give rise to hematopoietic cells of the primitive myeloid lineage. Endocardial precursors appear to rapidly migrate to the site of heart tube formation, where they arrive prior to the bilateral myocardial primordia. Analysis of a newly discovered zebrafish Scl/Tal1 mutant showed an additional and previously undescribed role of this transcription factor during the development of the endocardium. In Scl/Tal1 mutant embryos, endocardial precursors are specified, but migration is severely defective and endocardial cells aggregate at the ventricular pole of the heart. We further show that the initial fusion of the bilateral myocardial precursor populations occurs independently of the endocardium and tal1 function. Our results suggest early separation of the two components of the primitive heart tube and imply Scl/Tal1 as an indispensable component of the molecular hierarchy that controls endocardium morphogenesis.","['Bussmann, Jeroen', 'Bakkers, Jeroen', 'Schulte-Merker, Stefan']","['Bussmann J', 'Bakkers J', 'Schulte-Merker S']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS Genet,PLoS genetics,101239074,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Codon, Nonsense)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Zebrafish Proteins)', '0 (tal1 protein, zebrafish)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/genetics/*physiology', 'Codon, Nonsense', 'Embryo, Nonmammalian', 'Endocardium/*embryology/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Morphogenesis/*genetics', 'Myoblasts, Cardiac/cytology/metabolism', 'Phylogeny', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor/metabolism', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Zebrafish/embryology/genetics', 'Zebrafish Proteins/genetics/*physiology']",2007/08/29 09:00,2007/10/13 09:00,['2007/08/29 09:00'],"['2007/01/15 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/08/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/13 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/29 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,PLoS Genet. 2007 Aug;3(8):e140. doi: 10.1371/journal.pgen.0030140.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We have measured bone marrow microvessel density (MVD) in 43 myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients and in 10 subjects of group control--10 lymphoma patients (their bone marrow was free of disease). It was estimated by immunohistochemical method using anti-CD31 and anti-CD34 monoclonal antibodies. In 14 MDS patients and 6 healthy donors we also measured serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by immunoenzymatic method. RESULTS: Higher MVD numbers were found in MDS patients when compared to control bone marrows. The highest number of MVD was in RAEBt and CMML MDS subtypes according to FAB. There was no correlation between MVD and biological features of MDS patients except for the age (negative correlation). Bone marrow microvessel density does not influenced significantly on overall survival. The serum VEGF concentration in MDS patients was higher than in healthy donors, but the difference was not statistically significant. The VEGF levels did not correlate with MVD. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that angogenesis is enhanced in bone marrow MDS patients though its mechamism is not yet fully understood.","['Madry, Krzysztof', 'Dwilewicz-Trojaczek, Jadwiga', 'Suleiman, Wael', 'Paszkowska-Kowalewska, Malgorzata', 'Ziarkiewicz-Wroblewska, Bogna']","['Madry K', 'Dwilewicz-Trojaczek J', 'Suleiman W', 'Paszkowska-Kowalewska M', 'Ziarkiewicz-Wroblewska B']",['pol'],['Journal Article'],Poland,Pol Arch Med Wewn,Polskie Archiwum Medycyny Wewnetrznej,0401225,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/blood/pathology', 'Antigens, CD34/blood', 'Bone Marrow/*blood supply/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/blood/pathology', 'Male', 'Microcirculation/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/*pathology', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/blood/*pathology', 'Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/blood', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/*blood']",2007/08/29 09:00,2007/09/27 09:00,['2007/08/29 09:00'],"['2007/08/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/27 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/29 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pol Arch Med Wewn. 2007 Apr;117(4):25-30.,,,"['Kameda i Klinika Hematologii, Onkologii i Chorob Wewnetrznych, Samodzielny Publiczny Centralny Szpital Kliniczny, Akademia Medyczna, Warszawa. kmadry@amwaw.edu.pl']",,,,,,,,,Angiogeneza w szpiku kostnym u chorych na zespoly mielodysplastyczne.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro and clinical studies have indicated advantages when FLU and mitoxantrone (MTO) are applied in combination. To further enhance this effect, these two agents were coencapsulated in liposomes. FLU was passively encapsulated during liposome formation, and MTO was loaded with a transmembrane pH gradient. Entrapment efficiency, particle size, stability, and drug release kinetics were characterized. In vitro cytotoxicity study was carried out in two representative B-cell lines: Wac3CD5 and Raji. Synergism as measured by combination index (CI) was observed in cells treated with liposomes coencapsulating FLU and MTO. Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) analysis further confirmed that coencapsulated FLU and MTO improved the percentage of apoptosis among primary CLL cells.

HTLV-I infection causes the T-cell dysfunction, which contributes to the immunodeficient state of the patients. Programmed death-1 (PD-1) can negatively regulate T-cell response, when its ligand, PD-L1 or PD-L2 mainly expressed on antigen presenting cells, binds to this B7 family receptor. We investigated whether PD-1 is expressed on CD4(+) neoplastic (and/or non-neoplastic) cells or CD8(+) cytotoxic cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 11 patients with ATL. By flow cytometry, we found that the levels of PD-1 expression on both CD4(+)CD25(+) and CD4(+)CD25(-) T-cell populations were increased in ATL patients compared to normal healthy volunteers, while PD-1 levels on CD8(+) T-cells were comparable between the patients and normal subjects. In stimulation with anti-CD3 antibody, the proliferation of PD-1-expressing T-cells from ATL patients was weak when compared to that of PD-1-nonexpressing normal T-cells. In addition to PD-1, PD-L1 was coexpressed on ATL cells in some patients, and PD-L1 expression was enhanced by stimulation with anti-CD3 antibody. Finally, the production of cytokines such as TNF-alpha by ATL cells was restored by blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 interaction. These findings suggest that CD4(+) T-cells are the main PD-1-expressing cells rather than CD8(+) T-cells in ATL patients, and both neoplastic and normal CD4(+) cells are exhausted as a result of PD-1 expression, and additionally PD-L1 expression on the neoplastic cell.","['Shimauchi, Takatoshi', 'Kabashima, Kenji', 'Nakashima, Daiki', 'Sugita, Kazunari', 'Yamada, Yoko', 'Hino, Ryosuke', 'Tokura, Yoshiki']","['Shimauchi T', 'Kabashima K', 'Nakashima D', 'Sugita K', 'Yamada Y', 'Hino R', 'Tokura Y']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PDCD1 protein, human)', '0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*metabolism', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit/metabolism', 'Japan', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor', 'Up-Regulation']",2007/08/28 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2007/08/28 09:00'],"['2007/08/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/28 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2007 Dec 15;121(12):2585-90. doi: 10.1002/ijc.23042.,['10.1002/ijc.23042 [doi]'],"['(c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['Department of Dermatology, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, Japan, Kitakyusyu, Fukuoka, Japan. t-shima@med.uoeh-u.ac.jp']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CAM-DR (cell adhesion-mediated drug resistance) is a reversible, de novo drug resistance induced by adhesion of tumour cell lines to fibronectin (FN). Adhesion was demonstrated to directly regulate the apoptotic machinery. And it was observed in previous studies that high levels of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) were related to resistance to chemotherapeutics in many cancer cell lines. However, whether XIAP is relevant to CAM-DR of AML cells is unknown. In this report, we demonstrated that the mRNA and protein levels of XIAP were increased by 96.15% and 120.92%, respectively in U937 cells cocultured with FN as compared with controls. Antisense oligonucleotides targeting XIAP down-regulated the expression of XIAP and sensitized U937 cells to daunorubicin. In addition, we investigated the signalling pathway involved in the upregulation of XIAP. The levels of phosphorylated Akt (Ser473) were elevated in U937/FN cells and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 suppressed XIAP expression and restored the chemosensitivity to daunorubicin. Our findings suggested that adhesion-dependent activation of the PI3K/Akt/XIAP pathway may be one of the factors involved in the CAM-DR of U937 cells. Targeting this pathway may be a useful approach to improve the therapeutic responsiveness of leukaemia cells.","['Wang, Xiaofang', 'Wang, Chun', 'Qin, You-wen', 'Yan, Shi-ke', 'Gao, Yan-rong']","['Wang X', 'Wang C', 'Qin YW', 'Yan SK', 'Gao YR']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,"['0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XIAP protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['*Cell Adhesion', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fibronectins/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'U937 Cells', 'Up-Regulation', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/*genetics/physiology']",2007/08/28 09:00,2008/05/07 09:00,['2007/08/28 09:00'],"['2007/08/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/28 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2008 Mar;26(1):21-6. doi: 10.1002/hon.828.,['10.1002/hon.828 [doi]'],,"['Department of Hematology, Cancer Hospital of Tianjin, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin 300060, P.R.

Our aim was to identify at the time of admission, clinical and laboratory variables differing significantly among children who survived or died during a FN episode. METHODS: In a prospective, multicenter study, children admitted with a high-risk FN episode were uniformly evaluated at enrollment and managed according to a national consensus protocol. Medical charts of children who died were evaluated to determine whether the death could be associated with an infection. Admission clinical and laboratory variables significantly associated with death were identified. RESULTS: A total of 393 (70%) of 561 FN episodes evaluated from June 2004 to December 2005 were classified as high risk for invasive bacterial infection, of which 14 (3.6%) resulted in an infectious-related death. Deaths occurred from 2 to 27 days after admission, and most dying children were admitted with relapse of acute lymphocytic leukemia (36%), hypotension (71%), and a diagnosis of sepsis (79%), compared with surviving children (16%, 20%, and 5% respectively, P < 0.001). Children who died were admitted with lower absolute neutrophil count (P < 0.001) and absolute monocytes count levels (P = 0.008), higher blood urinary nitrogen (P = 0.03) and C-reactive protein values (P < 0.001), and had more positive cultures (79% versus 32%, P = 0.008).

A consensus, however, has not yet been reached as to the optimal method of evaluating ErbB2 status. Immunohistochemistry to detect protein overexpression and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to detect ErbB2 gene amplification are the most frequently used methods. As no one detection method fulfills all necessary requirements of reliability, reproducibility, and ease of use, we developed a novel approach in the form of a simple assay we refer to as protein and gene double staining (PGDS) which simultaneously evaluates protein overexpression and gene amplification by combining immunohistochemistry with chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH). A total of 134 invasive breast carcinomas, including 81 cases with a full-face section and 53 cases included in a tissue microarray (TMA), were assessed by PGDS, and the results were correlated with ErbB2 gene amplification status as determined by FISH. ErbB2 gene copy number determined by CISH analysis in the PGDS assay showed excellent concordance with that of FISH (correlation coefficient 0.82; P<0.001 with full-face section cases, and 0.98; P<0.001 with cases in a TMA). The overall concordance rate for gene amplification status between PGDS and FISH was 90.12% in cases with a full-face section and 92.45% with TMA cases. Perfect correlation was seen between the PGDS assay and FISH in cases that were considered either nonamplified or highly amplified by the dual assay. Of the 17 cases that showed low amplification by PGDS, 5 were classified as nonamplified by FISH. Correction for chromosome 17 copy number in the FISH assessment contributed to the discordance between CISH and FISH results. This newly developed PGDS method represents a novel approach to ErbB2 status determination that combines the assessment of both protein overexpression and gene amplification in one simple assay. It is likely that this assay will aid in immunohistochemical calibration and will also increase the sensitivity and specificity of ErbB2 testing.","['Ni, Ruoyu', 'Mulligan, Anna Marie', 'Have, Cherry', ""O'Malley, Frances P""]","['Ni R', 'Mulligan AM', 'Have C', ""O'Malley FP""]",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol,Applied immunohistochemistry & molecular morphology : AIMM,100888796,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)']",IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Carcinoma/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Female', 'Gene Amplification', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry/*methods', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/*analysis/genetics/metabolism']",2007/08/28 09:00,2007/11/08 09:00,['2007/08/28 09:00'],"['2007/08/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/08 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/28 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol. 2007 Sep;15(3):316-24. doi: 10.1097/01.pai.0000213138.01536.2e.,"['10.1097/01.pai.0000213138.01536.2e [doi]', '00129039-200709000-00014 [pii]']",,"['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, ON, Canada.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The main mechanism of microRNoma (defined as the full complement of microRNAs present in a genome) alteration in cancer cell seems to result in aberrant gene expression characterized by abnormal levels of expression for mature and/or precursor miRNA sequences in comparison with the corresponding normal tissues. Loss or amplification of miRNA genes has been reported in a variety of cancers, and altered patterns of miRNA expression may affect cell cycle and survival programs. The causes of the widespread differential expression of miRNA genes between malignant and normal cells can be explained by the genomic location of these genes in cancer-associated genomic regions, by epigenetic mechanisms as well as by alterations of members of the processing machinery. Germline and somatic mutations in miRNAs or polymorphisms in the mRNAs targeted by miRNAs may also contribute to cancer predisposition and progression. miRNAs expression profiling has been exploited to identify miRNAs potentially involved in the pathogenesis of human cancers and has allowed the identification of signatures associated with diagnosis, staging, progression, prognosis, and response to treatment of human tumors.

We have shown that human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) exposed to PM(10) produce pro-inflammatory mediators that contribute to a local and systemic inflammatory response. Changes in intracellular calcium concentrations ([Ca(2+)](i)) have been demonstrated to regulate several functions of the airway epithelium including the production of pro-inflammatory mediators. The aim of the present study was to determine the nature and mechanism of calcium responses induced by PM(10) in HBECs and its relationship to cytokine synthesis. METHODS: Primary HBECs were exposed to urban air pollution particles (EHC-93) and [Ca(2+)](i) responses were measured using the fluoroprobe (Fura-2). Cytokine levels were measured at mRNA and protein levels using real-time PCR and ELISA. RESULTS: PM(10) increased [Ca(2+)](i) in a dose-dependent manner. This calcium response was reduced by blocking the influx of calcium into cells (i.e. calcium-free medium, NiCl(2), LaCl(3)). PM(10) also decreased the activity of calcium pumps. PM(10) increased the production of IL-1beta, IL-8, GM-CSF and LIF. Preincubation with intracellular calcium chelator (BAPTA-AM) attenuated IL-1beta and IL-8 production, but not GM-CSF and LIF production. CONCLUSION: We conclude that exposure to PM(10) induces an increase in cytosolic calcium and cytokine production in bronchial epithelial cells. Our results also suggest that PM(10) induces the production of pro-inflammatory mediators via either intracellular calcium-dependent (IL-1beta, IL-8) or -independent (GM-CSF, LIF) pathways.","['Sakamoto, Noriho', 'Hayashi, Shizu', 'Gosselink, John', 'Ishii, Hiroshi', 'Ishimatsu, Yuji', 'Mukae, Hiroshi', 'Hogg, James C', 'van Eeden, Stephan F']","['Sakamoto N', 'Hayashi S', 'Gosselink J', 'Ishii H', 'Ishimatsu Y', 'Mukae H', 'Hogg JC', 'van Eeden SF']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,0416575,"['0 (Air Pollutants)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Inflammation Mediators)', '0 (Interleukin-1beta)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'TSN3DL106G (Fura-2)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Air Pollutants/chemistry/*toxicity', 'Bronchi/cytology/immunology', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis/*drug effects', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Epithelial Cells/drug effects/immunology', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Fura-2', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Inflammation Mediators/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-1beta/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Interleukin-8/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Particle Size', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2007/08/28 09:00,2008/01/04 09:00,['2007/08/28 09:00'],"['2007/07/06 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/08/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/04 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/28 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol. 2007 Dec 1;225(2):134-41. doi: 10.1016/j.taap.2007.07.006.

However, drug resistance often occurs at later stages of the disease, principally because of the occurrence of mutations in the kinase domain. Second generation Bcr-AbI inhibitors, such as dasatinib and nilotinib are capable of inhibiting many imatinib-resistant forms of the kinase but not the form in which threonine is mutated to isoleucine at the gatekeeper position (T315I). In this study, we present the crystal structure of the kinase domain of the c-AbI T315I mutant, as well as the wild-type form, in complex with a pyrrolopyridine inhibitor, PPY-A. The side chain of Ile315 is accommodated in the AbI T315I mutant structure without large conformational changes proximal to the site of mutation. In contrast to other inhibitors, such as imatinib and dasatinib, PPY-A does not occupy the hydrophobic pocket behind the gatekeeper residue. This binding mode, coupled with augmented contacts with the glycine-rich loop, appears to be critical for its ability to override the T315I mutation. The data presented here may provide structural guidance for the design of clinically useful inhibitors of Bcr-AbI T315I.","['Zhou, Tianjun', 'Parillon, Lois', 'Li, Feng', 'Wang, Yihan', 'Keats, Jeff', 'Lamore, Sarah', 'Xu, Qihong', 'Shakespeare, William', 'Dalgarno, David', 'Zhu, Xiaotian']","['Zhou T', 'Parillon L', 'Li F', 'Wang Y', 'Keats J', 'Lamore S', 'Xu Q', 'Shakespeare W', 'Dalgarno D', 'Zhu X']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Chem Biol Drug Des,Chemical biology & drug design,101262549,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridines)', '2ZD004190S (Threonine)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)', 'NH9L3PP67S (pyridine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/chemistry', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pyridines/chemistry', 'Structural Homology, Protein', 'Threonine/genetics/*metabolism']",2007/08/28 09:00,2007/10/20 09:00,['2007/08/28 09:00'],"['2007/08/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/20 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/28 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Drug Des. 2007 Sep;70(3):171-81. doi: 10.1111/j.1747-0285.2007.00556.x.,"['JPP556 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1747-0285.2007.00556.x [doi]']",,"['ARIAD Pharmaceuticals Inc, 26 Landsdowne St., Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.']",,,,,,,,"['PDB/2QOH', 'PDB/2Z60']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The BHES report submission, which ultimately found no link between exposure and the excess morbidity, coincided with OSHA's planned hearings over a new regulatory standard for benzene.

RESULTS: Individuals with any type of allergy have a decreased risk for cancer (compared with the general population), including glioma, colorectal cancer, cancer of the larynx, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, cancer of the esophagus, oral cancer, pancreatic cancer, stomach cancer, and uterine body cancer. However, an increased risk for bladder cancer, lymphoma, myeloma, and prostate cancer exists among those with allergies. Studies that involve breast cancer, leukemia, lung cancer, melanoma, and thyroid cancer have shown no association or conflicting results related to allergies. More research is needed before conclusions can be made about the relation between allergies and Kaposi sarcoma, liver cancer, and cancer of the ovaries. CONCLUSIONS: The association between allergies and cancer is site specific. Further research is needed to verify these results and to determine why such associations exist.","['Merrill, Ray M', 'Isakson, Ryan T', 'Beck, Robert E']","['Merrill RM', 'Isakson RT', 'Beck RE']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",United States,Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol,"Annals of allergy, asthma & immunology : official publication of the American College of Allergy, Asthma, & Immunology",9503580,,IM,"['Asthma/complications', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Global Health', 'Humans', 'Hypersensitivity/*complications', 'Lymphoma/epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology', 'Rhinitis, Allergic, Seasonal/complications', 'Risk Factors', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology']",2007/08/28 09:00,2007/09/22 09:00,['2007/08/28 09:00'],"['2007/08/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/28 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,"Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol. 2007 Aug;99(2):102-16; quiz 117-9, 150. doi: 10.1016/S1081-1206(10)60632-1.","['S1081-1206(10)60632-1 [pii]', '10.1016/S1081-1206(10)60632-1 [doi]']",,"['Department of Health Science, College of Health and Human Performance, Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah 84602, USA.

Abrogation of this process is commonly linked to cancer, and rapid detection of apoptosis in vitro is vital to the discovery of new anti-cancer drugs. In this paper, we describe the application of the electrical phenomenon dielectrophoresis for detecting apoptosis at very early stages after drug induction, on the basis of changes in electrophysiological properties. Our studies have revealed that K562 (human myelogenous leukemia) cells show a persistent elevation in the cytoplasmic conductivity occurring as early as 30 minutes following exposure to staurosporine. This method therefore allows a far more rapid detection method than existing biochemical marker methods.","['Chin, Sue', 'Hughes, Michael P', 'Coley, Helen M', 'Labeed, Fatima H']","['Chin S', 'Hughes MP', 'Coley HM', 'Labeed FH']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",New Zealand,Int J Nanomedicine,International journal of nanomedicine,101263847,['H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)'],IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Electrophoresis/*methods', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Staurosporine/*administration & dosage']",2007/08/28 09:00,2007/09/20 09:00,['2007/08/28 09:00'],"['2007/08/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/20 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/28 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Nanomedicine. 2006;1(3):333-7.,,,"['Centre for Biomedical Engineering, School of Engineering, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey, UK.']",,,,,,,PMC2426800,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

About 4000 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are diagnosed very year in the US and many more through out the world. The majority of these cases are in children and young adults, making ALL the most common form of malignancy in these age groups. The treatment protocols of ALL are complex and use 6-12 drugs. Consequently, the improvement in the protocol design has improved significantly the success rate for long-term event-free survival in the past 20-30 years, which is now approximately 75% for patients afflicted with the higher risk ALL features and just above this percentage for patients with standard or good features. Despite this success, approximately 15% of patients die from ALL, making leukemic relapse the most common cause of treatment failure in pediatric oncology. ASNases have been the cornerstone of ALL therapies since the late 1970s. Native or pegylated L-asparaginase (ASNase or PEG-ASNase) are highly specific for the deamination of L-asparagine (Asn) to aspartic acid and ammonia. Depletion of Asn leads to a nutritional deprivation and inhibition of protein biosynthesis, resulting in apoptosis in T-lymphoblastic leukemias, which require Asn from external sources. The reactions of the host exposed to repeated ASNase treatments as well as the up-regulation of the mammalian enzymes to overcome the ASN-depletion toxic condition are of significant importance and may make us relearn the lessons on this important antileukemic drug.","['Avramis, Vassilios I', 'Tiwari, Prakash Nidhi']","['Avramis VI', 'Tiwari PN']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",New Zealand,Int J Nanomedicine,International journal of nanomedicine,101263847,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/chemistry/pharmacokinetics', 'Asparaginase/*administration & dosage/chemistry/*pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Carriers/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Polyethylene Glycols/*chemistry', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*metabolism']",2007/08/28 09:00,2007/09/20 09:00,['2007/08/28 09:00'],"['2007/08/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/20 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/28 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Nanomedicine. 2006;1(3):241-54.,,,"['CHLA, Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Keck School of Medicine, Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90027, USA. vavramis@chla.usc.edu']",,45,,,,,PMC2426805,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: MR2 cells were treated with celecoxib at different concentrations (0, 20, 40, 80, 120 and 160 micromol/L). The proliferation of MR2 cells was observed by MTT assay and apoptosis was detected by DNA fragmentation analysis and flow cytometry with Annexin V-FITCiPI staining. The expression of survivin and PML/RARalpha mRNA was examined by RT-PCR and nested-PCR, and the protein expression of caspase-3, 9 and PARP was analyzed by Western-blot. RESULTS: After treatment with celecoxib the viability of MR2 cells decreased markedly in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and a DNA ladder pattern of internucleosomal fragmentation was observed. The translocation of phosphatidylserine at the outer surface of the cell plasma membrane was induced by celecoxib and its level increased following the augmentation of the drug concentration. The expression of survivin mRNA decreased dramatically while no significant change with PML/RARalpha. Treatment with celecoxib for 24 h resulted in the activation of caspase-3 and 9, cleavage of PARP. CONCLUSION: Celecoxib could inhibit MR2 cell proliferation by inducing apoptosis, which might be mediated by the caspase-3 and 9 activation and PARP cleavage. Moreover, the down-regulation of survivin may play a certain role in apoptosis of MR2 cells induced by celecoxib.","['Xu, Yun', 'Zhao, Yan-min', 'Huang, He']","['Xu Y', 'Zhao YM', 'Huang H']",['chi'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhejiang Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,Zhejiang da xue xue bao.

Expression of chimeric antigen receptors in effector cells operative in ADCC might allow to bypass insufficient activation via FcgammaRIII and other resistance mechanisms that limit natural killer (NK)-cell activity. Here we have generated genetically modified NK cells carrying a chimeric antigen receptor that consists of a CD20-specific scFv antibody fragment, via a flexible hinge region connected to the CD3zeta chain as a signaling moiety. As effector cells we employed continuously growing, clinically applicable human NK-92 cells. While activity of the retargeted NK-92 against CD20-negative targets remained unchanged, the gene modified NK cells displayed markedly enhanced cytotoxicity toward NK-sensitive CD20 expressing cells. Importantly, in contrast to parental NK-92, CD20-specific NK cells efficiently lysed CD20 expressing but otherwise NK-resistant established and primary lymphoma and leukemia cells, demonstrating that this strategy can overcome NK-cell resistance and might be suitable for the development of effective cell-based therapeutics for the treatment of B-cell malignancies.","['Muller, Tina', 'Uherek, Christoph', 'Maki, Guitta', 'Chow, Kai Uwe', 'Schimpf, Annemarie', 'Klingemann, Hans-Georg', 'Tonn, Torsten', 'Wels, Winfried S']","['Muller T', 'Uherek C', 'Maki G', 'Chow KU', 'Schimpf A', 'Klingemann HG', 'Tonn T', 'Wels WS']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD20/*immunology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/genetics/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*immunology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2007/08/25 09:00,2008/08/30 09:00,['2007/08/25 09:00'],"['2006/07/19 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/08/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/25 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2008 Mar;57(3):411-23. doi: 10.1007/s00262-007-0383-3.

Population controls (N=579) were drawn from the National Birth Registry. Interviews of parents were conducted using conventional and icon-based calendar forms. An exposure model was constructed for 25 pesticides in five time periods. RESULTS: Mothers' exposures to any pesticides during the year before conception and during the first and second trimesters were associated with the risk [odds ratio (OR) 2.4, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.0-5.9; OR 22, 95% CI 2.8-171.5; OR 4.5, 95% CI 1.4-14.7, respectively] and during anytime (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.0-4.8).

Altogether, these results highlight the therapeutic relevance of rescuing PP2A tumor suppressor activity in Ph1 leukemias and strongly support the introduction of the PP2A activator FTY720 in the treatment of CML-BC and Ph1 ALL patients.","['Neviani, Paolo', 'Santhanam, Ramasamy', 'Oaks, Joshua J', 'Eiring, Anna M', 'Notari, Mario', 'Blaser, Bradley W', 'Liu, Shujun', 'Trotta, Rossana', 'Muthusamy, Natarajan', 'Gambacorti-Passerini, Carlo', 'Druker, Brian J', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Chen, Ching-Shih', 'Verrills, Nicole M', 'Roy, Denis C', 'Caligiuri, Michael A', 'Bloomfield, Clara D', 'Byrd, John C', 'Perrotti, Danilo']","['Neviani P', 'Santhanam R', 'Oaks JJ', 'Eiring AM', 'Notari M', 'Blaser BW', 'Liu S', 'Trotta R', 'Muthusamy N', 'Gambacorti-Passerini C', 'Druker BJ', 'Cortes J', 'Marcucci G', 'Chen CS', 'Verrills NM', 'Roy DC', 'Caligiuri MA', 'Bloomfield CD', 'Byrd JC', 'Perrotti D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Propylene Glycols)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 2)', 'G926EC510T (Fingolimod Hydrochloride)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzamides', 'Blast Crisis/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dasatinib', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Fingolimod Hydrochloride', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Structure', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Propylene Glycols/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Phosphatase 2', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sphingosine/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/therapeutic use', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2007/08/25 09:00,2007/10/24 09:00,['2007/08/25 09:00'],"['2006/11/29 00:00 [received]', '2007/06/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/08/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/24 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/25 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2007 Sep;117(9):2408-21. doi: 10.1172/JCI31095.,['10.1172/JCI31095 [doi]'],,"['Human Cancer Genetics Program, Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology and Medical Genetics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.']","['CA16058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA101140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA095512/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA101140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA095512/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,PMC1950458,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Making use of ES cells expressing a granulocyte colony-stimulating factor:gp130 chimeric receptor and a hormone-dependent signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 estrogen receptor (STAT3-ER(T2)), we showed that expression of pim-1 and pim-3 was upregulated by LIF/gp130-dependent signaling and the STAT3 transcription factor. ES cells overexpressing pim-1 and pim-3 had a greater capacity to self-renew and displayed a greater resistance to LIF starvation based on a clonal assay. In contrast, knockdown of pim-1 and pim-3 increased the rate of spontaneous differentiation in a self-renewal assay. Knockdown of pim-1 and pim-3 was also detrimental to the growth of undifferentiated ES cell colonies and increased the rate of apoptosis.

We previously developed a simple, defined, serum-free culture medium that contains leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) for propagating pluripotent mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells in the absence of feeder cells. In this study, we determined the effects of ECM components as culture substrata on mES cell self-renewal in this culture medium, comparing conventional culture conditions that contain serum and LIF with gelatin as a culture substratum. mES cells remained undifferentiated when cultured on type I and type IV collagen or poly-D-lysine. However, they differentiated when cultured on laminin or fibronectin as indicated by altered morphologies, the activity of alkaline phosphatase decreased, Fgf5 expression increased, and Nanog and stage-specific embryonic antigen 1 expression decreased. Under these conditions, the activity of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3 and Akt/protein kinase B (PKB), which maintain cell self-renewal, decreased. In contrast, the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 activity, which negatively controls cell self-renewal, increased. In the defined conditions, mES cells did not express collagen-binding integrin subunits, but they expressed laminin- and fibronectin-binding integrin subunits. The expression of some collagen-binding integrin subunits was downregulated in an LIF concentration-dependent manner. Blocking the interactions between ECM and integrins inhibited this differentiation. Conversely, the stimulation of ECM-integrin interactions by overexpressing collagen-binding integrin subunits induced differentiation of mES cells cultured on type I collagen. The results of the study indicated that inactivation of the integrin signaling is crucial in promoting mouse embryonic stem cell self-renewal.

Specifically, long-term engraftment potential predominantly resides in the quiescent HSC subfraction, and G-CSF mobilization results in the preferential accumulation of quiescent HSC in the periphery. In contrast, stem cells from chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients display a constitutive presence in the circulation. To understand the molecular basis for this, we have used microarray technology to analyze the transcriptional differences between dividing and quiescent, normal, and CML-derived CD34+ cells. Our data show a remarkable transcriptional similarity between normal and CML dividing cells, suggesting that the effects of BCR-ABL on the CD34+ cell transcriptome are more limited than previously thought. In addition, we show that quiescent CML cells are more similar to their dividing counterparts than quiescent normal cells are to theirs. We also show these transcriptional differences to be reflected in the altered proliferative activity of normal and CML CD34+ cells. Of the most interest is that the major class of genes that is more abundant in the quiescent cells compared with the dividing cells encodes members of the chemokine family. We propose a role for chemokines expressed by quiescent HSC in the orchestration of CD34+ cell mobilization.

However, for the relatively small numbers of patients with relapsed or primary progressive disease, outcomes are not optimal. It is now recognized that high dose chemotherapy and autoSCT may be curative in a proportion of these patients. Nevertheless, survival even following autoSCT remains unsatisfactory, with relapse remaining the major concern. In particular, patients with primary progressive disease, those who fail to respond to salvage therapy, and those who are ineligible for autoSCT carry a relatively poor prognosis. In these groups of patients, clinical trials are examining tandem autologous stem cell transplantation or reduced intensity allogeneic transplantation. The latter procedure is promising in terms of its relatively low toxicities and its possibility of inciting a Graft-versus-Hodgkin Lymphoma effect.

The aim of this study was to determine and compare Procalcitonin with other inflammatory markers in the serum of immunosuppressed children with haematological malignancies; and to assess the predictive value of these mediators in distinguishing between bacterial and non-bacterial infection. METHODS & RESULTS: The study included 37 children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia undergoing intensive chemotherapy. They were divided into 3 groups, A, B and C. Group A consisted of 29 neutropenic children with 94 febrile episodes, group B of 20 neutropenic children with 56 afebrile episodes and group C of 13 non-neutropenic children with 58 afebrile episodes. Serial serum levels of PCT, C-Reactive Protein, Neopterin, Interleukin-6 and NO2/NO3 were all determined on a day-to-day basis for 7 consecutive days. In serum the concentrations of CRP was determined by nephelometry, of PCT by immunoluminescence and of Neopterin, IL-6 and NO2/NO3 by ELISA method. CONCLUSIONS: According to our results the Procalcitonin concentration increased rapidly in patients with microbial infection; the response was detectable within 24 hs of the onset of fever due to microbial infections. Procalcitonin is a specific and sensitive marker of microbial infection in patients with neutropenic fever. The markers, C-Reactive Protein, Interleukin-6 and NO2/NO3 may not help to identify infections and distinguish the etiology of infection in neutropenic febrile children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.","['Hatzistilianou, M', 'Rekleity, A', 'Athanassiadou, F', 'DeLutiis, M A', 'Conti, P', 'Catriu, D']","['Hatzistilianou M', 'Rekleity A', 'Athanassiadou F', 'DeLutiis MA', 'Conti P', 'Catriu D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Canada,Clin Invest Med,Clinical and investigative medicine.

Constitutively active CXCR4 variants bound higher levels of NPM than the wild-type receptor, which was reversed by T140, an inverse agonist. NPM binding to CXCR4 localized interactions to the C terminus and cytoplasmic loop (CL)-3, but not CL-1 or CL-2. Alanine scanning mutagenesis demonstrated that positively charged amino acids in CL-3 were critical for NPM binding. Recombinant NPM decreased GTP binding in membrane fractions after activation of CXCR4 by CXCL12. Suppression of NPM expression enhanced chemotactic responses to CXCL12, and, conversely, overexpression of a cytosolic NPM mutant reduced chemotaxis induced by CXCL12. This study provides evidence for a novel role for NPM as a negative regulator of CXCR4 signaling induced by CXCL12 that may be relevant to the biology of AML.","['Zhang, Wenbo', 'Navenot, Jean-Marc', 'Frilot, Nicole M', 'Fujii, Nobutaka', 'Peiper, Stephen C']","['Zhang W', 'Navenot JM', 'Frilot NM', 'Fujii N', 'Peiper SC']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', '*Chemotaxis', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', 'Protein Interaction Mapping', 'Receptors, CXCR4/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism']",2007/08/24 09:00,2007/12/14 09:00,['2007/08/24 09:00'],"['2007/08/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2007 Nov;72(5):1310-21. doi: 10.1124/mol.107.037119.

We present the general use of the bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) technology to quantitatively study the pharmacology and signaling properties of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) superfamily. RTK BRET-2 assays monitor, in living cells, the specific interaction between RTKs and their effector proteins, which control the activation of specific downstream signaling pathways. A total of 22 BRET assays have been established for nine RTKs derived from four subfamilies [erythroblastic leukemia viral (v-erb-b) oncogene homolog (ErbB), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor (TRK), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)] monitoring the interactions with five effectors (Grb2, p85, Stat5a, Shc46, PLCgamma1). These interactions are dependent on the RTK kinase activity and autophosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues in the carboxyl terminus. RTK BRET assays are highly sensitive for quantifying ligand-independent (constitutive), agonist-induced, or antagonist-inhibited RTK activity levels. We studied the signaling properties of the PDGF receptor, alpha polypeptide (PDGFRA) isoforms (V561D; D842V and delta842-845) carrying activating mutations identified in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). All three PDGFRA isoforms are fully constitutively activated, insensitive to the growth factor PDGF-BB, but show differential sensitivity of their constitutive activity to be inhibited by the inhibitor imatinib (Gleevec). Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) BRET structure-function studies identify the tyrosine residues 1068, 1114, and 1148 as the main residues mediating the interaction of EGFR with the adapter protein Grb2. The BRET technology provides an assay platform to study signaling pathway-specific RTK structure-function and will facilitate drug discovery efforts for the identification of novel RTK modulators.","['Tan, Philip K', 'Wang, Jean', 'Littler, Pey-Lih H', 'Wong, Kenneth K', 'Sweetnam, Timothy A', 'Keefe, William', 'Nash, Norman R', 'Reding, Esther C', 'Piu, Fabrice', 'Brann, Mark R', 'Schiffer, Hans H']","['Tan PK', 'Wang J', 'Littler PL', 'Wong KK', 'Sweetnam TA', 'Keefe W', 'Nash NR', 'Reding EC', 'Piu F', 'Brann MR', 'Schiffer HH']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/analysis/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer/*methods', 'Humans', 'Luminescent Proteins/analysis/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding/physiology', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/analysis/*metabolism', 'Renilla']",2007/08/24 09:00,2008/01/05 09:00,['2007/08/24 09:00'],"['2007/08/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2007 Dec;72(6):1440-6. doi: 10.1124/mol.107.039636.

We defined the functional significance of an intronic splicing enhancer, UGCAUG, and its cognate splicing factor, mFox2A, on exon 16 splicing during differentiation. UGCAUG displays cell-type-specific splicing regulation in a test neutral reporter and has a dose-dependent enhancing effect. Erythroid cells express 2 UGCAUG-binding mFox-2 isoforms, an erythroid differentiation-inducible mFox-2A and a commonly expressed mFox-2F. When overexpressed, both enhanced internal exon splicing in an UGCAUG-dependent manner, with mFox-2A exerting a much stronger effect than mFox-2F. A significant reciprocal increase in mFox-2A and decrease in mFox-2F occurred during erythroid differentiation and correlated with exon 16 inclusion. Furthermore, isoform-specific expression reduction reversed mFox-2A-enhancing activity, but not that of mFox-2F on exon 16 inclusion. Our results suggest that an erythroid differentiation-inducible mFox-2A isoform is a critical regulator of the differentiation-specific exon 16 splicing switch, and that its up-regulation in late erythroid differentiation is vital for exon 16 splicing.","['Yang, Guang', 'Huang, Shu-Ching', 'Wu, Jane Y', 'Benz, Edward J Jr']","['Yang G', 'Huang SC', 'Wu JY', 'Benz EJ Jr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (Epb41 protein, mouse)', '0 (FOXA2 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Microfilament Proteins)', '0 (RNA Precursors)', '0 (erythrocyte membrane band 4.1 protein)', '135845-92-0 (Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 3-beta)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Proteins/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/*genetics', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Erythroid Cells/*cytology', 'Exons/genetics', 'HeLa Cells', 'Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 3-beta/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Introns/genetics', 'Isomerism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Microfilament Proteins', 'Mutagenesis', 'RNA Precursors/metabolism', 'RNA Splicing/*physiology']",2007/08/24 09:00,2008/02/19 09:00,['2007/08/24 09:00'],"['2007/08/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Jan 1;111(1):392-401. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-01-068940.

Patients had at least 6 months of follow-up and were evaluated for hematologic and cytogenetic responses, as well as for safety and overall survival. At 6 months, the rate of major cytogenetic response (Ph < or = 35%) was 48%: complete (Ph = 0%) in 31%, and partial (Ph = 1%-35%) in 16%. The estimated survival at 12 months was 95%. Nilotinib was effective in patients harboring BCR-ABL mutations associated with imatinib resistance (except T315I), and also in patients with a resistance mechanism independent of BCR-ABL mutations. Adverse events were mostly mild to moderate, and there was minimal cross-intolerance with imatinib. Grades 3 to 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were observed in 29% of patients; pleural or pericardial effusions were observed in 1% (none were severe).

In this study, we demonstrate that Tax1 but not Tax2 interacts with NF-kappaB2/p100 and activates it by inducing the cleavage of p100 into the active transcription factor p52. Using RNA interference methods, we further show that NF-kappaB2/p100 is required for the transformation induced by Tax1, as determined by the ability to convert a T-cell line (CTLL-2) from interleukin-2 (IL-2)-dependent to -independent growth. While Tax2 shows a reduced transforming activity relative to Tax1, Tax2 fused with a PDZ domain binding motif (PBM) present only in Tax1 shows transforming activity equivalent to that of Tax1 in CTLL-2 cells expressing an inducer of p52 processing. These results reveal that the activation of NF-kappaB2/p100 plays a crucial role in the Tax1-mediated transformation of T cells and that NF-kappaB2/p100 activation and PBM function are both responsible for the augmented transforming activity of Tax1 relative to Tax2, thus suggesting that these Tax1-specific functions play crucial roles in HTLV-1 leukemogenesis.","['Higuchi, Masaya', 'Tsubata, Chikako', 'Kondo, Rie', 'Yoshida, Sakiko', 'Takahashi, Masahiko', 'Oie, Masayasu', 'Tanaka, Yuetsu', 'Mahieux, Renaud', 'Matsuoka, Masao', 'Fujii, Masahiro']","['Higuchi M', 'Tsubata C', 'Kondo R', 'Yoshida S', 'Takahashi M', 'Oie M', 'Tanaka Y', 'Mahieux R', 'Matsuoka M', 'Fujii M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (NF-kappa B p52 Subunit)', '0 (NFKB2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/*pathology/virology', 'Mice', 'NF-kappa B p52 Subunit/*metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism']",2007/08/24 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2007/08/24 09:00'],"['2007/08/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2007 Nov;81(21):11900-7. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00532-07.

Therefore, shortening the delay in providing survival estimates is desirable. Period analysis can estimate cancer survival by the use of recent data. We aimed to apply the period-analysis method to data that were collected by European cancer registries to estimate recent survival by country and cancer site, and to assess survival changes in Europe. We also compared our findings with data on cancer survival in the USA from the US SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results) programme. METHODS: We analysed survival data for patients diagnosed with cancer in 2000-02, collected from 47 of the European cancer registries participating in the EUROCARE-4 study. 5-year period relative survival for patients diagnosed in 2000-02 was estimated as the product of interval-specific relative survival values of cohorts with different lengths of follow-up. 5-year survival profiles for patients diagnosed in 2000-02 were estimated for the European mean and for five European regions, and findings were compared with US SEER registry data for patients diagnosed in 2000-02. A 5-year survival profile for patients diagnosed in 1991-2002 and a 10-year survival profile for patients diagnosed in 1997-2002 were also estimated by the period method for all malignancies, by geographical area, and by cancer site. FINDINGS: For all cancers, age-adjusted 5-year period survival improved for patients diagnosed in 2000-02, especially for patients with colorectal, breast, prostate, and thyroid cancer, Hodgkin's disease, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The European mean age-adjusted 5-year survival calculated by the period method for 2000-02 was high for testicular cancer (97.3% [95% CI 96.4-98.2]), melanoma (86.1% [84.3-88.0]), thyroid cancer (83.2% [80.9-85.6]), Hodgkin's disease (81.4% [78.9-84.1]), female breast cancer (79.0% [78.1-80.0]), corpus uteri (78.0% [76.2-79.9]), and prostate cancer (77.5% [76.5-78.6]); and low for stomach cancer (24.9% [23.7-26.2]), chronic myeloid leukaemia (32.2% [29.0-35.7]), acute myeloid leukaemia (14.8% [13.4-16.4]), and lung cancer (10.9% [10.5-11.4]). Survival for patients diagnosed in 2000-02 was generally highest for those in northern European countries and lowest for those in eastern European countries, although, patients in eastern European had the highest improvement in survival for major cancer sites during 1991-2002 (colorectal cancer from 30.3% [28.3-32.5] to 44.7% [42.8-46.7]; breast cancer from 60% [57.2-63.0] to 73.9% [71.7-76.2]; for prostate cancer from 39.5% [35.0-44.6] to 68.0% [64.2-72.1]). For all solid tumours, with the exception of stomach, testicular, and soft-tissue cancers, survival for patients diagnosed in 2000-02 was higher in the US SEER registries than for the European mean. For haematological malignancies, data from US SEER registries and the European mean were comparable in 2000-02, except for non-Hodgkin lymphoma. INTERPRETATION: Cancer-service infrastructure, prevention and screening programmes, access to diagnostic and treatment facilities, tumour-site-specific protocols, multidisciplinary management, application of evidence-based clinical guidelines, and recruitment to clinical trials probably account for most of the differences that we noted in outcomes.","['Verdecchia, Arduino', 'Francisci, Silvia', 'Brenner, Hermann', 'Gatta, Gemma', 'Micheli, Andrea', 'Mangone, Lucia', 'Kunkler, Ian']","['Verdecchia A', 'Francisci S', 'Brenner H', 'Gatta G', 'Micheli A', 'Mangone L', 'Kunkler I']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Lancet Oncol,The Lancet.

CASE DESCRIPTION: A 66-year-old right-handed man complained of 4 days of terrible right-sided, sharp, and shooting headache for which he saw his primary care provider. Routine laboratory examination showed a WBC count of 30800/microL. Neuroimaging showed a large, right frontotemporal, extra-axial, heterogeneously enhancing, dural based mass with associated recent intramural hemorrhage with evidence of midline shift and uncal herniation. The mass was resected using a right-sided extended craniotomy with anterior fossa and middle fossa approach. A hematoxylin-eosin-stained biopsy specimen showed whorls of tumor cells, diagnostic of a meningioma. Interspersed within the tumor bulk were nucleated RBCs, representing areas of extramedullary erythropoiesis within a meningioma. Flow cytometric evaluation confirmed the clinical suspicion of an underlying chronic lymphocytic leukemia. CONCLUSION: Occurrence of extramedullary hematopoiesis within a meningioma is extremely rare.

The aim of this retrospective study was to determine whether the effectiveness of mobilization and collection is an independent prognostic factor for autologous stem cell transplantation outcome. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 358 patients who received transplants from January 2003 to December 2004 (201 male and 157 female patients, ages from 2.7 to 77.3 years with median of 53 years of age) underwent autologous hematopoietic stem cell collection after mobilization with granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) or G-CSF plus chemotherapy priming. This retrospective study included patients with diagnoses of acute myelogenous leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, multiple myeloma, and solid tumors. All patients underwent stem cell collection until a target or a minimum CD34+ cell dose was reached. Correlations were performed between stem cell mobilization and/or collection efficacy and transplantation outcomes. RESULTS: In general, both larger reinfused CD34+ cell dose and shorter number of days for the stem cell count to reach the minimum of 2 x 10(6) per kg CD34+ cells do not foster quicker engraftment. Reinfused CD34+ cell dose of less than 12 x 10(6) and number of days stem cell collection to reach this minimum CD34+ cell dose did not independently affect the overall survival (OS) or disease-free survival (DFS). CONCLUSION: The effectiveness of hematopoietic stem cell mobilization and collection as defined as number of days to reach a CD34+ cell dose of 2 x 10(6) per kg should not be used independently to forecast posttransplantation prognosis, engraftment, DFS, and OS.","['Wang, Shirong', 'Nademanee, Auayporn', 'Qian, Dajun', 'Dagis, Andrew', 'Park, Hyun-Soon', 'Fridey, Joy', 'Smith, Eileen', 'Snyder, David', 'Somlo, George', 'Stein, Anthony', 'Rosenthal, Joseph', 'Falk, Peter', 'Kogut, Neil', 'Palmer, Joycelynne', 'Gaal, Karl', 'Kim, Young', 'Bhatia, Ravi', 'Yuan, Shan', 'Kay, Candace', 'Weiss, Lawrence', 'Forman, Stephen']","['Wang S', 'Nademanee A', 'Qian D', 'Dagis A', 'Park HS', 'Fridey J', 'Smith E', 'Snyder D', 'Somlo G', 'Stein A', 'Rosenthal J', 'Falk P', 'Kogut N', 'Palmer J', 'Gaal K', 'Kim Y', 'Bhatia R', 'Yuan S', 'Kay C', 'Weiss L', 'Forman S']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization/*methods', 'Hodgkin Disease/metabolism/therapy', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/metabolism/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/metabolism/therapy', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2007/08/24 09:00,2008/06/07 09:00,['2007/08/24 09:00'],"['2007/08/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Transfusion. 2007 Dec;47(12):2207-16. doi: 10.1111/j.1537-2995.2007.01448.x.

When the cells were treated with Alternol, chromatin condensation and phosphatidylserine externalization were observed with the down-regulation of the pro-survival gene Bcl-2 and the activation of caspase-3, caspase-9, but not caspase-8. Moreover, exposure of cells to Alternol resulted in a significant increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial transmembrane potential (DeltaPsim) depolarization.

(Palmae) is a source of anti-neoplastic activity.,1339-43,"In the present study, we investigated the in vitro anti-tumoral activities of fractions from aqueous extracts of the husk fiber of the typical A and common varieties of Cocos nucifera (Palmae). Cytotoxicity against leukemia cells was determined by the 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Cells (2 x 10(4)/well) were incubated with 0, 5, 50 or 500 microg/mL high- or low-molecular weight fractions for 48 h, treated with MTT and absorbance was measured with an ELISA reader. The results showed that both varieties have almost similar antitumoral activity against the leukemia cell line K562 (60.1 +/- 8.5 and 47.5 +/- 11.9% for the typical A and common varieties, respectively). Separation of the crude extracts with Amicon membranes yielded fractions with molecular weights ranging in size from 1-3 kDa (fraction A) to 3-10 kDa (fraction B) and to more than 10 kDa (fraction C). Cells were treated with 500 microg/mL of these fractions and cytotoxicity was evaluated by MTT. Fractions ranging in molecular weight from 1-10 kDa had higher cytotoxicity. Interestingly, C. nucifera extracts were also active against Lucena 1, a multidrug-resistant leukemia cell line. Their cytotoxicity against this cell line was about 50% (51.9 +/- 3.2 and 56.3 +/- 2.9 for varieties typical A and common, respectively). Since the common C. nucifera variety is extensively cultured in Brazil and the husk fiber is its industrial by-product, the results obtained in the present study suggest that it might be a very inexpensive source of new antineoplastic and anti-multidrug resistant drugs that warrants further investigation.","['Koschek, P R', 'Alviano, D S', 'Alviano, C S', 'Gattass, C R']","['Koschek PR', 'Alviano DS', 'Alviano CS', 'Gattass CR']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Brazil,Braz J Med Biol Res,Brazilian journal of medical and biological research = Revista brasileira de pesquisas medicas e biologicas,8112917,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Plant Extracts)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Cocos/*chemistry', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells/drug effects', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology']",2007/08/24 09:00,2008/11/05 09:00,['2007/08/24 09:00'],"['2006/10/05 00:00 [received]', '2007/06/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/08/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Braz J Med Biol Res. 2007 Oct;40(10):1339-43. doi: 10.1590/s0100-879x2006005000153.

Cell viabilities were measured based on the relative reduction in the photo responses of the photodiodes, covered with known concentration of trypan blue-stained cells. The developed method offers greater sensitivity and hence an excellent estimation of cell viability, but without all the hassle of conventional methods.

In addition to transcriptional regulation, the evidence suggests that Che-1 has a viral factor-like S phase promoting role in counteracting Rb repression to facilitate E2F-dependent transactivation during G1-S transition. Recently, Che-1 was found to play an important role in the DNA damage response and cell-cycle checkpoint control. Genetic studies in mice revealed that Che-1 is essential for preimplantation development and the establishment of embryonic gene expression. Importantly, several findings showed that Che-1 participates in inhibiting apoptotic process.

However, the nature of external or internal signals, which regulate hTERT expression in tissues, remains poorly understood. Thus, whereas it has been described that hTERT gene is regulated along the differentiation of primitive myeloid progenitors, the effect of specific cytokines on telomerase expression in each myeloid lineage is currently unknown. Based on these considerations, we have investigated hTERT expression in erythroid cells treated with erythropoietin (EPO) and transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta), as putative positive and negative regulators, respectively. We describe here that EPO activates hTERT gene transcription in in vitro-expanded primary erythroid precursors as well as in UT7 erythroleukemia cells. In UT7 cells, this study shows also that EPO acts through a JAK2/STAT5/c-myc axis. In contrast, TGFbeta blocks EPO signaling downstream of c-myc induction through a Smad3-dependent mechanism. Finally, hTERT appears to be efficiently regulated by EPO and TGFbeta in an opposite way in erythropoietic cells, arguing for a role of telomerase in red blood cell production.","['Prade-Houdellier, N', 'Frebet, E', 'Demur, C', 'Gautier, E-F', 'Delhommeau, F', 'Bennaceur-Griscelli, A-L', 'Gaudin, C', 'Martinel, V', 'Laurent, G', 'Mansat-De Mas, V', 'Beyne-Rauzy, O']","['Prade-Houdellier N', 'Frebet E', 'Demur C', 'Gautier EF', 'Delhommeau F', 'Bennaceur-Griscelli AL', 'Gaudin C', 'Martinel V', 'Laurent G', 'Mansat-De Mas V', 'Beyne-Rauzy O']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/biosynthesis', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*metabolism', 'Erythropoietin/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/metabolism', 'Telomerase/*biosynthesis', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*metabolism']",2007/08/24 09:00,2007/12/12 09:00,['2007/08/24 09:00'],"['2007/08/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Nov;21(11):2304-10. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404874.

DNA microarray technology was employed to compare the transcriptomes of eight immunomagnetically purified CD3+ normal donor-derived peripheral blood cell samples, with five highly purified inv(14)/t(14;14)-positive T-PLL blood samples. Between the two experimental groups, 734 genes were identified as differentially expressed, including functionally important genes involved in lymphomagenesis, cell cycle regulation, apoptosis and DNA repair. Notably, the differentially expressed genes were found to be significantly enriched in genomic regions affected by recurrent chromosomal imbalances.

CD3+ cells constitutively produce elevated levels of IL-11, while stimulation with the addition of phytohemagglutinin (PHA) increased GM-CSF levels in most of the patients with PV. Anti-IL-11-neutralizing antibody partially inhibited the formation of BFU-E and CFU-Mk colonies promoted by PV CD3+ cell-conditioned media. Although IL-11 is not produced by normal T cells, real-time PCR and flow cytometric analysis showed that IL-11 was upregulated in the CD3+ cells of most PV patients as compared to normal CD3+ cells. In addition, a greater percentage of BFU-E colonies formed by PV CD34+ cells in the presence of PV CD3+ cell-conditioned media alone were JAK2V617F-positive as compared with that induced by EPO.

Lack of bone marrow toxicity has encouraged further development of this drug for treatment of leukemia and lymphoma. Multiple signaling pathways have been shown to be involved in Aplidin-induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in G1 and G2 phase. However, the exact mechanism(s) of Aplidin action remains to be elucidated. Here we demonstrate that mitochondria-associated or -localized processes are the potential cellular targets of Aplidin. Whole genome gene-expression profiling (GEP) revealed that fatty acid metabolism, sterol biosynthesis and energy metabolism, including the tricarboxylic acid cycle and ATP synthesis are affected by Aplidin treatment. Moreover, mutant MOLT-4, human leukemia cells lacking functional mitochondria, were found to be resistant to Aplidin. Cytosine arabinoside (araC), which also generates oxidative stress but does not affect the ATP pool, showed synergism with Aplidin in our leukemia and lymphoma models in vitro and in vivo. These studies provide new insights into the mechanism of action of Aplidin. The efficacy of the combination of Aplidin and araC is currently being evaluated in clinical phase I/II program for the treatment of patients with relapsed leukemia and high-grade lymphoma.","['Humeniuk, R', 'Menon, L G', 'Mishra, P J', 'Saydam, G', 'Longo-Sorbello, G S A', 'Elisseyeff, Y', 'Lewis, L D', 'Aracil, M', 'Jimeno, J', 'Bertino, J R', 'Banerjee, D']","['Humeniuk R', 'Menon LG', 'Mishra PJ', 'Saydam G', 'Longo-Sorbello GS', 'Elisseyeff Y', 'Lewis LD', 'Aracil M', 'Jimeno J', 'Bertino JR', 'Banerjee D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Depsipeptides)', '0 (Peptides, Cyclic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'X4W7ZR7023 (Methylprednisolone)', 'Y76ID234HW (plitidepsin)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/biosynthesis', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects/transplantation', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Depsipeptides/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells/drug effects', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/drug therapy/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/drug therapy/pathology', 'Methylprednisolone/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/physiology', 'Mitoxantrone/pharmacology', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Peptides, Cyclic', 'Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2007/08/24 09:00,2007/12/28 09:00,['2007/08/24 09:00'],"['2007/08/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Dec;21(12):2399-405. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404911.

In solid tumours, high numbers of Tregs are associated with a poor prognosis. Knowledge about the implications of Tregs for the behaviour of haematological malignancies is limited. In this study, skin biopsies from 86 patients with mycosis fungoides (MF) and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) unspecified were analysed for the expression of FOXP3 on tumour cells and tumour-infiltrating Tregs. Labelling of above 10% of the neoplastic cells was seen in one case classified as an aggressive epidermotropic CD8+ cytotoxic CTCL. In the remaining 85 cases, the atypical neoplastic infiltrate was either FOXP3 negative (n=80) or contained only very occasional weakly positive cells (n=5). By contrast, all biopsies showed varying numbers of strongly FOXP3+ tumour-infiltrating Tregs. MF with early or infiltrated plaques had significantly higher numbers of FOXP3+ Tregs than CTCL unspecified or advanced MF with tumours or transformation to large cell lymphoma. An analysis of all patients demonstrated that increasing numbers of FOXP3+ Tregs were associated with improved survival in both MF and CTCL unspecified. In conclusion, our data indicate that the presence of FOXP3+ Tregs in CTCL is associated with disease stage and patient survival.","['Gjerdrum, L M', 'Woetmann, A', 'Odum, N', 'Burton, C M', 'Rossen, K', 'Skovgaard, G L', 'Ryder, L P', 'Ralfkiaer, E']","['Gjerdrum LM', 'Woetmann A', 'Odum N', 'Burton CM', 'Rossen K', 'Skovgaard GL', 'Ryder LP', 'Ralfkiaer E']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (FOXP3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells/chemistry', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating/chemistry/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/immunology/mortality/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycosis Fungoides/mortality/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/analysis', 'Skin Neoplasms/immunology/mortality/*pathology', 'Survival Analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/chemistry/*immunology/pathology']",2007/08/24 09:00,2007/12/28 09:00,['2007/08/24 09:00'],"['2007/08/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Dec;21(12):2512-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404913.

Vitamin A at high doses has been demonstrated to be beneficial in the treatment of some diseases, for instance acute promyelocytic leukemia. However, vitamin A and its naturally occurring metabolites (retinoids) are known to alter neuronal function, inducing behavioral disorders. Here we provide an evidence to indicate that vitamin A supplementation, at both therapeutic and excessive doses, induces oxidative stress in the rat substantia nigra. Vitamin A supplementation induced lipid peroxidation, protein carbonylation, and oxidation of protein thiol groups, as well as change in catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity. Surprisingly, locomotory and exploratory activity of rats were decreased after acute and chronic vitamin A supplementation.

The clinical features, outcomes, and antibiotic susceptibilities of VS bloodstream infections in children with hemato-oncological diseases are reported in this study. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of pediatric patients (< or =18 years) diagnosed with VS infections between January 1998 and December 2004 was conducted at the National Taiwan University Hospital. RESULTS: Among the 26 episodes noted in 25 pediatric patients, the incidence rate of VS bacteremia was found to be significantly higher in pediatric patients with acute myeloid leukemia compared with other hemato-oncological conditions. Most of the patients had profound neutropenia related to chemotherapy for a median of 5 days on the day of positive blood culture. Eight of the 25 patients had undergone stem cell transplantations. Streptococcus mitis was the most common bloodstream isolate and only 12 (44%) of the 27 isolated strains of VS were penicillin-susceptible. Empirical antibiotic treatments were not effective in half of the episodes, but did not affect overall mortality. Isolated bacteremia (63%) and pneumonia (22%) were the two leading clinical presentations. Complications were recognized more frequently in patients with pneumonia. Hypotension and mechanical ventilation each developed in 8 patients (31%). The overall mortality rate was 23%. CONCLUSIONS: Penicillin non-susceptible VS infection has emerged as a threat in children with hemato-oncological diseases, especially those with acute myeloid leukemia. S. mitis is the most common spp. of VS causing bacteremia in children and is associated with serious complications. The development of pneumonia resulted in clinical complications and higher mortality. Empirical antibiotic treatments with activity against the infecting strains did not reduce the overall mortality rate in this study.","['Huang, Wan-Ting', 'Chang, Luan-Yin', 'Hsueh, Po-Ren', 'Lu, Chun-Yi', 'Shao, Pei-Lan', 'Huang, Fu-Yuan', 'Lee, Ping-Ing', 'Chen, Chun-Ming', 'Lee, Chin-Yun', 'Huang, Li-Min']","['Huang WT', 'Chang LY', 'Hsueh PR', 'Lu CY', 'Shao PL', 'Huang FY', 'Lee PI', 'Chen CM', 'Lee CY', 'Huang LM']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Microbiol Immunol Infect,"Journal of microbiology, immunology, and infection = Wei mian yu gan ran za zhi",100956211,['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Bacteremia/complications/epidemiology/*microbiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications', 'Male', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Opportunistic Infections/complications/epidemiology/*microbiology', 'Pneumonia, Bacterial/complications/microbiology', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Streptococcal Infections/complications/*microbiology', 'Taiwan', 'Viridans Streptococci/drug effects/*isolation & purification']",2007/08/23 09:00,2008/01/03 09:00,['2007/08/23 09:00'],"['2007/08/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/03 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/23 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Microbiol Immunol Infect. 2007 Aug;40(4):349-54.,,,"['Department of Pediatrics, National Taiwan University Hospital and National Taiwan University College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interestingly, an engineered NUP98-HOXA10 (NA10) fusion can induce a several hundred-fold expansion of HSCs in vitro and NA10 and the AML-associated fusion gene NUP98-HOXD13 (ND13) have a virtually indistinguishable ability to transform myeloid progenitor cells in vitro and to induce leukemia in collaboration with MEIS1 in vivo. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: These findings provided a potentially powerful approach to identify key pathways mediating Hox-induced expansion and transformation of HSCs by identifying gene expression changes commonly induced by ND13 and NA10 but not by a NUP98-Hox fusion with a non-DNA binding homedomain mutation (N51S). The gene expression repertoire of purified murine bone marrow Sca-1+Lin- cells transduced with retroviral vectors encoding for these genes was established using the Affymetrix GeneChip MOE430A. Approximately seventy genes were differentially expressed in ND13 and NA10 cells that were significantly changed by both compared to the ND13(N51S) mutant. Intriguingly, several of these potential Hox target genes have been implicated in HSC expansion and self-renewal, including the tyrosine kinase receptor Flt3, the prion protein, Prnp, hepatic leukemia factor, Hlf and Jagged-2, Jag2. Consistent with these results, FLT3, HLF and JAG2 expression correlated with HOX A cluster gene expression in human leukemia samples. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion this study has identified several novel Hox downstream target genes and provides important new leads to key regulators of the expansion and transformation of hematopoietic stem cells by Hox.","['Palmqvist, Lars', 'Pineault, Nicolas', 'Wasslavik, Carina', 'Humphries, R Keith']","['Palmqvist L', 'Pineault N', 'Wasslavik C', 'Humphries RK']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Nup98 protein, human)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*physiology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*genetics/metabolism']",2007/08/23 09:00,2007/08/23 09:01,['2007/08/23 09:00'],"['2007/06/27 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/08/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/23 09:01 [medline]', '2007/08/23 09:00 [entrez]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2007 Aug 22;2(8):e768. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0000768.,['10.1371/journal.pone.0000768 [doi]'],,"['Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.']",,,,,,20070822,PMC1942085,,,,,,,['NLM: Original DateCompleted: 20070828'],,,,,,,,,,

In a transversal survey we assayed by allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) the JAK2 V617F mutational status in 304 patients with PMF. Multiple DNA samples were collected prospectively from 64 patients, and a highly sensitive quantitative PCR was used as a confirmatory test. In a longitudinal prospective study we determined the progression rate to clinically relevant outcomes in 174 patients who had JAK2 mutation determined at diagnosis. JAK2 V617F was identified in 63.4% of patients. None of the V617F-negative patients who were sequentially genotyped progressed to become V617F positive, whereas progression rate from heterozygous to homozygous mutation was 10 per 100 patient-years. JAK2 V617F mutation contributed to hemoglobin, aquagenic pruritus, and platelet count variability, whereas homozygous mutation was independently associated with higher white blood cell count, larger spleen size, and greater need for cytoreductive therapies. Adjusting for conventional risk factors, V617F mutation independently predicted the evolution toward large splenomegaly, need of splenectomy, and leukemic transformation.

The bone marrow showed 88% hypergranular promyelocytes, and the karyotype was 47,XY,+22 [5]/46,XY[30]. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) indicated disruption and deletion of the 5'-end of the RARA gene. Treatment with all-trans retinoic acid, idarubicin, and arsenic trioxide induced cytogenetic complete remission without morphologic evidence of residual leukemia. The diagnostic marrow was negative for PML-RARA transcripts by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), but an atypical product was observed. Sequencing showed partial homology to the PRKAR1A gene, encoding the regulatory subunit type I-alpha of cyclic adenosine monophosphate-dependent protein kinase. RT-PCR using specific primers for PRKAR1A and RARA amplified 2 transcript splice variants of a PRKAR1A-RARA fusion gene, and PRKAR1A and RARA FISH probes confirmed the fusion.

The purpose of this study was to analyze and compare the total sequence of Kit tyrosine kinase at the level of the mRNAs obtained from patients with clear systemic signs of a pathologically increased mast cell mediator release and those from healthy volunteers. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Kit encoding mRNA isolated from mast cell progenitors in peripheral blood from 17 patients with a mast cell activation disorder and from 5 healthy volunteers as well as from the human mast cell leukemia cell line HMC1 was analyzed for alterations. RESULTS: Multiple novel point mutations and six isoforms of Kit which are due to alternative mRNA splicing were detected. One isoform, the insertion of a glutamine residue at amino acid position 252, was found to be a new splice variant expressed in all patients but in none of the healthy volunteers. CONCLUSIONS: Systemic mast cell activation disorder was pathogenetically characterized by two or more alterations in the Kit tyrosine kinase providing not only a means of confirming the diagnosis, but also of assessing prognosis and of starting adequate therapeutic interventions. The insertion of Q252 appears to be pathognomic for that disease, providing a novel means for the identification of chronic non-specific gastrointestinal symptoms as manifestations of a systemic mast cell activation disorder.","['Molderings, Gerhard J', 'Kolck, Ulrich W', 'Scheurlen, Christian', 'Bruss, Michael', 'Homann, Jurgen', 'Von Kugelgen, Ivar']","['Molderings GJ', 'Kolck UW', 'Scheurlen C', 'Bruss M', 'Homann J', 'Von Kugelgen I']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Scand J Gastroenterol,Scandinavian journal of gastroenterology,0060105,['EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mastocytosis/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Point Mutation/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*genetics', 'RNA Splicing/genetics', 'Syndrome']",2007/08/22 09:00,2008/03/01 09:00,['2007/08/22 09:00'],"['2007/08/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/01 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/22 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Scand J Gastroenterol. 2007 Sep;42(9):1045-53. doi: 10.1080/00365520701245744.,"['777808211 [pii]', '10.1080/00365520701245744 [doi]']",,"['Institut fur Pharmakologie und Toxikologie, Universitatsklinikum Bonn, Germany. molderings@uni-bonn.de']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was a single-center, open-label, single-dose escalation, phase I trial in patients undergoing high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) and autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSCT). Velafermin was administered 24 h after stem cell infusion as a single intravenous dose infused over 15 min. Clinical safety variables were assessed and OM status scored daily for 30 days using the World Health Organization (WHO) grading scale. MAIN RESULTS: Thirty patients were treated with velafermin at doses of 0.03 (n = 10), 0.1 (n = 10), 0.2 (n = 8), or 0.33 mg/kg (n = 2). Patients were diagnosed with multiple myeloma (n = 16), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 12), acute myelogenous leukemia (n = 1), or desmoplasmic round cell tumor (n = 1). Velafermin was well tolerated at doses up to 0.2 mg/kg. There were no drug-related serious adverse events. No patient discontinued because of adverse events; however, two patients administered 0.33 mg/kg developed adverse reactions immediately after infusion of the study drug. No other patients were treated at this dose level. The most frequent (>35% of patients) treatment-emergent adverse events were diarrhea, fatigue, pyrexia, vomiting, and nausea. Most adverse events were mild or moderate and resolved the same day without sequelae. Eight (27%) patients developed WHO grade 3 or 4 OM during the study; seven of these patients received high-dose melphalan as a conditioning regimen. CONCLUSION: Velafermin was well tolerated by autologous PBSCT patients at doses up to 0.2 mg/kg.","['Schuster, Michael W', 'Shore, Tsiporah B', 'Harpel, John G', 'Greenberg, June', 'Jalilizeinali, Bita', 'Possley, Scott', 'Gerwien, Robert W', 'Hahne, William', 'Halvorsen, Yuan-Di C']","['Schuster MW', 'Shore TB', 'Harpel JG', 'Greenberg J', 'Jalilizeinali B', 'Possley S', 'Gerwien RW', 'Hahne W', 'Halvorsen YD']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (FGF20 protein, human)', '62031-54-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factors)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Fibroblast Growth Factors/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/complications/drug therapy/therapy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Stomatitis/chemically induced/*drug therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",2007/08/22 09:00,2008/09/13 09:00,['2007/08/22 09:00'],"['2007/01/28 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/08/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/13 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/22 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2008 May;16(5):477-83. doi: 10.1007/s00520-007-0325-9.

Susceptibility towards chemotherapy either of the leukemic bulk or the leukemic stem cell is considered the major determining parameter for long-term outcome. The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether chemoresistance was correlated between different antileukemic drugs or not. We determined the lethal concentration of chemotherapy necessary to reduce viability of cells to 50% compared to untreated control (LC50) as a surrogate marker of chemotherapy susceptibility of six established chemotherapeutic agents [cytarabine (median 0.83 microg/ml), daunorubicine (0.09 microg/ml), idarubicine (0.03 microg/ml), mitoxantrone (0.05 microg/ml), etoposide (4.81 microg/ml), and topotecan (0.14 microg/ml)] in an overall number of 147 samples from consecutive patients with AML by WST-1 assay in vitro. We found that susceptibility to chemotherapy was significantly correlated between all six agents (all p values < 0.01). A homogenous response of the blast populations was significantly correlated to high chemoresistance. These data indicate that cross-resistance in AML against antileukemic drugs exists between agents with different modes of action and seems not to be mediated by drug-specific resistance mechanisms but rather by more generalized death-defying features of the affected cells (e.g., inhibited apoptosis).","['Fiegl, Michael', 'Zimmermann, Inka', 'Lorenz, Isolde', 'Hiddemann, Wolfgang', 'Braess, Jan']","['Fiegl M', 'Zimmermann I', 'Lorenz I', 'Hiddemann W', 'Braess J']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Nucleosides)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I/metabolism', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nucleosides/chemistry/*pharmacology', '*Topoisomerase I Inhibitors', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2007/08/22 09:00,2008/04/29 09:00,['2007/08/22 09:00'],"['2007/05/26 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/08/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/29 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/22 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2008 Jan;87(1):27-33. doi: 10.1007/s00277-007-0361-z.

We addressed the potential long-term impact of this strategy in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), which is driven by the fusion oncogene BCR-ABL. Analysis of BCR-ABL genotypes in CML patients who relapsed after sequential treatment with the ABL inhibitors imatinib and dasatinib revealed evolving resistant BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations in all cases. Twelve patients relapsed with the pan-resistant T315I mutation, whereas 6 patients developed novel BCR-ABL mutations predicted to retain sensitivity to imatinib based on in vitro studies. Three of these patients were retreated with imatinib (or the chemically related compound nilotinib) and responded; however, selection for compound mutants (2 or 3 BCR-ABL mutations in the same molecule) can substantially limit the potential effectiveness of retreating patients with inhibitors that have previously failed. Furthermore, drug-resistant mutations, when compounded, can increase oncogenic potency relative to the component mutants in transformation assays. The Aurora kinase inhibitor VX-680, currently under clinical evaluation based on its activity against the T315I mutation, is also effective against the other commonly detected dasatinib-resistant mutation in our analysis, V299L. Our findings demonstrate the potential hazards of sequential kinase inhibitor therapy and suggest a role for a combination of ABL kinase inhibitors, perhaps including VX-680, to prevent the outgrowth of cells harboring drug-resistant BCR-ABL mutations.","['Shah, Neil P', 'Skaggs, Brian J', 'Branford, Susan', 'Hughes, Timothy P', 'Nicoll, John M', 'Paquette, Ronald L', 'Sawyers, Charles L']","['Shah NP', 'Skaggs BJ', 'Branford S', 'Hughes TP', 'Nicoll JM', 'Paquette RL', 'Sawyers CL']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '639089-54-6 (VX680)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)', 'HG18B9YRS7 (Valine)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Animals', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Line', 'Dasatinib', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*metabolism', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Thiazoles/therapeutic use', 'Valine/genetics/metabolism']",2007/08/22 09:00,2007/10/24 09:00,['2007/08/22 09:00'],"['2006/11/08 00:00 [received]', '2007/05/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/08/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/24 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/22 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2007 Sep;117(9):2562-9. doi: 10.1172/JCI30890.,['10.1172/JCI30890 [doi]'],,"['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, UCSF School of Medicine, San Francisco, California, USA.']",,,,,,,PMC1940237,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17710205,NLM,PubMed-not-MEDLINE,20100205,20190608,1198-0052 (Print) 1198-0052 (Linking),14,4,2007 Aug,Management of single brain metastasis: a practice guideline.,131-43,"QUESTIONS: Should patients with confirmed single brain metastasis undergo surgical resection? Should patients with single brain metastasis undergoing surgical resection receive adjuvant whole-brain radiation therapy (wbrt)? What is the role of stereotactic radiosurgery (srs) in the management of patients with single brain metastasis? PERSPECTIVES: Approximately 15%-30% of patients with cancer will develop cerebral metastases over the course of their disease. Patients identified as having single brain metastasis generally undergo more aggressive treatment than do those with multiple metastases; however, in the province of Ontario, management of patients with single brain metastasis varies. Given that conflicting evidence has been reported, the Neuro-oncology Disease Site Group (dsg) of the Cancer Care Ontario Program in Evidence-based Care felt that a systematic review of the evidence and a practice guideline were warranted. OUTCOMES: Outcomes of interest were survival, local control of disease, quality of life, and adverse effects. METHODOLOGY: The medline, cancerlit, embase, and Cochrane Library databases and abstracts published in the proceedings of the annual meetings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (1997-2005) and American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology (1998-2004) were systematically searched for relevant evidence. The review included fully published reports or abstracts of randomized controlled trials (rcts), nonrandomized prospective studies, and retrospective studies. The present systematic review and practice guideline has been reviewed and approved by the Neuro-oncology dsg, which comprises medical and radiation oncologists, surgeons, neurologists, a nurse, and a patient representative. External review by Ontario practitioners was obtained through an electronic survey. Final approval of the guideline report was obtained from the Report Approval Panel and the Neuro-oncology dsg. RESULTS: QUALITY OF EVIDENCE: The literature search found three rcts that compared surgical resection plus wbrt with wbrt alone. In addition, a Cochrane review, including a meta-analysis of published data from those three rcts, was obtained. One rct compared surgical resection plus wbrt with surgical resection alone. One rct compared wbrt plus srs with wbrt alone. Evidence comparing srs with surgical resection or examining srs with or without wbrt was limited to prospective case series and retrospective studies. BENEFITS: Two of three rcts reported a significant survival benefit for patients who underwent surgical resection as compared with those who received wbrt alone. Pooled results of the three rcts indicated no significant difference in survival or likelihood of dying from neurologic causes; however, significant heterogeneity was detected between the trials. The rct that compared surgical resection plus wbrt with surgical resection alone reported no significant difference in overall survival or length of functional independence; however, tumour recurrence at the site of the metastasis and anywhere in the brain was less frequent in patients who received wbrt as compared with patients in the observation group. In addition, patients who received wbrt were less likely to die from neurologic causes. Results of the rct that compared wbrt plus srs with wbrt alone indicated a significant improvement in median survival in patients who received srs. No quality evidence compares the efficacy of srs with surgical resection or examines the question of whether patients who receive srs should also receive wbrt. HARMS: Pooled results of the three rcts that examined surgical resection indicated no significant difference in adverse effects between groups. Postoperative complications included respiratory problems, intracerebral hemorrhage, and infection. One rct reported no significant difference in adverse effects between patients who received wbrt plus srs and those who received wbrt alone. PRACTICE GUIDELINE: TARGET POPULATION: The recommendations that follow apply to adults with confirmed cancer and a single brain metastasis. This practice guideline does not apply to patients with metastatic lymphoma, small-cell lung cancer, germ-cell tumour, leukemia, or sarcoma. RECOMMENDATIONS: Surgical excision should be considered for patients with good performance status, minimal or no evidence of extracranial disease, and a surgically accessible single brain metastasis amenable to complete excision. Because treatment in cases of single brain metastasis is considered palliative, invasive local treatments must be individualized. Patients with lesions requiring emergency decompression because of intracranial hypertension were excluded from the rcts, but should be considered candidates for surgery. To reduce the risk of tumour recurrence for patients who have undergone resection of a single brain metastasis, postoperative wbrt should be considered. The optimal dose and fractionation schedule for wbrt is 3000 cGy in 10 fractions or 2000 cGy in 5 fractions. As an alternative to surgical resection, wbrt followed by srs boost should be considered for patients with single brain metastasis. The evidence is insufficient to recommend srs alone as a single-modality therapy. QUALIFYING STATEMENTS: No high-quality data are available regarding the choice of surgery versus radiosurgery for single brain metastasis. In general, the size and location of the metastasis determine the optimal approach. The standard wbrt regimen for management of patients with single brain metastasis in the United States is 3000 cGy in 10 fractions, and this treatment is usually the standard arm in randomized studies of radiation in patients with brain metastases. Based solely on evidence, the understanding that no reason exists to choose 3000 cGy in 10 fractions over 2000 cGy in 5 fractions is correct; however, fraction size is believed to be important, and therefore 300 cGy daily (3000/10) is believed to be associated with fewer long-term neurocognitive effects than 400 cGy daily (2000/5) in the occasional long-term survivor. For that reason, many radiation oncologists in Ontario prefer 3000 cGy in 10 fractions. No data exist to either support or refute that preference; therefore, finding a resolution to this issue is not currently possible. The Neuro-oncology dsg will update the recommendations as new evidence becomes available.","['Mintz, A', 'Perry, J', 'Spithoff, K', 'Chambers, A', 'Laperriere, N']","['Mintz A', 'Perry J', 'Spithoff K', 'Chambers A', 'Laperriere N']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Curr Oncol,"Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",9502503,,,,2007/08/22 09:00,2007/08/22 09:01,['2007/08/22 09:00'],"['2007/08/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/22 09:01 [medline]', '2007/08/22 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Curr Oncol. 2007 Aug;14(4):131-43. doi: 10.3747/co.2007.129.,['10.3747/co.2007.129 [doi]'],,"['University of Pittsburgh, Department of Neurological Surgery, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, U.S.A.']",,,,,,,PMC1948870,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Analysis of the incidence of t-MDS and t-AML in 746 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) treated with the ibritumomab tiuxetan regimen in registration and compassionate-use trials between 1996 and 2002. RESULTS: Nineteen patients (2.5%) developed t-MDS or t-AML at a median follow-up of 4.4 years (range, 0 to 9.3). These malignancies were diagnosed at a median of 5.6 years (range, 1.4 to 13.9) after the diagnosis of NHL and 1.9 years (range, 0.4 to 6.3) after radioimmunotherapy. The annualized rates were 0.3% per year after the diagnosis of NHL and 0.7% per year after treatment. Most patients with t-MDS or t-AML had multiple cytogenetic aberrations, commonly on chromosomes 5 and 7, suggesting an association with previous exposure to chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: Analysis of data from patients in registration and compassionate-use trials suggests that the annualized incidences of t-MDS and t-AML are consistent with that expected in patients with NHL who have had extensive previous chemotherapy treatment and do not appear to be increased after treatment with the ibritumomab tiuxetan regimen. Cytogenetic testing before treatment with radioimmunotherapy may identify existing chromosomal abnormalities in previously treated patients, particularly those who have been treated with alkylating agents and purine nucleoside analogs and would be at higher risk for t-MDS or t-AML.","['Czuczman, Myron S', 'Emmanouilides, Christos', 'Darif, Mohamed', 'Witzig, Thomas E', 'Gordon, Leo I', 'Revell, Stephen', 'Vo, Katie', 'Molina, Arturo']","['Czuczman MS', 'Emmanouilides C', 'Darif M', 'Witzig TE', 'Gordon LI', 'Revell S', 'Vo K', 'Molina A']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Yttrium Radioisotopes)', '4Q52C550XK (ibritumomab tiuxetan)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/*etiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications/*etiology', 'Radioimmunotherapy/*methods', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Yttrium Radioisotopes/*administration & dosage/*adverse effects']",2007/08/22 09:00,2007/10/10 09:00,['2007/08/22 09:00'],"['2007/08/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/22 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2007 Sep 20;25(27):4285-92. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2006.09.2882.

To address these questions, 5 patients with FIP1L1/PDGFRA-positive CEL with documented clinical, hematologic, and molecular remission on imatinib (400 mg daily) and without evidence of cardiac involvement were enrolled in a dose de-escalation trial. The imatinib dose was tapered slowly with close follow-up for evidence of clinical, hematologic, and molecular relapse. Two patients with endomyocardial fibrosis were maintained on imatinib 300 to 400 mg daily and served as controls. All 5 patients who underwent dose de-escalation, but neither of the control patients, experienced molecular relapse (P < .05). None developed recurrent symptoms, and eosinophil counts, serum B12, and tryptase levels remained suppressed. Reinitiation of therapy at the prior effective dose led to molecular remission in all 5 patients, although 2 patients subsequently required increased dosing to maintain remission.

However, the interaction between malignant B and T cells remains to be fully elucidated. In a previous study, we have reported that ligation of CCL19-CCR7 and CXCL13-CXCR5 activates paternally expressed gene 10 (PEG10), resulting in an enhancement of apoptotic resistance in B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (B-ALL) CD23+CD5+ B cells. Here, we report that B-ALL CD23+CD5+ B cells produce IL-10 at high level, which can be further elevated by costimulation with CCL19 and CXCL13. CCL19/CXCL13-activated B-ALL CD23+CD5+ B cells, in turn, increase IL-10 expression in syngeneic CD8+ T cells in a B cell-derived IL-10-dependent manner and requiring a cell-cell contact. IL-10 secreted from B-ALL CD23+CD5+ B cells in vitro impairs tumor-specific CTL responses of syngeneic CD8+ T cells. The impairment of cytotoxicity of syngeneic CD8+ T cells is escalated by means of CCL19/CXCL13-induced up-regulation of IL-10 from B-ALL CD23+CD5+ B cells. Moreover, using a short hairpin RNA to knockdown PEG10, we provide direct evidence that increased expression of PEG10 in B-ALL CD23+CD5+ B cells is involved in malignant B-T cell interaction, contributing to the up-regulation of IL-10 expression, as well as to the impairment of cytotoxicity of syngeneic CD8+ T cells. Thus, malignant B-ALL CD23+CD5+ B cells play an immunoregulatory role in controlling different inflammatory cytokine expressions. IL-10 may be one of the critical cellular factors conferring B-ALL CD23+CD5+ B cells to escape from host immune surveillance.","['Wang, Xingbing', 'Yuling, He', 'Yanping, Jiang', 'Xinti, Tan', 'Yaofang, Yang', 'Feng, Yu', 'Ruijin, Xiao', 'Li, Wang', 'Lang, Chen', 'Jingyi, Liu', 'Zhiqing, Tang', 'Jingping, Ouyang', 'Bing, Xia', 'Li, Qiao', 'Chang, Alfred E', 'Sun, Zimin', 'Youxin, Jin', 'Jinquan, Tan']","['Wang X', 'Yuling H', 'Yanping J', 'Xinti T', 'Yaofang Y', 'Feng Y', 'Ruijin X', 'Li W', 'Lang C', 'Jingyi L', 'Zhiqing T', 'Jingping O', 'Bing X', 'Li Q', 'Chang AE', 'Sun Z', 'Youxin J', 'Jinquan T']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (CXCL13 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CCL19)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL13)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (PEG10 protein, human)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*immunology', 'CD5 Antigens/analysis', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology', 'Chemokine CCL19/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Chemokine CXCL13/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Surveillance/*immunology', 'Interleukin-10/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Receptors, IgE/analysis', 'Up-Regulation']",2007/08/22 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2007/08/22 09:00'],"['2007/08/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/22 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2007 Sep 1;179(5):2880-8. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.179.5.2880.,"['179/5/2880 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.179.5.2880 [doi]']",,"['Department of Hematology, Anhui Medical University Affiliated Provincial Hospital, Hefei, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['J Immunol. 2007 Nov 15;179(10):7184'],,,,,,,

SCL is expressed in, and required for, both primitive and definitive erythropoiesis. Thus far, we have identified only one erythroid SCL enhancer. Located 40 kb downstream of exon 1a, the +40 enhancer displays activity in primitive erythroblasts. We demonstrate here that a 3.7-kb fragment containing this element also targets expression to the midbrain, a known site of endogenous SCL expression. Although the 3.7-kb construct was active in primitive, but not definitive, erythroblasts, a larger 5.0-kb fragment, encompassing the 3.7-kb region, was active in both fetal and adult definitive hematopoietic cells. This included Ter119+ erythroid cells along with fetal liver erythroid and myeloid progenitors. Unlike two other SCL hematopoietic enhancers (+18/19 and -4), +40 enhancer transgenes were inactive in the endothelium. A conserved 400-bp core region, essential for both hematopoietic and midbrain +40 enhancer activity in embryos, relied on two GATA/E-box motifs and was bound in vivo by GATA-1 and SCL in erythroid cells.

Glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) catalyzes glycosylation of ceramide and produces glucosylceramide. Through GCS, ceramide glycosylation allows cellular escape from ceramide-induced programmed cell death. Here we investigated the expression of GCS in human leukemia cells and an association between GCS and multidrug resistance of leukemia cells. Using RT-PCR technique the level of GCS gene was detected in 65 clinical multidrug resistance/non-resistance cases with leukemia, and in K562 and K562/A02 cell lines. AlamarBlue Assay was applied to confirm the multidrug resistant of K562/A02 cells. PPMP, which is a chemical inhibitor for GCS, was used to determine the relationship between GCS and drug-resistance in K562/A02 cells. In addition, multidrug resistance gene (mdr1), Bcl-2 and Bax mRNA was also analyzed by RT-PCR. The expression of GCS and mdr1 mRNA in clinic multidrug resistance samples exhibited significantly increased compared with clinic drug sensitive group (P<0.05). There was the positive correlation both the expression of GCS and mdr1 genes in leukemia samples (P<0.01, gamma=0.7). AlamarBlue Assay showed that the K562/A02 cell line was 115-fold more resistant to adriamycin and 36-fold more resistant to vincristine compared with drug-sensitive K562 cell line. There also was significant expression difference of GCS and mdr1 genes between K562 and K562/A02 cells. Bcl-2 gene exhibited higher expressions whatever in clinic drug-resistance samples or K562/A02 cells, whereas the expressions of Bax gene were higher in drug-sensitive samples and K562 cells. PPMP increased sensitivity to adriamycin toxicity by inhibiting GCS in K562/A02 cells. Therefore, it is suggested that a high level of GCS in leukemia is possible contributed to multidrug resistance of leukemia cells. Abnormally expressions of the genes in associated with cell apoptosis might be one of the main molecular pathology mechanisms of multidrug resistance caused by GCS gene.","['Xie, Ping', 'Shen, Yun-Fen', 'Shi, Yuan-Ping', 'Ge, Shu-Mei', 'Gu, Zhong-Hua', 'Wang, Jue', 'Mu, Hui-Jun', 'Zhang, Bin', 'Qiao, Wei-Zhen', 'Xie, Ke-Ming']","['Xie P', 'Shen YF', 'Shi YP', 'Ge SM', 'Gu ZH', 'Wang J', 'Mu HJ', 'Zhang B', 'Qiao WZ', 'Xie KM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (Glucosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.1.80 (ceramide glucosyltransferase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Glucosyltransferases/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*enzymology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",2007/08/22 09:00,2008/05/07 09:00,['2007/08/22 09:00'],"['2007/05/10 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/05 00:00 [revised]', '2007/07/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/08/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/22 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2008 Mar;32(3):475-80. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2007.07.006.

Accordingly, SSRIs have been proposed as lead compounds in the development of new approaches to the treatment of lymphoma/leukaemia. Here we attempted to dissect the underlying signaling pathways by comparing susceptible and resistant cell lines. However, we found that all cell lines investigated underwent apoptotic cell death when exposed to SSRI concentrations exceeding 10 microM regardless of whether the cell lines were derived from B- (e.g., Namalwa, Ramos, Daudi, RL7), T-lymphoid tumors (e.g., Molt-4, Jurkat, CCRF-CEM) or other sources. The structure-activity relationship readily distinguished the pro-apoptotic and growth inhibitory effect of SSRIs from their eponymous action (blockage of the serotonin transporter): acetylation of the SSRIs fluvoxamine and paroxetine abrogated the ability of these compounds to inhibit 5HT-uptake, but did not impair their cytotoxic action. Based on these data we conclude that (i) SSRIs inhibit growth of transformed cells, but that (ii) this effect is neither specific for malignant cells nor specific for any particular cellular subset. (iii) The pro-apoptotic effect of SSRIs (at microM concentrations) is unrelated to their principal pharmacological action, i.e., inhibition of serotonin uptake (at nM concentrations). SSRIs or improved versions thereof are therefore unlikely to represent useful lead compounds for inducing apoptosis in B-cell derived tumors: the underlying mechanism is not confined to any specific cell lineage.","['Schuster, Christian', 'Fernbach, Nora', 'Rix, Uwe', 'Superti-Furga, Giulio', 'Holy, Marion', 'Freissmuth, Michael', 'Sitte, Harald H', 'Sexl, Veronika']","['Schuster C', 'Fernbach N', 'Rix U', 'Superti-Furga G', 'Holy M', 'Freissmuth M', 'Sitte HH', 'Sexl V']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors)', '333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/metabolism/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*chemically induced', 'Fibroblasts/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', '*Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', '*Lymphoma, B-Cell/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', '*Lymphoma, T-Cell/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Serotonin/metabolism', 'Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/chemical synthesis/metabolism/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Thymidine/metabolism']",2007/08/22 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2007/08/22 09:00'],"['2007/04/10 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/16 00:00 [revised]', '2007/07/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/08/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/22 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2007 Nov 1;74(9):1424-35. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2007.07.017.

After being thawed, they were cultured. The combination of rhGM-CSF, rhIL-4, rhTNF-alpha and other cytokines were added into the culture system. 12 days later, L-DCs were assayed for morphology, immunophenotype, mixed lymphocytic reaction (MLR) and CTL cytotoxicity on autologous leukemic cells. The results showed that both fresh and cryopreserved leukemic cells obtained from patients with acute or chronic leukemia revealed typical DC morphologically by means of using combinations of cytokines in culture, but there was no significant difference between pre-or post cryopreservations. L-DCs also upregulated the expression of CD80, CD54, HLA-DR, CD1a, CD83 and CD86, and downregulated the expression of CD14, but there was also no difference as compared with L-DCs befor cryopreservation. L-DCs derived from leukemic cells were also capable of stimulating MLR and inducing CTL which could kill autologous leukemic cells obviously. It is concluded that leukemic cells, regardless of fresh or frozen, can induce L-DCs after culture with cytokine combination. The L-DCs can induce CTL targeting autologous leukemic cells, and may be used to treat MRD as immunotherapy. The induction and biological properties of L-DCs are not influenced by cryopreservation.","['Huang, You-Zhang', 'Shen, Jian-Liang', 'Wang, Li-Xin', 'Xiang, Dan', 'Zheng, Pei-Hao', 'Cen, Jian', 'Gong, Li-Zhong', 'Liu, Yi', 'Yang, Ping-Di']","['Huang YZ', 'Shen JL', 'Wang LX', 'Xiang D', 'Zheng PH', 'Cen J', 'Gong LZ', 'Liu Y', 'Yang PD']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'CD8 Antigens/metabolism', '*Cryopreservation', 'Dendritic Cells/*cytology/immunology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology/*pathology', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",2007/08/22 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2007/08/22 09:00'],"['2007/08/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]', '2007/08/22 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2007 Aug;15(4):873-7.,['1009-2137(2007)04-0873-05 [pii]'],,"['Department of Hematology, Navy General Hospital of PLA, Beijing 100037, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results indicated that FLT3 expression was downregulated by shRNA1 and shRNA3, and shRNA1 showed stronger inhibitory effect. At 48 hours following transfection, the inhibitory rate of 25 nmol/L shRNA1 was 72.95 +/- 2.07%, lasting 72 hours. The 5 nmol/L and more concentration of FLT3 shRNA1 could downregulate FLT3 mRNA level, which displayed a quantity-effect relation; the inhibitory rate of 15 nmol/L shRNA1 was 67.53 +/- 0.66%.

DCs derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of health donors were loaded with apoptotic U937 cells, and induced to maturation in the presence of TNF-alpha. Matured DCs were cocultured with autologous T-lymphocytes, and combined with IL-2 in order to induce the leukemia-specific CTL. The phenotypes of DCs and T lymphocytes were tested by flow cytometry. The ability of DC capturing antigens was measured by Dextran-FITC endocytosis. The IL-12p70 level was assayed by ELISA kit. The proliferation of CTL and CTL activity were measured by MTT assay. The results showed that the apoptotic rate of the U937 cells was 51.2% when U937 cells were induced by 1 microg/ml ART for 48 hours in vitro. DCs had the most powerful ability of endocytosis in its immature phase. Apoptotic U937 cells could not induce the features of DC maturation, and apoptotic U937 cell-pulsed immature DCs could be matured with TNF-alpha. The IL-12p70 level secreded by apoptotic U937 cell-loaded mature DCs (mDC-(Apo)U937) was higher than that of non-loaded mDC. The proliferation of autologous T lymphocytes co-cultured with mDC-(Apo)U937 was significantly remarkable and the content of CD8(+) CTL was significantly higher in comparison with any other groups.

Among the 14 genotypes found in the test, the HLA-Cw7 was the most popular (37.8%) and the group 2 (HLA-Cw1, 3, 7, 8, 13, 14) recognized by KIR2DL2/2DL3 counted for 43.2%. The incompatibility of KIR for 32 cases of haploidentical BMT was 43.8%, of which 9/14 were KIR2DL incompatible, 5/14 were KIR2DL2 or KIR3DL1 incompatible. Among the 46 cases of haploidentical BMT, 29 cases were HLA-Cw matched and 14 cases were mismatched. The completed mismatch ratio of HLA-Cw was 30.4% and the match ratio was 63.4%. The survival rate was higher for the 14 cases of KIR genotype compatible group than the 13 cases of KIR genotype incompatible group (p = 0.032). The disease-free survival was significantly higher for the 17 cases of mismatched KIR ligands (HLA-Cw) group than the matched group (p = 0.024). The survival rate was higher in GVHD group than that in non-GVHD group when the KIR ligand was missing. The acute and severe GVHD was related to the existence of activating receptor of KIR2DS1/2DS2. The incompatibility group was accompanied with frequent acute and severe GVHD and less relapse and vice versa for the compatibility group. One patient died after BMT among the 14 mismatched KIR ligand group suffering from myelogenous leukemia while 4 patients out of 12 patients died in the matched group. It is concluded that the haploidentical BMT is characterized by mismatch between donor and recipient and its immunological reactions also features by the incompatibility of KIR genotype and missing ligand. The missing ligand for the donor KIR has strong effect on the outcome of BMT and it means a lot to analyze the KIR genotype and its ligand for the selection of best donor and prognostic evaluation in haploidentical BMT.","['Duan, Lian-Ning', 'Han, Hong-Xing', 'Liu, Jing', 'Yan, Hong-Min', 'Zhu, Ling', 'Xue, Mei', 'Ding, Li', 'Zhu, Pei-Yu', 'Wang, Heng-Xiang', 'Ji, Shu-Quan']","['Duan LN', 'Han HX', 'Liu J', 'Yan HM', 'Zhu L', 'Xue M', 'Ding L', 'Zhu PY', 'Wang HX', 'Ji SQ']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['0 (HLA-C Antigens)', '0 (HLA-C*70 antigen)', '0 (HLA-Cw1 antigen)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, KIR)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology', 'HLA-C Antigens/*genetics/immunology', 'Haplotypes/genetics/immunology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Histocompatibility/*genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, KIR/*genetics/immunology', 'Young Adult']",2007/08/22 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2007/08/22 09:00'],"['2007/08/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]', '2007/08/22 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2007 Aug;15(4):809-15.,['1009-2137(2007)04-0809-07 [pii]'],,"['Department of Hematology, General Hospital of Air Force, Beijing 100036, China. duanlianning@hotmail.com']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples from 70 cases (17 GVHD patients) undergoing allo-PBCST patients were detected for CDR3 (complementarity determining region 3 repertoire analysis of T cell receptor Vbetagene) using reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The products were further analyzed by genescan to identify T cell clonality. The results showed that the patients of HSCT generally passed through a transformation from monoclone to polyclone. At day 60 - 90 after HSCT, half of the cases were monoclonal and the remainders were polyclonal. After 120 days, most of patients without GVHD transferred into polyclones, however, patients with GVHD remained monoclonal after one year because of immunosuppressive agents and GVHD itself. The peripheral blood of GVHD patients mainly expressed monoclone/biclone at the time of target organ damage conspicuously, after medication intervention, partial monoclone or bioclone expressed TCR Vbeta subfamilies were diverted to polyclonal expression. It is concluded that the T cells present clonal proliferation and T cell receptors are prone to be used when patients are in earlier period of transplantation or with GVHD especially. The expression of TCR Vbeta subfamilies can return to normal polycloning along with the recovery of hematopoiesis and immunity in patients.","['Jia, Xin-Yan', 'Wang, Jian-Min', 'Li, Yang-Qiu', 'Chen, Shao-Hua', 'Zhang, Wei-Ping', 'Chen, Li']","['Jia XY', 'Wang JM', 'Li YQ', 'Chen SH', 'Zhang WP', 'Chen L']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*genetics', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",2007/08/22 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2007/08/22 09:00'],"['2007/08/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]', '2007/08/22 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2007 Aug;15(4):795-800.,['1009-2137(2007)04-0795-06 [pii]'],,"['Departmant of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, The Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results showed that plasmid pLenti6/V5-WISp39 could readily enhance the expression of WISp39 in U937 cells. A significant growth inhibition (37.6%) was observed in cells tranfected with pLenti6/V5-WISp39, while the control plasmid pLenti6/V5-lacZ showed little effect on U937 growth. Further analysis revealed that pLenti6/V5-WISp39 did not show obvious apoptosis induction effect, but it could really regulate U937 proliferation via cell cycle modulation. Compared with pLenti6/V5-lacZ, pLenti6/V5-WISp39 resulted in increase of cells in G(0)/G(1) phase by 10% at 48 hours after transfection. It is concluded that the WISp39 gene has no significant apoptosis induction effect on leukemic cells, but it can increase cells at G(0)/G(1) phase via effect on cell cycle, thus inhibiting the U937 proliferation.

The conventional RT-PCR was used to amplify PML/RARa gene from cultured NB4 cells. Standard curves were constructed by modified real-time PCR on standard template after 10-fold serial dilutions of cDNA of 1 microg NB4 cells. The sensitivity, stability and repeatability of this method was determined. The PML/RARa gene transcripts of bone marrows in 4 APL patients before and after treatment and in 1 APL patient relapsed after complete remission were dynamically detected by modified real-time quantitative RT-PCR. The results indicated that the sensitivity of real-time quantitative RT-PCR for detecting PML/RARa fusion gene was about 10(-5) microg cDNA from NB4 cells, the repeatability and reproducibility of this method were satisfactory, intra-and inter-assay coefficients of variation were 2.1% and 3.8%. The copy numbers of PML/RARa transcripte reflecting PML/RARa fusion gene expression level in 4 newly diagnosed patients with APL were 1884, 5533, 1803, 4677 and the median was 3 475.

It has been shown that specific expression of GATA-2 in blood progenitor cells requires distal cis-acting regulatory elements. Identification and characterization of these elements should help elucidating transcription regulatory mechanisms of GATA-2 expression in hematopoietic lineage. RESULTS: By pair-wise alignments of the zebrafish genomic sequences flanking GATA-2 to orthologous regions of fugu, mouse, rat and human genomes, we identified three highly conserved non-coding sequences in the genomic region flanking GATA-2, two upstream of GATA-2 and another downstream. Using both transposon and bacterial artificial chromosome mediated germline transgenic zebrafish analyses, one of the sequences was established as necessary and sufficient to direct hematopoietic GFP expression in a manner that recapitulates that of GATA-2. In addition, we demonstrated that this element has enhancer activity in mammalian myeloid leukemia cell lines, thus validating its functional conservation among vertebrate species. Further analysis of potential transcription factor binding sites suggested that integrity of the putative HOXA3 and LMO2 sites is required for regulating GATA-2/GFP hematopoietic expression. CONCLUSION: Regulation of GATA-2 expression in hematopoietic cells is likely conserved among vertebrate animals. The integrated approach described here, drawing on embryological, transgenesis and computational methods, should be generally applicable to analyze tissue-specific gene regulation involving distal DNA cis-acting elements.","['Yang, Zhongan', 'Jiang, Hong', 'Zhao, Fang', 'Shankar, Deepa B', 'Sakamoto, Kathleen M', 'Zhang, Michael Q', 'Lin, Shuo']","['Yang Z', 'Jiang H', 'Zhao F', 'Shankar DB', 'Sakamoto KM', 'Zhang MQ', 'Lin S']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,BMC Dev Biol,BMC developmental biology,100966973,"['0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Zebrafish Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Conserved Sequence', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', 'Regulatory Elements, Transcriptional/*genetics', 'Transfection', 'Zebrafish/*genetics', 'Zebrafish Proteins/*genetics']",2007/08/22 09:00,2007/09/27 09:00,['2007/08/22 09:00'],"['2006/11/01 00:00 [received]', '2007/08/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/08/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/27 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/22 09:00 [entrez]']",epublish,BMC Dev Biol. 2007 Aug 20;7:97. doi: 10.1186/1471-213X-7-97.,"['1471-213X-7-97 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-213X-7-97 [doi]']",,"['Department of Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California 90095-1606, USA. zyanghon@ucla.edu']","['HG001696/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL075826/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA108545/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'Z01 DK054508/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 75826/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 83077/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR013227/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL083077/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R24 RR013227/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HG001696/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK054508/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA108545/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 RR013227/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,20070820,PMC1988811,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The LBPA FA composition in THP-1 cells exhibits an elevated amount of oleic acid (18:1n-9) and enrichment of PUFA, especially DHA (22:6n-3). DHA supplemented to the medium was efficiently incorporated into LBPA. In contrast, arachidonic acid (20:4n-6) was hardly esterified to LBPA under the same experimental conditions. The turnover of DHA in LBPA was similar to that in other phospholipids. Specific incorporation of DHA into LBPA was also observed in baby hamster kidney fibroblasts, although LBPA in these cells contains very low endogenous levels of DHA in normal growth conditions. Our resuIts, together with published observations, suggest that the specific incorporation of DHA into LBPA is a common phenomenon in mammalian cells.

Although HIV-1 protein immunization in combination with MF59 resulted in partial protection, the DNA priming seemed to be crucial for obtaining full protection against the challenge. It is likely that the partial protection seen after immunization with protein alone is, to a certain extent, due to effects of the adjuvant since some animals that received the adjuvant MF59 alone were protected from the challenge.

A subset of patients with high-risk CLL rapidly progress to develop symptomatic disease requiring treatment. Over-represented in this group are those who have a deletion of 17p13.1, the chromosomal location of the tumor suppressor gene P53. Of all prognostic factors examined in CLL, del(17p13.1) has a superior predictive value for poor response to conventional therapy. In this article we review the current published data on prognostic factors relevant to treatment in CLL. We next provide therapeutic recommendations for patients with del(17p13.1) that are available to oncologists in general practice. Chemoimmunotherapy, alemtuzumab, or high-dose corticosteroids are all effective as initial therapy for these patients, but progression is generally rapid. If allogeneic immune therapy is to be considered, it should be approached as part of initial or first salvage therapy. The investigational agent flavopiridol has also demonstrated clinical activity in this subset of patients. Identification of small molecules and new treatment approaches for patients with del(17p13.1) is a major focus of several investigators.

Clinical surveys have found that expression of ZAP-70 by CLL cells is apparently a stronger predictor of early disease progression than is the use by CLL cells of unmutated Ig. As such, strategies that respectively monitor or target Ig-receptor signaling in CLL might be very useful in the risk assessment or treatment of this disease.","['Kipps, Thomas J']",['Kipps TJ'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Best Pract Res Clin Haematol,Best practice & research.

This imbalance can occur as a result of increased birth, decreased death, or a combination of the two. CLL has long been considered a disease in which cell accumulation results from decreased death, due to a genetic defect, with minimal birth of the leukemic clone. This view was promulgated when experimental options were limited and observations in vivo and in vitro were less precise--e.g. CLL cells appeared as resting lymphocytes by light microscopy and responded poorly to mitogens (primarily T-cell mitogens)--at a time when T- and B-cell discrimination was not well appreciated. However, recent studies using more sophisticated measures suggest that the initial characterization of CLL biology needs re-evaluation. Using a safe, non-radioactive in-vivo labeling method that permits the determination of CLL-cell birth rates, we have directly documented that a small fraction of the clone (approximately 0.1-1.75%), i.e., between approximately 1x10(9) and 1x10(12) cells are born each day in all patients studied. With this value, we calculated death rates of between 0 and 1x10(12) per day of leukemic cells from individual patients. Thus the dynamic interplay between birth and death that characterizes other leukemias and lymphomas applies to CLL. Therefore, CLL is a disease of both proliferation and accumulation in which a homeostatic balance exists in patients with stable lymphocyte counts or an imbalance exists in patients with rising lymphocyte counts.","['Chiorazzi, Nicholas']",['Chiorazzi N'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Best Pract Res Clin Haematol,Best practice & research.

Tax and serine 133 phosphorylated CREB (pCREB) bound to the HTLV-1 promoter facilitate viral transcription via the recruitment of the large cellular coactivators CBP/p300. While the interaction between the phosphorylated kinase inducible domain (pKID) of pCREB and the KIX domain of CBP/p300 has been well characterized, the molecular interactions between KIX, full-length Tax, and pCREB have not been examined. Here we biochemically characterized the interaction between Tax and KIX in a physiologically relevant complex containing pCREB and vCRE DNA. Our data show that Tax and pCREB simultaneously and independently bind two distinct surfaces on the KIX domain: Tax binds KIX at the previously characterized mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) protein interaction surface while pCREB binds KIX at the pKID-KIX interface. These results provide evidence for a model in which Tax and pCREB bind distinct surfaces of KIX for effective CBP/p300 recruitment to the HTLV-1 promoter. We also show that MLL competes with Tax for KIX binding, suggesting a novel mechanism of Tax oncogenesis in which normal MLL function is disrupted by Tax.","['Ramirez, Julita A', 'Nyborg, Jennifer K']","['Ramirez JA', 'Nyborg JK']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,"['0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (p300-CBP Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'p300-CBP Transcription Factors/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism']",2007/08/21 09:00,2007/12/12 09:00,['2007/08/21 09:00'],"['2007/03/28 00:00 [received]', '2007/06/20 00:00 [revised]', '2007/06/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/08/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/21 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Mol Biol. 2007 Sep 28;372(4):958-969. doi: 10.1016/j.jmb.2007.06.062.

The underlying mechanism of the RUNX/CBFbeta complex in regulation of cell proliferation is still poorly defined. In this study, we demonstrate that the Caenorhabditis elegans CBFbeta homolog, bro-1, is essential for the proliferation, differentiation and specification of a row of stem cell-like lineages, called seam cells. BRO-1 forms complex with the C. elegans RUNX homolog, RNT-1, and augments the DNA-binding activity of RNT-1. The RNT-1/BRO-1 complex directly interacts with the C. elegans Groucho homolog, UNC-37, whose loss of function mutations display similar defects in the proliferation of seam cells as those of bro-1 and rnt-1 mutants.

We propose a simple procedure for classifying or predicting the cancer types of test samples when multiple cancer types and many genes are present. METHOD: The procedure sequentially combines a gene-sort algorithm and a predictive likelihood-based classifier. Genes that have homogeneous patterns of expression measurements across cancer types are of limited interest. Therefore, this algorithm orders genes on the basis of strong heterogeneous patterns. The proposed classifier then selects the first few genes, which are sufficient to classify most training samples correctly via cross validation.

Molecular remission is defined as a reduction in the quantification of BCR-ABL transcripts to an undetectable level by molecular diagnostic methods, and is considered as a surrogate marker for cure or long-term disease control. The molecular diagnostic methods including fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR) are more sensitive than classical cytogenetic analysis for the detection of BCR-ABL positive cells. QRT-PCR, due to its superior sensitivity, is considered the gold standard for the follow-up of Ph+ leukemias treated with imatinib. AIM: The objective of our study was to compare the diagnostic and clinical usefulness of FISH and QRT-PCR at different timepoints for Ph+ leukemias. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We investigated 23 unselected patients with Ph+ CML (n = 21) or Ph+ ALL (n = 2) at 77 different timepoints in a comparative study with both FISH and QRT-PCR using commercially available reagents in a routine laboratory. RESULTS: Our study demonstrated a good correlation of QRT-PCR with FISH in detecting the BCR-ABL fusion gene among patients with CML or ALL (coefficient of correlation = 0.77493, p < 0.0001, using Spearman's correlation procedure). All newly diagnosed or untreated cases were positive with both methods. Lower coefficients of correlation were found when FISH and QRT-PCR were correlated with the white blood cell count (WBC). An overall concordance of FISH and QRT-PCR (being either negative or positive in both tests) was found in 65 cases (84.4%) and a discrepancy identified in 12 cases (15.6%). CONCLUSIONS: We confirm that QRT-PCR allows precise measurement of low levels of BCR-ABL transcripts and can serve as a sensitive indicator for minimal residual disease. In addition, we demonstrate in most cases a good correlation of QRT-PCR with FISH in detecting the BCR-ABL fusion gene among patients with CML or Ph+ ALL. FISH is not suitable for monitoring minimal residual disease.","['Bao, Fei', 'Munker, Reinhold', 'Lowery, Clarissa', 'Martin, Sherry', 'Shi, Runhua', 'Veillon, Diana M', 'Cotelingam, James D', 'Nordberg, Mary Lowery']","['Bao F', 'Munker R', 'Lowery C', 'Martin S', 'Shi R', 'Veillon DM', 'Cotelingam JD', 'Nordberg ML']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",New Zealand,Mol Diagn Ther,Molecular diagnosis & therapy,101264260,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Leukemia/blood/*diagnosis/*metabolism', 'Leukocytes', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods']",2007/08/21 09:00,2007/10/17 09:00,['2007/08/21 09:00'],"['2007/08/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/17 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/21 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Diagn Ther. 2007;11(4):239-45. doi: 10.1007/BF03256245.,"['1144 [pii]', '10.1007/BF03256245 [doi]']",,"['Department of Pathology, Louisiana State University, Shreveport, Louisiana, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment of leukemia cells with a variety of concentrations of CCE (500-2500 microg/microL) for 24 h resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of leukemia cell growth. The cell growth inhibition was accompanied by G(0)/G(1) cell cycle arrest and by a loss of cells in S phase. Futhermore, apoptosis detected as a sub-G(0) cell population and apoptotic DNA fragmentation was observed. More detailed analyses of apoptosis induced by CCE in HL-60 cells revealed that apoptosis progressed through the caspase-9/-3 pathway, as release of cytochrome c, caspase-9/-3 activations and specific proteolytic cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Taken together, the results suggest that CCE exerts an antiproliferative activity on leukemia cells and induces apoptosis of these cells through a mitochondrial/caspase dependent pathway.","['Nadova, S', 'Miadokova, E', 'Mucaji, P', 'Grancai, D', 'Cipak, L']","['Nadova S', 'Miadokova E', 'Mucaji P', 'Grancai D', 'Cipak L']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Phytother Res,Phytotherapy research : PTR,8904486,"['0 (Acetates)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '76845O8NMZ (ethyl acetate)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Acetates/chemistry', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cynara/*chemistry', 'Cytochromes c/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism/pathology', 'Plant Extracts/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Solubility']",2007/08/21 09:00,2008/06/25 09:00,['2007/08/21 09:00'],"['2007/08/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/25 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/21 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Phytother Res. 2008 Feb;22(2):165-8. doi: 10.1002/ptr.2263.,['10.1002/ptr.2263 [doi]'],,"['Department of Genetics, Faculty of Natural Sciences, Comenius University, Mlynska dolina, B-1, 84215 Bratislava, Slovakia.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the TIP60-dependent response to UV-induced DNA damage remain poorly understood. To systematically analyse proteins that regulate TIP60 activity in response to UV irradiation, we performed a proteomic analysis of proteins selectively bound to TIP60 in response to UV irradiation using mass spectrometry and identified a novel regulatory mechanism by which TIP60 orchestrates transcriptional activation of p53-dependent checkpoint response in UV-irradiated cells. The initial step of this pathway involves UV-induced association of TIP60 with SUMO-conjugation enzymes and site-specific sumoylation of TIP60 at lysines 430 and 451 via Ubc9. This sumoylation initiates the relocation of TIP60 from nucleoplasm to the promyelocytic leukemia body, which is essential for the UV-irradiated DNA damage repair response via a p53-dependent pathway. Significantly, inhibition of TIP60 sumoylation by overexpression of non-sumoylatable mutant abrogates the p53-dependent DNA damage response, demonstrating the importance of TIP60 sumoylation in response to UV irradiation. Our biochemical characterization demonstrated that the sumoylation of TIP60 augments its acetyltransferase activity in vitro and in vivo. Thus, this study shed new light on the function and regulation of TIP60 activity in UV-irradiated DNA damage response.","['Cheng, Z', 'Ke, Y', 'Ding, X', 'Wang, F', 'Wang, H', 'Wang, W', 'Ahmed, K', 'Liu, Z', 'Xu, Y', 'Aikhionbare, F', 'Yan, H', 'Liu, J', 'Xue, Y', 'Yu, J', 'Powell, M', 'Liang, S', 'Wu, Q', 'Reddy, S E', 'Hu, R', 'Huang, H', 'Jin, C', 'Yao, X']","['Cheng Z', 'Ke Y', 'Ding X', 'Wang F', 'Wang H', 'Wang W', 'Ahmed K', 'Liu Z', 'Xu Y', 'Aikhionbare F', 'Yan H', 'Liu J', 'Xue Y', 'Yu J', 'Powell M', 'Liang S', 'Wu Q', 'Reddy SE', 'Hu R', 'Huang H', 'Jin C', 'Yao X']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (SUMO1 protein, human)', '0 (Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Histone Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (KAT5 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Lysine Acetyltransferase 5)', 'EC 2.3.2.23 (Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (SENP6 protein, human)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC9)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Bone Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured/radiation effects', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/metabolism', 'DNA Damage/physiology/*radiation effects', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'HeLa Cells', 'Histone Acetyltransferases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kidney/metabolism/pathology', 'Lysine/chemistry', 'Lysine Acetyltransferase 5', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Osteosarcoma/metabolism/pathology', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Proteomics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'SUMO-1 Protein', 'Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes/metabolism', '*Ultraviolet Rays']",2007/08/21 09:00,2008/03/05 09:00,['2007/08/21 09:00'],"['2007/08/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/21 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2008 Feb 7;27(7):931-41. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1210710.

These results suggest that in some cases, megakaryocytes have different clonal abnormalities than surrounding hematopoietic tissue. The genetic profiles of myeloproliferative disorders had several differences from those of myelodysplastic syndromes. Although different from both, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia appeared more similar to myeloproliferative disorders using these techniques.","[""O'Malley, Dennis P"", 'Orazi, Attilio', 'Dunphy, Cherie H', 'Coleman, Benjamin R', 'Marks, Rebecca A', 'Wang, Mingsheng', 'Cheng, Liang']","[""O'Malley DP"", 'Orazi A', 'Dunphy CH', 'Coleman BR', 'Marks RA', 'Wang M', 'Cheng L']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,,IM,"['Bone Marrow Diseases/*genetics', 'Humans', '*Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Megakaryocytes/*physiology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2007/08/21 09:00,2008/01/17 09:00,['2007/08/21 09:00'],"['2007/08/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/17 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/21 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mod Pathol. 2007 Nov;20(11):1166-71. doi: 10.1038/modpathol.3800951.

In this study polyphenolic extract (PPE) of leaves of Ichnocarpus frutescens was evaluated for antitumor activity in vivo. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Murine Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) model was used to assess PPE antitumor activity in vivo. PPE cytotoxicity was determined in vitro in U-937 monocytoid leukemia and K-562 erythroleukemia cell lines. PPE also have been assessed for the free radical scavenging activity against superoxide and nitric oxide radicals. Acute oral toxicity was performed by acute toxic classic method. The total phenolics content was quantified by the Folin-Ciocalteu method. RESULTS: Results of in vivo study showed a significant decrease in tumor volume, viable tumor cell count and a significant increase of life span in the PPE treated group compared to untreated one: the life span of PPE treated animals increased by 53.41% (50 mg PPE/kg) and 73.95% (100 mg PPE/kg). PPE (5, 10 and 20 microg/mL) effectively inhibits in vitro proliferation of U-937 and K-562 cell lines. PPE exhibited pronounced radical scavenging activity with an inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) value of 167.46 microg/mL and 158.52 microg/mL against superoxide and nitric oxide radicals, respectively. CONCLUSION: PPE of Ichnocarpus frutescens possesses strong free radical scavenging activity and anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vivo.","['Kumarappan, C T', 'Mandal, Subhash C']","['Kumarappan CT', 'Mandal SC']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ukraine,Exp Oncol,Experimental oncology,101230541,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Free Radical Scavengers)', '0 (Phenols)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Polyphenols)', '0 (Solvents)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', 'H4N855PNZ1 (alpha-Tocopherol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*therapeutic use', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Body Weight/drug effects', 'Carcinoma, Ehrlich Tumor/drug therapy', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Flavonoids/*chemistry', 'Free Radical Scavengers/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Nitric Oxide/chemistry/metabolism', 'Phenols/*chemistry', 'Plant Extracts/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Plant Leaves/chemistry', 'Polyphenols', 'Solvents/chemistry', 'Superoxides/metabolism', 'Survival Rate', 'Toxicity Tests, Acute', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Tumor Burden/drug effects', 'U937 Cells', 'alpha-Tocopherol/pharmacology']",2007/08/21 09:00,2007/09/29 09:00,['2007/08/21 09:00'],"['2007/08/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/29 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/21 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Oncol. 2007 Jun;29(2):94-101.,['31/609 [pii]'],,"['Pharmacognosy and Phytotherapy Research Laboratory, Division of Pharmacognosy, Department of Pharmaceutical Technology, Faculty of Engineering and Technology, Jadavpur University, Kolkata 700 032, India.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cudraflavanone A was shown to inhibit the activity of topoisomerase I with approximately 0.4 mmol/l 50% inhibitory concentration. A concentration of 6 micromol/l cudraflavanone A caused a 50% growth inhibition of human cancer cell U937. Cudraflavanone A-induced cell death was characterized by the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and pro-caspase-3. Furthermore, cudraflavanone A induced the fragmentation of DNA into multiples of 180 bp (an apoptotic DNA ladder), indicating that the inhibitor triggered apoptosis. This induction of apoptosis by cudraflavanone A was also confirmed using flow-cytometry analysis. In addition, this compound inhibited protein kinase C activity with approximately 150 micromol/l 50% inhibitory concentration.

We compared toxicity of older and younger patients in three randomized trials of adjuvant chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Toxicity data were available for 93% of 6,642 patients enrolled. The three trials included: Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 8541, a comparison of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil in three dose schedules; CALGB 9344: cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin with or without paclitaxel; and CALGB 9741: cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and paclitaxel every 2 versus every 3 weeks. National Cancer Institute grade 3 to 5 toxicities were compared among age groups. RESULTS: Seven percent of patients (n = 458) were age 65 or older, 3% were 70 or older, 38% were 51 to 64, and 55% were 50 or younger. Twenty-four deaths (0.4%) were attributed to treatment; seven (1.5%) of 486 in patients 65 or older, 10 (0.40%) of 2,480 in patients who were 51 to 64 years, and seven (0.19%) of 3,676 occurred in patients younger than 50. In multivariate analysis, older patients were significantly more likely to have grade 4 hematologic toxicity, to have discontinued treatment for toxicity, or to have died of acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome. There were no significant differences in grade 3 to 4 nonhematologic toxicity. CONCLUSION: Healthy older patients who met the strict eligibility criteria for these trials had a higher rate of hematologic toxicity and treatment-related deaths than younger patients, but no increase in nonhematologic toxicity. Elderly patients treated with newer adjuvant chemotherapy regimens derive the same benefits from newer chemotherapy regimens as younger patients but should be cautioned about the increased risk of toxicity and treatment-related death.","['Muss, Hyman B', 'Berry, Donald A', 'Cirrincione, Constance', 'Budman, Daniel R', 'Henderson, I Craig', 'Citron, Marc L', 'Norton, Larry', 'Winer, Eric P', 'Hudis, Clifford A']","['Muss HB', 'Berry DA', 'Cirrincione C', 'Budman DR', 'Henderson IC', 'Citron ML', 'Norton L', 'Winer EP', 'Hudis CA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant/adverse effects', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/chemically induced', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/chemically induced', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/chemically induced', 'Paclitaxel/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",2007/08/21 09:00,2007/09/13 09:00,['2007/08/21 09:00'],"['2007/08/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/13 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/21 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2007 Aug 20;25(24):3699-704. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2007.10.9710.,"['25/24/3699 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2007.10.9710 [doi]']",,"['University of Vermont, Vermont Cancer Center, Burlington, VT 05405, USA. hyman.muss@uvm.edu']","['CA32291/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA35279/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA60138/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77406/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77651/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CAII028/PHS HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,['Cancer and Leukemia Group B Experience'],,,,,,,,,,,

Cancer and related treatments represent additional challenges for teens navigating the transition from childhood to adulthood. This study was conducted to evaluate behavioral and social outcomes of adolescent childhood cancer survivors using data from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated 2,979 survivors and 649 siblings of cancer survivors to determine the incidence of difficulty in six behavioral and social domains (depression/anxiety, headstrong, attention deficit, peer conflict/social withdrawal, antisocial behaviors, and social competence). Outcomes were determined by calculating parent-reported scores to questions from the behavior problem index. RESULTS: Survivors and siblings were similar in age at the time of interview (mean: 14.8, survivors; 14.9, siblings; range, 12 to 17 years). Overall, multivariate analyses showed that survivors were 1.5 times (99% CI, 1.1 to 2.1) more likely than siblings to have symptoms of depression/anxiety and 1.7 times (99% CI, 1.3 to 2.2) more likely to have antisocial behaviors. Scores in the depression/anxiety, attention deficit, and antisocial domains were significantly elevated in adolescents treated for leukemia or CNS tumors when compared with siblings. In addition, survivors of neuroblastoma had difficulty in the depression/anxiety and antisocial domains. Treatments with cranial radiation and/or intrathecal methotrexate were specific risk factors. CONCLUSION: Adolescent survivors of childhood cancer, especially those with a history of leukemia, CNS tumors, or neuroblastoma, may be at increased risk for adverse behavioral and social outcomes.

There is a genetic component to the risk of AML within the general population, and low penetrance variant alleles encoding DNA repair enzymes have been genetically implicated in therapy-related AML susceptibility. However, what is largely ignored is that target cell number, which defines the number of genomes at risk from DNA damaging agents, is also part of the equation that defines risk. We will review the evidence from genetic studies of inbred mouse models that target cell frequency is a risk factor in radiation leukaemogenesis. Inbred mouse strains that differ in their susceptibility to radiation-induced r-AML and thymic lymphoma (r-TL), spontaneous TL and pristane-induced plasmacytoma (PCT) have been exploited to identify susceptibility loci. The target cell in AML is the haemopoietic stem cell, whereas TLs and PCT arise from more mature lymphoid progenitor cells. Inbred mice also differ significantly in all aspects of haemopoiesis, and these differences have been used to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) that determine the frequency of specific haemopoietic stem, progenitor or mature blood cells. The co-localization of QTL that determine risk and target cell frequency in all three haemopoietic malignancies is strong evidence that target cell frequency is a risk factor in radiation leukaemogenesis.","['Jawad, M', 'Giotopoulos, G', 'Cole, C', 'Plumb, M']","['Jawad M', 'Giotopoulos G', 'Cole C', 'Plumb M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Br J Radiol,The British journal of radiology,0373125,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/etiology/*genetics', 'Lymphoma/etiology/genetics', 'Mice', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Risk Factors']",2007/08/22 09:00,2007/10/16 09:00,['2007/08/22 09:00'],"['2007/08/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/16 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/22 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Radiol. 2007 Sep;80 Spec No 1:S56-62. doi: 10.1259/bjr/99530445.,"['80/Special_Issue_1/S56 [pii]', '10.1259/bjr/99530445 [doi]']",,"['Department of Genetics, University of Leicester, University Road, Leicester LE1 7RH, UK.']",,60,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In general, ATRA is well-tolerated but may be associated with a potentially lethal side-effect, referred to as retinoic acid or differentiation syndrome (DS). The cellular and molecular mechanisms of DS are poorly understood and involve changes in the adhesive qualities and cytokine secretion of leukemic cells during ATRA-induced differentiation. As leukocyte extravasation is a key event in DS pathogenesis, we analyzed the association between the polymorphisms at Exon 4 (G241R) and Exon 6 (E469K) of ICAM-1 and Exon 3 (L125V) of PECAM-1 genes with DS development in APL patients treated with ATRA and anthracyclines. DS was diagnosed in 23/127 (18.1%) APL patients at an average of 11.5 days after the start of ATRA. All patients presented respiratory distress associated with increased ground-glass opacity in chest radiographies. Other accompanying symptoms were: fever not attributable to infection (65.2%), generalized edema (37.5%), weight gain (37.5%), and impairment of renal function (8.6%). We detected an association between development of DS and the AA genotype at Codon 469 of ICAM-1 (odds ratio of 3.5; 95% confidence interval: 1.2-10.2). Conversely, no significant association was detected between G241R or L125V polymorphisms at Exon 4 of ICAM-1 and Exon 3 of PECAM-1, respectively. Our results suggest that susceptibility to DS in APL patients may be influenced by genetic variation in adhesion molecule loci.","['Dore, Adriana I', 'Santana-Lemos, Barbara A A', 'Coser, Virginia M', 'Santos, Flavia L S', 'Dalmazzo, Leandro F', 'Lima, Ana S G', 'Jacomo, Rafael H', 'Elias, Jorge Jr', 'Falcao, Roberto Passetto', 'Pereira, Waldir V', 'Rego, Eduardo M']","['Dore AI', 'Santana-Lemos BA', 'Coser VM', 'Santos FL', 'Dalmazzo LF', 'Lima AS', 'Jacomo RH', 'Elias J Jr', 'Falcao RP', 'Pereira WV', 'Rego EM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Exons/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/complications/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Genetic/*genetics', 'Syndrome', 'Tretinoin/adverse effects']",2007/08/21 09:00,2007/12/07 09:00,['2007/08/21 09:00'],"['2007/08/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/21 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2007 Nov;82(5):1340-3. doi: 10.1189/jlb.0207095.

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a hematopoietic stem cell disorder for which interferon-alpha has demonstrated substantial activity. In the 1980s interferon-alpha became first-line therapy for patients with chronic-phase CML, not eligible for allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Following the discovery of the leukemic oncogene BCR/ABL and its causal association with CML, the potent BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate was developed. Imatinib proved to be superior to interferon-alpha in all outcome measures, making imatinib the new standard of care for patients with CML. There is both clinical and laboratory evidence suggesting imatinib therapy alone is not curative in CML, whereas IFN has induced a low but reproducible curative effect in some patients. This unique activity may be the basis for the reincorporation of IFN into the management of CML. These observations may be best explained by imatinib's negligible activity against the leukemic stem cell (LSC) population. This review discusses the history of interferon-alpha in the treatment of CML, the evolution of molecularly targeted therapies, and some of the lessons we have learned from years of informative research in CML. It also explores the new challenge of managing minimal residual disease in the imatinib era, and addresses the promising role for LSC-directed therapies in the future treatment of CML.","['Kujawski, Lisa A', 'Talpaz, Moshe']","['Kujawski LA', 'Talpaz M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Cytokine Growth Factor Rev,Cytokine & growth factor reviews,9612306,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use']",2007/08/21 09:00,2008/01/04 09:00,['2007/08/21 09:00'],"['2007/08/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/04 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/21 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2007 Oct-Dec;18(5-6):459-71. doi: 10.1016/j.cytogfr.2007.06.015.

The present study was an evaluation of proliferation, cytotoxicity and differentiation of harmine and harmaline on HL60 cells, alone or in combination with ATRA and G-CSF. Counting of cells, viability, MTT assay, morphology, NBT reduction and flow cytometry analysis were performed using CD11b and CD 14 monoclonal antibodies. The data showed that harmine and harmaline reduced proliferation in dose and time dependent manner. Optimal antiproliferative concentration of these agents was chosen. However, both agents in higher doses were cytotoxic. Combination of ATRA, G-CSF and each agent alone, particularly harmaline in optimal dose, resulted in partially additive decrease in cell proliferation. Cells treated with both harmaline and ATRA demonstrated some morphological changes and NBT positivity, but the extent of changes observed following treatment with harmaline was less than ATRA. Flow cytometric analysis showed that ATRA induced a neutrophilic differentiation, while harmaline led to a predominantly monocytic differentiation. Combination of harmine and harmaline with ATRA and G-CSF did not change the extent of differentiation, and the cells differentiated into the neutrophilic lineage. This shows that the direction of differentiation is dominantly determined by ATRA. These preliminary data implies a new approach in treatment of leukemia.","['Zaker, Farhad', 'Oody, Arezo', 'Arjmand, Alireza']","['Zaker F', 'Oody A', 'Arjmand A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Korea (South),Arch Pharm Res,Archives of pharmacal research,8000036,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '4FHH5G48T7 (Harmine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'CN58I4TOET (Harmaline)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Harmaline/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Harmine/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Peganum/*chemistry', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",2007/08/21 09:00,2007/10/10 09:00,['2007/08/21 09:00'],"['2007/08/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/21 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Pharm Res. 2007 Jul;30(7):844-9. doi: 10.1007/BF02978835.,['10.1007/BF02978835 [doi]'],,"['Iran University of Medical sciences, Department of Hematology and Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Tehran. farhadz20@yahoo.co.uk']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Poor discrimination between ZAP-70 positive and negative cells hampers routine application of flow cytometry. We examined the usefulness of FACS Lysing Solution. METHODS: ZAP-70 expression in 65 healthy volunteers was measured by four-color flow cytometry, comparing FACS Lysing Solution for fixation and permeabilization with the Fix & Perm kit. Separation between ZAP-70 positive T cells and negative B cells was based on a ratio of median ZAP-70 staining of T cells to B cells. In 25 B-CLL patients, ZAP-70 expression was estimated using the lower limit of the fluorescence range corresponding with 98% of ZAP-70 positive T cells as threshold marker as well as a ratio of B-CLL cell to internal T-cell median ZAP-70 staining. RESULTS: Use of FACS Lysing Solution resulted in approximately fourfold increased separation between ZAP-70 positive T cells and negative B cells, when compared with the Fix & Perm kit. In B-CLL samples, ZAP-70 negative and positive B-cell expression could be clearly discerned.

It triggers apoptosis by inhibiting de novo transcription of the short-lived Mcl-1 protein, but it is unknown how this leads to Bax/Bak activation that is required for most forms of cell death. Here, we studied the effects of seliciclib in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), a malignancy with aberrant expression of apoptosis regulators. Although seliciclib-induced Mcl-1 degradation within 4 h, Bax/Bak activation occurred between 16 and 20 h. During this period, no transcriptional changes in apoptosis-related genes occurred. In untreated cells, prosurvival Mcl-1 was engaged by the proapoptotic proteins Noxa and Bim. Upon drug treatment, Bim was quickly released. The contribution of Noxa and Bim as a specific mediator of seliciclib-induced apoptosis was demonstrated via RNAi. Significantly, 16 h after seliciclib treatment, there was accumulation of Bcl-2, Bim and Bax in the 'mitochondria-rich' insoluble fraction of the cell. This suggests that after Mcl-1 degradation, the remaining apoptosis neutralizing capacity of Bcl-2 is gradually overwhelmed, until Bax forms large multimeric pores in the mitochondria. These data demonstrate in primary leukemic cells hierarchical binding and crosstalk among Bcl-2 members, and suggest that their functional interdependence can be exploited therapeutically.","['Hallaert, D Y H', 'Spijker, R', 'Jak, M', 'Derks, I A M', 'Alves, N L', 'Wensveen, F M', 'de Boer, J P', 'de Jong, D', 'Green, S R', 'van Oers, M H J', 'Eldering, E']","['Hallaert DY', 'Spijker R', 'Jak M', 'Derks IA', 'Alves NL', 'Wensveen FM', 'de Boer JP', 'de Jong D', 'Green SR', 'van Oers MH', 'Eldering E']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BAK1 protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0ES1C2KQ94 (Roscovitine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Purines/*pharmacology', 'RNA Interference', 'Roscovitine', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",2007/08/19 09:00,2008/01/23 09:00,['2007/08/19 09:00'],"['2007/08/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/23 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2007 Nov;14(11):1958-67. doi: 10.1038/sj.cdd.4402211.

Parsing the regulation of interleukin-6-type cytokine signaling.,126-41,"Activation of the transcription factor signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) 3 is a defining feature of the interleukin (IL)-6 family of cytokines, which include IL-6, leukemia inhibitory factor, and cardiotrophin-1. These cytokines, as well as STAT3 activation, have been shown to be protective for cardiac myocytes and necessary for ischemia preconditioning. However, the mechanisms that regulate IL-6-type cytokine signaling in cardiac myocytes are largely unexplored. We propose that the protective character of IL-6-type cytokine signaling in cardiac myocytes is determined principally by three mechanisms: redox status of the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Janus kinase 1 (JAK) 1 that activates STAT3, phosphorylation of STAT3 within the transcriptional activation domain on serine 727, and STAT3-mediated induction of suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) 3 that terminates IL-6-type cytokine signaling. Moreover, we hypothesize that hyperactivation of the JAK kinases, particularly JAK2, mismatched STAT3 serine-tyrosine phosphorylation or heightened STAT3 transcriptional activity, and SOCS3 induction may ultimately prove detrimental. Here we summarize recent evidence that supports this hypothesis, as well as additional possible mechanisms of JAK-STAT regulation. Understanding how IL-6-type cytokine signaling is regulated in cardiac myocytes has great significance for exploiting the therapeutic potential of these cytokines and the phenomenon of preconditioning.","['Kurdi, Mazen', 'Booz, George W']","['Kurdi M', 'Booz GW']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,J Cardiovasc Pharmacol,Journal of cardiovascular pharmacology,7902492,"['0 (Cardiovascular Agents)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (SOCS3 protein, human)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cardiovascular Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Heart Diseases/*drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*metabolism', 'Janus Kinase 1/drug effects/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins/drug effects/metabolism']",2007/08/19 09:00,2007/10/27 09:00,['2007/08/19 09:00'],"['2007/08/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/27 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cardiovasc Pharmacol. 2007 Aug;50(2):126-41. doi: 10.1097/FJC.0b013e318068dd49.,"['10.1097/FJC.0b013e318068dd49 [doi]', '00005344-200708000-00005 [pii]']",,"['Division of Molecular Cardiology, Cardiovascular Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Texas A&M University System Health Science Center, College Station, TX 76504, USA.']",,180,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mutational status of the immunoglobulin variable heavy chain region (IGHV) has been used to classify patients into 2 groups in terms of overall survival (OS) and clinical characteristics, but the labor-intensive nature and the cost of this time-consuming analysis has prompted investigations of surrogate markers. METHODS: We developed a standardized quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR (qPCR) method to measure zeta-chain (TCR)-associated protein kinase (ZAP70) mRNA in purified CD19(+) cells. We evaluated this and other methods (flow cytometry analyses of ZAP70 and CD38 proteins and qPCR analysis of lipoprotein lipase mRNA) in a cohort of 108 patients (median follow-up, 82 months) to evaluate any associations with IGHV mutational status, OS, and treatment-free survival (TFS). RESULTS: The association between qPCR-measured ZAP70 and IGHV mutational status was statistically significant [chi(2) (1) = 50.95; P <0.0001], and the value of Cramer's V statistic (0.72) indicated a very strong relation. This method also demonstrated sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of 87.8%, 85.7%, 87.5%, and 86%, respectively. ZAP70 expression was significantly associated with OS (P = 0.0021) and TFS (P <0.0001). ZAP70(+) patients had significantly shorter median TFS (24 months) than ZAP70(-) patients (157 months) (P <0.0001). Moreover, qPCR-measured ZAP70 expression has greater prognostic power than IGHV mutational status and the other prognostic markers tested.

At the beginning of the 1990's, the alkeran-prednisone combination was the golden standard in the treatment of myeloma. In the mid 1990's, the treatment results in younger patients were dramatically improved by high-dose chemotherapy with autologous transplantation. The first decade of the new millennium has brought about even better results after the introduction of thalidomide in the initial treatment in patients not indicated for transplantation. Improvement is also expected in patients of a younger age group thanks to the combination of new drugs with autologous transplantation. A breakthrough in the treatment of patients with diffuse large cell lymphoma was the introduction in the treatment regimen of high-dose chemotherapy with autologous transplantation, and primarily the introduction of a new drug--a monoclonal antibody antiCD20, rituximab, in initial treatment. The golden standard for patients with chronic leukaemia in the early 1990's was hydroxyurea treatment. This was replaced by a new golden standard--interferon alpha, which was, in turn, replaced by the specific blocker of bcr-abl thyrosine kinase-imatinib.

In some patients, CCA/Ph-negative status was associated with myelodysplasia or acute myeloid leukemia. The objective of the current study was to determine the prognostic impact of CCA/Ph-negative cells. METHODS: The authors compared the pretherapeutic risk factors (Kruskall-Wallis test), exposure to cytotoxic drugs (chi-square test), and overall and progression-free survival (Kaplan-Meyer and logistic regression analysis, respectively) of 515 patients with mostly chronic-phase CML who were treated with imatinib mesylate after failure of interferon-alpha according to whether they attained a major cytogenetic response (MCR) (n = 324 patients), an MCR with CCA/Ph-negative status (n = 30 patients), or no MCR (n = 161 patients). RESULTS: CCA/Ph-negative status most frequently involved chromosomes Y, 8, and 7. No significant differences in pretherapeutic risk factors were detected between patients who attained an MCR with and without CCA/Ph-negative cells, except that exposure to alkylating agents was more frequent in patients with CCA/Ph-negative cells, and overall and progression-free survival were identical. With a median follow-up of 51 months, only 2 patients developed myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). CONCLUSIONS: The overall prognosis for patients who had CML with CCA/Ph-negative status was good and was driven by the CML response to imatinib mesylate. Isolated CCA/Ph-negative cells in the absence of morphologic evidence of MDS do not justify a change in therapy.","['Deininger, Michael W N', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Paquette, Ron', 'Park, Byung', 'Hochhaus, Andreas', 'Baccarani, Michele', 'Stone, Richard', 'Fischer, Thomas', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Niederwieser, Dietger', 'Gambacorti-Passerini, Carlo', 'So, Charlene', 'Gathmann, Insa', 'Goldman, John M', 'Smith, Douglas', 'Druker, Brian J', 'Guilhot, Francois']","['Deininger MW', 'Cortes J', 'Paquette R', 'Park B', 'Hochhaus A', 'Baccarani M', 'Stone R', 'Fischer T', 'Kantarjian H', 'Niederwieser D', 'Gambacorti-Passerini C', 'So C', 'Gathmann I', 'Goldman JM', 'Smith D', 'Druker BJ', 'Guilhot F']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Chi-Square Distribution', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic, Atypical, BCR-ABL Negative/*drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/chemically induced', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced', 'Piperazines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Pyrimidines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Thrombocytopenia/chemically induced', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Outcome']",2007/08/19 09:00,2007/10/25 09:00,['2007/08/19 09:00'],"['2007/08/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/25 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 2007 Oct 1;110(7):1509-19. doi: 10.1002/cncr.22936.,['10.1002/cncr.22936 [doi]'],,"['Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Oregon Health & Science University Cancer Institute, Portland, Oregon 97239, USA. deininge@ohsu.edu']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chromosomal abnormalities in ALL have been frequently described, the most common is the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph). The resulting fusion gene, BCR-ABL1, encodes for a chimerical oncoprotein (BCR-ABL) with constitutive tyrosine kinase activity, which leads to uncontrolled cell proliferation, reduced apoptosis, and impaired cell adhesion. Treating Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) ALL patients with conventional chemotherapy has not substantially improved their long-term outcomes. Recently, however, BCR-ABL-targeted strategies have been successfully adopted. Imatinib is an oral competitive inhibitor of ABL with demonstrated phase 2 efficacy in patients with treatment-naive and pretreated ALL. Despite its efficacy, imatinib may induce specific resistance in a large proportion of patients, mainly because of the occurrence of ABL1 mutations. Therefore, novel inhibitors have been developed. Dasatinib is a multitargeted kinase inhibitor of BCR-ABL, SRC, C-KIT, PDGFRs, and ephrin A receptor kinases. Unlike imatinib, it binds both the active and inactive BCR-ABL as well as the majority of ABL mutants. Dasatinib is approved for treatment of imatinib-pretreated Ph+ ALL, and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) on the basis of phase 2 trials that demonstrated impressive efficacy and favorable tolerability profiles. Nilotinib is another BCR-ABL targeted agent that is similar in structure to imatinib but has significantly greater binding affinity. It also has demonstrated promising efficacy in Ph+ ALL but is still being evaluated in phase 2 trials. In this article, the authors reviewed current knowledge on novel tyrosine-kinase inhibitors in adult Ph+ ALL patients.","['Piccaluga, Pier Paolo', 'Paolini, Stefania', 'Martinelli, Giovanni']","['Piccaluga PP', 'Paolini S', 'Martinelli G']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Dasatinib', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Analysis', 'Thiazoles/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",2007/08/19 09:00,2007/10/12 09:00,['2007/08/19 09:00'],"['2007/08/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 2007 Sep 15;110(6):1178-86. doi: 10.1002/cncr.22881.,['10.1002/cncr.22881 [doi]'],['(c) 2007 American Cancer Society.'],"['Institute of Hematology and Medical Oncology L and A Seragnoli S.

We report here that CD8(+) T cells were the dominant T lymphocytes seen and T-cell repertoire diversity decreased dramatically during the first 3 months after allo-HSCT. Patients with GVHD grade II - IV had significantly lower T-cell repertoire diversity compared with non-GVHD patients. TCR beta variable gene (TCRBV) subfamily 8, 5.1, 5.2, 4, and 13 were the five most frequently expanded subfamilies among these patients. Among the 49 over-expanded clones identified, clonotype ""TCR3-5"" and ""TCR18-5"" were isolated from four patients with HLA-A2 allele and skin GVHD. Their frequencies correlated well with skin symptoms (i.e. rash). Moreover, they were detected in donors but not detected in recipients before transplantation. Lastly, three common TCRBV CDR3 motifs shared by T cells related with GVHD were discovered: TGDS, GLAG, and GGG. These findings suggest that TCR spectratyping is helpful for revealing GVHD-related T cells and may have utility in early diagnosis.","['Du, Jin-Wei', 'Gu, Jiang-Ying', 'Liu, Jing', 'Cen, Xi-Nan', 'Zhang, Ying', 'Ou, Yuan', 'Chu, Bin', 'Zhu, Ping']","['Du JW', 'Gu JY', 'Liu J', 'Cen XN', 'Zhang Y', 'Ou Y', 'Chu B', 'Zhu P']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Complementarity Determining Regions)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Child', 'Complementarity Determining Regions/analysis', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*diagnosis/immunology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/immunology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', '*Transplantation, Homologous']",2007/08/19 09:00,2007/11/09 09:00,['2007/08/19 09:00'],"['2007/08/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/09 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2007 Aug;48(8):1618-27. doi: 10.1080/10428190701474357.,"['781277715 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190701474357 [doi]']",,"['Department of Hematology, Peking University First Hospital, West District, Beijing, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

P upregulated TLR-4 in U937, and HNP1 - 3, LL-37, IRAK-2, and IRAK-4 in multiple lines and RU486 down regulated these.

To study targeted killing effects of cytosine deaminase (CD)-thymidine kinase (TK) fusion suicide gene on multi-drug resistant leukemia, the CD-TK fusion suicide gene expression vector driven by mdr1 promoter was constructed and transferred into K562 and K562/A02 cells using lipofectintrade mark 2000. RT-PCR was used to demonstrate that there were CD and TK genes expression in K562/A02 cells, but not in K562 cells. MTT analysis showed that, compared with that in K562/CDTK, the survival rate of K562/A02-CDTK cells decreased and at the same time the apoptotic rate increased after treatment with GCV and 5-FC (P < 0.05). In vivo studies showed that the tumor volume in the prodrug treated K562/A02-CDTK groups was significantly less than that in the NS-control and K562-CDTK groups (P < 0.05).

In the present work, we investigated the effects of hyperforin on the activity of P-gp/MDR1, an ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transporter putatively involved in multidrug resistance (MDR). Ex vivo treatment of CLL cells with HF markedly impaired the activity of P-gp, as measured by the inhibition of the capacity of the treated cells to efflux the rhodamine 123 probe. In addition, most CLL cells expressed breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), another ABC transporter. The activity of BCRP was also inhibited by HF, as assessed by the impaired capacity of HF-treated CLL cells to efflux the specific probe mitoxantrone. The capacity of HF to reverse P-gp and BCRP activity was confirmed in myeloid leukaemia cell lines, notably in HL-60/DNR cells selected for their resistance to daunorubicine and overexpressing P-gp. Our results therefore suggest that HF might be of interest in the therapy of CLL and other haematological malignancies through its potential capacity to revert MDR in addition to its pro-apoptotic properties.","['Quiney, Claire', 'Billard, Christian', 'Faussat, Anne-Marie', 'Salanoubat, Celia', 'Kolb, Jean-Pierre']","['Quiney C', 'Billard C', 'Faussat AM', 'Salanoubat C', 'Kolb JP']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (ABCG2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Terpenes)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'DHD7FFG6YS (Phloroglucinol)', 'RM741E34FP (hyperforin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds/pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/pharmacology', 'Myeloid Cells/drug effects', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Phloroglucinol/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Terpenes/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",2007/08/19 09:00,2007/11/09 09:00,['2007/08/19 09:00'],"['2007/08/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/09 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2007 Aug;48(8):1587-99. doi: 10.1080/10428190701474332.,"['781269415 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190701474332 [doi]']",,"['UMRS 872 INSERM, Universite Paris 6, Centre de Recherche des Cordeliers, Paris, France.']",,,['Leuk Lymphoma. 2007 Aug;48(8):1470-1.

Five haematological patients with IFR were treated with systemic antifungal therapy and endoscopic surgical debridement of infected tissues, followed by amphotericin-B directly instilled in the sinuses by a new type of ethmoidal drainage.

Fifty-six patients with hematologic malignancies (age 24 +/- 5.5) had cryopreserved ovarian tissue. Thirty-three patients had Hodgkin's disease, 14 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 6 acute leukemia, and 3 chronic myelocytic leukemia. Harvesting of ovarian tissue was also performed following previous exposure to chemotherapy (33 patients), 13 of them shortly after the chemotherapy. Partial oophorectomy was the preferred surgical procedure. Fertility was restored with ovarian tissue transplantation in a sterilized patient and following fertility treatment in a patient with very low ovarian reserve. We recommend that indications and timing of ovarian tissue banking should be individualized. Patients previously exposed to chemotherapy can consider ovarian tissue freezing. The extent of tissue removed should take into account the large number of follicles lost and the risk of future sterilization.

Moreover, the involvement of the FIP1L1-alphaPDGFR fusion gene resulting from a cryptic del (4)(q12q12) was examined in 24 cases. The FIP1L1-alphaPDGFR messenger RNA (mRNA) was detected in three patients (13% of patients fulfilled WHO criteria and 17% of Chusid criteria). One had a novel fusion transcript, which skipped the exon 12 of alphaPDGFR. The transcript appears to be generated by a splicing mechanism that is different from the previously reported splicing patterns. In silico analysis, the exon skipping was not related to a disruption of the exonic splicing enhancers within the exon but strongly associated with the loss of the vast majority of the FIP1L intron 8a where intronic splicing enhancers were accumulated. Unexpectedly, pseudo-chimera DNA fragments with some shared characteristic features were occasionally generated from healthy control samples by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Considering the relatively low incidence of the FIP1L1-alphaPDGFR transcript positive case, extreme care must therefore be taken when making a diagnosis using RT-PCR before imatinib therapy.","['Sada, Akiko', 'Katayama, Yoshio', 'Yamamoto, Katsuya', 'Okuyama, Shin', 'Nakata, Hideshi', 'Shimada, Hirotoshi', 'Oshimi, Kazuo', 'Mori, Mayumi', 'Matsui, Toshimitsu']","['Sada A', 'Katayama Y', 'Yamamoto K', 'Okuyama S', 'Nakata H', 'Shimada H', 'Oshimi K', 'Mori M', 'Matsui T']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Exons/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypereosinophilic Syndrome/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Introns/genetics', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/analysis/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha/analysis/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Deletion', 'mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors/analysis/biosynthesis/*genetics']",2007/08/19 09:00,2008/03/20 09:00,['2007/08/19 09:00'],"['2007/06/16 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/20 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2007 Dec;86(12):855-63. doi: 10.1007/s00277-007-0357-8.

METHODS: Nine cases of mass-forming pancreatitis were divided into two groups, one consisting of cases that met the histological diagnostic criteria for AIP by the Japan Pancreas Society (JPS) and the other consisting of cases which did not. Histological findings, immunohistological findings, and pancreatograms were compared between these groups. RESULTS: Six cases met the histological criteria of JPS (group A) and the other three did not (group B). In the mass-forming portion in group A, the wall of the pancreatic duct showed marked thickening. However, the epithelium was well preserved, and dilatation of the branch ducts or protein plugs were rarely observed. All cases showed marked obliterative phlebitis. The IgG4 labeling index (LI) was 25% or more in all but one case. In the portion other than the mass, the lobular structure was well preserved and the IgG4 LI was less than 10%. The pancreatogram showed localized stenosis or obstruction at the site of the mass associated with a normal-appearing main pancreatic duct in the remaining portion. In group B, histological findings typical of chronic pancreatitis with dilated branch ducts and protein plugs were observed. Obliterative phlebitis was not confirmed. The IgG4 LI in the mass-forming portion was low (2.3%-11.1%).

This retrospective study included 96 patients with a diagnosis of cGVHD from a cohort of 119 patients with a prior history of acute GVHD. The median TTF was 73 days after the diagnosis of cGVHD. The 2-year cumulative incidences of first, second and third episodes of flare-up (FU) during courses of cGVHD were estimated as 69.5, 46.4 and 22.1%. Those patients who did not have an episode of FU of cGVHD had 96.0% of 2-years GSS rate, while those with 1 and > or =2 episodes had 50.8 and 46.8%, respectively (P=0.001). Shorter TTF was associated with poor GSS and decreased overall survival. The shorter TTF during the course of cGVHD was significantly associated with extensive cGVHD (P=0.002), Hopkins' risk category (P=0.022) and progressive-type cGVHD (P<0.001) in multivariate analysis.

In this study, we examined whether activation of endogenous Abl kinases affects transformation, proliferation and survival, which are major contributors to breast cancer development and metastatic progression. Using a pharmacological inhibitor and RNAi, we demonstrate that activation of endogenous Abl kinases dramatically promotes breast cancer cell proliferation and anchorage-independent growth in serum, as well as survival following nutrient deprivation. Activation of Abl kinases mediates phosphorylation of STAT3, and promotes proliferation by accelerating G(1) --> S progression. Moreover, we identify IGF-1R as a novel upstream activator of endogenous Abl kinases, and demonstrate that Abl kinase activation is required for IGF-1-stimulated cell cycle progression in breast cancer cells. Since activation of Abl kinases affects multiple steps of breast cancer development and progression, Abl kinase inhibitors are likely to be effective agents for the treatment of breast cancers containing highly active Abl kinases.","['Srinivasan, D', 'Sims, J T', 'Plattner, R']","['Srinivasan D', 'Sims JT', 'Plattner R']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,['EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)'],IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/*enzymology/pathology', 'Cell Adhesion/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Enzyme Activation/physiology', 'Female', 'Genes, abl/physiology', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/*physiology']",2007/08/19 09:00,2008/03/04 09:00,['2007/08/19 09:00'],"['2007/08/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/04 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2008 Feb 14;27(8):1095-105. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1210714.

The aim of this study was to identify polymorphisms in the genes encoding phase I and II drug metabolizing enzymes associated with the risk of relapse or death in a cohort of 209 children with neuroblastoma. METHODS: Real-time PCR allelic discrimination was used to characterize the presence of polymorphisms in DNA from children with neuroblastoma.

The influence of selected factors on event-free survival was tested using the Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: As previously reported, amplification of MYCN (hazards ratio=4.25, 95% confidence interval=2.76-6.56, P<0.001), unfavorable stage (hazard ratio=4.14, 95% confidence interval=2.3-7.47, P<0.001) or age more than 1 year at diagnosis (hazard ratio=1.86, 95% confidence interval=1.19-2.92, P=0.007) were all associated with an increased risk of relapse or death. Carriers of a NAT1*11 allele variant were significantly less likely to relapse or die compared with those with NAT1*10 or other NAT1 allele variants (P<0.001). In multivariate analysis, children who were GSTM1 null were more likely to relapse or die during follow-up after adjusting for MYCN amplification, stage and age at diagnosis (hazard ratio=1.6, 95% confidence interval=1.02-2.9, P=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: These observations suggest that the NAT1*11 variant and the GSTM1 wild-type genotype contribute to a more favorable outcome in patients treated for neuroblastoma and are the first to demonstrate a relationship between NAT1 and GSTM1 genotypes in childhood neuroblastoma.","['Ashton, Lesley J', 'Murray, Jayne E', 'Haber, Michelle', 'Marshall, Glenn M', 'Ashley, David M', 'Norris, Murray D']","['Ashton LJ', 'Murray JE', 'Haber M', 'Marshall GM', 'Ashley DM', 'Norris MD']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pharmacogenet Genomics,Pharmacogenetics and genomics,101231005,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (MYCN protein, human)', '0 (N-Myc Proto-Oncogene Protein)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Pharmaceutical Preparations)', '9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)', 'EC 2.3.1.5 (Arylamine N-Acetyltransferase)', 'EC 2.3.1.5 (N-acetyltransferase 1)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (glutathione S-transferase M1)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Alleles', 'Arylamine N-Acetyltransferase/genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/genetics', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Glutathione Transferase/genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Isoenzymes/genetics', 'Male', 'N-Myc Proto-Oncogene Protein', 'Neuroblastoma/*enzymology/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations/*metabolism', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Prognosis']",2007/08/19 09:00,2007/11/09 09:00,['2007/08/19 09:00'],"['2007/08/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/09 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pharmacogenet Genomics. 2007 Sep;17(9):709-17. doi: 10.1097/FPC.0b013e3280e1cc92.,"['10.1097/FPC.0b013e3280e1cc92 [doi]', '01213011-200709000-00004 [pii]']",,"[""Children's Cancer Institute Australia for Medical Research, Randwick, New South Wales, Australia. lashton@ccia.unsw.edu.au""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ultrasonography showed bilateral hydronephrosis and a large pelvic mass displacing the uterus. Pelvic mass biopsy showed fibroadipose tissue with diffuse neoplastic cell infiltration and immunostaining was positive for leukocyte common antigen (LCA) and myeloperoxidase consistent with myeloid sarcoma. Bone marrow biopsy revealed 63% myeloblasts. The patient died the 17th day of induction therapy. We came across only four MS cases in English literature that presented with ARF. To our knowledge, this case is the first description of myeloid sarcoma presenting with ARF and bilateral ureteral obstruction not originating from urogenital system.

In this study, we show that PDE4 inhibitors up-regulate glucocorticoid receptor (GRalpha) transcript levels in B-CLL cells but not T-CLL cells or Sezary cells or normal circulating T cells, B cells, monocytes, or neutrophils. Because GRalpha transcript half-life does not vary in CLL cells treated with the prototypic PDE4 inhibitor rolipram, the 4-fold increase in GRalpha mRNA levels observed within 4 h of rolipram treatment seems to result from an increase in GRalpha transcription. Rolipram treatment increases levels of transcripts derived from the 1A3 promoter to a greater extent than the 1B promoter. Treatment of B-CLL cells with two other PDE4 inhibitors currently in clinical development also augments GR transcript levels and glucocorticoid-mediated apoptosis. Washout studies show that simultaneous treatment with both drug classes irreversibly augments apoptosis over the same time frame that GR up-regulation occurs. Although treatment of B-CLL cells with glucocorticoids reduces basal GRalpha transcript levels in a dose-related manner, cotreatment with rolipram maintained GRalpha transcript levels above baseline. Our results suggest that as a result of their unusual sensitivity to PDE4 inhibitor-mediated up-regulation of GRalpha expression, treatment of B-CLL patients with combined PDE4 inhibitor/glucocorticoid therapy may be of therapeutic benefit in this disease.","['Meyers, John A', 'Taverna, Josephine', 'Chaves, Jorge', 'Makkinje, Anthony', 'Lerner, Adam']","['Meyers JA', 'Taverna J', 'Chaves J', 'Makkinje A', 'Lerner A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Aminopyridines)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Carboxylic Acids)', '0 (Cyclohexanecarboxylic Acids)', '0 (Cyclopropanes)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '0 (glucocorticoid receptor alpha)', '0P6C6ZOP5U (Roflumilast)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '8ATB1C1R6X (Cilomilast)', ""EC 3.1.4.17 (3',5'-Cyclic-AMP Phosphodiesterases)"", 'EC 3.1.4.17 (Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 4)', 'K676NL63N7 (Rolipram)']",IM,"[""3',5'-Cyclic-AMP Phosphodiesterases/*antagonists & inhibitors"", 'Aminopyridines/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides/pharmacology', 'Carboxylic Acids/pharmacology', 'Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 4', 'Cyclohexanecarboxylic Acids', 'Cyclopropanes/pharmacology', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic System/chemistry/cytology/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Nitriles/pharmacology', 'Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/analysis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Rolipram/pharmacology']",2007/08/19 09:00,2007/09/26 09:00,['2007/08/19 09:00'],"['2007/08/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/26 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2007 Aug 15;13(16):4920-7. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-0276.,"['13/16/4920 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-0276 [doi]']",,"['Evans Department of Medicine, Section of Hematology and Oncology, Boston Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts 02118, USA.']","['T32 HL007501-26/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA106705/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 106705/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA106705-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL007501/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,PMC2656255,,,,,,,,['NIHMS91850'],,,,,,,,,

To improve the activities, the structure of EA has been modified, and it has been shown that EA esters had an increased cell growth inhibitory ability compared with nonesterified analogue. EA butyl-ester (EABE) was synthesized, and its apoptosis induction ability was studied. The efficacy of EABE was compared with that of EA, and the mechanisms of action were studied in HL-60 leukemia cells. EABE exhibited greater cell growth inhibitory and apoptosis induction abilities than did EA. EABE-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells correlated with increased levels of reactive oxygen species, the death receptor 5 (DR5), and caspase activation and decreased levels of the mitochondrial membrane potential. Pretreatment with antioxidants, either N-acetylcysteine or catalase, completely blocked EABE-induced apoptosis, H2O2 accumulation, and up-regulation of DR5 levels. RG19, a subclone of Raji cells stably transfected with a GSTpi expression vector, and K562 cells with high endogenous GSTP1-1 activity were less sensitive to EABE-induced apoptosis. EABE was more rapidly taken up than EA by HL-60 cells as determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) measurements of intracellular concentrations. These results suggest that (a) H2O2 production is a mediator of EABE and EA-induced apoptosis; (b) GSTP1-1 plays a negative role in EABE and EA-induced apoptosis; and (c) the activity of EABE is greater than EA due to its more rapid entry into cells.","['Wang, Rui', 'Li, Chunmin', 'Song, Dandan', 'Zhao, Guisen', 'Zhao, Linxiang', 'Jing, Yongkui']","['Wang R', 'Li C', 'Song D', 'Zhao G', 'Zhao L', 'Jing Y']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione S-Transferase pi)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'M5DP350VZV (Ethacrynic Acid)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Catalase/pharmacology', 'Cell Growth Processes/drug effects', 'Ethacrynic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Glutathione S-Transferase pi/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology']",2007/08/19 09:00,2007/10/05 09:00,['2007/08/19 09:00'],"['2007/08/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2007 Aug 15;67(16):7856-64. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-0151.,"['67/16/7856 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-0151 [doi]']",,"['Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both RA and D3 decreased the expression of PDGFR-alpha and PDGFR-beta throughout differentiation. When cells were treated with the PDGFR inhibitor AG1296 in addition to RA or D3, signs of terminal differentiation such as inducible oxidative metabolism and cell substrate adhesion were enhanced. These changes were accompanied by an increased extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 activation. AG1296 also resulted in elevated expression of differentiation markers CD11b and CD66c when administered with RA or D3. Interestingly, other markers did not follow the same pattern. Cells receiving AG1296 in addition to RA or D3 showed decreased G1-G0 arrest and CD14, CD38, and CD89 expression. We thus provide evidence that certain sets of differentiation markers can be enhanced, whereas others can be inhibited by the PDGFR pathway. In addition, we found calcium levels to be decreased by RA and D3 but increased when AG1296 was given in addition to RA or D3, suggesting that calcium levels decrease during myeloid or monocytic differentiation, and elevated calcium levels can disturb the expression of certain differentiation markers.","['Reiterer, Gudrun', 'Yen, Andrew']","['Reiterer G', 'Yen A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD11b Antigen)', '0 (CEACAM6 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Fc(alpha) receptor)', '0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', '0 (ITGAM protein, human)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Tyrphostins)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', '146535-11-7 (6,7-dimethoxy-3-phenylquinoxaline)', '1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/biosynthesis', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis', 'CD11b Antigen/biosynthesis', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/biosynthesis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cholecalciferol/pharmacology', 'GPI-Linked Proteins', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/biosynthesis', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/metabolism', 'Monocytes/metabolism/*pathology', 'Myeloid Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Receptors, Fc/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Resting Phase, Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tyrphostins/pharmacology', 'Ubiquitin/metabolism']",2007/08/19 09:00,2007/10/05 09:00,['2007/08/19 09:00'],"['2007/08/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2007 Aug 15;67(16):7765-72. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-0014.,"['67/16/7765 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-0014 [doi]']",,"['Department of Biomedical Sciences, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853, USA.']","['CA33505/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK072105/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanisms of this retrovirus-associated immune suppression are far from clarified. Dendritic cells (DCs) have been attributed a decisive role in these pathogenic processes. We have used the Friend retrovirus (FV) mouse model in order to acquire further knowledge about the role of infection of DCs in virus-induced immunosuppression. About 20% of the myeloid DCs that were generated from the bone marrow of FV-infected mice carried FV proteins. The infection was productive, and infected DCs transmitted the virus in cell culture and in vivo. FV infection of DCs led to a defect in DC maturation, as infected cells expressed very little costimulatory molecules. Live imaging analysis of the cell contact between DCs and T cells revealed prolonged contacts of T cells with infected DCs compared with uninfected DCs. Although naive T cells were still activated by FV-infected DCs, this activation did not result in antigen-specific T-cell proliferation. Interestingly, infected DCs expanded a population of Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells with immunosuppressive potential, suggesting that the contact between naive T cells and retrovirus-infected DCs results in tolerance rather than immunity. Thus, retroviral infection of DCs leads to an expansion of regulatory T cells, which might serve as an immune escape mechanism of the virus.","['Balkow, Sandra', 'Krux, Frank', 'Loser, Karin', 'Becker, Jan U', 'Grabbe, Stephan', 'Dittmer, Ulf']","['Balkow S', 'Krux F', 'Loser K', 'Becker JU', 'Grabbe S', 'Dittmer U']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigen Presentation/immunology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/immunology', 'Cell Communication/*immunology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology/virology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*immunology', '*Immune Tolerance', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Models, Immunological', 'Myeloid Cells/*immunology/virology', 'Retroviridae Infections/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*immunology/virology']",2007/08/19 09:00,2007/12/27 09:00,['2007/08/19 09:00'],"['2007/08/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/27 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Dec 1;110(12):3949-58. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-05-092189.

Inhibitors of this pathway could serve as useful biological probes and potential cancer therapeutic agents. Through a transcription-based high-throughput serum response element-luciferase screening assay, we identified two small-molecule inhibitors of this pathway. Mechanistic studies on the more potent CCG-1423 show that it acts downstream of Rho because it blocks SRE.L-driven transcription stimulated by Galpha(12)Q231L, Galpha(13)Q226L, RhoA-G14V, and RhoC-G14V. The ability of CCG-1423 to block transcription activated by MKL1, but not that induced by SRF-VP16 or GAL4-VP16, suggests a mechanism targeting MKL/SRF-dependent transcriptional activation that does not involve alterations in DNA binding. Consistent with its role as a Rho/SRF pathway inhibitor, CCG-1423 displays activity in several in vitro cancer cell functional assays. CCG-1423 potently (<1 mumol/L) inhibits lysophosphatidic acid-induced DNA synthesis in PC-3 prostate cancer cells, and whereas it inhibits the growth of RhoC-overexpressing melanoma lines (A375M2 and SK-Mel-147) at nanomolar concentrations, it is less active on related lines (A375 and SK-Mel-28) that express lower levels of Rho. Similarly, CCG-1423 selectively stimulates apoptosis of the metastasis-prone, RhoC-overexpressing melanoma cell line (A375M2) compared with the parental cell line (A375). CCG-1423 inhibited Rho-dependent invasion by PC-3 prostate cancer cells, whereas it did not affect the Galpha(i)-dependent invasion by the SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cell line. Thus, based on its profile, CCG-1423 is a promising lead compound for the development of novel pharmacologic tools to disrupt transcriptional responses of the Rho pathway in cancer.","['Evelyn, Chris R', 'Wade, Susan M', 'Wang, Qin', 'Wu, Mei', 'Iniguez-Lluhi, Jorge A', 'Merajver, Sofia D', 'Neubig, Richard R']","['Evelyn CR', 'Wade SM', 'Wang Q', 'Wu M', 'Iniguez-Lluhi JA', 'Merajver SD', 'Neubig RR']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Anilides)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (CCG 1423)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rhoA GTP-Binding Protein)']",IM,"['Anilides/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Mice', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Neoplasms/pathology', 'Serum Response Element/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'rhoA GTP-Binding Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics']",2007/08/19 09:00,2007/10/16 09:00,['2007/08/19 09:00'],"['2007/08/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/16 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2007 Aug;6(8):2249-60. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-06-0782.,"['6/8/2249 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-06-0782 [doi]']",,"['Department of Pharmacology, University of Michigan Medical Center, 1301 MSRB III, Room 2220D, 1150 West Medical Center Drive, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-0632, USA.']","['R01 DK061656/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK061656-02/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK061656-04/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA77612/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK061656-03/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01DK61615/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01GM39561/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK061656-01/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK061656-05/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This finding suggests a role of misfolded N-CoR in the differentiation arrest of APL cells and highlights its significance as a potential molecular target in protein conformation-based therapy for APL. Based on this hypothesis, we investigated the therapeutic potential of several protein conformation modifiers on APL-derived cell lines NB4 and NB4-R1. Through a small-scale screening of these selected compounds, we identified genistein as a potent inhibitor of growth of both RA-sensitive and RA-resistant APL cells. Genistein inhibited the growth of NB4 cells through its collective regulatory effects on cell cycle progression, differentiation, and apoptosis. Genistein-induced apoptosis of NB4 cells was mediated by activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 and was associated with a decrease in mitochondrial transmembrane potential and cytosolic release of cytochrome c. Genistein promoted differentiation of both RA-sensitive and RA-resistant NB4 cells and induced cell cycle arrest by blocking the G(2)-M transition. Genistein up-regulated the expression of PML and N-CoR proteins, promoted degradation of PML-RAR, and reorganized the microspeckled distribution of PML oncogenic domains to a normal dot-like pattern in NB4 cells. Moreover, genistein significantly reversed the PML-RAR-induced misfolding of N-CoR protein by possibly inhibiting the selective phosphorylation-dependent binding of N-CoR to PML-RAR. These findings identify genistein as a potent modifier of N-CoR protein conformation and highlights its therapeutic potential in both RA-sensitive and RA-resistant APL cells.","['Ng, Angela Ping Ping', 'Nin, Dawn Sijin', 'Fong, Jek Howe', 'Venkataraman, Divya', 'Chen, Chien-Shing', 'Khan, Matiullah']","['Ng AP', 'Nin DS', 'Fong JH', 'Venkataraman D', 'Chen CS', 'Khan M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (NCOR1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 1)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '17885-08-4 (Phosphoserine)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Genistein/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Neoplasm Proteins/chemistry', 'Nuclear Proteins/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 1', 'Peptide Hydrolases/genetics', 'Phosphoserine/metabolism', 'Phosphotyrosine/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', '*Protein Folding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/chemistry']",2007/08/19 09:00,2007/10/16 09:00,['2007/08/19 09:00'],"['2007/08/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/16 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2007 Aug;6(8):2240-8. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-06-0705.,"['6/8/2240 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-06-0705 [doi]']",,"['Oncology Research Institute, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, 02-07, Center for Life Sciences, 28 Medical Drive, Singapore 117456.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We measured the concentration of 17 OC pesticides, including hexachlorobenzene (HCB), four lindane isomers (alpha-, beta-, gamma- and delta-hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH)), two chlordane species (heptachlor and oxy-chlordane), four cyclodiene insecticides (aldrin, dieldrin, endrin and mirex), six dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT) isomers and nine PCB congeners (PCBs 28, 52, 101, 118, 138, 153, 170, 180 and 194) in plasma samples of 377 subjects, including 174 NHL cases and 203 controls from France, Germany and Spain. The risk of NHL and its major subtypes associated with increasing blood levels of OC pesticides and PCBs was calculated using unconditional logistic regression. RESULTS: Risk of NHL, diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and chronic lymphatic leukaemia (CLL) did not increase with plasma levels of HCB, beta-HCH, p,p'-dichloro-diphenyl-dichloroethylene (DDE), or total and individual PCBs or their functional groups, in the overall study population. Substantial heterogeneity in DLBCL risk associated with immunotoxic PCBs (p = 0.03) existed between the Spanish subgroup (odds ratio (OR) for immunotoxic PCB plasma level above the median vs below the median was 0.7, 95% CI 0.3 to 1.6) and the French and German subgroups combined (OR 3.2, 95% CI 0.9 to 11.5).

We demonstrated previously that Tax associates with the cell cycle check point regulator Chk2 and proposed that the inappropriate activation of Chk2 provides a model for Tax-induced loss of genetic integrity (Haoudi, A., Daniels, R. C., Wong, E., Kupfer, G., and Semmes, O. J. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 37736-37744). Here we provide an explanation for how Tax induces some Chk2 activities but represses others. We show that Tax interaction with Chk2 generates two activation signals in Chk2, oligomerization and autophosphorylation. However, egress of Chk2 from chromatin, normally observed in response to ionizing radiation, was repressed in Tax-expressing cells. Analysis of chromatin-bound Chk2 from Tax-expressing cells revealed phosphorylation at Thr(378), Ser(379), Thr(383), Thr(387), and Thr(389). In contrast, chromatin-bound Chk2 in the absence of Tax was phosphorylated at Thr(383) and Thr(387) in response to ionizing radiation. We further establish that Tax binds to the kinase domain of Chk2. Confocal microscopy revealed a redistribution of Chk2 to colocalize with Tax in Tax speckled structures, which we have shown previously to coincide with interchromatin granules. We propose that Tax binding via the Chk2 kinase domain sequesters phosphorylated Chk2 within chromatin, thus hindering chromatin egress and appropriate response to DNA damage.","['Gupta, Saurabh K', 'Guo, Xin', 'Durkin, Sarah S', 'Fryrear, Kimberly F', 'Ward, Michael D', 'Semmes, O John']","['Gupta SK', 'Guo X', 'Durkin SS', 'Fryrear KF', 'Ward MD', 'Semmes OJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '2ZD004190S (Threonine)', 'EC 2.7.1.11 (Checkpoint Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (CHEK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Checkpoint Kinase 2', 'Chromatin/*metabolism', 'DNA Damage', 'Gene Products, tax/metabolism/*physiology', 'Genome', 'Humans', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Models, Biological', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism/*physiology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Threonine/chemistry']",2007/08/19 09:00,2007/11/08 09:00,['2007/08/19 09:00'],"['2007/08/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/08 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2007 Oct 5;282(40):29431-40. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M704110200.

This study was performed to determine the mechanism by which Mcl-1 confers TRAIL resistance and to evaluate methods for overcoming this resistance. Affinity purification/immunoblotting assays using K562 human leukemia cells, which contain Mcl-1 and Bcl-x(L) as the predominant antiapoptotic Bcl-2 homologs, demonstrated that TRAIL treatment resulted in binding of tBid to Bcl-x(L) but not Mcl-1. In contrast, TRAIL caused increased binding between Mcl-1 and Bak that was diminished by treatment with the caspase 8 inhibitor N-(N(alpha)-acetylisoleucylglutamylthreonyl) aspartic acid (O-methyl ester)-fluoromethyl ketone (IETD(OMe)-fmk) or the c-Jun N-terminal kinase inhibitor SP600125. In addition, TRAIL caused increased binding of Bim and Puma to Mcl-1 that was inhibited by IETD(OMe)-fmk but not SP600125. Further experiments demonstrated that down-regulation of Mcl-1 by short hairpin RNA or the kinase inhibitor sorafenib increased TRAIL-induced Bak activation and death ligand-induced apoptosis in a wide variety of neoplastic cell lines as well as clinical acute myelogenous leukemia specimens. Collectively, these observations not only suggest a model in which Mcl-1 confers TRAIL resistance by serving as a buffer for Bak, Bim, and Puma, but also identify sorafenib as a potential modulator of TRAIL sensitivity.","['Meng, Xue Wei', 'Lee, Sun-Hee', 'Dai, Haiming', 'Loegering, David', 'Yu, Chunrong', 'Flatten, Karen', 'Schneider, Paula', 'Dai, Nga T', 'Kumar, Shaji K', 'Smith, B Douglas', 'Karp, Judith E', 'Adjei, Alex A', 'Kaufmann, Scott H']","['Meng XW', 'Lee SH', 'Dai H', 'Loegering D', 'Yu C', 'Flatten K', 'Schneider P', 'Dai NT', 'Kumar SK', 'Smith BD', 'Karp JE', 'Adjei AA', 'Kaufmann SH']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BAK1 protein, human)', '0 (BBC3 protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Benzenesulfonates)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*metabolism', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein/biosynthesis', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Benzenesulfonates/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*physiology', 'Niacinamide/analogs & derivatives', 'Phenylurea Compounds', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism/physiology', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology', 'Sorafenib', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*metabolism', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/*metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/metabolism']",2007/08/19 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2007/08/19 09:00'],"['2007/08/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2007 Oct 12;282(41):29831-46. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M706110200.

Here, we generated tamoxifen (TAM)-inducible transgenic mice (lck-ER(T2)-SCL) to study the consequences of acquired SCL activation during T-cell development. Aberrant activation of SCL in thymocytes resulted in the accumulation of immature CD4(+)CD8(+) (double-positive, DP) cells by preventing normal surface expression of the T-cell receptor alphabeta (TCRalphabeta) complex. SCL-induced immature DP cells were further characterized by up-regulated NOTCH1 and generated noncycling polyclonal CD8(+)TCRbeta(low) cells. The prevalence of these cells was SCL dependent because TAM withdrawal resulted in their disappearance. Furthermore, we observed that SCL activation led to a dramatic up-regulation of NOTCH1 target genes (Hes-1, Deltex1, and CD25) in thymocytes. Strikingly, NOTCH1 target gene up-regulation was already observed after short-term SCL induction, implying that enhanced NOTCH signaling is mediated by SCL and is not dependent on secondary genetic events. These data represent the basis for a novel pathway of SCL-induced leukemogenesis and provide a functional link between SCL and NOTCH1 during this process.","['Gothert, Joachim R', 'Brake, Rachael L', 'Smeets, Monique', 'Duhrsen, Ulrich', 'Begley, C Glenn', 'Izon, David J']","['Gothert JR', 'Brake RL', 'Smeets M', 'Duhrsen U', 'Begley CG', 'Izon DJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Notch1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/*metabolism', 'Genes, T-Cell Receptor beta', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Models, Biological', 'Organ Culture Techniques', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Receptor, Notch1/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Thymus Gland/cytology/embryology']",2007/08/19 09:00,2008/01/10 09:00,['2007/08/19 09:00'],"['2007/08/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Nov 15;110(10):3753-62. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-12-063644.

The histone modification activity of the human trithorax group mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) protein and the cell cycle regulatory activity of the cell proliferation factor herpes simplex virus host cell factor 1 (HCF-1) are stimulated by cleavage of precursors that generates stable heterodimeric complexes. MLL is processed by a protease called taspase 1, whereas the precise mechanisms of HCF-1 maturation are unclear, although they are known to depend on a series of sequence repeats called HCF-1(PRO) repeats. We demonstrate here that the Drosophila homologs of MLL and HCF-1, called Trithorax and dHCF, are both cleaved by Drosophila taspase 1. Although highly related, the human and Drosophila taspase 1 proteins display cognate species specificity. Thus, human taspase 1 preferentially cleaves MLL and Drosophila taspase 1 preferentially cleaves Trithorax, consistent with coevolution of taspase 1 and MLL/Trithorax proteins. HCF proteins display even greater species-specific divergence in processing: whereas dHCF is cleaved by the Drosophila taspase 1, human and mouse HCF-1 maturation is taspase 1 independent. Instead, human and Xenopus HCF-1PRO repeats are cleaved in vitro by a human proteolytic activity with novel properties. Thus, from insects to humans, HCF proteins have conserved proteolytic maturation but evolved different mechanisms.","['Capotosti, Francesca', 'Hsieh, James J-D', 'Herr, Winship']","['Capotosti F', 'Hsieh JJ', 'Herr W']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (host cell factor, Drosophila)', '0 (trx protein, Drosophila)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (taspase1, Drosophila)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (taspase1, human)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/genetics/*metabolism', 'Drosophila Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Drosophila melanogaster/genetics/metabolism', 'Endopeptidases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Stability', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protease Inhibitors/metabolism', 'Protein Precursors/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Substrate Specificity']",2007/08/19 09:00,2008/02/19 09:00,['2007/08/19 09:00'],"['2007/08/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2007 Oct;27(20):7063-72. doi: 10.1128/MCB.00769-07.

Novel treatment strategies are required to overcome resistance of cells to commonly used agents. The effects of valproic acid (VPA), an antiepileptic drug with histone deacetylase inhibitory activity, on mononuclear cells isolated from 40 CLL patients were evaluated. METHODS: CLL cells were treated with increasing doses of VPA (0.5, 1, 2, and 5 mM). The mode of cytotoxic drug action was determined by annexin binding, DNA fragmentation, and caspase activation. RESULTS: Exposure of CLL cells to VPA resulted in dose-dependent cytotoxicity and apoptosis in the 40 CLL patients. VPA treatment induced apoptotic changes in CLL cells including phosphatidylserine externalization and DNA fragmentation. The mean apoptotic rates were similar between IgV(H) mutated and unmutated patients, the latter presenting a more aggressive clinical course. VPA induced apoptosis via the extrinsic pathway involving engagement of the caspase-8-dependent cascade. Although CLL cells are commonly resistant to death receptor-induced apoptosis, VPA significantly increased sensitivity of leukemic cells to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and led to downregulation of c-FLIP (L) expression. VPA caused no potentialization of TRAIL-induced apoptosis on normal B cells. In addition, VPA overcame the prosurvival effects of bone marrow stromal cells. CONCLUSION: These findings point out that the combination of TRAIL and VPA, at clinically relevant concentration, may be valuable in the treatment of CLL.","['Lagneaux, Laurence', 'Gillet, Nicolas', 'Stamatopoulos, Basile', 'Delforge, Alain', 'Dejeneffe, Marielle', 'Massy, Martine', 'Meuleman, Nathalie', 'Kentos, Alain', 'Martiat, Philippe', 'Willems, Luc', 'Bron, Dominique']","['Lagneaux L', 'Gillet N', 'Stamatopoulos B', 'Delforge A', 'Dejeneffe M', 'Massy M', 'Meuleman N', 'Kentos A', 'Martiat P', 'Willems L', 'Bron D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Anticonvulsants)', '0 (CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein)', '0 (CFLAR protein, human)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phosphatidylserines)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '614OI1Z5WI (Valproic Acid)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anticonvulsants/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Caspase 8/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects/genetics', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects/genetics', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Histone Deacetylases/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics/metabolism', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylserines/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects/genetics', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Valproic Acid/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",2007/08/19 09:00,2007/11/08 09:00,['2007/08/19 09:00'],"['2007/02/09 00:00 [received]', '2007/05/18 00:00 [revised]', '2007/06/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/08 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2007 Oct;35(10):1527-37. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2007.06.014.

Combined chemotherapy is currently the primary treatment modality. During the past decade, very high cure rates of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have been reported both at home and abroad. However, the cure rates of children with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remain low due to the multiple-drug resistance (MDR). P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is one of the most important mechanisms of MDR for leukemia cells. However, the function of the protein, the clinical application of its reversal agents and the efficacy of the combination of the reversal agents remain to be elucidated. The present study aimed to evaluate the P-gp pump function on leukemia cell membrane and the effects of the combined administration of the reversal agents cyclosporin A (CSA) and verapamil (VER) through the observation of Calcein-AM (C-AM) metabolism in the cell line K562 and its multi-drug resistant subline K562/VCR. METHODS: The mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of C-AM inside the cytoplasm was analyzed with flow cytometry (FCM). The events of K562 and K562/VCR cells treated and untreated with CSA, VER and CSA + VER were acquired at time points 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes, respectively, and the data obtained were analyzed with CellQuest software. RESULTS: The C-AM in the K562 and K562/VCR varied more apparently in the fist 24 hours. In addition, the MFI of the C-AM in K562 was significantly higher than that in K562/VCR cells indicating that the P-gp pump molecules were functioning. The MFIs of the CSA, VER and CSA + VER groups co-cultured with K562/VCR cells were 4014 +/- 219, 3879 +/- 116 and 4158 +/- 302, respectively after 120 min of incubation, significantly higher as compared to that of control group (3251 +/- 107, P < 0.05). On the other hand, significant inhibition of the efflux from the K562/VCR cell line was also noticed after the same time period of incubation with the MFIs of 2237 +/- 155, 1932 +/- 233 and 2231 +/- 147, respectively in the three groups, which was significantly higher than that of control group (1622 +/- 191, P < 0.05). CSA, VER and CSA + VER could increase the uptake and inhibit the efflux of C-AM by K562/VCR cells, while no evident influence on those functions inside the parental cell line K562 cells was noticed. CONCLUSIONS: CSA, VER and CSA + VER could increase the uptake and reduce the efflux of C-AM by K562/VCR cells while no significant difference between the CSA + VER and CSA or VER was noticed. P-gp pump function and the effects of its reversal agents on leukemic cells can be rapidly and easily evaluated by using the C-AM and FCM.","['Lan, Zhi-jian', 'Tang, Yong-min', 'Shen, Hong-qiang', 'Qian, Bai-qin', 'Ning, Bo-tao', 'Chen, Ying-hu']","['Lan ZJ', 'Tang YM', 'Shen HQ', 'Qian BQ', 'Ning BT', 'Chen YH']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],China,Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of pediatrics,0417427,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Fluoresceins)', '148504-34-1 (calcein AM)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'V0YM2B16TS (fluorexon)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Child', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Fluoresceins/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Verapamil/pharmacology', 'Vincristine/pharmacology']",2007/08/19 09:00,2010/10/30 06:00,['2007/08/19 09:00'],"['2007/08/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/30 06:00 [medline]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi. 2007 May;45(5):334-8.,,,"[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou 310003, China.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), a nuclear protein, has recently been identified as an important mediator of local and systemic inflammatory diseases when released into the extracellular milieu. In the present study, the investigators explored the clinical significance of alteration in the serum levels of HMGB1 in childhood acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and the mechanism of HMGB1-induced tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha secretion in leukemic cells. METHODS: The serum levels of HMGB1 in healthy children and childhood ALL were assayed by Western blotting. K562 leukemic cells were stimulated with recombinant HMGB1 protein in vitro, and the secretion of TNF-alpha was determined by using ELISA. The effects of HMGB1 on activation of p38, c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK), and extracellular-signal regulated protein kinase (ERK) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in K562 cells were assayed by using Western blotting. The effects of inhibitors specific for the MAPK on HMGB1-induced TNF-alpha secretion were assayed by using ELISA. RESULTS: The serum levels of HMGB1 were significantly higher in ALL initial treatment group (n = 15, 43.78 +/- 4.62 microg/ml) than those in healthy control group (n = 15, 0.60 +/- 0.48 microg/ml, P < 0.01) and ALL complete remission group (n = 15, 0.89 +/- 0.62 microg/ml, P < 0.01). No significant difference was found between the healthy control group and ALL complete remission group in HMGB1 levels (P > 0.05). TNF-alpha started to become detectable at 2 h and was still increasing at 16 h after HMGB1 (1 microg/ml) treatment in K562 cell culture. TNF-alpha was also secreted from K562 cells in a dose-dependent manner after HMGB1 (1 ng/ml-1 microg/ml) exposure. HMGB1 induced the phosphorylation of p38, JNK and ERK in k562 cells. Inhibitors specific for the JNK (SP600125), MEK (PD98059), and p38 MAPK (SB203580), abrogated HMGB1-induced TNF-alpha secretion. CONCLUSIONS: The measurement of serum HMGB1 is helpful to evaluate the prognosis of the childhood ALL. HMGB1 stimulates leukemic cells to secrete TNF-alpha through a MAPK-dependent mechanism.","['Kang, Rui', 'Tang, Dao-lin', 'Cao, Li-zhi', 'Yu, Yan', 'Zhang, Guo-yuan', 'Xiao, Xian-zhong']","['Kang R', 'Tang DL', 'Cao LZ', 'Yu Y', 'Zhang GY', 'Xiao XZ']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],China,Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of pediatrics,0417427,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (HMGB1 Protein)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'OU13V1EYWQ (SB 203580)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'HMGB1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*pharmacology', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*metabolism']",2007/08/19 09:00,2010/10/30 06:00,['2007/08/19 09:00'],"['2007/08/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/30 06:00 [medline]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi. 2007 May;45(5):329-33.,,,"['Department of Pediatrics, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410008, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: From Jan. 1st, 1999 to Mar. 1st, 2006, 311 patients with newly diagnosed childhood ALL, who underwent induction chemotherapy for over 10 days, were eligible for analysis. Group 99 (n = 243) patients who were admitted before May 1st, 2005, were treated with ALL-XH-99 Protocol, whereas 68 patients admitted afterwards, defined as Group 05, were treated with ALL Protocol 2005 which was based on ALL-XH-99 Protocol but the treatment intensity was reduced to decrease treatment associated mortality. Clinically, the distributions of the initial data from the patients, treatment responses, complete remission rates after therapy, and treatment-associated infections in the two groups were evaluated. RESULTS: Patients from the two groups obtained similar complete remission rate (91.8% vs. 95.6%, P = 0.29), while patients from Group 05 were benefited more from their therapy.

Erratic gastrointestinal absorption as a result of oral administration of Bu not only affects the efficacy, but also increases the risk of toxicity. This study was to analyze the efficacy and toxicity of intravenous Bu and cyclophosphamide (Cy) conditioning before allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (allo-PBSCT) for leukemia. METHODS: Fifteen leukemia patients received intravenous Bu/Cy conditioning before allo-PBSCT, while 20 patients received oral Bu/Cy conditioning. The responses and adverse events of the 2 groups were assessed. RESULTS: All 15 patients in intravenous Bu/Cy group had hematopoietic engraftment. The median time of engraftment was 12 (9-15) days for neutrophils and 15 (11-24) days for platelets. Of the 15 patients, 6 (40.0%) developed acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), including 4 cases of grade I-II aGVHD and 2 cases of grade III-IV aGVHD; during conditioning, 7 (46.6%) had vomiting, 1 (6.7%) had oral mucositis, 1 (6.7%) had hemorrhagic cystitis, 2 (13.3%) had hepatic damage, none developed seizure.

This study was to probe the efficacy and safety of treating pediatric cancer pain with analgesics for adults through summarizing the experience of diagnosis and treatment in Cancer Center of Sun Yet-sen University. METHODS: Basing on the components and the endurable dosage of each component for children, we formulated the appropriate dosage and usage of a few analgesics (including sustained release tablets of morphine, oxycodone and transdermal fantanyl) available in China, most of which were used in adults. Cancer pain of 139 children with newly diagnosed tumors were treated according to the World Health Organization (WHO) analgesic ladder, including 19 cases of mild pain, 41 cases of moderate pain and 79 cases of severe pain. Efficacy and adverse events were evaluated. RESULTS: Of the 139 patients, 104 (74.8%) were treated with analgesics of 1 WHO ladder step, 35 (25.2%) were treated with increased WHO ladder steps (ladder 1-->2 or 2-->3) or reduced WHO ladder steps (ladder 3-->2 or 2-->1). The total response rate for pain relief was 100%: 129 (92.8%) patients had complete relief, 7 (5.0%) had obvious relief, 3(2.2%) had moderate relief. The median time for pain control was 5 days (range, 1-12 days). Sustained release tablets of morphine, transdermal fantanyl, and sustained release tablets of oxycodone were used in 20, 28, and 40 patients, respectively. The median ages of the 3 groups were 10 (5-18), 6 (2.3-16), and 5 (2.5-16) years, respectively. The median of maximum dosages of the 3 single drugs were 20 (10-70) mg, 25 (12.5-50) microg/h, and 10 (5-30) mg, respectively. The median doses used in the 3 groups were 100 (20-360) mg, 5 (1.25-7.5) mg, and 60 (10-200) mg, respectively. The non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug-induced adverse events were nausea and vomiting with very low frequencies. The weak opioid and strong opioid drug-induced adverse events included constipation, nausea, vomiting, and somnolence, all of which were reversible. No severe adverse events, including respiratory depression and drug addiction, happened. CONCLUSIONS: The WHO ladder approach for cancer pain is appropriate for children. Currently in China, most analgesics for adults could be used for pediatric cancer pain treatment.","['Zhen, Zi-Jun', 'Sun, Xiao-Fei', 'Xia, Yi', 'Ling, Jia-Yu', 'Zheng, Lei', 'Luo, Wen-Biao', 'Lin, Hui']","['Zhen ZJ', 'Sun XF', 'Xia Y', 'Ling JY', 'Zheng L', 'Luo WB', 'Lin H']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Ai Zheng,Ai zheng = Aizheng = Chinese journal of cancer,9424852,"['0 (Analgesics, Opioid)', '0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Delayed-Action Preparations)', '76I7G6D29C (Morphine)', 'CD35PMG570 (Oxycodone)', 'UF599785JZ (Fentanyl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Analgesics, Opioid/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Constipation/chemically induced', 'Delayed-Action Preparations', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Fentanyl/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Lymphoma/complications', 'Male', 'Morphine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Nausea/chemically induced', 'Oxycodone/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Pain, Intractable/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Vomiting/chemically induced', '*World Health Organization']",2007/08/19 09:00,2009/10/30 06:00,['2007/08/19 09:00'],"['2007/08/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/30 06:00 [medline]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ai Zheng. 2007 Aug;26(8):866-9.,['1000-467X200708866 [pii]'],,"['State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510060, PR China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17697538,NLM,MEDLINE,20091029,20201113,,26,8,2007 Aug,[Apoptosis of human leukemia HL-60 cells induced by rhabdastrellic acid-A and its mechanisms].,809-14,"BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Rhabdastrellic acid-A is an isomalabaricane triterpenoid isolated from the sponge Rhabdastrella globostellata from South China Sea. Our previous study indicated that rhabdastrellic acid-A can inhibit the proliferation of many types of tumor cells with minor toxicity. This study was to investigate the apoptosis of human leukemia HL-60 cells induced by rhabdastrellic acid-A and its possible mechanisms. METHODS: Inhibitory effect of rhabdastrellic acid-A on the proliferation of HL-60 cells was evaluated by MTT assay. DNA fragmentation was analyzed by agarose electrophoresis. Cell morphology was observed under fluorescent microscope. The protein levels of Caspase-3, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), P73, Bcl-2 and Bax were analyzed by Western blot. The expression profile of apoptosis-related genes was analyzed by gene microarray. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was conducted to confirm some altered genes identified by gene microarray. RESULTS: Rhabdastrellic acid-A inhibited the proliferation of HL-60 cells and the 50% inhibition concentration (IC50) was (0.64+/-0.21) microg/ml. When treated with 1 microg/ml rhabdastrellic acid-A for 36 h, condensation of nuclear chromatin of HL-60 cells was observed under fluorescent microscope and DNA fragmentation was observed by agarose electrophoresis. Also, rhabdastrellic acid-A induced cleavage of PARP and Caspase-3. The mRNA levels of 44 genes, including p73, JunD, TNFAIP3 and GADD45A, were up-regulated and the mRNA levels of 16 genes, including MAP2K5 and IGF2R, were down-regulated. The results were further confirmed by RT-PCR. The protein level of P73 was up-regulated after rhabdastrellic acid-A treatment. CONCLUSION: Rhabdastrellic acid-A could induce the apoptosis of HL-60 cells which may be related to the up-regulation of apoptosis-related genes such as p73 and JunD, and the down-regulation of MAP2K5 and IGF2R.","['Guo, Jing-Feng', 'Zhou, Jun-Min', 'Feng, Gong-Kan', 'Liu, Zong-Chao', 'Xiao, Ding-Jun', 'Deng, Song-Zhi', 'Deng, Rong', 'Zhu, Xiao-Feng']","['Guo JF', 'Zhou JM', 'Feng GK', 'Liu ZC', 'Xiao DJ', 'Deng SZ', 'Deng R', 'Zhu XF']",['chi'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Ai Zheng,Ai zheng = Aizheng = Chinese journal of cancer,9424852,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Receptor, IGF Type 2)', '0 (TP73 protein, human)', '0 (Triterpenes)', '0 (Tumor Protein p73)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (rhabdastrellic acid A)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 5)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP2K5 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 5/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/metabolism', 'Receptor, IGF Type 2/metabolism', 'Triterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Protein p73', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",2007/08/19 09:00,2009/10/30 06:00,['2007/08/19 09:00'],"['2007/08/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/30 06:00 [medline]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ai Zheng. 2007 Aug;26(8):809-14.,['1000-467X200708809 [pii]'],,"['State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510060, PR China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Characterization of the molecular structure of the MOZ-TIF2 fusion protein suggested that the fusion protein would effect on nuclear receptor signaling. RESULTS: A series of deletions from the N-terminus of the MOZ-TIF2 fusion protein demonstrated that the MOZ portion is essential for nuclear localization of the fusion protein. Transient expression of MOZ-TIF2 dramatically decreased both basal and estradiol inducible reporter gene activity in an estrogen receptor element (ERE) driven luciferase reporter system and decreased androgen-inducible reporter gene activity in an androgen receptor element (ARE) luciferase reporter system. Deletions in the MOZ portion of the MOZ-TIF2 fusion protein reduced the suppression in the ER reporter system. Stable expression of MOZ-TIF2 inhibited retinoic acid (RA) inducible endogenous CD11b and C/EBPbeta gene response. The suppression of the reporter systems was released with either a CID domain deletion or with mutations of leucine-rich repeats in the TIF2 portion of MOZ-TIF2. The co-expression of TIF2, but not CBP, with MOZ-TIF2 partially restored the inhibition of the reporter systems. In addition, analysis of protein interactions demonstrated MOZ-TIF2 interaction with the C-terminus of CBP through both the MOZ and TIF2 portions of the fusion protein. CONCLUSION: MOZ-TIF2 inhibited nuclear receptor-mediated gene response by aberrant recruitment of CBP and both the MOZ and TIF2 portions are required for this inhibition.","['Yin, Hong', 'Glass, Jonathan', 'Blanchard, Kerry L']","['Yin H', 'Glass J', 'Blanchard KL']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (NCOA2 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Coactivator 2)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Receptors, Androgen)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Histone Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (KAT6A protein, human)', 'W980KJ009P (Corticosterone)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Corticosterone', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Histone Acetyltransferases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Nuclear Receptor Coactivator 2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/chemistry/*genetics', 'Receptors, Androgen/genetics', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Estrogen/genetics', '*Transcription, Genetic']",2007/08/19 09:00,2007/12/28 09:00,['2007/08/19 09:00'],"['2007/05/05 00:00 [received]', '2007/08/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [entrez]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2007 Aug 13;6:51. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-6-51.,"['1476-4598-6-51 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-4598-6-51 [doi]']",,"['Feist-Weiller Cancer Center and Department of Medicine, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, Shreveport, USA. hyin@lsuhsc.edu']",,,,,,20070813,PMC2048977,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The appearance of various chromosomal and molecular alterations in the accelerated and terminal phase of CML is well documented, but evidence for causal relationship is largely lacking. We carried out a genome wide screening at a resolution of 1 Mb of 54 samples at different stages of CML together with 12 CML cell lines and found that disease progression is accompanied by a spectrum of recurrent genome imbalances. Among the most frequent are losses at 1p36, 5q21, 9p21, and 9q34 and gains at 1q, 8q24, 9q34, 16p, and 22q11, all of which were located with higher precision within the genome than previously possible. These genome imbalances are unique to CML cases with clinically manifested or suspected accelerated/blast stage alike, but not seen in chronic phase samples. Previously unrecognized cryptic imbalances occurring within the Ph-chromosome were also detected, although further scrutiny is required to pin-point gene involvement and seek association with disease features. Importantly, some of these imbalances were seen in the CD34(+) cells but not in the whole BM samples of patients in accelerated phase. Taken together, these findings highlight the potential of screening CD34(+) cells for genome wide imbalances associated with disease progression. Finally, the numerous single copy number variations recorded, many unique to this cohort of patients, raise the possible association of genome polymorphism and CML.","['Brazma, D', 'Grace, C', 'Howard, J', 'Melo, J V', 'Holyoke, T', 'Apperley, J F', 'Nacheva, E P']","['Brazma D', 'Grace C', 'Howard J', 'Melo JV', 'Holyoke T', 'Apperley JF', 'Nacheva EP']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,,IM,"['Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Artificial, Bacterial', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', '*Genome', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', 'Male']",2007/08/19 09:00,2007/11/14 09:00,['2007/08/19 09:00'],"['2007/08/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2007 Nov;46(11):1039-50. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20487.,['10.1002/gcc.20487 [doi]'],"['Copyright (c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['Royal Free and UCL Medical School, Academic Haematology, Molecular Cytogenetics, Rowland Hill Street, Hampstead, and Hammersmith Hospital, London NW3 2PF, UK.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The constitutive tyrosine kinase transforms either hematopoietic stem cells (in CML) or committed pre-B lymphoid progenitors (in Ph+ ALL) to generate these distinct diseases. The INK4A/ARF tumor suppressor locus is frequently deleted in both B- and T-lineage ALLs, including Ph+ ALL, whereas the locus remains intact in CML. In murine bone marrow transplant models and after transfer of syngeneic Bcr-Abl-transformed pre-B cells into immunocompetent recipient animals, Arf gene inactivation dramatically decreases the latency and enhances the aggressiveness of Bcr-Abl-induced lymphoblastic leukemia. Targeted inhibition of the Bcr-Abl kinase with imatinib provides highly effective therapy for CML, but Ph+ ALL patients do not experience durable remissions. Despite exquisite in vitro sensitivity of Arf-null, BCR-ABL+ pre-B cells to imatinib, these cells efficiently establish lethal leukemias when introduced into immunocompetent mice that receive continuous, maximal imatinib therapy. Bcr-Abl confers interleukin-7 (IL-7) independence to pre-B cells, but imatinib treatment restores the requirement for this cytokine. Hence, IL-7 can reduce the sensitivity of Bcr-Abl+ pre-B cells to imatinib.

Similarly, the heterozygote and homozygote variant genotypes displayed a homogenous distribution in both groups (p > 0.05 for all comparisons). Moreover, distribution of the variant allele and subgenotypes did not significantly differ between the patient subgroups with a diagnosis age below or above 50 years.

Furthermore, it was active in the in vivo P388 murine leukemia model. In this study, the mechanism of cytotoxicity mediated by silvestrol in the LNCaP (hormone-dependent human prostate cancer) cell line was investigated. Silvestrol induced an apoptotic response, disrupted the mitochondrial trans-membrane potential and caused cytochrome c release into the cytoplasm. Immunoblot analysis indicated that, at the protein level, silvestrol produced an increase of Bcl-xl phosphorylation with a concomitant increase of bak. Furthermore, caspase-2, -9 and -10 appeared to be involved in silvestrol-mediated apoptosis. In contrast, the involvement of caspase-3 and -7 was not detected, either by immunoblot or caspase-3/-7-like activity analysis, indicating that these pathways do not play a crucial role in silvestrol-induced apoptosis. To investigate the relative contribution of the caspases, inhibition of apoptosis with four different cell-permeable inhibitors was studied (Boc-D-Fmk, Z-VDVAD-FMK Z-LEHD-FMK and Z-AEVD-FMK). Only the general caspase inhibitor, Boc-D-Fmk, completely inhibited the formation of apoptotic bodies. In contrast, caspase-2 and caspase-9 selective inhibitors induced about a 40% reduced apoptotic response, whereas the caspase-10 selective inhibitor caused about a 60% reduction in apoptosis compared to silvestrol only treated cells. Taken together, the studies described herein demonstrate the involvement of the apoptosome/mitochondrial pathway and suggest the possibility that silvestrol may also trigger the extrinsic pathway of programmed cell death signaling in tumor cells.","['Kim, Soyoung', 'Hwang, Bang Yeon', 'Su, Bao-Ning', 'Chai, Heebyung', 'Mi, Qiuwen', 'Kinghorn, A Douglas', 'Wild, Robert', 'Swanson, Steven M']","['Kim S', 'Hwang BY', 'Su BN', 'Chai H', 'Mi Q', 'Kinghorn AD', 'Wild R', 'Swanson SM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Apoptosomes)', '0 (Benzyl Compounds)', '0 (Boc-D-FMK)', '0 (Hydrocarbons, Fluorinated)', '0 (Triterpenes)', '0 (silvestrol)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 7)']",IM,"['Aglaia/chemistry', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Apoptosomes/drug effects/physiology', 'Benzyl Compounds/pharmacology', 'Caspase 3/*metabolism', 'Caspase 7/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Interactions', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Hydrocarbons, Fluorinated/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects/physiology', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/physiology', 'Neoplasms, Hormone-Dependent/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Triterpenes/*pharmacology']",2007/08/19 09:00,2007/09/07 09:00,['2007/08/19 09:00'],"['2007/08/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2007 Jul-Aug;27(4B):2175-83.,,,"['Program for Collaborative Research in the Pharmaceutical Science and Department of Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacognosy, College of Pharmacy, University of Illinois at Chicago, IL 60612, USA.']","['U19 CA052956/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U19 CA052956-15/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U19 CA52956/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,PMC2787233,,,,,,,,['NIHMS158791'],,,,,,,,,

Currently, two asparaginase formulations are available in the US, native Escherichia coli asparaginase (ASNase) and pegaspargase. A third formulation native Erwinia asparaginase (Erwinase, ERW) has recently been made available under a licensing exception for personal use. We report here the development and validation process of ERW pharmacoanalytical assays and the results in a few patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed and systematically validated the ERW enzyme activity and ERW concentration, anti-ERW antibody and related assays. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) studies were performed in a limited number of patients who received 6,000 IU/m2 x 3 per week x 2 courses, and 4 patients who received 25,000 IU/m2 x 3 per week x 2 courses of ERW. RESULTS: The linearity and range of the Erwinase calibration lines for the pharmacoanalytical assays were excellent. The accuracy and precision were better than the FDA limit allows for oncology biological products (<30%) coefficient of variation (%CV) and related parameters in the quantification of ERW concentration. The validation of these parameters was equal to or better than during the assay development. PK-PD analyses of ERW in a few patients yielded an average half-life of elimination of 15.8+/-1.64 hours. There was an excellent PD response post ERW administration resulting in an ERW concentration-dependent asparagine (ASN, <0.5 microM) and glutamine (GLN, <50 microM) deamination. Pharmacodynamic correlations demonstrated that 0.1 to 0.2 IU/ml of ERW in serum were sufficient for 90% GLN and/or ASN deamination for up to 2 weeks. No anti-ERW antibody [Ab(+)] was seen among those few patients. None of the other 5 patients had an adverse event. Based on these post hoc results, simulations on various doses and schedules of this drug have been made. CONCLUSION: The pharmacoanalytical assays were excellent tools to evaluate the PK and PD data of ERW in pediatric patients with HR ALL. However, this initial PK-PD evidence needs further validation in future clinical trials. Insights into the PD contributions of ERW in anti-E. coli ASNase Ab(+) patients will guide us in optimal design and use of ERW as part of combination chemotherapy regimens in future clinical trials.","['Avramis, Vassilios I', 'Martin-Aragon, Sagrario', 'Avramis, Earl V', 'Asselin, Barbara L']","['Avramis VI', 'Martin-Aragon S', 'Avramis EV', 'Asselin BL']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Antibodies/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Asparaginase/immunology/*pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Child', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Computer Simulation', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Erwinia/enzymology', 'Escherichia coli/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Reproducibility of Results']",2007/08/19 09:00,2007/08/24 09:00,['2007/08/19 09:00'],"['2007/08/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/24 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2007 Jul-Aug;27(4C):2561-72.,,,"['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, USC Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90027, USA. vavramis@chla.edu']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is largely due to the existence of multiple genetic barriers to HIV-1 replication in most nonhuman primates, including a severe block targeting the early, post-entry phase of the viral replication cycle. It is now known that a protein called TRIM5alpha mediates this early restriction in nonhuman primate cells. Tissue culture experiments, together with genetic association studies involving multiple HIV/AIDS cohorts, indicate that the human orthologue of TRIM5alpha does not have a significant impact on HIV-1 replication. However, most human alleles encode a functional protein that can restrict at least one retrovirus unrelated to HIV-1 (N-tropic murine leukemia virus), although one deleterious mutation (H43Y) is present at high frequency in human populations. Phylogenetic analyses of the TRIM5 locus reveal that prehistoric retroviral epidemics, not unlike the current HIV/AIDS pandemic, played a significant role in the evolutionary history of humans and their primate relatives. The discovery of TRIM5alpha's antiretroviral activity sparked the imaginations of many laboratories, and considerable effort has now been channeled into characterizing the protein and determining its possible mechanism(s) of action. It is hoped that research on TRIM5alpha will contribute to the establishment of new and improved models for HIV replication and AIDS pathogenesis, point the way towards novel therapeutic targets to stem the tide of the human AIDS epidemic, provide an experimental window onto the early, post-entry stages of the retroviral replication cycle, and even inspire the search for other cellular factors that modulate retroviral infection.","['Newman, Ruchi M', 'Johnson, Welkin E']","['Newman RM', 'Johnson WE']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Spain,AIDS Rev,AIDS reviews,101134876,"['0 (Antiviral Restriction Factors)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Tripartite Motif Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (TRIM5 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (TRIM5(alpha) protein, rhesus monkey)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Restriction Factors', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'HIV Infections/*virology', 'HIV-1/*growth & development/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Primates', 'Proteins/genetics/*immunology', 'Tripartite Motif Proteins', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases']",2007/08/19 09:00,2007/09/12 09:00,['2007/08/19 09:00'],"['2007/08/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,AIDS Rev. 2007 Apr-Jun;9(2):114-25.,,,"['Division of Microbiology, New England Primate Research Center, Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, Harvard Medical School, Southborough, MA 01772, USA.']",,111,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Questions about whether this exclusion is justified prompted a Congressional mandate to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) to, further, examine the radiogenicity of CLL. This study revisits the question of CLL radiogenicity by examining epidemiologic evidence from occupationally and medically-exposed populations. METHODS: A systematic review of radiation-exposed cohorts was conducted to investigate the association between radiation and CLL. Exploratory power calculations for a pooled occupational study were performed to examine the feasibility of assessing CLL radiogenicity epidemiologically. RESULTS: There is a bias against reporting CLL results, because of the disease's presumed non-radiogenicity. In medical cohort studies that provide risk estimates for CLL, risk is elevated, though non-significantly, in almost all studies with more than 15 years average follow-up. The results of occupational studies are less consistent. CONCLUSIONS: Studies with adequate follow-up time and power are needed to better understand CLL radiogenicity. Power analyses show that a pooled study might detect risk on the order of radiation induced non-CLL leukemia, but is unlikely to detect smaller risks.","['Silver, Sharon R', 'Hiratzka, Shannon L', 'Schubauer-Berigan, Mary K', 'Daniels, Robert D']","['Silver SR', 'Hiratzka SL', 'Schubauer-Berigan MK', 'Daniels RD']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,,IM,"['Humans', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/epidemiology', 'National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, U.S.', '*Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', 'United States']",2007/08/19 09:00,2008/04/12 09:00,['2007/08/19 09:00'],"['2006/07/03 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2007 Dec;18(10):1077-93. doi: 10.1007/s10552-007-9048-y.

Imatinib mesylate (imatinib) is an inhibitor that specifically targets a set of protein tyrosine kinase, such as abl, c-kit, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) and it is widely used to treat chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The purpose of the present study is to determine whether imatinib can provide benefit in the arthritis induced by anti-collagen type II antibody (CAIA) in mice, a model that provides an opportunity to study the effector inflammatory phase of arthritis without involving the priming phase of the immune responses. Mice treated with intraperitoneal administration of imatinib (1 or 10 mg/kg) prior to the development of CAIA displayed significant reductions in the severity of CAIA as assessed by arthritis score, histology, and synovial PDGF and vascular endothelial growth factor expression. In addition, treatment of the mice that had developed CAIA with intraperitoneal administration of imatinib (1 or 10 mg/kg) inhibited the progression of arthritis as assessed by those parameters. These results suggest that imatinib prevents and treats CAIA. Imatinib may thus have both a preventive and therapeutic potential for the joint inflammation at the effector stage of RA.","['Koyama, Kensuke', 'Hatsushika, Kyosuke', 'Ando, Takashi', 'Sakuma, Michitomo', 'Wako, Masanori', 'Kato, Ryohei', 'Haro, Hirotaka', 'Sugiyama, Hajime', 'Hamada, Yoshiki', 'Ogawa, Hideoki', 'Nakao, Atsuhito']","['Koyama K', 'Hatsushika K', 'Ando T', 'Sakuma M', 'Wako M', 'Kato R', 'Haro H', 'Sugiyama H', 'Hamada Y', 'Ogawa H', 'Nakao A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mod Rheumatol,Modern rheumatology,100959226,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Collagen Type II)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arthritis, Experimental/*drug therapy/pathology/prevention & control', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/*drug therapy/immunology/prevention & control', 'Benzamides', 'Collagen Type II/immunology', 'Female', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Inflammation/drug therapy/prevention & control', 'Mice', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology']",2007/08/19 09:00,2007/10/24 09:00,['2007/08/19 09:00'],"['2007/02/08 00:00 [received]', '2007/05/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/24 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mod Rheumatol. 2007;17(4):306-10. doi: 10.1007/s10165-007-0592-9.

Here we identify a SNP within this element in humans that is more frequent in AML with a complex karyotype, leads to decreased enhancer activity, and reduces PU.1 expression in myeloid progenitors in a development-dependent manner. This SNP inhibits binding of the chromatin-remodeling transcriptional regulator special AT-rich sequence binding protein 1 (SATB1). Overexpression of SATB1 increased PU.1 expression, and siRNA inhibition of SATB1 downregulated PU.1 expression. Targeted disruption of the distal enhancer led to a loss of regulation of PU.1 by SATB1. Interestingly, disruption of SATB1 in mice led to a selective decrease of PU.1 RNA in specific progenitor types (granulocyte-macrophage and megakaryocyte-erythrocyte progenitors) and a similar effect was observed in AML samples harboring this SNP.

RECENT FINDINGS: Epigenetics is the study of mitotically heritable alterations in gene expression potential that are not mediated by changes in DNA sequence. Recently, it has become clear that nutrition can affect epigenetic mechanisms, causing long-term changes in gene expression. This review focuses on methods for studying the epigenetic mechanism DNA methylation. Recent advances include improvement in high-throughput methods to obtain quantitative data on locus-specific DNA methylation and development of various approaches to study DNA methylation on a genome-wide scale. SUMMARY: No single method of DNA methylation analysis will be appropriate for every application. By understanding the type of information provided by, and the inherent potential for bias and artifact associated with, each method, investigators can select the method most appropriate for their specific research needs.","['Shen, Lanlan', 'Waterland, Robert A']","['Shen L', 'Waterland RA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Curr Opin Clin Nutr Metab Care,Current opinion in clinical nutrition and metabolic care,9804399,,IM,"['*DNA Methylation', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genomic Imprinting', 'Humans', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', 'Risk Assessment', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2007/08/19 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2007/08/19 09:00'],"['2007/08/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Clin Nutr Metab Care. 2007 Sep;10(5):576-81. doi: 10.1097/MCO.0b013e3282bf6f43.,"['10.1097/MCO.0b013e3282bf6f43 [doi]', '00075197-200709000-00003 [pii]']",,"['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, USA.']","['5K01DK070007/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P501 CA100632 03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",32,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Consenting, eligible myeloma patients on IFN maintenance therapy for at least 6 weeks were randomly (1:1) allocated to receive P-IFN for 3 months followed by IFN for 3 months, or to continue with IFN for 3 months followed by P-IFN for 3 months (cross-over design). Patients were assessed for toxicity and QoL. Dose of P-IFN was equivalent to IFN. RESULTS: The study enrolled 60 patients. At enrollment, 35 patients were in complete remission, 20 in partial remission and 5 were minimal responders. P-IFN was associated with significantly better global QoL score (mean difference 8.4; P = 0.0002). There was a significant improvement in functional scales--physical (P = 0.03), emotional (P = 0.04), social (P = 0.0008) with P-IFN. Fatigue (P = 0.0003), pain (P = 0.02) and appetite loss (P = 0.003) symptom scales were less in patients while on P-IFN. There were no statistically significant differences between treatment arms in QoL as measured by QLQ-MY24. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that patients on P-IFN have a better QoL.

MPLW515L leads to activation of downstream signaling pathways and cytokine-independent proliferation in hematopoietic cells. The adaptor protein Lnk is a negative regulator of several cytokine receptors, including MPL. We show that overexpression of Lnk in Ba/F3-MPLW515L cells inhibits cytokine-independent growth, while suppression of Lnk in UT7-MPLW515L cells enhances proliferation. Lnk blocks the activation of Jak2, Stat3, Erk, and Akt in these cells. Furthermore, MPLW515L-expressing cells are more susceptible to Lnk inhibitory functions than their MPL wild-type (MPLWT)-expressing counterparts. Lnk associates with activated MPLWT and MPLW515L and colocalizes with the receptors at the plasma membrane. The SH2 domain of Lnk is essential for its binding and for its down-regulation of MPLWT and MPLW515L. Lnk itself is tyrosine-phosphorylated following thrombopoietin stimulation. Further elucidating the cellular pathways that attenuate MPLW515L will provide insight into the pathogenesis of MPD and could help develop specific therapeutic approaches.","['Gery, Sigal', 'Gueller, Saskia', 'Chumakova, Katya', 'Kawamata, Norihiko', 'Liu, Liqin', 'Koeffler, H Phillip']","['Gery S', 'Gueller S', 'Chumakova K', 'Kawamata N', 'Liu L', 'Koeffler HP']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Lnk protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Mpl protein, mouse)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics/physiology', 'Animals', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Down-Regulation', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mutant Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics', 'Point Mutation/physiology', 'Protein Binding', 'Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin/*genetics/metabolism', 'Thrombopoietin/pharmacology']",2007/08/19 09:00,2007/12/14 09:00,['2007/08/19 09:00'],"['2007/08/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Nov 1;110(9):3360-4. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-05-089326.

We showed previously that overexpression of Sp100 protein can suppress ALT and that this was associated with sequestration of the MRE11/RAD50/NBS1 (MRN) recombination protein complex by Sp100. In the present study, we determined whether MRN proteins are required for ALT activity. ALT cells were depleted of MRN proteins by small hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown, which was maintained for up to 100 population doublings. Knockdown of NBS1 had no effect on the level of RAD50 or MRE11, but knockdown of RAD50 also depleted cells of NBS1, and knockdown of MRE11 depleted cells of all three MRN proteins. Depletion of NBS1, with or without depletion of other members of the complex, resulted in inhibition of ALT-mediated telomere maintenance, as evidenced by decreased numbers of ALT-associated promyelocytic leukemia bodies and decreased telomere length. In some clones there was an initial period of rapid shortening followed by stabilization of telomere length, whereas in others there was continuous shortening at a rate within the reported range for normal human somatic cells lacking a telomere maintenance mechanism. In contrast, depletion of NBS1 in telomerase-positive cells did not result in telomere shortening. A recent study showed that NBS1 was required for the formation of extrachromosomal telomeric circles (Compton, S. A., Choi, J. H., Cesare, A. J., Ozgur, S., and Griffith, J. D. (2007) Cancer Res. 67, 1513-1519), also a marker for ALT. We conclude that the MRN complex, and especially NBS1, is required for the ALT mechanism.","['Zhong, Ze-Huai', 'Jiang, Wei-Qin', 'Cesare, Anthony J', 'Neumann, Axel A', 'Wadhwa, Renu', 'Reddel, Roger R']","['Zhong ZH', 'Jiang WQ', 'Cesare AJ', 'Neumann AA', 'Wadhwa R', 'Reddel RR']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MRE11 protein, human)', '0 (NBN protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Telomere-Binding Proteins)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 3.1.- (MRE11 Homologue Protein)', 'EC 3.6.- (Acid Anhydride Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.6.- (Rad50 protein, human)', 'EC 6.5.1.- (DNA Repair Enzymes)']",IM,"['Acid Anhydride Hydrolases', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Repair Enzymes/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'MRE11 Homologue Protein', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'RNA/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Telomere/metabolism/*ultrastructure', 'Telomere-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Transfection']",2007/08/19 09:00,2007/11/08 09:00,['2007/08/19 09:00'],"['2007/08/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/08 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2007 Oct 5;282(40):29314-22. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M701413200.

It was recently shown that PRAME can function as a repressor of retinoic acid signaling, as indicated by down-regulation of retinoic acid receptor-beta (RARB) and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A). Another study suggested that PRAME can induce caspase-independent apoptosis via down-regulation of heat shock 27-kDa protein 1 (HSPB1) and S100 calcium-binding protein A4 (S100A4). The transcriptional repression of PRAME depends on the formation of a complex with the enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2). To test whether these mechanisms play an important roll in AML, we analyzed the expression of PRAME, EZH2, RARB, HSPB1, S100A4, and CDKN1A by real-time polymerase chain reaction in primary leukemic cells from 52 children with AML. All genes were expressed in many patients, but the level of expression of the last four genes was not associated with either PRAME expression or PRAME and EZH2 co-expression. In conclusion, the above mechanisms do not seem to play a major role in the pathogenesis of AML; they could be neutralized by other pathways that affect the same targets.","['Steinbach, Daniel', 'Pfaffendorf, Nadine', 'Wittig, Susan', 'Gruhn, Bernd']","['Steinbach D', 'Pfaffendorf N', 'Wittig S', 'Gruhn B']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (HSP27 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (HSPB1 protein, human)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PRAME protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (S100 Calcium-Binding Protein A4)', '0 (S100 Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (retinoic acid receptor beta)', '142662-27-9 (S100A4 protein, human)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (EZH2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 2)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/genetics/*metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Down-Regulation', 'Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HSP27 Heat-Shock Proteins', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 2', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'S100 Calcium-Binding Protein A4', 'S100 Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*metabolism']",2007/08/19 09:00,2007/10/05 09:00,['2007/08/19 09:00'],"['2007/04/04 00:00 [received]', '2007/05/09 00:00 [revised]', '2007/05/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2007 Aug;177(1):51-4. doi: 10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2007.05.011.,"['S0165-4608(07)00316-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2007.05.011 [doi]']",,"[""University Children's Hospital Ulm, Eythstrasse 24, Ulm 89075, Germany.

They are implicated in various biological functions, such as viral infection, cellular transformation, innate immunity and growth control, and they might be dynamic hubs sensing stress and DNA damage. Data from PML(-/-) mice suggest that PML-NBs are involved in apoptosis via caspase-independent mechanisms, probably involving p53-dependent and independent pathways. However, the recently demonstrated co-localization of caspase-2 within the PML-NB nuclear structures presents a new paradigm for nuclear cell death. Here, we show that these nuclear structures have a protein known as SP100 that could contain a caspase recruitment domain (CARD). If verified experimentally, this discovery will suggest a mechanism by which caspase-2 could be recruited into the complex and ultimately lead to apoptosis.","['Sanchez-Pulido, Luis', 'Valencia, Alfonso', 'Rojas, Ana M']","['Sanchez-Pulido L', 'Valencia A', 'Rojas AM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Trends Biochem Sci,Trends in biochemical sciences,7610674,"['0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (CRADD Signaling Adaptor Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '135844-47-2 (Sp100 protein, human)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 2)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Nuclear/metabolism', '*Apoptosis', 'Autoantigens/metabolism', 'CRADD Signaling Adaptor Protein', 'Caspase 2/*metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus Structures', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intranuclear Inclusion Bodies/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism']",2007/08/19 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2007/08/19 09:00'],"['2007/03/07 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/02 00:00 [revised]', '2007/08/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Trends Biochem Sci. 2007 Sep;32(9):400-6. doi: 10.1016/j.tibs.2007.08.001.

Various investigators have shown that the fusion product AML1-ETO on its own is unable to promote leukemia. Early studies using transgenic mouse models demonstrated that the direct knock-in of the fusion protein expression is embryonic lethal, similar to the AML1 knockout, suggesting that AML1-ETO has a dominant negative role over AML1. Using the embryonic stem cells generated for such studies, we show here that the presence of the fusion product AML1-ETO blocks definitive hematopoiesis in vitro as well, in both one and two step methylcellulose methods of embryonic stem cell hematopoietic differentiation. However, there is a very low occurrence of macrophage colonies, similar to the knock-in mice that display macrophages in cell cultures of yolk sac derived cells. In addition, we show that exogenous expression of AML1 is unable to bypass this AML1-ETO induced definitive hematopoietic block in these cells. This inability is not linked to an inability to reverse gene expression inhibition by AML1-ETO of the PU.1 gene associated with stem cell maintenance and myeloid differentiation. Our results suggest that AML1-ETO functions in a complex competitive manner with AML1 involving transcriptional regulation, protein-protein interactions and post-transcriptional mechanism(s) affecting early embryonic hematopoiesis and possibly leukemogenesis.","['Peterson, Luke F', 'Lo, Miao-Chia', 'Okumura, Akiko Joo', 'Zhang, Dong-Er']","['Peterson LF', 'Lo MC', 'Okumura AJ', 'Zhang DE']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MTG8 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism']",2007/08/19 09:00,2007/12/21 09:00,['2007/08/19 09:00'],"['2007/06/03 00:00 [received]', '2007/06/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2007 Nov-Dec;39(3):321-8. doi: 10.1016/j.bcmd.2007.06.012.

Its expression increases during B-lymphocyte ontogeny. Few data are available about CD45 expression in the various types of low-grade B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL). Low levels of CD45 have been reported in pathologic lymphocytes from typical chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and higher levels of this antigen have been observed in some cases of atypical CLL and in some cases of other types of NHL. One hundred and seven bone marrow samples of NHL with bone marrow infiltration were investigated: 45 typical CLL, 15 atypical CLL, 9 mantle cell lymphomas (MCL), 1 MCL with CD23 expression, 18 marginal zone lymphomas (MZL), 6 lymphoplasmacytic lymphomas (LPL), 6 follicular lymphomas (FL), and 7 hairy cell leukemias (HCL). CD45 expression was evaluated by flow cytometry: pathologic lymphocytes were identified on the basis of specific immunophenotypic profile, CD19/K or CD19/lambda co-expression. Results were expressed as median fluorescence intensity (MFI) along a 1024 linear scale. CD45 expression was measured also on autologous T-lymphocytes and a ""CD45 index"" was calculated as the ratio MFI of pathologic B-lymphocytes/MFI of T-lymphocytes, to normalize the results obtained. We found four CD45 expression patterns: very low in typical CLL; relatively low in MCL; intermediate intensity in MZL, LPL, and FL; very high expression in HCL. Among the atypical cases, very high CD45 expression was found in one case of CD23-negative CLL, in CD23-positive MCL, and CLL with atypical morphology. The results indicate different levels of maturation in low-grade NHL and may help to characterize such neoplasias.","['Carulli, Giovanni', 'Cannizzo, Elisa', 'Zucca, Alessandra', 'Buda, Gabriele', 'Orciuolo, Enrico', 'Marini, Alessandra', 'Petrini, Mario']","['Carulli G', 'Cannizzo E', 'Zucca A', 'Buda G', 'Orciuolo E', 'Marini A', 'Petrini M']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPRC protein, human)']",IM,"['Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/*biosynthesis', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*metabolism/pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2007/08/19 09:00,2008/05/21 09:00,['2007/08/19 09:00'],"['2007/04/08 00:00 [received]', '2007/06/07 00:00 [revised]', '2007/06/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2008 Feb;32(2):263-7. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2007.06.002.

A number of mechanisms seem to be involved in the protective responses to PDT, including activation of transcription factors, heat shock proteins, antioxidant enzymes and apoptotic pathways. RESULTS: In this study, we address the effects of a destructive/lethal hexaminolevulinate (HAL) mediated PDT dose on the transcriptome by using transcriptional exon evidence oligo microarrays. Here, we confirm deviations in the steady state expression levels of previously identified early defence response genes and extend this to include unreported PDT inducible gene groups, most notably the metallothioneins and histones. HAL-PDT mediated stress also altered expression of genes encoded by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Further, we report PDT stress induced alternative splicing. Specifically, the ATF3 alternative isoform (deltaZip2) was up-regulated, while the full-length variant was not changed by the treatment. Results were independently verified by two different technological microarray platforms. Good microarray, RT-PCR and Western immunoblotting correlation for selected genes support these findings. CONCLUSION: Here, we report new insights into how destructive/lethal PDT alters the transcriptome not only at the transcriptional level but also at post-transcriptional level via alternative splicing.","['Cekaite, Lina', 'Peng, Qian', 'Reiner, Andrew', 'Shahzidi, Susan', 'Tveito, Siri', 'Furre, Ingegerd E', 'Hovig, Eivind']","['Cekaite L', 'Peng Q', 'Reiner A', 'Shahzidi S', 'Tveito S', 'Furre IE', 'Hovig E']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Genomics,BMC genomics,100965258,"['0 (ATF3 protein, human)', '0 (Activating Transcription Factor 3)', '0 (DNA, Mitochondrial)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Photosensitizing Agents)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '88755TAZ87 (Aminolevulinic Acid)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 4)', 'EC 3.4.- (Metalloproteases)', 'G7H20TKI67 (5-aminolevulinic acid hexyl ester)']",IM,"['Activating Transcription Factor 3/metabolism', 'Alternative Splicing/drug effects', 'Aminolevulinic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA, Mitochondrial/genetics', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Exons', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Histones/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 4/genetics/metabolism', 'Metalloproteases/genetics/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects', '*Photochemotherapy', 'Photosensitizing Agents/*pharmacology', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects']",2007/08/19 09:00,2007/11/10 09:00,['2007/08/19 09:00'],"['2006/12/20 00:00 [received]', '2007/08/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [entrez]']",epublish,BMC Genomics. 2007 Aug 13;8:273. doi: 10.1186/1471-2164-8-273.,"['1471-2164-8-273 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2164-8-273 [doi]']",,"['Department of Tumor Biology, Rikshopitalet - Radiumhospitalet Medical Center, 0310 Oslo, Norway. linac@rr-research.no']",,,,,,20070813,PMC2045114,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, constitutively active PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling has also been firmly established as a major determinant for cell growth, proliferation, and survival in an wide array of human cancers. Thus, blocking the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signal transduction network could be an effective new strategy for targeted anticancer therapy. Pharmacological inhibitors of this signaling cascade are powerful antineoplastic agents in vitro and in xenografted models of tumors, and some of them are now being tested in clinical trials. Recent studies showed that PI3K/Akt/mTOR axis is frequently activated in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patient blasts and strongly contributes to proliferation, survival, and drug-resistance of these cells. Both the disease-free survival and overall survival are significantly shorter in AML cases with PI3K/Akt/mTOR upregulation. Therefore, this signal transduction cascade may represent a target for innovative therapeutic treatments of AML patients. In this review, we discuss the possible mechanisms of activation of this pathway in AML cells and the downstream molecular targets of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling network which are important for blocking apoptosis, enhancing proliferation, and promoting drug-resistance of leukemic cells. We also highlight several pharmacological inhibitors which have been used to block this pathway for targeted therapy of AML. These small molecules induce apoptosis or sensitize AML cells to existing drugs, and might be used in the future for improving the outcome of this hematological disorder.","['Martelli, A M', 'Tazzari, P L', 'Evangelisti, C', 'Chiarini, F', 'Blalock, W L', 'Billi, A M', 'Manzoli, L', 'McCubrey, J A', 'Cocco, L']","['Martelli AM', 'Tazzari PL', 'Evangelisti C', 'Chiarini F', 'Blalock WL', 'Billi AM', 'Manzoli L', 'McCubrey JA', 'Cocco L']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United Arab Emirates,Curr Med Chem,Current medicinal chemistry,9440157,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Cycle', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sirolimus/therapeutic use', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases']",2007/08/19 09:00,2007/09/19 09:00,['2007/08/19 09:00'],"['2007/08/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Curr Med Chem. 2007;14(19):2009-23. doi: 10.2174/092986707781368423.,['10.2174/092986707781368423 [doi]'],,"[""Dipartimento di Scienze Anatomiche Umane e Fisiopatologia dell'Apparato Locomotore, Universita di Bologna, Cell Signalling Laboratory, via Irnerio 48, 40126 Bologna, Italy. amartell@biocfarm.unibo.it""]",['R011098195/PHS HHS/United States'],219,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Besides its antiviral effect, its potential use in the treatment of cancer has become an important area of research. CPEC is activated by intracellular phosphorylation ultimately forming its metabolite CPEC-TP. CPEC-TP is a non competitive inhibitor of cytidine-5'-triphosphate synthetase (CTP-synthetase), an important enzyme in the formation of CTP. Studies have shown that cancer cells have a high CTP synthetase activity, thus making them interesting targets for chemotherapy. CPEC has been preclinically studied in different malignancy models. In vitro results on leukemia show activity in the nanomolar range on several cell lines. However in vivo results are conflicting and the findings vary from increase in life span over 100% to only limited effectiveness. Interesting results have been obtained in colorectal and neuroblastoma cells. In several neuroblastoma cell lines incubation with CPEC in combination with cytarabine or gemcitabine has resulted in increased cell death compared to incubation with with only one of the agents. CPEC has been studied in a phase I trial in patients with solid tumors. In five of 26 patients unexplained cardiotoxicity (extreme hypotension) occurred. The cardiotoxic effects could not be reproduced in animal models. However, precautions should be taken when using this drug in future clinical trials. Low dosage of CPEC seems necessary and intensive cardiac monitoring is advisable. In this manuscript, it is demonstrated that CPEC has an anti-cancer effect in several tumor models: CPEC might be a potentially useful drug in anticancer treatment.","['Schimmel, K J M', 'Gelderblom, H', 'Guchelaar, H J']","['Schimmel KJ', 'Gelderblom H', 'Guchelaar HJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Curr Cancer Drug Targets,Current cancer drug targets,101094211,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '5CSZ8459RP (Cytidine)', '69MO0NDN8K (cyclopentenyl cytosine)', 'EC 6.3.- (Carbon-Nitrogen Ligases)', 'EC 6.3.4.2 (CTP synthetase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/metabolism/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Carbon-Nitrogen Ligases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytidine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/administration & dosage/metabolism/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans']",2007/08/19 09:00,2007/09/11 09:00,['2007/08/19 09:00'],"['2007/08/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/11 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Curr Cancer Drug Targets. 2007 Aug;7(5):504-9. doi: 10.2174/156800907781386579.,['10.2174/156800907781386579 [doi]'],,"['Department of Clinical Pharmacy and Toxicology, Leiden University Medical Center, The Netherlands. k.j.m.schimmel@lumc.nl']",,55,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We collected detailed information on occupational history and assessed exposure to meat in general and several types of meat via expert assessment of the questionnaires. The odds ratio (OR) of non-Hodgkin lymphoma for ever occupational exposure to meat was 1.18 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.95-1.46), that for exposure to beef meat was 1.22 (95% CI 0.90-1.67), and that for exposure to chicken meat was 1.19 (95% CI 0.91-1.55).

It is also possible to analyze solid tissues after reduction to a single cell suspension. One of the applications of fl ow cytometry is immunophenotyping. AIM: The authors try to introduce the basic physical and biological principles of fl ow-cytometry to the broader public and to prove the benefits of method in lymph nodes assessment. METHOD: A common method of immunophenotyping with the help of labeled monoclonal antibodies applied to lymph node cells was used. RESULTS: Flow cytometry revealed the infiltration of the extirpated lymph node with leukemic cells. CONCLUSIONS: The authors demonstrate fl ow cytometry as a relatively less common but efficient way of lymph node assessment in a patient with an anamnesis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. They also discuss the contribution of immunophenotyping to the process of the differential diagnostics of lymph nodes enlargement.,"['Pikalova, Zuzana', 'Szotkowski, Tomas', 'Indrak, Karel']","['Pikalova Z', 'Szotkowski T', 'Indrak K']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Czech Republic,Biomed Pap Med Fac Univ Palacky Olomouc Czech Repub,"Biomedical papers of the Medical Faculty of the University Palacky, Olomouc, Czechoslovakia",101140142,,IM,"['Adult', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping/methods', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis', 'Lymph Nodes/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphatic Diseases/diagnosis', 'Male']",2007/08/11 09:00,2008/04/04 09:00,['2007/08/11 09:00'],"['2007/08/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/04 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/11 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biomed Pap Med Fac Univ Palacky Olomouc Czech Repub. 2007 Jun;151(1):99-101. doi: 10.5507/bp.2007.018.,['10.5507/bp.2007.018 [doi]'],,"['Department of Haemato-oncology, University Hospital, Palacky University, Olomouc, Czech Republic.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we describe the use of siRNA against wt1 and bcl-2 in leukemic cell lines for successful growth inhibition. We have used two different sequences designated as siRNA-A and siRNA-B corresponding to positions within the wt1 coding sequence to downregulate wt1 and a commercially available siRNA kit to downregulate bcl-2. WT1 and bcl-2 gene expression in transfected leukemic cell lines were evaluated with RT-PCR and western blot analyses. MTT assay was used to measure the cell viability and flow cytometry using annexin V/PI-staining for apoptosis. K562 and HL-60 cell lines transfected with siRNA-A targeted to wt1 had greatly decreased levels of both wt1 mRNA and protein expression. In contrast, siRNA-B and control siRNA led almost to no effect on wt1 mRNA and protein expression. siRNA-A-reduced wt1 mRNA expression was associated with a decreased cell proliferation and increased number of apoptotic cells in K562 and HL-60 cells by 24 and 48 h after transfection. Combined treatment with wt1 siRNA and bcl-2 siRNA simultaneously was not able to override the cell growth and apoptosis effects compared to single treatment with wt1 siRNA. siRNAs targeted against human wt1 might be a valuable tool as antiproliferative agent against wt1 expressing leukemic cells.","['Glienke, W', 'Maute, L', 'Koehl, U', 'Esser, R', 'Milz, E', 'Bergmann, L']","['Glienke W', 'Maute L', 'Koehl U', 'Esser R', 'Milz E', 'Bergmann L']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'EUY85H477I (thiazolyl blue)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Genes, Wilms Tumor', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*metabolism', 'Tetrazolium Salts/pharmacology', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection']",2007/08/11 09:00,2007/10/27 09:00,['2007/08/11 09:00'],"['2007/08/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/27 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/11 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Oct;21(10):2164-70. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404878.

Comparing the array CGH and gene expression patterns revealed that genomic imbalances conferred a great impact on the expression of genes in the affected regions. The array CGH analyses identified a high frequency of cytogenetically cryptic genetic changes, for example, del(9p) and del(12p). Interestingly, a duplication of Xq material, varying between 30 and 60 Mb in size, was found in 6 of 11 males (55%), but not in females. Genes on Xq were found to have a high expression level in cases with dup(Xq); a similar overexpression was confirmed in t(12;21)-positive cases in an external gene expression data set. By studying the expression profile and the proposed function of genes in the minimally gained region, several candidate target genes (SPANXB, HMGB3, FAM50A, HTATSF1 and RAP2C) were identified. Among them, the testis-specific SPANXB gene was the only one showing a high and uniform overexpression, irrespective of gender and presence of Xq duplication, suggesting that this gene plays an important pathogenetic role in t(12;21)-positive leukemia.","['Lilljebjorn, H', 'Heidenblad, M', 'Nilsson, B', 'Lassen, C', 'Horvat, A', 'Heldrup, J', 'Behrendtz, M', 'Johansson, B', 'Andersson, A', 'Fioretos, T']","['Lilljebjorn H', 'Heidenblad M', 'Nilsson B', 'Lassen C', 'Horvat A', 'Heldrup J', 'Behrendtz M', 'Johansson B', 'Andersson A', 'Fioretos T']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosomes, Human, X', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*biosynthesis', 'Female', '*Gene Duplication', '*Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', '*Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets/*biosynthesis', 'Repressor Proteins/*biosynthesis']",2007/08/11 09:00,2007/10/27 09:00,['2007/08/11 09:00'],"['2007/08/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/27 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/11 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Oct;21(10):2137-44. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404879.

In this study, we identified TSC-22 as a potential leukemia suppressor. Two types of FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 (Flt3) mutations are frequently found in acute myeloid leukemia: Flt3-ITD harboring an internal tandem duplication in the juxtamembrane domain associated with poor prognosis and Flt3-TKD harboring a point mutation in the kinase domain. Comparison of gene expression profiles between Flt3-ITD- and Flt3-TKD-transduced Ba/F3 cells revealed that constitutive activation of Flt3 by Flt3-TKD, but not Flt3-ITD, upregulated the expression of TSC-22. Importantly, treatment with an Flt3 inhibitor PKC412 or an Flt3 small interfering RNA decreased the expression level of TSC-22 in Flt3-TKD-transduced cells. Forced expression of TSC-22 suppressed the growth and accelerated the differentiation of several leukemia cell lines into monocytes, in particular, in combination with differentiation-inducing reagents. On the other hand, a dominant-negative form of TSC-22 accelerated the growth of Flt3-TKD-transduced 32Dcl.3 cells.

There are no data whether any of these regimens has advantage and in what setting. We retrospectively analyzed SCT outcomes in 151 patients given fludarabine-based RIC for various hematological malignancies; 72 conditioned with fludarabine and intravenous-busulfan (FB) and 79 with fludarabine and melphalan (FM). FM was more myelosuppressive. Grade III-IV organ toxicity occurred in 31 and 53% of FB and FM recipients (P=0.005) and acute graft-versus-host disease grade II-IV in 33 and 53%, respectively (P=0.01). Non-relapse mortality rate (NRM) was 16 and 40%, respectively (P=0.003). Active disease (HR 2.2, P=0.003) and prior autologous SCT (HR 1.7, P=0.04) predicted inferior overall survival (OS). Among patients transplanted in remission, OS was 72 and 36% after FB and FM, respectively (P=0.03) due to increased NRM with FM. Similarly, patients transplanted in active disease experienced higher NRM with FM, however lower relapse rates resulted in equivalent OS. In conclusion, there are marked differences in outcome between RIC regimens that are theoretically dose-equivalent. The FM regimen is more myelosuppressive and toxic but controls disease better. FB was associated with improved survival in patients transplanted in remission.

We have reported that trolox, an analogue of alpha-tocopherol, increases As2O3-mediated apoptosis in a variety of APL, myeloma and breast cancer cell lines, while non-malignant cells may be protected. In the present study, we extended previous results to show that trolox increases As2O3-mediated apoptosis in the P388 lymphoma cell line in vitro, as evidenced by decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential and release of cytochrome c. We then sought to determine whether this combination can enhance antitumor effects while protecting normal cells in vivo. In BDF1 mice, trolox treatment decreased As2O3-induced hepatomegaly, markers of oxidative stress and hepatocellular damage. In P388 tumor-bearing mice, As2O3 treatment prolonged survival, and the addition of trolox provided a further significant increase in lifespan. In addition, the combination of As2O3 and trolox inhibited metastatic spread, and protected the tumor-bearing mice from As2O3 liver toxicity. Our results suggest, for the first time, that trolox might prevent some of the clinical manifestations of As2O3-related toxicity while increasing its pro-apoptotic capacity and clinical efficacy in hematological malignancies.","['Diaz, Z', 'Laurenzana, A', 'Mann, K K', 'Bismar, T A', 'Schipper, H M', 'Miller, W H Jr']","['Diaz Z', 'Laurenzana A', 'Mann KK', 'Bismar TA', 'Schipper HM', 'Miller WH Jr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Chromans)', '0 (Oxides)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'S18UL9710X (6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Antioxidants/administration & dosage', 'Apoptosis', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*administration & dosage', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromans/*administration & dosage', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', '*Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Liver/*drug effects', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Oxides/*administration & dosage/toxicity']",2007/08/11 09:00,2007/10/27 09:00,['2007/08/11 09:00'],"['2007/08/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/27 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/11 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Oct;21(10):2117-27. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404891.

The transgenic mice showed increased mortality with severe organ infiltration by neutrophils, and the homeostasis of hematopoiesis was broken. The myelopoiesis was enhanced with expansion of myeloid cells in BM, increased peripheral granulocytes and extramedullary myelopoiesis in spleen. In contrast to myeloid cells, the lymphoid commitment was severely impaired with the B lymphopoiesis blocked at the transition from pro/pre-B I to pre-B II stage in BM and T thymocytes development blocked at the most immature stage (DN I).

However, high incidence of toxicity and low stability in vivo were observed with hydroxamic acid-based HDACi such as suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), thus limiting its clinical applicability. In this study, we found that a novel non-hydroxamate HDACi NCH-51 could inhibit the cell growth of a variety of lymphoid malignant cells through apoptosis induction, more effectively than SAHA. Activation of caspase-3, -8 and -9, but not -7 was detected after the treatment with NCH-51. Gene expression profiles showed that NCH-51 and SAHA similarly upregulated p21 and downregulated anti-apoptotic molecules including survivin, bcl-w and c-FLIP. Proteome analysis using two-dimensional electrophoresis revealed that NCH-51 upregulated anti-oxidant molecules including peroxiredoxin 1 and 2 and glutathione S-transferase at the protein level. Interestingly, NCH-51 induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) after 8 h whereas SAHA continuously declined ROS. Pretreatment with an antioxidant, N-acetyl-L-cysteine, abolished the cytotoxicity of NCH-51. These findings suggest that NCH-51 exhibits cytotoxicity by sustaining ROS at the higher level greater than SAHA. This study indicates the therapeutic efficacy of NCH-51 and novel insights for anti-HDAC therapy.","['Sanda, T', 'Okamoto, T', 'Uchida, Y', 'Nakagawa, H', 'Iida, S', 'Kayukawa, S', 'Suzuki, T', 'Oshizawa, T', 'Suzuki, T', 'Miyata, N', 'Ueda, R']","['Sanda T', 'Okamoto T', 'Uchida Y', 'Nakagawa H', 'Iida S', 'Kayukawa S', 'Suzuki T', 'Oshizawa T', 'Suzuki T', 'Miyata N', 'Ueda R']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (NCH-51 compound)', '0 (Proteome)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Sulfhydryl Compounds)', 'EC 1.11.1.15 (Peroxiredoxins)']",IM,"['Antioxidants/chemistry', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Peroxiredoxins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics/*methods', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Sulfhydryl Compounds/*pharmacology']",2007/08/11 09:00,2007/12/12 09:00,['2007/08/11 09:00'],"['2007/08/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/11 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Nov;21(11):2344-53. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404902.

A total of 102 patients were registered on two consecutive multicenter trials, designated MLL96 and MLL98, between 1995 and 2001. Those with a rearranged MLL gene (MLL-R, n=80) were assigned to receive intensive chemotherapy followed by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), while those with germline MLL (MLL-G, n=22) were treated with chemotherapy alone. The 5-year event-free survival (EFS) rate for all 102 infants was 50.9% (95% confidence interval, 41.0-60.8%). The most prominent late effect was growth impairment, observed in 58.9% of all evaluable patients in the MLL-R group. This plan of risk-based therapy appears to have improved the overall prognosis for infants with ALL, compared with previously reported results.

The population represented a sample of all workers based on radiation dose at study termination. The final sample included 28,000 workers with > or = 5.0 mSv, 10,462 workers with < 5.0 mSv and 33,353 non-nuclear workers. Nuclear workers had lower mortality rates for leukemia and LHC than US white males but higher rates of lung cancer and a significant five-fold excess of mesothelioma. Dose-dependent analyses of risks in the high exposure group indicated that for each cancer the risk increased at exposures above 10.0 mSv. An internal comparison of workers with 50.0 mSv exposures to workers with exposures of 5.0-9.9 mSv indicated relative risks for leukemia of 2.41 (95% CI: 0.5, 23.8), for LHC, 2.94 (95% CI: 1.0,12.0), for lung cancer, 1.26 (95% CI: 0.9, 1.9) and for mesothelioma, 1.61 (95% CI: 0.4, 9.7) for the higher exposure group. Except for LHC, these risks are not significant. However, the increasing risk with increasing exposure for these cancers, some of which are known to be related to radiation, suggests that low-level protracted exposures to gamma rays may be associated with these cancers. Other agents such as asbestos, which are common to shipyard work, may play a role especially in the risk of mesothelioma. Future follow up of the population would identify bounds on radiation risks for this population for comparison with similar risks estimated from other populations.","['Matanoski, Genevieve M', 'Tonascia, James A', 'Correa-Villasenor, Adolfo', 'Yates, Katherine C', 'Fink, Nancy', 'Elliott, Elizabeth', 'Sanders, Bruce', 'Lantry, Deborah']","['Matanoski GM', 'Tonascia JA', 'Correa-Villasenor A', 'Yates KC', 'Fink N', 'Elliott E', 'Sanders B', 'Lantry D']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Radiat Res,Journal of radiation research,0376611,,IM,"['Adult', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gamma Rays/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Industry/statistics & numerical data', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*etiology/*mortality', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*mortality', '*Nuclear Reactors/statistics & numerical data', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects/statistics & numerical data', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Time', 'United States']",2007/08/11 09:00,2008/03/18 09:00,['2007/08/11 09:00'],"['2007/08/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/18 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/11 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Radiat Res. 2008 Jan;49(1):83-91. doi: 10.1269/jrr.06082.

In 2004 and 2005, 38 different laboratories from North America participated in three separate sample exchanges using real-time qRT-PCR to measure RNA transcript levels in unknown diluents of a BCR-ABL1-positive cell line, K562. In this study we compared results of quantitative testing for BCR-ABL1 from laboratories using different platforms, internal controls, reagents, and calculation methods. Our data showed that there can be considerable variability of results from laboratory to laboratory, with log reduction calculations varying from 1.6 to 3 log between laboratories at the same dilution. We found that none of the variables tested had a significant impact on the results reported, except for the use of ABL1 as the internal control (P < 0.001). Laboratories that used ABL1 consistently underreported their log reduction values. Regardless of the specific methodology and platform used for real-time qRT-PCR testing, it is important for laboratories to participate in proficiency testing to ensure consistent and acceptable test accuracy and sensitivity.

Exposed subendothelial collagen interacting with platelet glycoprotein (GP) VI leads to platelet activation and integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3)-mediated aggregation. We previously showed that ligand binding to GPVI also induces metalloproteinase-dependent shedding, generating an approximately 55-kDa soluble ectodomain fragment and an approximately 10-kDa membrane-associated remnant. Here, treatment of platelets with collagen or the GPVI-targeting rattlesnake toxin convulxin also induces rapid (10-30 s) formation of a high molecular weight GPVI complex (GPVIc) under nonreducing conditions, as detected by immunoblotting with anti-GPVI antibodies. The appearance of an approximately 20-kDa remnant detectable using a polyclonal antibody against the GPVI cytoplasmic tail under nonreducing, but not reducing, conditions after ectodomain shedding and nonreduced/reduced two-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel analysis of biotinylated platelets confirmed that that GPVIc was a homodimer. Formation of disulfide-linked GPVIc was prolonged in the presence of metalloproteinase inhibitor GM6001 and was independent of GPVI signaling because it was unaffected by inhibitors of Src kinases, Syk, or phosphoinositide 3-kinase. To identify the thiol involved in disulfide bond formation, wild-type or mutant GPVI, where two available sulfhydryls (Cys-274 and Cys-338) were individually mutated to serine, was expressed in rat basophilic leukemia cells. Dimerization of wild-type and C274S GPVI, but not the C338S mutant, was observed after treating cells with convulxin. We conclude that (i) a subpopulation of GPVI forms a constitutive dimer on the platelet surface, facilitating rapid disulfide cross-linking, (ii) convulxin or other GPVI agonists induce disulfide-linked GPVI dimerization independent of GPVI signaling, and (iii) the penultimate residue of the GPVI cytoplasmic tail, Cys-338, mediates disulfide-dependent dimer formation.","['Arthur, Jane F', 'Shen, Yang', 'Kahn, Mark L', 'Berndt, Michael C', 'Andrews, Robert K', 'Gardiner, Elizabeth E']","['Arthur JF', 'Shen Y', 'Kahn ML', 'Berndt MC', 'Andrews RK', 'Gardiner EE']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Crotalid Venoms)', '0 (Dipeptides)', '0 (Disulfides)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (N-(2(R)-2-(hydroxamidocarbonylmethyl)-4-methylpentanoyl)-L-tryptophan', 'methylamide)', '0 (Platelet Glycoprotein GPIIb-IIIa Complex)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (platelet membrane glycoprotein VI)', '37206-04-5 (convulxin)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (SYK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk protein, rat)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.- (Metalloproteases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Blood Platelets/*metabolism', 'Blood Vessels/injuries/metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/genetics/*metabolism', 'Collagen/genetics/metabolism', 'Crotalid Venoms/pharmacology', 'Dimerization', 'Dipeptides/pharmacology', 'Disulfides/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Lectins, C-Type', 'Ligands', 'Metalloproteases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Oxidation-Reduction/drug effects', '*Platelet Adhesiveness/drug effects/genetics', 'Platelet Glycoprotein GPIIb-IIIa Complex/genetics/metabolism', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins/*agonists/genetics/metabolism', 'Protease Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/genetics', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics', 'Syk Kinase', 'Thrombosis/genetics/*metabolism', 'src-Family Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/physiology']",2007/08/11 09:00,2007/12/13 09:00,['2007/08/11 09:00'],"['2007/08/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/11 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2007 Oct 19;282(42):30434-41. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M701330200.

Because traditional trials are designed to evaluate one agent at a time, the evaluation of therapies in combination requires specialized trial designs. In place of the traditional separate phase I and II trials, we propose using a parallel phase I/II clinical trial to evaluate simultaneously the safety and efficacy of combination dose levels, and select the optimal combination dose. The trial is started with an initial period of dose escalation, then patients are randomly assigned to admissible dose levels. These dose levels are compared with each other. Bayesian posterior probabilities are used in the randomization to adaptively assign more patients to doses with higher efficacy levels. Combination doses with lower efficacy are temporarily closed and those with intolerable toxicity are eliminated from the trial. The trial is stopped if the posterior probability for safety, efficacy, or futility crosses a prespecified boundary. For illustration, we apply the design to a combination chemotherapy trial for leukemia. We use simulation studies to assess the operating characteristics of the parallel phase I/II trial design, and compare it to a conventional design for a standard phase I and phase II trial. The simulations show that the proposed design saves sample size, has better power, and efficiently assigns more patients to doses with higher efficacy levels.","['Huang, Xuelin', 'Biswas, Swati', 'Oki, Yasuhiro', 'Issa, Jean-Pierre', 'Berry, Donald A']","['Huang X', 'Biswas S', 'Oki Y', 'Issa JP', 'Berry DA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Biometrics,Biometrics,0370625,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Bayes Theorem', 'Biometry', 'Clinical Trials, Phase I as Topic/*statistics & numerical data', 'Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Logistic Models', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic/statistics & numerical data', 'Safety']",2007/08/11 09:00,2007/09/15 09:00,['2007/08/11 09:00'],"['2007/08/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/15 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/11 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biometrics. 2007 Jun;63(2):429-36. doi: 10.1111/j.1541-0420.2006.00685.x.,"['BIOM685 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1541-0420.2006.00685.x [doi]']",,"['Department of Biostatistics and Applied Mathematics, University of Texas, M.

To this end, an oligonucleotide array approach was used to study the gene expression in CD34(+) cells from human cord blood retrovirally transduced with WT1 or a control vector. We found that the expression of the putative tumor suppressor gene N-myc downstream regulated gene 2 (NDRG2) mRNA was induced by WT1 in CD34(+) cells and also in leukemic U937 cells. Furthermore, a novel transcription start site in the NDRG2 gene was identified in WT1-transduced cells, in addition to two previously reported transcription start sites.

The most extensively studied protein involved in multidrug resistance (MDR) is the transmembrane glycoprotein P (P-gp), the product of the multidrug resistance gene 1 (MDR1). MDR1/P-gp overexpression is frequently observed in hematological malignancies, especially in acute leukemia, and has been reported to correlate with poor prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The aim of this study was to evaluate the level of MDR1 gene expression in bone marrow and/or peripheral blood samples in 92 AML patients in relation to their prognosis. The analyzed group was stratified according to presence or absence of prognostically favorable aberrations (PFAs), such as t(15;17) with PML/RARalpha fusion gene, t(8;21) with AML1/ETO fusion gene or inv(16)/ t(16;16) with CBFbeta/MYH11 fusion gene. These prognostically favorable aberrations were detected by RT-PCR and/or standard cytogenetic techniques. MDR1 expression was detected by semiquantitative comparative RT-PCR using software-based evaluation. The levels of MDR1 expression in the bone marrow predicted induction of complete remission in the whole group of analyzed patients (P = 0.032). They were significantly lower in PFA negative patients who achieved complete remission compared to those who failed to achieve complete remission (P = 0.008). In PFA negative patients, MDR1 expression was higher when compared to PFA positive patients (P = 0.055). No such difference was found when analyzing peripheral blood samples. Our experiments showed no impact of MDR1 expression in bone marrow or peripheral blood cells on overall survival (P = 1.000 and P = 0.903 respectively). In summary, the present study shows the prognostic impact of MDR1 expression on induction of complete remission in AML patients. We confirmed that MDR1 overexpression is an unfavorable prognostic factor in AML, which may help to stratify the risk rate of PFA negative patients.

These cells represented by K562 myeloblasts originated from the blastic phase of the chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) carry characteristic bcr-abl fusion gene. They represent a convenient model for in vitro studies of CML myeloblasts and are sensitive to various agents which may induce ageing, differentiation and cell death. Mean nuclear diameter (MNuD) and largest nuclear diameter (Mx NuD) in stained cytospins of these cells were measured at a high light microscopic magnification by means of computer programme. Starving cultures were used for induction of ageing without preceding differentiation, sodium butyrate was used as a cytostatic agent or differentiation inducer and imatinib mesylate represented a cytostatic agent for CML. The largest shift of MNuD to smaller values was noted in ageing cultures or cultures treated with butyrate. The decrease of MNuD was less apparent in resistant cells treated with imatinib. This drug, however, produced a very large incidence of necrotic or apoptotic cells or bodies. From the methodical point of view it should be mentioned that values of maximal nuclear diameter (MxNuD) followed similar trends as MNuD and thus provided similar information. The measurement of both nuclear diameters, i.e. MNuD and MxNuD might be a complementary and simple tool to evaluate the cell state in cytological preparations because of their decrease in ageing cells or cells treated with antiproliferative drugs of different mode of action.","['Smetana, K', 'Pilcova, H', 'Pluskalova, M', 'Hrkal, Z']","['Smetana K', 'Pilcova H', 'Pluskalova M', 'Hrkal Z']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Aging/drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Butyrates/*pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology']",2007/08/11 09:00,2007/10/25 09:00,['2007/08/11 09:00'],"['2007/08/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/25 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/11 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Neoplasma. 2007;54(5):359-64.,,,"['Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, U nemocnice 1, Praha 2, 128 20 Czech Republic. karel.smetana@uhkt.cz']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, objective responses are only achieved in 20% of cases and long-term survival is rarely observed. Clinically applied anticancer drugs exert at least some of their activities by inducing apoptosis. A critical step in apoptotic signal transduction is the permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM), which is regulated by the BCL-2 family of proteins. Hence, therapeutic targeting of BCL-2 proteins is a promising approach to increase the drug-sensitivity of cancers. To this end we have assessed the impact of conditional expression of the proapoptotic multidomain (BH1-2-3) protein BAK, which directly permeabilizes the MOM, and the BH3-mimetic ABT-737, which acts indirectly by derepressing BH1-2-3 proteins, on apoptosis and drug sensitivity of NSCLC cells. Conditionally expressed BAK sensitized resistant NSCLC cells to drug-induced apoptosis. In contrast, ABT-737 was ineffective in those NSCLC cells expressing high levels of the anti-apoptotic MCL-1 protein. Tissue microarray analysis of tumor samples from 84 chemotherapy-naive NSCLC patients revealed MCL-1 expression in 56% of cases, thus supporting the relevance of this resistance factor in a clinical setting. Enforced expression of the BH3-only protein NOXA, which targets MCL-1, overcame resistance to ABT-737. Moreover, combining conditionally expressed BAK with ABT-737 enhanced apoptosis in NSCLC cells independently of their MCL-1 status. In conclusion, the heterogeneity of apoptosis defects observed in drug-resistant NSCLC demands individually tailored molecular therapies. Targeting the MOM permeabilizer BAK appears to have a broader apoptogenic activity than the BH3-only mimetic ABT-737.","['Wesarg, Emmanuelle', 'Hoffarth, Sandra', 'Wiewrodt, Rainer', 'Kroll, Monika', 'Biesterfeld, Stefan', 'Huber, Christoph', 'Schuler, Martin']","['Wesarg E', 'Hoffarth S', 'Wiewrodt R', 'Kroll M', 'Biesterfeld S', 'Huber C', 'Schuler M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BAK1 protein, human)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '1P9D0Z171K (Butylated Hydroxytoluene)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '728-39-2 (BH 3)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Biphenyl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Butylated Hydroxytoluene/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Electrophoresis', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nitrophenols/*pharmacology', 'Paclitaxel/pharmacology', 'Permeability', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/metabolism']",2007/08/11 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2007/08/11 09:00'],"['2007/08/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/11 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2007 Dec 1;121(11):2387-94. doi: 10.1002/ijc.22977.,['10.1002/ijc.22977 [doi]'],"['(c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['Gene Therapy Laboratory, Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Drugs known to produce AML following chemotherapy of primary malignancy are usually alkylating agents or topoisomerase II inhibitors. Both children and adults develop AML following treatment with these classes of antineoplastic drugs. In this review, the effect of age at treatment on a child's susceptibility to developing therapy related AML was investigated. The clinical literature describing pediatric cancer patients treated with cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents was used to characterize risk factors associated with chemical leukemogenesis in children. As demonstrated in the published literature, the risk of developing AML following chemotherapy is not reliably correlated with the age of the pediatric patient. There is no consistent evidence that indicates that younger children will be at increased risk; in fact, some studies suggest that younger children might actually display a decreased susceptibility. The age dependency of treatment-related malignancies (all types) in children appears to vary considerably with the type of secondary neoplasm in question. For example, secondary solid tumors such as breast, central nervous system (CNS), bone, and thyroid cancer are highly dependent on the age of the patient at time of diagnosis and treatment; in contrast, an age dependency for t-AML risk was not observed in these same patient populations. Predictably, the induction of t-AML in children follows a rational dose-response relationship, with increasing doses of chemotherapy resulting in greater risk. Recent U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) cancer risk assessment guidance recommends a default assumption that children are inherently up to 10-fold more sensitive than adults to carcinogen exposures. Available scientific and medical literature does not support the hypothesis that children necessarily possess an increased risk of developing AML following leukemogenic chemical exposure.","['Pyatt, David W', 'Aylward, Lesa L', 'Hays, Sean M']","['Pyatt DW', 'Aylward LL', 'Hays SM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,J Toxicol Environ Health B Crit Rev,"Journal of toxicology and environmental health.

Headspace gas chromatography is the analytical method of choice for obtaining reliable results on its occurrence. The presence of furan in some food items has been known since the late 1970s, but a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) survey published in 2004 revealed the occurrence of furan in a broad variety of canned and jarred foods, including baby food, that undergo heat treatment. Furan is carcinogenic in rats and mice, showing a dose-dependent increase in hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas. In rats, a dose-dependent increase of mononuclear leukaemia is evident and a very high incidence of cholangiocarcinomas of the liver, even at the lowest dose tested. There is evidence to indicate that furan-induced carcinogenicity is probably attributable to a genotoxic mechanism. However, chronic toxicity with secondary cell proliferation may indirectly amplify the tumour response. From the available data, there is a relative small difference between possible human exposure and the doses in experimental animals required to produce carcinogenic effects. However, reliable risk assessment requires further data on both toxicity and exposure.

We studied the school marks of childhood leukemia survivors in a register-based study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three hundred seventy-one patients with a diagnosis of leukemia before the age of 16 years who were born between 1974 and 1986 and alive on their 16th birthday were identified from the Finnish Cancer Registry. Five matched controls were sought for each patient from the Population Register Center of Finland. Information on the ninth-grade school report was obtained from Statistics Finland. The overall mark average and the marks (scale 4 to 10) for mother tongue, foreign language, mathematics, and physical education were compared between the patients and controls. RESULTS: The ninth-grade school report was obtained by 97.6% of the patients and 98.5% of the controls. The patients whose treatment included cranial irradiation had a lower overall mark average (mean difference, -0.24; 95% CI, -0.33 to -0.15) and lower marks for all assessed school subjects compared with their controls. Of the patients treated with chemotherapy alone, only the females with leukemia diagnosed before 7 years of age had lower school marks than their controls. The biggest difference was observed in the marks for foreign language among the irradiated females diagnosed at a young age (mean difference, -1.0; 95% CI, -1.25 to -0.74). CONCLUSION: Leukemia treatment that includes cranial irradiation impairs scholastic achievement. It is noteworthy that treatment of leukemia with chemotherapy alone impairs school performance only in females diagnosed before school age.","['Harila-Saari, Arja H', 'Lahteenmaki, Paivi M', 'Pukkala, Eero', 'Kyyronen, Pentti', 'Lanning, Marjatta', 'Sankila, Risto']","['Harila-Saari AH', 'Lahteenmaki PM', 'Pukkala E', 'Kyyronen P', 'Lanning M', 'Sankila R']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Educational Status', 'Female', 'Finland', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*psychology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Physical Education and Training', 'Registries', 'Schools', 'Sex Factors', 'Students']",2007/08/10 09:00,2007/08/31 09:00,['2007/08/10 09:00'],"['2007/08/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/31 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/10 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2007 Aug 10;25(23):3518-24. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2006.09.4987.,"['25/23/3518 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2006.09.4987 [doi]']",,"['Department of Pediatrics and Adolescence, Oulu University Hospital, OYS, Oulu, Finland. arja.harila-saari@oulu.fi']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied a learning cohort of 426 MDS patients diagnosed at the Department of Hematology, San Matteo Hospital, Pavia, Italy, between 1992 and 2004, and a validation cohort of 739 patients diagnosed at the Heinrich-Heine-University Hospital, Dusseldorf, Germany, between 1982 and 2003. All patients were reclassified according to WHO criteria. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed using Cox models with time-dependent covariates. RESULTS: The most important variables for the prognostic model were WHO subgroups, karyotype, and transfusion requirement. We defined a WHO classification-based prognostic scoring system (WPSS) that was able to classify patients into five risk groups showing different survivals (median survival from 12 to 103 months) and probabilities of leukemic evolution (P < .001). WPSS was shown to predict survival and leukemia progression at any time during follow-up (P < .001), and its prognostic value was confirmed in the validation cohort. CONCLUSION: WPSS is a dynamic prognostic scoring system that provides an accurate prediction of survival and risk of leukemic evolution in MDS patients at any time during the course of their disease. This time-dependent system seems particularly useful in lower risk patients and may be used for implementing risk-adapted treatment strategies.","['Malcovati, Luca', 'Germing, Ulrich', 'Kuendgen, Andrea', 'Della Porta, Matteo G', 'Pascutto, Cristiana', 'Invernizzi, Rosangela', 'Giagounidis, Aristoteles', 'Hildebrandt, Barbara', 'Bernasconi, Paolo', 'Knipp, Sabine', 'Strupp, Corinna', 'Lazzarino, Mario', 'Aul, Carlo', 'Cazzola, Mario']","['Malcovati L', 'Germing U', 'Kuendgen A', 'Della Porta MG', 'Pascutto C', 'Invernizzi R', 'Giagounidis A', 'Hildebrandt B', 'Bernasconi P', 'Knipp S', 'Strupp C', 'Lazzarino M', 'Aul C', 'Cazzola M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Blood Transfusion', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cytogenetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/*etiology', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Staging/methods', 'Prognosis', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2007/08/10 09:00,2007/08/31 09:00,['2007/08/10 09:00'],"['2007/08/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/31 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/10 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2007 Aug 10;25(23):3503-10. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2006.08.5696.,"['25/23/3503 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2006.08.5696 [doi]']",,"['Department of Hematology, University of Pavia, Fondazione Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico Policlinico San Matteo, 27100 Pavia, Italy.']",,,"['J Clin Oncol. 2008 Mar 1;26(7):1180; author reply 1181-2.

To identify a susceptibility gene for CLL, we assembled families from the major European (ICLLC) and American (GEC) consortia to conduct a genome-wide linkage analysis of 101 new CLL pedigrees using a high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array and combined the results with data from our previously reported analysis of 105 families. Here, we report on the combined analysis of the 206 families. Multipoint linkage analyses were undertaken using both nonparametric (model-free) and parametric (model-based) methods. After the removal of high linkage disequilibrium SNPs, we obtained a maximum nonparametric linkage (NPL) score of 3.02 (P = .001) on chromosome 2q21.2. The same genomic position also yielded the highest multipoint heterogeneity LOD (HLOD) score under a common recessive model of disease susceptibility (HLOD = 3.11; P = 7.7 x 10(-5)), which was significant at the genome-wide level. In addition, 2 other chromosomal positions, 6p22.1 (corresponding to the major histocompatibility locus) and 18q21.1, displayed HLOD scores higher than 2.1 (P < .002). None of the regions coincided with areas of common chromosomal abnormalities frequently observed in CLL.

Previous studies have shown that CLL B lymphocytes express relatively large amounts of CD74 mRNA relative to normal B cells. In the present study, we analyzed the molecular mechanism regulated by CD74 in B-CLL cells. The results presented here show that activation of cell-surface CD74, expressed at high levels from an early stage of the disease by its natural ligand, macrophage migration-inhibition factor (MIF), initiates a signaling cascade that contributes to tumor progression. This pathway induces NF-kappaB activation, resulting in the secretion of IL-8 which, in turn, promotes cell survival. Inhibition of this pathway leads to decreased cell survival. These findings could form the basis of unique therapeutic strategies aimed at blocking the CD74-induced, IL-8- dependent survival pathway.","['Binsky, Inbal', 'Haran, Michal', 'Starlets, Diana', 'Gore, Yael', 'Lantner, Frida', 'Harpaz, Nurit', 'Leng, Lin', 'Goldenberg, David M', 'Shvidel, Lev', 'Berrebi, Alain', 'Bucala, Richard', 'Shachar, Idit']","['Binsky I', 'Haran M', 'Starlets D', 'Gore Y', 'Lantner F', 'Harpaz N', 'Leng L', 'Goldenberg DM', 'Shvidel L', 'Berrebi A', 'Bucala R', 'Shachar I']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (invariant chain)']",IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*physiology', 'Blotting, Western', '*Cell Survival', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-8/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/*pathology', 'Signal Transduction']",2007/08/10 09:00,2007/10/25 09:00,['2007/08/10 09:00'],"['2007/08/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/25 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/10 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2007 Aug 14;104(33):13408-13. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0701553104.

In KMCH cholangiocarcinoma cells stably expressing Mcl-1 small interference RNA (siRNA), treatment with TRAIL induced a redistribution of the cathepsin B from lysosomes to the cytosol. Pharmacological and small hairpin RNA-targeted inhibition of cathepsin B attenuated TRAIL-mediated apoptosis as assessed by morphological, biochemical, and clonogenic assays. Neither Bid siRNA nor Bak siRNA prevented cathepsin B release. In contrast, treatment of the cells with Bim siRNA or the JNK inhibitor SP600125 attenuated lysosomal permeabilization and cell death. Moreover, Bim and active Bax co-localized to lysosomes in TRAIL-treated cells in a JNK-dependent manner, and Bax siRNA reduced TRAIL-induced lysosomal permeabilization and cell death. Finally, BH3 domain peptides permeabilized isolated lysosomes in the presence of Bax. Collectively, these data suggest that TRAIL can trigger an apoptotic pathway that involves JNK-dependent activation of Bim, which in turn induces Bax-mediated permeabilization of lysosomes.","['Werneburg, Nathan W', 'Guicciardi, M Eugenia', 'Bronk, Steve F', 'Kaufmann, Scott H', 'Gores, Gregory J']","['Werneburg NW', 'Guicciardi ME', 'Bronk SF', 'Kaufmann SH', 'Gores GJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Anthracenes)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BAK1 protein, human)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '1TW30Y2766 (pyrazolanthrone)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 4)', 'EC 3.4.22.1 (Cathepsin B)']",IM,"['Anthracenes/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Cathepsin B/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane Permeability/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Lysosomes/*metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 4/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Peptides/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/metabolism/pharmacology', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/*metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/*metabolism']",2007/08/10 09:00,2007/11/09 09:00,['2007/08/10 09:00'],"['2007/08/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/09 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/10 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2007 Sep 28;282(39):28960-28970. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M705671200.

The leukemic cell lines used in this study were NALM-1, JURKAT, HL-60 and K-562. Fifteen out of 16 tested diazenes were cytotoxic towards the leukemic cell lines: 11 with high efficacy (IC(50)<50 microM) at least towards two to three leukemic cell lines, and 4 with medium efficacy (IC(50)>50 microM). Ten out of these 11 diazenes have a common structure and belong to the subclass of diazenecarboxamides. Five diazenes (SB-681, LK-34, UP-39, JK-1197, UP-11) were highly cytotoxic (IC(50) values 3.3-38.9 microM) towards all four leukemic cell lines. The selectivity of the cytotoxicity towards leukemic cells was tested by using resting and Con-A-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isolated from healthy donors and towards normal mouse fibroblast cell line, 3T3. The diazenes cytotoxic towards leukemic cells, did not affect the viability of the resting PBMC suggesting selectivity of their action. Moreover, eight diazenes did not affect the normal dividing cells (Con-A-stimulated PBMC and fibroblasts). Thus, we present eight diazenes which are selectively cytotoxic towards leukemic cells, not affecting normal cells even when activated to proliferation.

Correspondingly, AKAP12 was expressed in normal progenitors but transcriptionally silent in leukaemic blasts. Re-expression of AKAP12 in Kasumi-1 and SKNO-1 cells was accomplished by treatment with MS275 alone or in combination with zebularine, indicating epigenetic mechanisms of gene repression. AKAP12 hypermethylation was found in one case of refractory anaemia with excess blasts (RAEB) and two cases of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) in a panel of 21 blood or bone marrow samples from children with malignant myeloid disorders including refractory cytopenia, RAEB, juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia and AML.

Although sphingosine kinase (SPHK) signalling is known to play important roles in the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis, the role of SPHK activation in IL-6 signalling and in the pathology of MM remains unclear. This study found that IL-6 activated SPHK in MM cells, which mediates the suppressive effects of IL-6 on MM cell apoptosis. Both MM cell lines and primary MM cells constitutively expressed SPHK, and treatment of MM cells with IL-6 resulted in activation of SPHK in a concentration-dependent manner. Specific inhibitors of the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways blocked the IL-6-induced activation of SPHK. It was further demonstrated that IL-6-induced activation of SPHK inhibited dexamethasone-induced apoptosis of MM cells. IL-6 stimulation or retroviral-mediated overexpression of SPHK1 in MM cells resulted in increased intracellular SPHK activity and upregulation of myeloid cell leukaemia-1 (Mcl-1), leading to increased cell proliferation and survival. Conversely, inhibition of SPHK1 by small interfering RNA reduced IL-6-induced upregulation of Mcl-1 and blocked the suppressive effect of IL-6 on MM cell apoptosis. Taken together, these results delineate a key role for SPHK activation in IL-6-induced proliferation and survival of MM cells, and suggest that SPHK may be a potential new therapeutic target in MM.","['Li, Qing-Fang', 'Wu, Chu-Tse', 'Duan, Hai-Feng', 'Sun, Hui-Yan', 'Wang, Hua', 'Lu, Zhuo-Zhuang', 'Zhang, Qun-Wei', 'Liu, Hong-Jun', 'Wang, Li-Sheng']","['Li QF', 'Wu CT', 'Duan HF', 'Sun HY', 'Wang H', 'Lu ZZ', 'Zhang QW', 'Liu HJ', 'Wang LS']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))', 'EC 2.7.1.- (sphingosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', '*Enzyme Activation', 'Glucocorticoids/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/physiology', 'Multiple Myeloma/*enzymology/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/physiology', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/*metabolism/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2007/08/10 09:00,2007/11/09 09:00,['2007/08/10 09:00'],"['2007/08/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/09 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/10 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2007 Sep;138(5):632-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2007.06711.x.,"['BJH6711 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2007.06711.x [doi]']",,"['Department of Experimental Haematology, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, Beijing, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we investigated hypermethylation of the DKK1 promoter in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), especially core-binding factor (CBF) leukaemia. The methylation status of DKK1 was analysed using methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction in 47 patients with AML.

In contrast, Wnt inhibitory factor-1 methylation was found in APL (4 of 6 patients) but not in CBF leukaemia (0 of 12 patients) (P = 0.001). Multivariate analyses suggested that DKK1 methylation was a risk factor for poorer overall survival. Sequential analysis using four paired samples obtained at diagnosis and relapse suggested that DKK1 methylation was involved in the progression of leukaemia.

Azacitidine is a ribonucleoside and decitabine is a deoxyribonucleoside; therefore, we hypothesized that inhibition of RR by HC would be antagonistic to azacitidine and synergistic to decitabine. HL-60 and T24 cancer cell lines were treated with azacitidine or decitabine in combination with HC and DNA methylation of LRE1, MAGEA1 and CDKN2A was quantitatively measured by bisulphite-polymerase chain reaction pyrosequencing. Surprisingly, we found that HC blocked the ability of both azacitidine and decitabine to inhibit DNA methylation and this antagonistic effect was attributable to the arrest of the cell cycle induced by HC. However, this antagonism could be avoided with sequential treatment of HC followed by azacitidine or decitabine.

A limited set of genes was consistently affected by FLT3 inhibition. In confirmation of their FLT3 dependence, these genes returned toward pretreatment levels of expression after reversal of FLT3 inhibition. Several of the most significantly affected genes are involved in the RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase, Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription and phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathways. These data suggest that constitutively activated FLT3 works through multiple signal transduction pathways. PIM1, MYC and CCND3 were chosen from this gene set to explore their biological roles.

METHODS: Using a sequential longitudinal design, 476 patients were randomized to be tested at all 3 time points, at 6 and 12 months posttransplantation, or at only 12 months posttransplantation. Participants completed a comprehensive battery of neuropsychologic tests that indexed memory, psychomotor speed, attention, and executive functioning, and provided a total neuropsychologic performance score (TNP). RESULTS: The results indicate that performance on cognitive abilities, except for attention, significantly improved across the 1-year follow-up period after HSCT. Performance on the TNP and all cognitive domains was superior or equal to population normative values by the 12-month measurement point. The results also indicate that repeated exposure to tests led to better performance on motor speed and the TNP and that attrition influenced the TNP, such that those who remained in the longitudinal sample exhibited greater longitudinal improvement in scores as compared with patients who left the sample. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the current study suggest that although patients undergoing HSCT experience cognitive deficits during the period just before transplantation, cognitive functioning returns to normative values within a year after transplantation.","['Jacobs, Sheri R', 'Small, Brent J', 'Booth-Jones, Margaret', 'Jacobsen, Paul B', 'Fields, Karen K']","['Jacobs SR', 'Small BJ', 'Booth-Jones M', 'Jacobsen PB', 'Fields KK']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Attention', 'Breast Neoplasms/surgery', '*Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders/epidemiology/etiology', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Hodgkin Disease/surgery', 'Humans', 'Learning', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/surgery', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/surgery', 'Male', 'Memory', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/surgery', 'Neoplasms/*surgery', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Psychomotor Performance', 'Time Factors']",2007/08/10 09:00,2007/10/25 09:00,['2007/08/10 09:00'],"['2007/08/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/25 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/10 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 2007 Oct 1;110(7):1560-7. doi: 10.1002/cncr.22962.,['10.1002/cncr.22962 [doi]'],,"['Health Outcomes and Behavior Program, H.

In order to determine the diagnostic use of different markers of parvovirus B19 infection, serum specimens obtained from 79 patients with haematological disorders were tested for specific antibodies and viral DNA through the use of ELISA and PCR techniques. Evidence of parvovirus B19 infection was found in 23/79 (29.1%) patients by demonstrating viral DNA and/or specific IgM antibody. B19 infection was established in 3 of 11 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia, in 3 of 11 acute myeloid leukemia, in 2 of 11 patients with multiple myeloma, in 3 of 8 patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma, in 5 of 10 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, in 1 of 6 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, in 4 of 11 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and in 2 of 11 patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia. In 4 of 23 positive patients, only parvovirus B19 DNA could be detected, while 7 patients were tested positive for both parvovirus B19 DNA and specific IgM. Nine patients were tested positive for both B19 DNA and specific IgG. In the remaining 3 positive patients only specific IgM could be detected. Due to the discrepancies between DNA and IgM results, the diagnostic procedures should include a search for specific DNA by PCR methods if specific IgM has been found to be negative.","['Us, Tercan', 'Ozune, Leyla', 'Kasifoglu, Nilgun', 'Akgun, Yurdanur']","['Us T', 'Ozune L', 'Kasifoglu N', 'Akgun Y']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Brazil,Braz J Infect Dis,The Brazilian journal of infectious diseases : an official publication of the Brazilian Society of Infectious Diseases,9812937,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Chronic Disease', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Hematologic Diseases/*virology', 'Hodgkin Disease/virology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/blood', 'Immunoglobulin M/blood', 'Leukemia/virology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Parvoviridae Infections/diagnosis/*virology', '*Parvovirus B19, Human/genetics/immunology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prospective Studies']",2007/08/09 09:00,2008/02/06 09:00,['2007/08/09 09:00'],"['2007/03/14 00:00 [received]', '2007/08/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/09 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Braz J Infect Dis. 2007 Jun;11(3):327-30. doi: 10.1590/s1413-86702007000300006.,"['S1413-86702007000300006 [pii]', '10.1590/s1413-86702007000300006 [doi]']",,"['Department of Microbiology and Clinical Microbiology, School of Medicine, Eskisehir Osmangazi University, Eskisehir, Turkey. tercanus@ogu.edu.tr']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The diabetes developed 120 days after the drug was started, requiring insulin therapy for 12 months. Anti-islet autoantibody was negative, and there were no laboratory findings suggestive of pancreatitis. The DM related do L-asparaginase therapy is insulinopenic and transient, resolving with suspension of the drug. The diagnosis of this type of diabetes is based on its temporal relationship with the L-asparaginase and in the exclusion of other known causes.

The results demonstrated that Runx1 and HIF-1alpha proteins directly interacted with each other to a degree, in which Runt homology domain of Runx1 was mainly involved. Leukemia-related abnormal Runx1 fusion protein AML1-ETO, which fuses the N-terminal 177 amino acid residues of the Runx1 protein in frame to ETO (eight-twenty-one) protein, also interacted with HIF-1alpha protein with greater ability than Runx1 itself. More intriguingly, Runx1 overexpression inhibited DNA-binding and transcriptional activity of HIF-1 protein with reduced expression of HIF-1-targeted genes such as vascular endothelial growth factor, while silence of Runx1 expression by specific small interfering RNA significantly increased transcriptional activity of HIF-1 protein, suggesting that Runx1 inhibited transcription-dependent function of HIF-1.

As a proof of concept, we analysed blood samples from three patients undergoing therapy with ABL kinase inhibitors and found that the patients' response to therapy correlated with our molecular monitoring. We were also able to detect mutations emerging in patients long before clinical relapse. Therefore, the polony assay could be applied to a larger patient sample to assess the utility of early mutation detection in patient-specific treatment decisions.

We determined the epidemiological patterns of malignancies in Bahrain and compared them with those of other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries and other developed countries. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Data for the study were obtained from the Bahrain Cancer Registry (BCR) database. The overall and type-specific 5-year average incidence rates were calculated for the years 1998-2002 and derived using the CANREG software formula. The incidence rates for the year 2000 were used for comparing Bahrain with those of other countries in the Arabian Gulf using the statistics of the Gulf Centre for Cancer Registration. RESULTS: During the 5-year period there were 2405 cancer cases in Bahrain (1239 males and 1166 females), with an annual average of 481 cases. The world age-standardized incidence rates (ASR) were 162.3 and 145.2 per 100,000 for Bahraini males and females, respectively. Generally, Bahraini men had a higher ASR for most cancer types, and the most common type of cancer was lung for males (35.2 per 100,000), followed by bladder (14.5) and prostate (14.3), and breast for females (46.8), followed by lung (12.2) and ovary (7.7). CONCLUSION: Compared to other Gulf countries, Bahrain had higher incidence rates for cancers of the lung, prostate, colorectum, bladder, kidney, pancreas and leukemia among males and for cancers of the breast, lung, bladder, thyroid, uterus and ovary among females. A rising trend in cancer incidence is likely to continue for years or even decades to come.","['Alsayyad, Jamal', 'Hamadeh, Radah']","['Alsayyad J', 'Hamadeh R']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Saudi Arabia,Ann Saudi Med,Annals of Saudi medicine,8507355,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bahrain/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology']",2007/08/09 09:00,2007/11/01 09:00,['2007/08/09 09:00'],"['2007/08/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/01 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/09 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Saudi Med. 2007 Jul-Aug;27(4):251-8. doi: 10.5144/0256-4947.2007.251.,"['06-332 [pii]', '10.5144/0256-4947.2007.251 [doi]']",,"['Medical Review Office, Ministry of Health, Manama, Bahrain.

The present study addresses the cell-cycling status of CLL cells, focusing on those leukemic cells expressing CD38, a molecule involved in signaling and activation that also serves as a prognostic marker in this disease. CD38(+) and CD38(-) members of individual CLL clones were analyzed for coexpression of molecules associated with cellular activation (CD27, CD62L, and CD69), cell-cycle entry (Ki-67), signaling (ZAP-70), and protection from apoptosis (telomerase and Bcl-2). Regardless of the size of the CD38(+) fraction within a CLL clone, CD38(+) subclones are markedly enriched for expression of Ki-67, ZAP-70, human telomerase reverse transcriptase, and telomerase activity. Although the percentage of cells (approximately 2%) entering the cell cycle as defined by Ki-67 expression is small, the absolute number within a clone can be sizeable and is contained primarily within the CD38(+) fraction. Despite these activation/proliferation differences, both CD38(+) and CD38(-) fractions have similar telomere lengths, suggesting that CD38 expression is dynamic and transient. These findings may help explain why high percentages of CD38(+) cells within clones are associated with poor clinical outcome.","['Damle, Rajendra N', 'Temburni, Sonal', 'Calissano, Carlo', 'Yancopoulos, Sophia', 'Banapour, Taraneh', 'Sison, Cristina', 'Allen, Steven L', 'Rai, Kanti R', 'Chiorazzi, Nicholas']","['Damle RN', 'Temburni S', 'Calissano C', 'Yancopoulos S', 'Banapour T', 'Sison C', 'Allen SL', 'Rai KR', 'Chiorazzi N']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Ki-67 Antigen)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/*metabolism', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, Surface/metabolism', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/*metabolism/*pathology', 'CD5 Antigens/metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Ki-67 Antigen/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Telomerase/metabolism', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/metabolism']",2007/08/09 09:00,2007/12/14 09:00,['2007/08/09 09:00'],"['2007/08/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/09 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Nov 1;110(9):3352-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-04-083832.

We have analyzed the kinases targeted by dasatinib by using an unbiased chemical proteomics approach to detect binding proteins directly from lysates of CML cells. Besides Abl and Src kinases, we have identified the Tec kinases Btk and Tec, but not Itk, as major binders of dasatinib. The kinase activity of Btk and Tec, but not of Itk, was inhibited by nanomolar concentrations of dasatinib in vitro and in cultured cells. We identified the gatekeeper residue as the critical determinant of dasatinib susceptibility. Mutation of Thr-474 in Btk to Ile and Thr-442 in Tec to Ile conferred resistance to dasatinib, whereas mutation of the corresponding residue in Itk (Phe-435) to Thr sensitized the otherwise insensitive Itk to dasatinib. The configuration of this residue may be a predictor for dasatinib sensitivity across the kinome. Analysis of mast cells derived from Btk-deficient mice suggested that inhibition of Btk by dasatinib may be responsible for the observed reduction in histamine release upon dasatinib treatment. Furthermore, dasatinib inhibited histamine release in primary human basophils and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines in immune cells. The observed inhibition of Tec kinases by dasatinib predicts immunosuppressive (side) effects of this drug and may offer therapeutic opportunities for inflammatory and immunological disorders.","['Hantschel, Oliver', 'Rix, Uwe', 'Schmidt, Uwe', 'Burckstummer, Tilmann', 'Kneidinger, Michael', 'Schutze, Gregor', 'Colinge, Jacques', 'Bennett, Keiryn L', 'Ellmeier, Wilfried', 'Valent, Peter', 'Superti-Furga, Giulio']","['Hantschel O', 'Rix U', 'Schmidt U', 'Burckstummer T', 'Kneidinger M', 'Schutze G', 'Colinge J', 'Bennett KL', 'Ellmeier W', 'Valent P', 'Superti-Furga G']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basophils/drug effects/metabolism', 'Dasatinib', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Histamine Release/drug effects', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Thiazoles/*pharmacology', 'U937 Cells']",2007/08/09 09:00,2007/10/25 09:00,['2007/08/09 09:00'],"['2007/08/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/25 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/09 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2007 Aug 14;104(33):13283-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0702654104.

Blocking BCR-ABL by the ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (IM, Gleevec) is clinically highly efficient. Treatment response is unfortunately compromised by the emergence of IM resistance, which is regularly seen in accelerated and blastic phase of CML (CML-AP/BP) and in Ph+ ALL. BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations are then considered the causative mechanism of IM resistance, because 50-60% of the IM resistant patients harbour such mutations. In contrast, IM resistance arises very rarely in patients that are treated with IM in early chronic phase of CML. This implies that BCR-ABL independent factors such as the cellular context of BCR-ABL expression and stage of disease decisively control the evolution of IM resistance. In line with this, novel Abl-kinase inhibitors such as dasatinib (DA) or nilotinib (NI) - although capable of inhibiting most of the BCR/-BL kinase mutants - still often fail to overcome resistance and do mostly not induce durable cytogenetic responses in IM resistant CML-AP/BC and Ph+ ALL patients. On the basis of available evidence it is proposed here that alternative genetic aberrations, which synergize with BCR-ABL to enable leukemic self-renewal are of causal importance for the evolution of clinical kinase inhibitor resistance. Kinase mutations may in turn reflect clonal variants of cells that emerge on the basis of an already existing IM resistant and self-renewing leukemic cell population. This model has clinical implications as it implies that even highly potent Abl-kinase inhibition can not target the genetic basis of IM resistance and will also not resolve the problem of Abl-kinase inhibitor resistance.","['Burchert, Andreas']",['Burchert A'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Scotland,Drug Resist Updat,Drug resistance updates : reviews and commentaries in antimicrobial and anticancer chemotherapy,9815369,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Models, Biological', 'Mutation', 'Piperazines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",2007/08/09 09:00,2008/01/04 09:00,['2007/08/09 09:00'],"['2007/05/21 00:00 [received]', '2007/06/11 00:00 [revised]', '2007/06/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/08/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/04 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/09 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Drug Resist Updat. 2007 Aug-Oct;10(4-5):152-61. doi: 10.1016/j.drup.2007.06.001.

In people who do not have BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutations, the encoded proteins prevent breast/ovarian cancer. However BRCA1 and BRCA2 proteins have multiple functions including participating in a pathway that mediates repair of DNA double strand breaks by error-free methods. Inactivation of BRCA1, BRCA2 or any other critical protein within this ""BRCA pathway"" due to a gene mutation should inactivate this error-free repair process. DNA fragments produced by double strand breaks are then left to non-specific processes that rejoin them without regard for preserving normal gene regulation or function, so rearrangements of DNA segments are more likely. These kinds of rearrangements are typically associated with some lymphomas and leukemias. METHODS: Literature searches produced about 2500 epidemiology and basic science articles related to the BRCA pathway. These articles were reviewed and copied to a database to facilitate access. Meta-analyses of statistical information compared risks for hematologic cancers vs. mutations for the components in a model pathway containing BRCA1/2 gene products. RESULTS: Deleterious mutations of genes encoding proteins virtually anywhere within the BRCA pathway increased risks up to nearly 2000 fold for certain leukemias and lymphomas. Cancers with large increases in risk included mantle cell lymphoma, acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and prolymphocytic leukemia. Mantle cell lymphoma is defined by a characteristic rearrangement of DNA fragments interchanged between chromosomes 11 and 14. DNA translocations or rearrangements also occur in significant percentages of the other cancers. CONCLUSION: An important function of the BRCA pathway is to prevent a subgroup of human leukemias and lymphomas that may involve non-random, characteristic gene rearrangements. Here, the genetic defect in BRCA pathway deficiencies is a chromosomal misrepair syndrome that may facilitate this subgroup of somatic cancers. Inactivation of a single gene within the pathway can increase risks for multiple cancers and inactivation of a different gene in the same pathway may have similar effects. The results presented here may have clinical implications for surveillance and therapy.","['Friedenson, Bernard']",['Friedenson B'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review']",England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (BRCA1 Protein)', '0 (BRCA2 Protein)']",IM,"['Adult', 'BRCA1 Protein/*metabolism', 'BRCA2 Protein/*metabolism', 'Breast Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/prevention & control', 'Child', 'Fanconi Anemia/genetics', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Lymphoma/genetics', 'Male', '*Mutation', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/prevention & control', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2007/08/09 09:00,2007/11/02 09:00,['2007/08/09 09:00'],"['2006/11/17 00:00 [received]', '2007/08/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/08/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/02 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/09 09:00 [entrez]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2007 Aug 6;7:152. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-7-152.,"['1471-2407-7-152 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-7-152 [doi]']",,"['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, College of Medicine, University of Illinois Chicago, Chicago, IL 60607, USA. molmeddoc@yahoo.com']",,77,,,,20070806,PMC1959234,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Much cancer research involves refining the somatic mutation theory with an ever increasing catalog of genetic changes. The problem is that such research may miss paradoxical aspects of carcinogenesis for which there is no likely explanation under the somatic mutation theory. These paradoxical aspects offer opportunities for new research directions that should not be ignored. DISCUSSION: Various paradoxes related to the somatic mutation theory of carcinogenesis are discussed: (1) the presence of large numbers of spatially distinct precancerous lesions at the onset of promotion, (2) the large number of genetic instabilities found in hyperplastic polyps not considered cancer, (3) spontaneous regression, (4) higher incidence of cancer in patients with xeroderma pigmentosa but not in patients with other comparable defects in DNA repair, (5) lower incidence of many cancers except leukemia and testicular cancer in patients with Down's syndrome, (6) cancer developing after normal tissue is transplanted to other parts of the body or next to stroma previously exposed to carcinogens, (7) the lack of tumors when epithelial cells exposed to a carcinogen were transplanted next to normal stroma, (8) the development of cancers when Millipore filters of various pore sizes were was inserted under the skin of rats, but only if the holes were sufficiently small. For the latter paradox, a microarray experiment is proposed to try to better understand the phenomena. SUMMARY: The famous physicist Niels Bohr said ""How wonderful that we have met with a paradox. Now we have some hope of making progress."" The same viewpoint should apply to cancer research. It is easy to ignore this piece of wisdom about the means to advance knowledge, but we do so at our peril.","['Baker, Stuart G', 'Kramer, Barnett S']","['Baker SG', 'Kramer BS']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinogens/pharmacology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Regression, Spontaneous', 'Neoplasms/*etiology/genetics/pathology', 'Rats', 'Research/*trends']",2007/08/09 09:00,2007/10/17 09:00,['2007/08/09 09:00'],"['2007/05/01 00:00 [received]', '2007/08/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/08/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/17 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/09 09:00 [entrez]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2007 Aug 6;7:151. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-7-151.,"['1471-2407-7-151 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-7-151 [doi]']",,"['Division of Cancer Prevention, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA. sb16i@nih.gov']",,,,,,20070806,PMC1993836,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, we propose a novel Bayesian model and learning algorithm, GenMiR++ (Generative model for miRNA regulation), that accounts for patterns of gene expression using miRNA expression data and a set of candidate miRNA targets. A set of high-confidence functional miRNA targets are then obtained from the data using a Bayesian learning algorithm. Our model scores 467 high-confidence miRNA targets out of 1,770 targets obtained from TargetScanS in mouse at a false detection rate of 2.5%: several confirmed miRNA targets appear in our high-confidence set, such as the interactions between miR-92 and the signal transduction gene MAP2K4, as well as the relationship between miR-16 and BCL2, an anti-apoptotic gene which has been implicated in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. We present results on the robustness of our model showing that our learning algorithm is not sensitive to various perturbations of the data.

These patients were divided into 2 groups: 1 group of 28 cases diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia, the majority treated with cytarabine (Ara-C) infusion for 7 days and daunorubicin intravenously daily for 3 days (7+3 regimen), and the other control group of 23 cases treated with chemotherapy or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation for a variety of hematologic malignancies. All biopsies during the recovery period were obtained before consolidation regimen. We used morphometry to calculate the cellularity and myeloid to erythroid ratio and quantified megakaryocytes CD10 versus time from day 14 onward. The absolute neutrophil and platelet counts for 28 cases were related to histologic recovery. RESULTS: From day 14, we noted a differential slope of recovery of these patients with no difference in male and female patients, P = .45, but a difference between younger and older patients (>58.5 years), P = .03. After regenerative hyperplasia, the cellularity plateaus, the myeloid to erythroid ratio, and the megakaryocytes even out with platelet normalization, and the early CD10+ B cells rise from day 40 onward, P = .01. The patterns of recovery after day 60 of postchemotherapy and posttransplantation patients are similar. Complete histologic and peripheral blood recovery is noted at day 38 and thereafter. CONCLUSIONS: By linear equation using at least 2 trephine biopsy specimens, the projected rate of cellular recovery may be determined, and 5 histologic features are associated with complete histologic recovery.","['Khalil, Farah', 'Cualing, Hernani', 'Cogburn, Julia', 'Miles, Lili']","['Khalil F', 'Cualing H', 'Cogburn J', 'Miles L']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Arch Pathol Lab Med,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,7607091,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Bone Marrow/*physiology', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recovery of Function', 'Remission Induction', 'Time Factors']",2007/08/09 09:00,2007/08/28 09:00,['2007/08/09 09:00'],"['2007/02/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/08/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/09 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2007 Aug;131(8):1281-9. doi: 10.5858/2007-131-1281-TCFBMR.,"['2006-0440-OAR1 [pii]', '10.5858/2007-131-1281-TCFBMR [doi]']",,"['Department of Pathology, H.

Here, we characterize the morphological and biochemical features of this type of death and show that it displays the hallmarks of type III PCD. A molecular and biochemical approach has led us to identify a key mediator of this type of death, dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1). CD47 ligation induces Drp1 translocation from cytosol to mitochondria, a process controlled by chymotrypsin-like serine proteases. Once in mitochondria, Drp1 provokes an impairment of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, which results in dissipation of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, reactive oxygen species generation, and a drop in ATP levels. Surprisingly, neither the activation of the most representative proapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, such as Bax or Bak, nor the release of apoptogenic proteins AIF (apoptosis-inducing factor), cytochrome c, endonuclease G (EndoG), Omi/HtrA2, or Smac/DIABLO from mitochondria to cytosol is observed. Responsiveness of cells to CD47 ligation increases following Drp1 overexpression, while Drp1 downregulation confers resistance to CD47-mediated death. Importantly, in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells, mRNA levels of Drp1 strongly correlate with death sensitivity. Thus, this previously unknown mechanism controlling caspase-independent type III PCD may provide the basis for novel therapeutic approaches to overcome apoptotic avoidance in malignant cells.","['Bras, Marlene', 'Yuste, Victor J', 'Roue, Gael', 'Barbier, Sandrine', 'Sancho, Patricia', 'Virely, Clemence', 'Rubio, Manuel', 'Baudet, Sylvie', 'Esquerda, Josep E', 'Merle-Beral, Helene', 'Sarfati, Marika', 'Susin, Santos A']","['Bras M', 'Yuste VJ', 'Roue G', 'Barbier S', 'Sancho P', 'Virely C', 'Rubio M', 'Baudet S', 'Esquerda JE', 'Merle-Beral H', 'Sarfati M', 'Susin SA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (CD47 Antigen)', '0 (CD47 protein, human)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP Phosphohydrolases)', 'EC 3.6.5.5 (DNM1L protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.5 (Dynamins)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus/physiology', 'CD47 Antigen/genetics/metabolism', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Death/*physiology', 'Cell Shape', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dynamins', 'Electron Transport/physiology', 'GTP Phosphohydrolases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mitochondria/metabolism/pathology', 'Mitochondrial Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Serine Endopeptidases/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/physiology']",2007/08/08 09:00,2008/02/19 09:00,['2007/08/08 09:00'],"['2007/08/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/08 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2007 Oct;27(20):7073-88. doi: 10.1128/MCB.02116-06.

Recently published neuroimaging data suggest a common pathophysiology associated with a variety of chemotherapy agents and modes of administration. METHODS: We reviewed the medical literature for single reports and case series of patients presenting with stroke-like episodes while receiving systemic or intrathecal chemotherapy. We only included studies providing detailed neuroimaging data. Patients with cerebrovascular accidents were excluded. RESULTS: We identified 27 reports of toxic leukoencephalopathy in patients treated with methotrexate (intrathecal, systemic), 5-fluorouracil and its derivative carmofur, and capecitabine. Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) of all patients revealed well demarcated hyperintense lesions within the subcortical white matter of the cerebral hemispheres and the corpus callosum, corresponding to areas of decreased proton diffusion on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps (available in 21/27 patients). Lesions exceeded the confines of adjacent vascular territories. Complete resolution of symptoms within 1-4 days was accompanied by normalisation of ADC abnormalities. However, fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences frequently revealed persistent white matter abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: Several pathophysiological models of delayed leukoencephalopathy after exposure to intrathecal or systemic chemotherapy have been proposed. DWI findings in this cohort are indicative of cytotoxic oedema within cerebral white matter and lend support to an at least partially reversible metabolic derangement as the basis for this syndrome.","['Baehring, J M', 'Fulbright, R K']","['Baehring JM', 'Fulbright RK']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,"Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",2985191R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '1548R74NSZ (Tegafur)', '6804DJ8Z9U (Capecitabine)', 'HA82M3RAB2 (carmofur)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'Brain/*drug effects/pathology', 'Brain Edema/chemically induced/diagnosis', 'Capecitabine', 'Dementia, Vascular/*chemically induced/*diagnosis', 'Deoxycytidine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Energy Metabolism/drug effects', 'Female', 'Fluorouracil/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Nerve Fibers, Myelinated/drug effects/pathology', 'Neurologic Examination/drug effects', 'Registries', 'Remission, Spontaneous', 'Stroke/*chemically induced/diagnosis', 'Tegafur/therapeutic use/*toxicity']",2007/08/08 09:00,2008/04/30 09:00,['2007/08/08 09:00'],"['2007/08/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/30 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/08 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry. 2008 May;79(5):535-9. doi: 10.1136/jnnp.2007.123737.

Although various Bayesian designs for Phase I clinical trials have been proposed in the literature, the traditional 3+3 design is still widely used because of its algorithm-based simplicity in logistics for the clinical investigators to carry out in comparison with model-based Bayesian methods. In this paper, we propose an optimization algorithm for designing phase I cancer clinical trials. This algorithm does not need assumptions on the true dose-response relationship but can readily incorporate available prior information about the true response probabilities. It searches for an approximately optimal design within a design space, in which the 3+3 design is included as a special case. Simulation studies show that the design recommended by this algorithm significantly outperforms the 3+3 design.","['Jiang, Hui', 'Liu, Yifan', 'Su, Zheng']","['Jiang H', 'Liu Y', 'Su Z']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Contemp Clin Trials,Contemporary clinical trials,101242342,,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Bayes Theorem', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials, Phase I as Topic/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', '*Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Research Design']",2007/08/08 09:00,2008/05/31 09:00,['2007/08/08 09:00'],"['2007/02/09 00:00 [received]', '2007/06/07 00:00 [revised]', '2007/06/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/08/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/31 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/08 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Contemp Clin Trials. 2008 Mar;29(2):102-8. doi: 10.1016/j.cct.2007.06.003.

We tried to expand inhibitory natural killer cell receptor CD94-expressing CD8 T cells with cytolytic activity and CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells from the same cord cell unit. METHODS: Cytotoxic CD94-expressing CD8 T cells were expanded from CD4-depleted cord blood using an immobilized anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody and a cytokine and also CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells were expanded from a CD4-enriched fraction derived from the same cord blood unit using anti-CD3/CD28 monoclonal antibody-coated Dynabeads and cytokines. RESULTS: We were able to obtain a more than 1000-fold expansion of CD94-expressing CD8 T cells and a more than 50-fold expansion of CD4(+)CD25(+) cells from the same cord blood unit. These expanded CD4(+)CD25(+) cells expressed FoxP3 mRNA at a level about 100-fold higher than that in isolated CD25(-) cells and could suppress allogeneic mixed lymphocyte culture by >80% (effector cells: CD4(+)CD25(+) cells = 2:1). Cytolytic activities of purified CD94-expressing cells detected by a 4-hour (51)Cr release assay against K562 were >60%. Coculture of CD94-expressing cells with expanded CD4(+)CD25(+) cells did not have any effect on cytolytic activities of purified CD94-expressing cells against K562 cells. CONCLUSION: These expanded cytolytic CD94-expressing CD8 cells might be able to induce a graft-vs-leukemia effect without enhancing graft-vs-host disease, and CD4(+)CD25(+) cells might be able to suppress allogeneic responses, including graft-vs-host disease and graft rejection after cord blood transplantation.","['Tanaka, Junji', 'Sugita, Junichi', 'Kato, Naoko', 'Toubai, Tomomi', 'Ibata, Makoto', 'Shono, Yusuke', 'Ota, Shuichi', 'Kondo, Takeshi', 'Kobayashi, Takahiko', 'Kobayashi, Masanobu', 'Asaka, Masahiro', 'Imamura, Masahiro']","['Tanaka J', 'Sugita J', 'Kato N', 'Toubai T', 'Ibata M', 'Shono Y', 'Ota S', 'Kondo T', 'Kobayashi T', 'Kobayashi M', 'Asaka M', 'Imamura M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (KLRC1 protein, human)', '0 (KLRD1 protein, human)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily C)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily D)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Natural Killer Cell)']",IM,"['CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*cytology/immunology/*metabolism', '*Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Fetal Blood/*cytology/immunology/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/immunology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology/prevention & control', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/immunology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily C', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily D/*biosynthesis/immunology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*biosynthesis/immunology', 'Receptors, Natural Killer Cell', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*cytology/immunology/*metabolism', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2007/08/08 09:00,2007/11/08 09:00,['2007/08/08 09:00'],"['2007/05/30 00:00 [received]', '2007/06/04 00:00 [revised]', '2007/06/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/08/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/08 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/08 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2007 Oct;35(10):1562-6. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2007.06.006.

DESIGN: Comparison of integrin beta3 and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) expression in endometrial biopsies from moderate responders and high responders with temporally matched natural cycles. SETTING: Clinical and experimental research. PATIENT(S): Patients with cancelled embryo transfer were evaluated. Moderate responders were defined as E2 5,000-15,000 pmol/L on the day of hCG administration (group B, n = 7). High responders were defined as E2 >15,000 pmol/L on the day of hCG administration (group C, n = 8). Healthy and fertile volunteers were used as natural controls (group A, n = 10). INTERVENTION(S): Endometrial biopsy on the day of LH+7/hCG+7. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Immunohistochemistry of integrin beta3 and LIF and imaging analysis. RESULT(S): Endometrial integrin beta3 and LIF expressions in the peri-implantation phase were significantly lower in stimulated cycles (including both moderate and high responders) compared to natural controls. Expression of LIF in glandular epithelium in high responders was lower than that in moderate responders. CONCLUSION(S): These data demonstrated that suggested markers of endometrial receptivity were reduced in stimulated cycles compared with natural cycles, and more so in high response cycles compared with moderate response cycles.","['Chen, Qiu-Ju', 'Sun, Xiao-Xi', 'Li, Lu', 'Gao, Xiao-Hong', 'Gemzell-Danielsson, Kristina', 'Cheng, Li-Nan']","['Chen QJ', 'Sun XX', 'Li L', 'Gao XH', 'Gemzell-Danielsson K', 'Cheng LN']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Fertil Steril,Fertility and sterility,0372772,"['0 (Integrin beta3)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Embryo Implantation/*physiology', 'Endometrium/cytology/*metabolism', 'Epithelium/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Integrin beta3/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*metabolism', 'Male', '*Ovulation Induction', 'Pregnancy', 'Stromal Cells/metabolism']",2007/08/08 09:00,2008/07/17 09:00,['2007/08/08 09:00'],"['2006/10/15 00:00 [received]', '2007/03/15 00:00 [revised]', '2007/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/08/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/17 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/08 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Fertil Steril. 2008 May;89(5 Suppl):1357-63. doi: 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2007.03.073.

To clarify the relationship between Mcl-1 and Bim, we generated cell lines silenced for Mcl-1 (shMcl-1) or Bim (shBim). We demonstrate that Mcl-1 and Bim proteins are concomitantly down-regulated in either shBim or shMcl-1 cells. We show that the down-regulation of either Mcl-1 in shBim or Bim in shMcl-1 cells is not due to a transcriptional event, but results from post-translational regulation. Indeed, the multi-ubiquitinated forms of Mcl-1 or Bim are increased in shBim and shMcl-1 cells, respectively, indicating proteasome degradation. Since Mcl-1/Bim complexes are predominant in myeloma cells the down-regulation of Mcl-1 by shRNA leads to unliganded Bim sensitive to degradation and reciprocally for unliganded Mcl-1 in shBim cells. Finally, our results support that the interaction between Mcl-1 and Bim confers to themselves mutual protection.","['Wuilleme-Toumi, Soraya', 'Trichet, Valerie', 'Gomez-Bougie, Patricia', 'Gratas, Catherine', 'Bataille, Regis', 'Amiot, Martine']","['Wuilleme-Toumi S', 'Trichet V', 'Gomez-Bougie P', 'Gratas C', 'Bataille R', 'Amiot M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Kidney/cytology', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Multiple Myeloma/*enzymology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/*metabolism', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Ubiquitin/*metabolism']",2007/08/08 09:00,2007/10/20 09:00,['2007/08/08 09:00'],"['2007/07/09 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/08/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/20 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/08 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2007 Oct 5;361(4):865-9. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.07.070.

We analyzed the effect of MK-4 on the proliferation of fibroblast-like synoviocytes using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. The pro-apoptotic effect of MK-4 upon fibroblast-like synoviocytes was investigated with annexin V staining and DNA fragmentation and caspase 3/7 assays. Moreover, we analyzed the effect of MK-4 on the development of collagen-induced arthritis in female dark agouti rats. Our results indicated that MK-4 inhibited the proliferation of fibroblast-like synoviocytes and the development of collagen-induced arthritis in a dose-dependent manner.

In this work, we have investigated the mechanism of internalization of cIBR peptide [cyclo(1,12)PenPRGGSVLVTGC] that is conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and doxorubicin (DOX) to give FITC-cIBR and DOX-cIBR conjugates, respectively. Internalization mechanisms of FITC-cIBR and DOX-cIBR were studied in LFA-1-expressing cells (HL-60) and LFA-1-deficient cells (HUVEC) under the following conditions: (a) at two different temperatures (4 and 37 degrees C), (b) in the presence of ATP-depleting agents (sodium azide and 2-deoxy- d-glucose), and (c) in the presence of a microtubule-disrupting agent (nocodazole). At 37 degrees C, FITC-cIBR was internalized by HL-60 cells and located in the endosomes; however, it was not internalized by LFA-1-deficient HUVEC. Incubation of FITC-cIBR at 4 degrees C or in the presence of nocodazole inhibited its endocytosis in HL-60 cells. The ATP inhibitors inhibited the internalization of FITC-cIBR but maintained its binding to cell surface receptors. In contrast, DOX-cIBR was diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm of LFA-1-expressing HL-60 cells following incubation at 37 degrees C. No inhibitory processes could block the entry or change the distribution pattern of DOX-cIBR into HL-60 cells, suggesting that DOX-cIBR uptake was not mediated by receptors such as LFA-1. DOX-cIBR was still found inside HUVEC, but with a distribution pattern somewhat different from that in HL-60 cells. The major entry mechanism of DOX-cIBR could be via passive diffusion because DOX-cIBR has an octanol/water distribution coefficient (Log D) of 1.15. Thus, DOX-cIBR is more lipophilic than FITC-cIBR with a Log D of 0.57. Therefore, the change in the hydrophobicity of the conjugate may alter the mechanism of entry of DOX-cIBR compared to that of FITC-cIBR. This study suggests that alteration of the physicochemical properties of drug-peptide conjugates can change the mode of uptake from receptor-mediated uptake to passive diffusion.","['Majumdar, Sumit', 'Kobayashi, Naoki', 'Krise, Jeffrey P', 'Siahaan, Teruna J']","['Majumdar S', 'Kobayashi N', 'Krise JP', 'Siahaan TJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Pharm,Molecular pharmaceutics,101197791,"['0 (Peptide Fragments)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'I223NX31W9 (Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate)']",IM,"['Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry, Physical', 'Doxorubicin/chemistry/toxicity', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Epithelial Cells/drug effects', 'Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/*chemistry/*toxicity', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Molecular Structure', 'Peptide Fragments/chemical synthesis/*chemistry/*toxicity']",2007/08/08 09:00,2007/12/13 09:00,['2007/08/08 09:00'],"['2007/08/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/08 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Pharm. 2007 Sep-Oct;4(5):749-58. doi: 10.1021/mp0700458.

Chromosomes were prepared using direct method and/or short-term (24 h) cultures of bone marrow cells. Karyotypic analysis was carried out by using R-banding technique. Thirteen cases were studied by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) by using a chromosome 4-specific alpha -satellite DNA probe labeled by spectrum Green to ascertain the presence of a clone with trisomy 4. Five cases with t (8; 21) revealed by karyotypic analysis were detected by dual-color FISH using t (8; 21) translocation probe to confirm the AML1/ETO rearrangement. RESULTS: All the patients with AL and trisomy 4 were with de novo AL except two cases with secondary AL. M2 was the most frequent Franch-American-British(FAB) subtype in this series (9/21 cases). The initial leukocyte count more than 10x 10(9)/L was seen in 16 cases. An enlargement of liver, spleen and/or lymph nodes in varying degrees was found in 15 cases.

Patients were classified as: poor metabolizers (PMs; 3.1%), intermediate metabolizers (IMs; 24.5%) and extensive metabolizers (EMs; 72.5%). Patients genotyped as PMs had significant higher hepato- and nephrotoxicities compared to IMs or EMs. Maximum bilirubin and serum creatinine levels measured after transplant were approximately twofold higher than those of EMs or IMs. The increased toxicity resulted in an increased 4-year estimate for transplant-related mortality (TRM) with 50+/-18.6% for PMs compared to 25.1+/-3.7% for EMs (P<0.018) and 22.7 +/-5.6% for IMs (P<0.042), whereas no significant influence for relapse rate, overall survival or incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease grade 2-4 were found between the groups.

Conditioning regimens were initially designed to provide dose-intense therapy in order to overcome tumor resistance. These forms of transplants, referred to as ablative regimens, often result in significant extramedullary toxicity, limiting its applicability to younger, fitter patients. Reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) transplants are a direct result of an understanding of the immunotherapeutic potential of the donated hematopoietic stem cells. These forms of transplants administer chemoradiotherapy with the intent of allowing for donor cell engraftment with less of an emphasis on dose intensity. In so doing, treatment-related mortality has been reduced, and older-aged patients and those with co-morbidities are now frequently offered this therapy. In the decade since its creation, RIC transplantation has changed the spectrum of patients with malignancies who may benefit from this therapy. For the first time, transplant patients are becoming more representative of the populations most at risk for diseases requiring this therapy.

Two such agents, 5-azacytidine and 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, are currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. Ongoing studies are evaluating alternative dosing schedules for these drugs and the activity and safety of this class of agent in combination with histone deacetylase inhibitors.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-five patients (median age, 70 years) were enrolled; 12 were untreated and 13 had relapsed AML. To determine an OBD (based on a gene re-expression end point), 14 patients received decitabine alone for 10 days. To determine the MTD, 11 patients received decitabine (at OBD, days 1 through 10) plus dose-escalating VA (days 5 through 21). RESULTS: The OBD of decitabine was 20 mg/m(2)/d intravenously, with limited nonhematologic toxicity. In patients treated with decitabine plus VA, dose-limiting encephalopathy occurred in two of two patients at VA 25 mg/kg/d and one of six patients at VA 20 mg/kg/d. Drug-induced re-expression of estrogen receptor (ER) was associated with clinical response (P < or = .05). ER promoter demethylation, global DNA hypomethylation, depletion of DNA methyltransferase enzyme, and histone hyperacetylation were also observed. In an intent-to-treat analysis, the response rate was 44% (11 of 25). Of 21 assessable patients, 11 (52%) responded: four with morphologic and cytogenetic complete remission (CR; each had complex karyotype), four with incomplete CR, and three with partial remission. In untreated AML, four of nine assessable patients achieved CR. Clinical responses appeared similar for decitabine alone or with VA. CONCLUSION: Low-dose decitabine was safe and showed encouraging clinical and biologic activity in AML, but the addition of VA led to encephalopathy at relatively low doses. On the basis of these results, additional studies of decitabine (20 mg/m(2)/d for 10 days) alone or with an alternative deacetylating agent are warranted.","['Blum, William', 'Klisovic, Rebecca B', 'Hackanson, Bjoern', 'Liu, Zhongfa', 'Liu, Shujun', 'Devine, Hollie', 'Vukosavljevic, Tamara', 'Huynh, Lenguyen', 'Lozanski, Gerard', 'Kefauver, Cheryl', 'Plass, Christoph', 'Devine, Steven M', 'Heerema, Nyla A', 'Murgo, Anthony', 'Chan, Kenneth K', 'Grever, Michael R', 'Byrd, John C', 'Marcucci, Guido']","['Blum W', 'Klisovic RB', 'Hackanson B', 'Liu Z', 'Liu S', 'Devine H', 'Vukosavljevic T', 'Huynh L', 'Lozanski G', 'Kefauver C', 'Plass C', 'Devine SM', 'Heerema NA', 'Murgo A', 'Chan KK', 'Grever MR', 'Byrd JC', 'Marcucci G']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['614OI1Z5WI (Valproic Acid)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Azacitidine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics', 'Brain Diseases/*chemically induced', 'Decitabine', 'Fatigue/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Infections/chemically induced', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Failure', 'Valproic Acid/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics']",2007/08/08 09:00,2007/09/12 09:00,['2007/08/08 09:00'],"['2007/08/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/08 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2007 Sep 1;25(25):3884-91. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2006.09.4169.

These transcription factors act as selectors of developmental programmes, to govern the morphogenesis of multiple structures and organs. However, despite the variety of morphogenetic processes Hox proteins are involved in, only a limited set of their target genes has been identified so far. To find additional targets, we used a strategy based upon the simultaneous overexpression of Hoxa2 and its cofactors Pbx1 and Prep in a cellular model. Among genes whose expression was upregulated, we identified LMO1, which codes for an intertwining LIM-only factor involved in protein-DNA oligomeric complexes. By analysing its expression in Hox knockout mice, we show that Lmo1 is differentially regulated by Hoxa2 and Hoxb2, in specific columns of hindbrain neuronal progenitors.

The objective of this study was to determine whether parental socio-economic status influences beliefs, attitude, and behavior of health-care providers (hcp) treating childhood leukemia in Indonesia. PROCEDURE: A self-administered semi-structured questionnaire was filled in by 102 hcp (69 doctors, 28 nurses, 2 psychologists, 2 hematology technicians, 1 administrator). RESULTS: Most hcp (98%) asked parents about their financial situation. The decision to start treatment was influenced by parental socio-economic status (86%), motivation of parents (80%), and motivation of doctors (76%). Health-care providers stated that prosperous patients comply better with treatment (64%), doctors comply better with treatment for the prosperous (53%), most patients cannot afford to complete treatment (58%), less extensive explanations are given toward poor families (60%), and communication is impeded by differences in status (67%). When dealing with prosperous families a minority of hcp stated that they pay more attention (27%), work with greater accuracy (24%), take more interest (23%), and devote more time per visit (22%). Most hcp denied differences in the quality of medical care (93%) and the chances of cure (58%) between poor and prosperous patients.

However, genistein is also a competitive inhibitor of fatty acid amide hydrolase, the enzyme responsible for anandamide hydrolysis. Here we have investigated whether inhibition of fatty acid amide hydrolase rather than inhibition of endocytosis is the primary determinant of genistein actions upon anandamide uptake. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Cellular uptake of anandamide, labelled in the arachidonoyl part of the molecule was assessed in four different cell lines using a standard method. Fatty acid amide hydrolase activity in homogenates and intact cells was measured using anandamide labelled in the ethanolamine part of the molecule. KEY RESULTS: The fatty acid amide hydrolase inhibitor URB597 inhibited anandamide uptake into RBL2H3 cells and R3327 AT-1 prostate cancer cells, but not into 3T3-L1 preadipocytes or PC-3 prostate cancer cells. An identical pattern was seen with genistein. The related compound daidzein inhibited anandamide hydrolysis in homogenates and intact cells, and reduced its uptake into RBL2H3 and R3327 AT-1, but not PC-3 cells. Anandamide hydrolysis by cell homogenates was in the order RBL2H3 > R3327 AT-1 > PC-3 approximately 3T3-L1. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The ability of genistein to inhibit anandamide uptake is mimicked by daidzein (which does not affect tyrosine kinase), and is only seen in cells that show sensitivity to URB597. This indicates that blockade of fatty acid amide hydrolase is the primary determinant of the effects of genistein on cellular anandamide uptake.","['Thors, L', 'Eriksson, J', 'Fowler, C J']","['Thors L', 'Eriksson J', 'Fowler CJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Pharmacol,British journal of pharmacology,7502536,"['0 (Arachidonic Acids)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Carbamates)', '0 (Endocannabinoids)', '0 (Isoflavones)', '0 (Polyunsaturated Alkamides)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', ""0 (cyclohexyl carbamic acid 3'-carbamoylbiphenyl-3-yl ester)"", '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '6287WC5J2L (daidzein)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)', 'EC 3.5.- (Amidohydrolases)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (fatty-acid amide hydrolase)', 'UR5G69TJKH (anandamide)']",IM,"['3T3-L1 Cells', 'Amidohydrolases/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Arachidonic Acids/*metabolism/pharmacokinetics', 'Benzamides/pharmacology', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Carbamates/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Endocannabinoids', 'Genistein/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Hydrolysis/drug effects', 'Isoflavones/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Molecular Structure', 'Polyunsaturated Alkamides/*metabolism/pharmacokinetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Tritium']",2007/08/07 09:00,2008/02/26 09:00,['2007/08/07 09:00'],"['2007/08/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/26 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/07 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Pharmacol. 2007 Nov;152(5):744-50. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjp.0707401.

Human T cell leukemia virus (HTLV-1)-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis is a slowly progressive neurodegenerative disease, in which evidence of BBB breakdown has been demonstrated by the presence of lymphocytic infiltrates in the CNS and plasma protein leakage through cerebral endothelium. Using an in vitro human BBB model, we investigated the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in endothelial changes induced by HTLV-1-infected lymphocytes. We demonstrate that coculture with infected lymphocytes induces an increase in paracellular endothelial permeability and transcellular migration, via IL-1alpha and TNF-alpha secretion. This disruption is associated with tight junction disorganization between endothelial cells, and alterations in the expression pattern of tight junction proteins such as zonula occludens 1. These changes could be prevented by inhibition of the NF-kappaB pathway or of myosin light chain kinase activity. Such disorganization was confirmed in histological sections of spinal cord from an HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis patient. Based on this BBB model, the present data indicate that HTLV-1-infected lymphocytes can induce BBB breakdown and may be responsible for the CNS infiltration that occurs in the early steps of retroviral-associated neuromyelopathies.","['Afonso, Philippe Vicente', 'Ozden, Simona', 'Prevost, Marie-Christine', 'Schmitt, Christine', 'Seilhean, Danielle', 'Weksler, Babette', 'Couraud, Pierre-Olivier', 'Gessain, Antoine', 'Romero, Ignacio Andres', 'Ceccaldi, Pierre-Emmanuel']","['Afonso PV', 'Ozden S', 'Prevost MC', 'Schmitt C', 'Seilhean D', 'Weksler B', 'Couraud PO', 'Gessain A', 'Romero IA', 'Ceccaldi PE']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Interleukin-1alpha)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (TJP1 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Zonula Occludens-1 Protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.18 (Myosin-Light-Chain Kinase)']",IM,"['Blood-Brain Barrier/enzymology/*immunology/pathology/ultrastructure/virology', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cerebellum/blood supply/enzymology/immunology/ultrastructure', 'Endothelial Cells/enzymology/*immunology/pathology/virology', 'Endothelium, Vascular/enzymology/immunology/pathology/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1alpha/immunology/metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism/ultrastructure/virology', 'Membrane Proteins/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Models, Immunological', 'Myosin-Light-Chain Kinase/*immunology/metabolism', 'Neurodegenerative Diseases/enzymology/*immunology/pathology/virology', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/enzymology/*immunology/pathology/virology', 'Phosphoproteins/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Spinal Cord/enzymology/immunology/ultrastructure/virology', 'Tight Junctions/*immunology/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/immunology/metabolism', 'Zonula Occludens-1 Protein']",2007/08/07 09:00,2007/10/04 09:00,['2007/08/07 09:00'],"['2007/08/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/04 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/07 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2007 Aug 15;179(4):2576-83. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.179.4.2576.,"['179/4/2576 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.179.4.2576 [doi]']",,"[""Unite d'Epidemiologie et Physiopathologie des Virus Oncogenes, Departement de Virologie and Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique Unite de Recherche Associee 3015, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In trans activation assays using an IL-12p40 gene reporter construct introduced in RAW 264.7 mouse macrophages, we show that the Icsbp1(C294) isoform behaves as a partial loss-of-function. The Icsbp1(C294) hypomorph allele appears to have a threshold effect on IL-12 production, with pleiotropic consequences on resistance to different types of infections in vivo. Despite the presence of a resistance Nramp1(G169) allele, BXH-2 mice (Icsbp1(C294)) show impaired control of Mycobacterium bovis (bacille Calmette-Guerin) multiplication both early and late during infection, with uncontrolled replication linked to inability to form granulomas in infected liver and spleen. Studies in informative (BXH-2 x BALB/cJ)F(2) mice show that homozygosity for Icsbp1(C294) causes susceptibility to Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium to a level comparable to that seen for mice lacking functional Nramp1 or TLR4. Finally, impaired Icsbp1(C294) function is associated with the following: 1) increased replication of the Plasmodium chabaudi AS malarial parasite during the first burst of blood parasitemia, and 2) recurring waves of high blood parasitemia late during infection. These results show that Icsbp1 is required for orchestrating early innate responses and also long-term immune protection against unrelated intracellular pathogens.","['Turcotte, Karine', 'Gauthier, Susan', 'Malo, Danielle', 'Tam, Mifong', 'Stevenson, Mary M', 'Gros, Philippe']","['Turcotte K', 'Gauthier S', 'Malo D', 'Tam M', 'Stevenson MM', 'Gros P']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Cation Transport Proteins)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-12 Subunit p40)', '0 (Tlr4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 4)', '0 (interferon regulatory factor-8)', '0 (natural resistance-associated macrophage protein 1)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Cation Transport Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Genes, Recessive', '*Immunity, Innate/genetics', 'Interferon Regulatory Factors/genetics/*immunology', 'Interleukin-12 Subunit p40/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/immunology', 'Macrophages/*immunology/microbiology/parasitology', 'Malaria/genetics/*immunology/veterinary', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Mycobacterium bovis/*immunology', 'Parasitemia/genetics/immunology', 'Plasmodium chabaudi/immunology', 'Salmonella Infections/genetics/*immunology', 'Salmonella typhimurium/immunology', 'Syndrome', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4/genetics/immunology', 'Tuberculosis/genetics/*immunology/veterinary']",2007/08/07 09:00,2007/10/04 09:00,['2007/08/07 09:00'],"['2007/08/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/04 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/07 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2007 Aug 15;179(4):2467-76. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.179.4.2467.,"['179/4/2467 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.179.4.2467 [doi]']",,"['Department of Biochemistry, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['12038-4/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the case of CTL-susceptible targets (e.g., P815 mastocytoma cells and EL-4 or RLmale1 T lymphoma cells), however, it is assumed that the CTL is the effector cell responsible for allograft rejection and that perforin and Fas ligand (FasL) pathways are the killing mechanisms. In the present study, we examined the role of these cytotoxic molecules in the rejection of i.p. allografted CTL-susceptible leukemia cells. Unexpectedly, the allografted leukemia cells were acutely rejected from gld (a mutation of FasL), perforin(-/-), or double-deficient mice. The peritoneal exudate cells from gld or normal mice showed T cell-, TCRalphabeta-, and perforin-dependent cytotoxic activity against the allograft, whereas the exudate cells from perforin(-/-) mice exhibited almost full cytotoxic activity in the presence of Fas-Fc. Furthermore, the infiltrates from double-deficient mice showed a high cytotoxic activity against the allografted cells even in the presence of anti-TCRalphabeta Ab or in the absence of T cells. The cytotoxic cells appeared to be macrophages, because they were Mac-1(+) mononuclear cells with a kidney- or horseshoe-shaped nucleus and because the cytotoxic activity was completely suppressed by the addition of N(G)-monomethyl-l-arginine, an inhibitor of inducible NO synthase. These results indicate that macrophages are ready and available to kill CTL-susceptible allografts when CTLs lack both perforin and FasL molecules.","['Nomi, Hayahito', 'Tashiro-Yamaji, Junko', 'Yamamoto, Yumiko', 'Miura-Takeda, Sayako', 'Miyoshi-Higashino, Masako', 'Takahashi, Takeshi', 'Azuma, Haruhito', 'Ueda, Haruhiko', 'Katsuoka, Yoji', 'Kubota, Takahiro', 'Yoshida, Ryotaro']","['Nomi H', 'Tashiro-Yamaji J', 'Yamamoto Y', 'Miura-Takeda S', 'Miyoshi-Higashino M', 'Takahashi T', 'Azuma H', 'Ueda H', 'Katsuoka Y', 'Kubota T', 'Yoshida R']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Macrophage-1 Antigen)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '126465-35-8 (Perforin)', '27JT06E6GR (omega-N-Methylarginine)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nos2 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/immunology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Fas Ligand Protein/*deficiency/immunology', 'Graft Rejection/genetics/*immunology', 'Heart Transplantation/*immunology', 'Leukemia/genetics/immunology', 'Macrophage-1 Antigen/genetics/immunology', 'Macrophages/*immunology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*deficiency/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neoplasm Transplantation/immunology', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology', 'Perforin', 'Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins/*deficiency/immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/genetics/immunology', 'Skin Transplantation/*immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'omega-N-Methylarginine/pharmacology']",2007/08/07 09:00,2007/10/04 09:00,['2007/08/07 09:00'],"['2007/08/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/04 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/07 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2007 Aug 15;179(4):2180-6. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.179.4.2180.,"['179/4/2180 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.179.4.2180 [doi]']",,"['Department of Physiology, Osaka Medical College, Takatsuki, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In mast cells, SHP-1 has been shown to negatively regulate the initial signaling triggered by high-affinity receptor for IgE (FcepsilonRI) and positively regulate downstream outputs. To clarify the molecular mechanisms of SHP-1 in mast cells, we determined substrates for SHP-1 by using the substrate-trapping approach. When phosphatase-inactive SHP-1 was over-expressed in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL)-2H3 cells, tyrosine phosphorylation of a 68-kDa protein was enhanced before and after FcepsilonRI aggregation. Immunoprecipitation and western blot analyses revealed that this protein is SHP-1, either endogenous or ectopically expressed. FcepsilonRI-induced activation of Lyn and Syk was comparable between cells expressing wild-type (wt) and phosphatase-inactive SHP-1. In vitro phosphatase assay and combined transfection, immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analyses showed that tyrosine 536 of SHP-1 was potent phosphorylation site and that SHP-1 could dephosphorylate this site that had been phosphorylated by Lyn. Furthermore, the phosphatase activity of SHP-1 immunoprecipitated from cells expressing a phosphatase-inactive SHP-1 was increased compared with that from vector-transfected or wt SHP-1-expressing cells. Finally, expression of phosphatase-inactive SHP-1 resulted in decreased activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and suppressed transcription of cytokine genes, whereas wt SHP-1 enhanced these processes. Taken collectively, these results suggest that SHP-1 may be a physiological substrate of SHP-1 in RBL-2H3 cells and that dephosphorylation of SHP-1 leads to a decrease in its catalytic activity and an enhancement of downstream signaling. A negative autoregulatory circuit of SHP-1 may contribute to mast cell regulation.","['Ozawa, Tomoko', 'Nakata, Kazuko', 'Mizuno, Kazuya', 'Yakura, Hidetaka']","['Ozawa T', 'Nakata K', 'Mizuno K', 'Yakura H']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int Immunol,International immunology,8916182,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk protein, rat)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptpn6 protein, rat)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytokines/genetics/immunology', 'Down-Regulation/immunology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/immunology', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/*immunology', 'Mast Cells/immunology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/immunology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6/genetics/*immunology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/immunology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/immunology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Signal Transduction/immunology', 'Syk Kinase', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'src-Family Kinases/immunology']",2007/08/07 09:00,2007/12/15 09:00,['2007/08/07 09:00'],"['2007/08/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/15 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/07 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int Immunol. 2007 Sep;19(9):1049-61. doi: 10.1093/intimm/dxm070.

However, we and others have recently obtained evidence for a potential involvement of this receptor system in leukemia. To investigate mechanisms underlying the leukemogenic potential of activated neurotrophin receptor signaling, we analyzed in vivo leukemogenesis mediated by deltaTrkA, a mutant of TRKA (tropomyosin-related kinase A) isolated from a patient with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Retroviral expression of deltaTrkA in myeloid 32D cells induced AML in syngeneic C3H/Hej mice (n=11/11, latency approximately 4 weeks). C57Bl/6J mice transplanted with deltaTrkA-transduced primary lineage negative (Lin-) bone marrow cells died of a transient polyclonal AML (n=7/15, latency of <12 days). Serial transplantation of AML cells did not re-induce this disease but rather acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL, latency >78 days). All primary recipients surviving the early AML developed clonal ALL or myeloid leukemia (latency >72 days) that required additional genetic lesions. PI3K and mTOR-raptor were identified as the crucial mediators of leukemic transformation, whereas STAT and MAP kinase signaling pathways were not activated. Thus, our findings reveal potent and unique transforming properties of altered neurotrophin receptor signaling in leukemogenesis, and encourage further analyses of neurotrophin receptors and downstream signaling events in hematological malignancies.","['Meyer, J', 'Rhein, M', 'Schiedlmeier, B', 'Kustikova, O', 'Rudolph, C', 'Kamino, K', 'Neumann, T', 'Yang, M', 'Wahlers, A', 'Fehse, B', 'Reuther, G W', 'Schlegelberger, B', 'Ganser, A', 'Baum, C', 'Li, Z']","['Meyer J', 'Rhein M', 'Schiedlmeier B', 'Kustikova O', 'Rudolph C', 'Kamino K', 'Neumann T', 'Yang M', 'Wahlers A', 'Fehse B', 'Reuther GW', 'Schlegelberger B', 'Ganser A', 'Baum C', 'Li Z']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, trkA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Models, Biological', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Receptor, trkA/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction']",2007/08/04 09:00,2007/10/27 09:00,['2007/08/04 09:00'],"['2007/08/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/27 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/04 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Oct;21(10):2171-80. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404882.

Candidate genes were prioritized on the basis of genes whose SNPs or expression differentiated cases from controls or showed LOH or copy number change in germline vs paired blast DNA from the 13 cases. Three biological pathways were altered: adhesion, Wnt signaling and regulation of actin. Validation experiments using a genome scan for etoposide-induced leukemogenic MLL chimeric fusions in 15 HapMap cell lines also implicated genes involved in adhesion, a process linked to de novo leukemogenesis.

Conditions governing NK cell alloreactivity and the role of NK recovery in sibling SCT are not well defined. NK cells on day 30 post-transplant (NK30) were measured in 54 SCT recipients with leukemia and donor and recipient killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) genotype determined. In univariate analysis, donor KIR genes 2DL5A, 2DS1, 3DS1 (positive in 46%) and higher numbers of inhibitory donor KIR correlated with higher NK30 counts and were associated with improved transplant outcome. NK30 counts also correlated directly with the transplant CD34 cell dose and inversely with the CD3+ cell dose. In multivariate analysis, the NK30 emerged as the single independent determinant of transplant outcome. Patients with NK30 >150/microl had less relapse (HR 18.3, P=0.039), acute graft-versus-host disease (HR 3.2, P=0.03), non-relapse mortality (HR 10.7, P=0.028) and improved survival (HR 11.4, P=0.03).

Although many diseases that affect the lacrimal gland and fossa are specifically diagnosed by imaging, it is frequently very difficult to differentiate each specific disease on the basis of image characteristics alone due to intrinsic similarities. In lacrimal gland epithelial tumors, benign pleomorphic adenomas are seen most commonly with a well defined benign appearance, and a malignant adenoid cystic carcinoma is seen with a typical invasive malignant appearance. However, a malignant myoepithelial carcinoma is seen with a benign looking appearance. Lymphomatous lesions of the lacrimal gland include a broad spectrum ranging from reactive hyperplasia to malignant lymphoma. These lesions can be very difficult to differentiate both radiologically and pathologically. Generally, lymphomas tend to occur in older patients. The developmental cystic lesions found in the lacrimal fossa such as dermoid and epidermoid cysts can be diagnosed when the cyst involves the superior temporal quadrant of the orbit and manifests as a non-enhancing cystic mass and, in case of a lipoma, it is diagnosed as a total fatty mass. However, masses of granulocytic sarcoma and xanthogranuloma, as well as vascular masses, such as a hemangiopericytoma, are difficult to diagnose correctly on the basis of preoperative imaging findings alone. A careful clinical evaluation and moreover, a pathologic verification, are needed. In this pictorial review, the various imaging spectrums of pathologic masses involving the lacrimal gland and fossa are presented, along with appropriate anatomy and pathology reviews.","['Jung, Won Sang', 'Ahn, Kook Jin', 'Park, Mi Ra', 'Kim, Ji Young', 'Choi, Jae Jeong', 'Kim, Bum Soo', 'Hahn, Seong Tai']","['Jung WS', 'Ahn KJ', 'Park MR', 'Kim JY', 'Choi JJ', 'Kim BS', 'Hahn ST']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Korea (South),Korean J Radiol,Korean journal of radiology,100956096,,IM,"['Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/diagnostic imaging', 'Conjunctival Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging', 'Cysts/diagnostic imaging', 'Eye Neoplasms/*diagnostic imaging', 'Hemangiopericytoma/diagnostic imaging', 'Humans', 'Lacrimal Apparatus/*pathology', 'Lacrimal Apparatus Diseases/diagnostic imaging', 'Lipoma/diagnostic imaging', 'Lymphoma/diagnostic imaging', 'Neoplasms, Glandular and Epithelial/diagnostic imaging', 'Neurofibroma/diagnostic imaging', 'Radiography', 'Sarcoma, Myeloid/diagnostic imaging']",2007/08/04 09:00,2007/11/09 09:00,['2007/08/04 09:00'],"['2007/08/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/09 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/04 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Korean J Radiol. 2007 Jul-Aug;8(4):336-42. doi: 10.3348/kjr.2007.8.4.336.,"['2007v8n4p336 [pii]', '10.3348/kjr.2007.8.4.336 [doi]']",,"[""Department of Radiology, St Mary's Hospital, Catholic University College of Medicine, 62 Youido-dong, Youngdeungpo-gu, Seoul 150-713, Korea.""]",,9,,,,,PMC2627159,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This property combined with its essential function in mitochondrial energy production suggests that it may have therapeutic potential in cancer treatment. As part of the body's antioxidant defence against free radical production, CoQ10 concentrations may change during anti-cancer chemotherapy. Our study measured CoQ10 concentration in the plasma of 27 children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) at the time of diagnosis, during induction (protocol ALL-BFM 2000), and post induction treatment. The starting values were compared to the CoQ10 concentrations in 92 healthy children. The total CoQ10 concentration and its redox status were measured by HPLC using electrochemical detection and internal standardisation. While the CoQ10 concentration in the plasma of children with ALL was within a normal range at the time of diagnosis (0.99 +/- 0.41 pmol/microl), a drastic increase was observed during induction treatment (2.19 +/- 1.01 pmol/mul on day 33). This increase was accompanied by shift in the redox status in favour of the reduced form of CoQ10. The increase in CoQ10 concentration during induction treatment may be attributed to the activation of a natural antioxidative defence mechanism, endocrine influence on CoQ10 synthesis from steroid treatment, or a shift in CoQ10 from the damaged cells to the plasma after cell lysis.","['Niklowitz, Petra', 'Wiesel, Thomas', 'Andler, Werner', 'Menke, Thomas']","['Niklowitz P', 'Wiesel T', 'Andler W', 'Menke T']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Biofactors,"BioFactors (Oxford, England)",8807441,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Coenzymes)', '1339-63-5 (Ubiquinone)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'EJ27X76M46 (coenzyme Q10)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Antioxidants/metabolism', 'Asparaginase/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Coenzymes/blood', 'Daunorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/drug therapy', 'Prednisone/therapeutic use', 'Ubiquinone/*analogs & derivatives/blood', 'Vincristine/therapeutic use']",2007/08/04 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2007/08/04 09:00'],"['2007/08/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/04 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biofactors. 2007;29(2-3):83-9. doi: 10.1002/biof.552029208.,['10.1002/biof.552029208 [doi]'],,"['Vestische Kinderklinik Datteln, University Witten-Herdecke, Datteln, Germany. pf-niklowitz@web.de']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A multicenter, open, phase II study of anagrelide treatment in 60 patients during 2 yr was performed by the Swedish Myeloproliferative Disorder Study Group. Adequate bone marrow biopsies were obtained from 53 of the CMPD patients [36 essential thrombocythemia (ET), 16 polycythemia vera (PV), 1 chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis (CIMF)] before treatment and compared with biopsies from 30 healthy volunteers and 34 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

We report the identification of B cell leukemia (Bcl)-3 as an essential negative regulator of TLR signaling. By blocking ubiquitination of p50, a member of the nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB family, Bcl-3 stabilizes a p50 complex that inhibits gene transcription. As a consequence, Bcl-3-deficient mice and cells were found to be hypersensitive to TLR activation and unable to control responses to lipopolysaccharides. Thus, p50 ubiquitination blockade by Bcl-3 limits the strength of TLR responses and maintains innate immune homeostasis. These findings indicate that the p50 ubiquitination pathway can be selectively targeted to control deleterious inflammatory diseases.","['Carmody, Ruaidhri J', 'Ruan, Qingguo', 'Palmer, Scott', 'Hilliard, Brendan', 'Chen, Youhai H']","['Carmody RJ', 'Ruan Q', 'Palmer S', 'Hilliard B', 'Chen YH']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Science,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",0404511,"['0 (B-Cell Lymphoma 3 Protein)', '0 (Bcl3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (NF-kappa B p50 Subunit)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Rela protein, mouse)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptors)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Cell Lymphoma 3 Protein', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Female', 'Half-Life', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Lipopolysaccharides/immunology', 'Macrophage Activation', 'Macrophages, Peritoneal/*immunology/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'NF-kappa B p50 Subunit/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Toll-Like Receptors/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factor RelA/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin/metabolism']",2007/08/04 09:00,2007/08/22 09:00,['2007/08/04 09:00'],"['2007/08/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/04 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Science. 2007 Aug 3;317(5838):675-8. doi: 10.1126/science.1142953.,"['317/5838/675 [pii]', '10.1126/science.1142953 [doi]']",,"['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.']","['AI069289/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI50059/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'DK070691/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The relationship between health insurance status and the time from the onset of first cancer-specific symptom or sign to definitive diagnosis (lagtime) was retrospectively compared with other sociodemographic factors in newly diagnosed cancer patients aged 15-29 years who were evaluated between June 2001 and June 2003. Data on 270 patients with the six most common cancer types in this cohort (leukemia, Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, sarcoma, brain tumors, thyroid cancer) were retrospectively collected in 2004. RESULTS: Lagtimes were evaluable in 235 (88%) patients. In multivariate analysis, the type of cancer and health insurance were significantly associated with lagtime, whereas race/ethnicity, age, gender, marital status, and surrogate measures of socioeconomic status were not. The mean lagtime in patients with public or no health insurance was 13.1 weeks longer than in patients with private health insurance, and longer in four of six evaluable histology-specific types of cancer. In cancers evaluable for stage at diagnosis, advanced stage was associated with longer lagtimes. CONCLUSION: In the U.S., older adolescents and young adults with cancer are likely to have a delay in diagnosis because of inadequate health insurance and consequently present with a more advanced stage of disease.","['Martin, Sean', 'Ulrich, Corinne', 'Munsell, Mark', 'Taylor, Sarah', 'Lange, Georgia', 'Bleyer, Archie']","['Martin S', 'Ulrich C', 'Munsell M', 'Taylor S', 'Lange G', 'Bleyer A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Oncologist,The oncologist,9607837,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cancer Care Facilities', 'Female', 'Health Services Accessibility/economics', 'Humans', 'Linear Models', 'Male', 'Medically Uninsured/*statistics & numerical data', 'Neoplasm Staging/*economics', 'Neoplasms/economics/epidemiology/*pathology', 'Risk Factors', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Texas/epidemiology', 'Time Factors']",2007/08/04 09:00,2008/03/26 09:00,['2007/08/04 09:00'],"['2007/08/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/26 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/04 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncologist. 2007 Jul;12(7):816-24. doi: 10.1634/theoncologist.12-7-816.,"['12/7/816 [pii]', '10.1634/theoncologist.12-7-816 [doi]']",,"['University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, CO 80231, USA.

Because of the critical role of NF-kappaB signaling pathway, we investigated the effects of GA on NF-kappaB-mediated cellular responses and NF-kappaB-regulated gene products in human leukemia cancer cells. Treatment of cells with GA enhanced apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and chemotherapeutic agents, inhibited the expression of gene products involved in antiapoptosis (IAP1 and IAP2, Bcl-2, Bcl-x(L), and TRAF1), proliferation (cyclin D1 and c-Myc), invasion (COX-2 and MMP-9), and angiogenesis (VEGF), all of which are known to be regulated by NF-kappaB. GA suppressed NF-kappaB activation induced by various inflammatory agents and carcinogens and this, accompanied by the inhibition of TAK1/TAB1-mediated IKK activation, inhibited IkappaBalpha phosphorylation and degradation, suppressed p65 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, and finally abrogated NF-kappaB-dependent reporter gene expression. The NF-kappaB activation induced by TNFR1, TRADD, TRAF2, NIK, TAK1/TAB1, and IKKbeta was also inhibited. The effect of GA mediated through transferrin receptor as down-regulation of the receptor by RNA interference reversed its effects on NF-kappaB and apoptosis. Overall our results demonstrate that GA inhibits NF-kappaB signaling pathway and potentiates apoptosis through its interaction with the transferrin receptor.","['Pandey, Manoj K', 'Sung, Bokyung', 'Ahn, Kwang Seok', 'Kunnumakkara, Ajaikumar B', 'Chaturvedi, Madan M', 'Aggarwal, Bharat B']","['Pandey MK', 'Sung B', 'Ahn KS', 'Kunnumakkara AB', 'Chaturvedi MM', 'Aggarwal BB']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NFKBIA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Xanthones)', '139874-52-5 (NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha)', '8N585K83U2 (gambogic acid)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Genes, Reporter/drug effects', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Proteins/metabolism', '*Ligands', 'Models, Biological', 'NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Metastasis/genetics', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Receptors, Transferrin/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Xanthones/*pharmacology']",2007/08/04 09:00,2008/01/10 09:00,['2007/08/04 09:00'],"['2007/08/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/04 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Nov 15;110(10):3517-25. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-03-079616.

Memory B cells, which are responsible for this phenomenon, undergo greater proliferation and differentiation into Ig-secreting plasma cells than naive B cells. We have found that memory cells rapidly enter cell division, irrespective of extrinsic stimuli. Microarray analysis of human splenic B cells revealed that naive cells express higher levels than memory B cells of Kruppel-like factor (KLF) 4, KLF9, and promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF), transcription factors important in maintaining cellular quiescence. These genes were down-regulated after activation through CD40 and the B cell receptor. Enforced expression of KLF4, KLF9, and PLZF in memory B cells delayed their entry into division and reduced the number of proliferating cells, such that the behavior of transfected memory cells resembled that of naive B cells. Thus, the accelerated response of memory B cells correlates with reduced expression of KLF4, KLF9, and PLZF and the subsequent regulatory effects they exert on the cell cycle.","['Good, Kim L', 'Tangye, Stuart G']","['Good KL', 'Tangye SG']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (KLF4 protein, human)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Factor 4)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['*Antibody Formation', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/*metabolism', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', '*Immunologic Memory', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/*metabolism']",2007/08/04 09:00,2007/10/25 09:00,['2007/08/04 09:00'],"['2007/08/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/25 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/04 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2007 Aug 14;104(33):13420-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0703872104.

We also found that c-MET, related to proliferation and protection from apoptosis, is associated with the pro-apoptotic protein FAS in TEL-AML1 B-ALL cells and in normal B lymphocytes. The possible role of this protein complex in drug-induced apoptosis was thus investigated in REH TEL-AML1 B-ALL cell line.

REH cells stimulated with IL-3 and treated with doxorubicin did not undergo apoptosis more than nonstimulated cells, demonstrating that increased proliferation in itself is not directly related to the higher apoptotic sensitivity observed with HGF stimulation. These results indicate that c-MET activation enhances specifically FAS-mediated apoptosis in TEL-AML1 ALL cells and, considering that the c-MET/FAS complex is present only in normal B lymphocytes and in TEL-AML1 leukemias, this implies that it may have an important contribution in cellular homeostasis and in high sensitivity of TEL-AML1 ALL to chemotherapeutic regimens.","['Accordi, Benedetta', 'Pillozzi, Serena', ""Dell'Orto, Marta Campo"", 'Cazzaniga, Giovanni', 'Arcangeli, Annarosa', 'Kronnie, Geertruy Te', 'Basso, Giuseppe']","['Accordi B', 'Pillozzi S', ""Dell'Orto MC"", 'Cazzaniga G', 'Arcangeli A', 'Kronnie GT', 'Basso G']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*metabolism', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Protein Transport', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met/*metabolism', 'RNA/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'fas Receptor/*metabolism']",2007/08/04 09:00,2007/11/08 09:00,['2007/08/04 09:00'],"['2007/08/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/08 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/04 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2007 Oct 5;282(40):29384-93. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M706314200.

Bcl-2 over-expression inhibits cytochrome c release and apoptosis, and also prevents c-FLIP(L) down-regulation and caspase-8 activation, but not TNF-R1 over-expression.

It has been shown that mCAT1 is expressed on the basolateral surface of polarized epithelial MDCK cells. However, little is known about the mechanisms involved in the intracellular trafficking of mCAT1. Using the green fluorescent protein-tagged mCAT1 expressed in MDCK cells, we report here that mCAT1 is physically associated with clathrin adaptor protein complex 1 (AP-1) implicated in protein trafficking from trans-Golgi network (TGN) to the basolateral surface. When the cells were infected with eMuLV, reduction of cell surface mCAT1, as well as a concomitant decrease in mCAT1-AP-1 association, was observed while association of mCAT1 with AP-3 involved in the TGN-to-lysosome trafficking was increased. Similar results were obtained when eMuLV envelope protein alone was expressed. The results may provide useful insights into the mechanism by which a simple retrovirus downregulates its receptor.","['Fujisawa, Ryuichi', 'Masuda, Michiaki']","['Fujisawa R', 'Masuda M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport)', '0 (Cationic Amino Acid Transporter 1)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (ecotropic murine leukemia virus receptor)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport/genetics/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cationic Amino Acid Transporter 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', '*Down-Regulation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Receptors, Virus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",2007/08/04 09:00,2007/12/07 09:00,['2007/08/04 09:00'],"['2007/04/16 00:00 [received]', '2007/05/07 00:00 [revised]', '2007/06/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/08/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/04 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Virology. 2007 Nov 25;368(2):342-50. doi: 10.1016/j.virol.2007.06.036.

The aims of the study were: (1) analysis of expression of MRP1, PGP1, LRP, BCL-2 and p53 proteins; (2) correlation with ex vivo drug resistance, and (3) analysis of their prognostic impact on clinical outcome in childhood acute lymphoblastic (ALL) and acute myeloid (AML) leukemia. METHODS: Total number of 787 children diagnosed for initial ALL (n = 527), relapsed ALL (n = 104), initial AML (n = 133) and relapsed AML (n = 23) were included into the study. Mean follow-up period was 3.5 years. Drug resistance for up to 30 anticancer agents was performed by the MTT assay. Expression of all proteins was tested by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Both initial AML and relapsed ALL samples showed higher drug resistance than initial ALL samples. No significant differences were found in drug resistance between initial and relapsed AML samples. The presence of multidrug resistance and apoptosis proteins had no impact on pDFS in iALL and iAML, however strong trend towards adverse prognostic impact of MRP1, PGP and LRP on pDFS in rALL was observed. The same trend was observed for each of analyzed co-expressions of tested multidrug resistance proteins. CONCLUSIONS: The phenomenon of cellular drug resistance in childhood acute leukemias is multifactorial and plays an important role in response to therapy. Expression of MRP1, PGP and LRP proteins, as well as their co-expression play possible role in childhood relapsed ALL.","['Styczynski, Jan', 'Wysocki, Mariusz', 'Debski, Robert', 'Czyzewski, Krzysztof', 'Kolodziej, Beata', 'Rafinska, Beata', 'Kubicka, Malgorzata', 'Koltan, Sylwia', 'Koltan, Andrzej', 'Pogorzala, Monika', 'Kurylak, Andrzej', 'Olszewska-Slonina, Dorota', 'Balwierz, Walentyna', 'Juraszewska, Edyta', 'Wieczorek, Maria', 'Olejnik, Igor', 'Krawczuk-Rybak, Maryna', 'Kuzmicz, Marta', 'Kowalczyk, Jerzy', 'Stefaniak, Jolanta', 'Badowska, Wanda', 'Sonta-Jakimczyk, Danuta', 'Szczepanski, Tomasz', 'Matysiak, Michal', 'Malinowska, Iwona', 'Stanczak, Elzbieta', 'Wachowiak, Jacek', 'Konatkowska, Benigna', 'Gil, Lidia', 'Balcerska, Anna', 'Maciejka-Kapuscinska, Lucyna']","['Styczynski J', 'Wysocki M', 'Debski R', 'Czyzewski K', 'Kolodziej B', 'Rafinska B', 'Kubicka M', 'Koltan S', 'Koltan A', 'Pogorzala M', 'Kurylak A', 'Olszewska-Slonina D', 'Balwierz W', 'Juraszewska E', 'Wieczorek M', 'Olejnik I', 'Krawczuk-Rybak M', 'Kuzmicz M', 'Kowalczyk J', 'Stefaniak J', 'Badowska W', 'Sonta-Jakimczyk D', 'Szczepanski T', 'Matysiak M', 'Malinowska I', 'Stanczak E', 'Wachowiak J', 'Konatkowska B', 'Gil L', 'Balcerska A', 'Maciejka-Kapuscinska L']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Vault Ribonucleoprotein Particles)', '0 (major vault protein)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/diagnosis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Vault Ribonucleoprotein Particles/genetics/*metabolism']",2007/08/03 09:00,2007/12/12 09:00,['2007/08/03 09:00'],"['2006/12/17 00:00 [received]', '2007/06/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/08/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/03 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2007 Nov;133(11):875-93. doi: 10.1007/s00432-007-0274-1.

In comparison with MCF-7, MCF-7R lacks estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) and overexpressess P-glycoprotein (P-gp), different IAPs (inhibitory of apoptosis proteins) and COX-2. Through analyses of the effects on cell proliferation, cycling and death, we have observed that the antitumor activity of curcumin and of the more potent (approximately two-fold) MR 39 is at least equal in the MDR cell line compared to the parental MCF-7. Similar results were observed also in an MDR variant of HL-60 leukemia. RT-PCR evaluations performed in MCF-7 and MCF-7R showed that curcumin or MR 39 produced early modifications in the amounts of relevant gene transcripts, which, however, were mostly diverse (i.e. represented by decreases in IAPs and COX-2 in MCF-7R versus reductions in Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL as well as increases in the Bcl-XS/Bcl-XL ratio in MCF-7) in the two cell lines. These results could not be explained by an involvement of NF-kappaB (p65 subunit) or STAT3, since the low nuclear levels of these transcription factors present in MCF-7 were only slightly, though significantly, elevated in MCF-7R; moreover, curcumin or MR 39 caused minor changes in NF-kappaB or STAT3 activation. Overall, these data underline that curcumin or MR 39 antitumor activities are not hampered by P-gp expression or lack of ERalpha in breast cancer cells. Remarkably, the agents appeared to modify their molecular effects according to the diverse gene expression patterns existing in the MDR and in the parental MCF-7. Clearly, the structure and properties of curcumin can form the basis for the development of antitumor compounds that are more effective against both chemosensitive and MDR cells.","['Poma, Paola', 'Notarbartolo, Monica', 'Labbozzetta, Manuela', 'Maurici, Annamaria', 'Carina, Valeria', 'Alaimo, Alessandra', 'Rizzi, Michele', 'Simoni, Daniele', ""D'Alessandro, Natale""]","['Poma P', 'Notarbartolo M', 'Labbozzetta M', 'Maurici A', 'Carina V', 'Alaimo A', 'Rizzi M', 'Simoni D', ""D'Alessandro N""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Mol Med,International journal of molecular medicine,9810955,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Curcumin/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Transcription Factor RelA/metabolism']",2007/08/03 09:00,2007/10/12 09:00,['2007/08/03 09:00'],"['2007/08/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/03 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Mol Med. 2007 Sep;20(3):329-35.,,,"['Department of Pharmacological Sciences, University of Palermo, 90127 Palermo, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Certain data suggest the induction of apoptosis by emetine in leukemia cells. Therefore, we examined the suitability of emetine for the sensitisation of leukemia cells to apoptosis induced by cisplatin. In response to emetine, we found a strong reduction in viability, an induction of apoptosis and caspase activity comparable to the cytotoxic effect of cisplatin. Moreover, emetine had an additive effect and increased cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Mechanistically, we demonstrate by DNA array analysis that emetine alone or together with cisplatin down-regulates several anti-survival genes and up-regulates several pro-apoptotic signalling molecules along with other effects on signalling. These data show that emetine is a strong inducer of apoptosis in leukemia cells and could be a suitable cytotoxic drug alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutics to sensitise leukemia cells to apoptosis.","['Moller, Maren', 'Herzer, Kerstin', 'Wenger, Till', 'Herr, Ingrid', 'Wink, Michael']","['Moller M', 'Herzer K', 'Wenger T', 'Herr I', 'Wink M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'X8D5EPO80M (Emetine)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'DNA Primers', 'Emetine/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Kinetics', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification']",2007/08/03 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2007/08/03 09:00'],"['2007/08/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/03 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2007 Sep;18(3):737-44.,,,"['Institute of Pharmacy and Molecular Biotechnology, University of Heidelberg, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, resistance to arsenite agents reduces their efficacy. We have isolated arsenite-resistant human epidermoid carcinoma KB cells, termed KAS. KAS cells were resistant to sodium arsenite (22-fold) and showed a reduced accumulation of arsenite as a result of an active efflux mechanism. Further analysis indicated that resistance of KAS cells extended to other drugs including cisplatin (17-fold), antimony potassium tartrate (11-fold) and doxorubicin (27-fold). Although increased expression of multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1) in KAS cells was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR and immunoblot analysis, specific inhibitors of MRP1 did not completely eliminate arsenite resistance. The level of glutathione (GSH) in KAS cells was 3-fold higher than that in KB-3-1 cells, and the inhibition of GSH synthesis by buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) considerably increased the cytotoxic effect of arsenite on KAS cells.

The stable transfected cells were identified with RT-PCR, the effect of EDAG/siRNA on the growth of the human erythroleukemia cell line HEL was analyzed by MTT assay, and angiogenic factor IL-8 release was evaluated by ELISA and RT-PCR. The results showed that EDAG/siRNA can silence the expression of EDAG in HEL cells. Down-regulation of EDAG expression by retrovirus-mediated siRNA inhibited the cell proliferation and tumor growth. Knockdown of EDAG expression by siRNA is also associated with decreased expression of the anti-angiogenic factor IL-8, suggesting that EDAG stimulates tumor growth at least in part by regulating angiogenesis.

Chronic inflammation leads to cancer development and progression. Interleukin-8 (CXCL-8) is a CXC chemokine, which plays an important role in neutrophil chemotaxis and activation. We previously reported that CXCL-8 was produced by a variety of human carcinoma cells and tissues, and that CXCL-8 promoted proliferation in pancreatic carcinoma cells (SUIT-2). In the present study, we analyzed whether various cytokines affect cell proliferation by CXCL-8 expression in pancreas carcinoma cells. All examined pancreatic carcinoma cells expressed CXCL-8 and TNFRII mRNA constitutively in RPMI-1640 medium without FBS. TNF-alpha, LIF, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, or IFN-beta enhanced the expression of CXCL-8 mRNA, but IL-10 did not in Hs-700T cells. Actinomycin D suppressed and cycloheximide augmented CXCL-8 mRNA which was induced by TNF-alpha or not. The half-life of CXCL-8 mRNA was 36.5 min by TNF-alpha and 35.2 min by no stimulation. In our previous study, LIF promoted cell growth in Hs-700T cells. LIF induced CXCL-8 mRNA in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Addition of recombinant CXCL-8 did not induce cell growth of Hs-700T. Anti-CXCL-8 IgG significantly suppressed cell growth. CXCL-8 would act as an autocrine growth factor in Hs-700T cells, which expressed CXCL-8 mRNA highly without stimulation. Curcumin (diferuloylmethane), NF-kappaB inhibitor, suppressed cell proliferation in Hs-700T cells. These results suggest that CXCL-8 plays a pivotal role in progression of pancreatic cancer, and its expression is influenced by inflammatory cytokines in pancreatic tumor microenvironment.","['Kamohara, Hidenobu', 'Takahashi, Masashi', 'Ishiko, Takatoshi', 'Ogawa, Michio', 'Baba, Hideo']","['Kamohara H', 'Takahashi M', 'Ishiko T', 'Ogawa M', 'Baba H']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/chemistry', 'Inflammation', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism', 'Interleukin-8/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*metabolism', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*metabolism']",2007/08/03 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2007/08/03 09:00'],"['2007/08/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/03 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2007 Sep;31(3):627-32.,,,"['Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan. kamo.kamo@tkg.bbiq.jp']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pharmacogenomics, the study of inherited differences in drug disposition and effects, is emerging as a tool to predict efficacy and toxicity of drugs. Glutathione S-transferases (GST) are involved in the metabolism and detoxification of environmental carcinogens and some classes of chemotherapeutics. Polymorphism of GSTM1 and GSTT1, in the form of homozygous deletion, is encountered in varying frequencies in normal population. It has been associated with altered response and toxicity from cytotoxic chemotherapy. In this study, we investigated the impact of these polymorphisms on response and side effects of chemotherapy in adult acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients. Correlations between these genetic polymorphisms and other prognostic factors were also investigated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We genotyped GSTM1 and GSTT1 in 98 adult AML patients using multiplex PCR. Induction therapy included Doxorubicin and Cytosine arabinoside (3+7) regimen. Treatment outcomes were compared in those with or without GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes. RESULTS: The frequencies of GSTM1 null and GSTT1 null genotypes were 56% and 14%, respectively. Six percent (6%) were double null. The rate of toxic death during induction was 3/7 (43%) and 17/56 (30%) in GSTT1 null and GSTT1 present patients, respectively, p=0.67. This constituted 75% and 42% of total deaths in each group, respectively, p=0.31. Differences were not statistically significant. On the other hand, the rate of complete remission (CR) in patients with GSTM1 present compared to those with GSTM1 null genotype was 12/27 (48%) versus 23/36 (64%), p=0.21. GSTT1 null genotype was significantly associated with lymphoid marker (mainly CD7) expression (p=0.03), known with its adverse effect on prognosis. Overall survival and disease-free survival were similar in patients with and without the genes. No significant associations were encountered between GST genotypes and treatment outcomes. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest possible association, though not significant, between GSTT1 null genotype and toxic death during induction and between GSTM1 present genotype and lower rate of CR. Studies on larger numbers are needed focusing on selection of anticancer agents to avoid adverse reactions and therapeutic failure, with special emphasis on drug toxicity and dose adjustment.","['Mossallam, Ghada I', 'Abdel Hamid, Thoraya M', 'Samra, Mohamed A']","['Mossallam GI', 'Abdel Hamid TM', 'Samra MA']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Egypt Natl Canc Inst,Journal of the Egyptian National Cancer Institute,9424566,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 2.5.1.- (glutathione S-transferase T1)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Glutathione Transferase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/enzymology/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Outcome']",2007/08/03 09:00,2007/09/26 09:00,['2007/08/03 09:00'],"['2007/08/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/26 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/03 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Egypt Natl Canc Inst. 2006 Sep;18(3):264-73.,,,"['Department of Clinical Pathology, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Egypt. ghadamossallam@hotmail.com']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CD9 was expressed in 3/6 (50%) of M3 cases, CD7 was expressed in 11.8% and was mostly confined to FAB M1 and M2 and associated with immature antigens CD34, HLA-DR and TdT. CD56 was expressed in 7/34 (20.6%) cases, three of these cases (42.9%) belonged to the monocytic group. CD56 was also detected in 2 cases with 11q23 rearrangement. CD56 was expressed in 2/7 (28.6%) M2 cases, and was associated with t (8;21) (q22;q22) together with CD19. Co-expression of CD56 and CD7 was detected in 2.9% of the cases. CD79a was expressed in one case together with CD19, diagnosed as acute biphenotypic leukemia, and was associated with t(8;21) (q22;q22). CONCLUSION: Minimal residual disease in AML is very difficult to trace, detection of aberrant expression of lymphoid antigens will make it easier. The high score given to CD79a by EGIL is questionable based on cytogenetic classification.","['El-Sissy, Azza H', 'El-Mashari, May A', 'Bassuni, Wafaa Y', 'El-Swaayed, Aziza F']","['El-Sissy AH', 'El-Mashari MA', 'Bassuni WY', 'El-Swaayed AF']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Egypt Natl Canc Inst,Journal of the Egyptian National Cancer Institute,9424566,"['0 (Antigens, CD7)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (CD79 Antigens)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD7/*analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'CD56 Antigen/*analysis', 'CD79 Antigens/*analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Saudi Arabia']",2007/08/03 09:00,2007/09/26 09:00,['2007/08/03 09:00'],"['2007/08/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/26 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/03 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Egypt Natl Canc Inst. 2006 Sep;18(3):244-9.,,,"['Department of Pathology, King Fahad Medical City, Riyadh, KSA, Egypt. elsissy@yahoo.com']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is usually associated with inactivation of the involved genes, and can be reversed using demethylating agents. The aim of this study is to evaluate the frequency of p15 and E-cadherin promoter methylation in Egyptian acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients in an attempt to identify a subset of patients who might be candidates for demethylating agents as a form of targeted therapy either as a primary or as an adjunct to current standard induction and post-remission regimens. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In the present work we have studied tumor-associated aberrant p15 and E-cadherin promotor methylation in 59 newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients using methylation specific PCR. RESULTS: Aberrant p15 promoter methylation was detected in 49% (29/59) of the patients. In 4 of these patients, no DNA could be amplified by the p15 unmethylated reaction showing a complete methylation of both alleles in the examined region. In the remaining 25 cases both methylated and unmethylated DNA could be amplified. Aberrant methylation of E-cadherin was detected in 63% (37/59) of the cases. In all of these cases both the methylated and the unmethylated alleles were amplified denoting partial methylation of the examined region. Concomitant methylation of p15 and E-cadherin was detected in 40% (23/59) of all the cases tested, while in 27% (16/59) of the cases both genes were not methylated. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that p15 and E-cadherin promoter methylation are frequent events in Egyptian AML and provide an impetus for larger studies to define the extent and pattern of methylation in the various subgroups of AML. Methylation studies, therefore, represent a novel additional tool to define the subset of patients who might benefit from demethylating agents,thus providing the molecular basis for targeted therapeutic approaches and better designing of risk-adapted therapy.","['El-Shakankiry, Nayera H', 'Mossallam, Ghada I']","['El-Shakankiry NH', 'Mossallam GI']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Egypt Natl Canc Inst,Journal of the Egyptian National Cancer Institute,9424566,"['0 (Cadherins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cadherins/*genetics', 'Child', 'CpG Islands/*genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15/*genetics', '*DNA Methylation', 'Egypt', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic']",2007/08/03 09:00,2007/09/26 09:00,['2007/08/03 09:00'],"['2007/08/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/26 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/03 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Egypt Natl Canc Inst. 2006 Sep;18(3):227-32.,,,"['The Department of Clinical Pathology, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Egypt.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Accordingly, targeting NFkappaB provides an attractive strategy for cancer therapy. We recently found that specific inhibition of Hsp90 by geldanamycin (GA) results in autophagic degradation of IKK and NFkappaB-inducing kinase (NIK), an upstream kinase of IKK, and inactivation of NFkappaB in various cell lines. Here, we further report that GA inhibition of Hsp90 also led to IKK autophagic degradation and NFkappaB inhibition in both HTLV-transformed T cells and ATL-derived cell lines. Importantly, GA treatment led to efficient apoptosis of these malignant cells, whereas inhibition of autophagic degradation of IKK significantly ameliorated the cytotoxic effect of GA. These findings thus not only provide mechanistic insights into the tumor suppression function of autophagy and the anti-tumor activity of GA, but also suggest an immediate therapeutic strategy for ATL and other diseases associated with NFkappaB activation by targeting autophagic degradation of the central NFkappaB activating kinases.","['Yan, Pengrong', 'Qing, Guoliang', 'Qu, Zhaoxia', 'Wu, Chang-Chih', 'Rabson, Arnold', 'Xiao, Gutian']","['Yan P', 'Qing G', 'Qu Z', 'Wu CC', 'Rabson A', 'Xiao G']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Autophagy,Autophagy,101265188,"['0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', 'Z3K3VJ16KU (geldanamycin)']",IM,"['Autophagy/drug effects/*physiology', 'Benzoquinones/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Transformation, Viral/drug effects/*physiology', 'Gene Expression/drug effects/genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic/*therapeutic use', 'Models, Biological', 'NF-kappa B/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism']",2007/08/03 09:00,2008/02/01 09:00,['2007/08/03 09:00'],"['2007/08/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/01 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/03 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Autophagy. 2007 Nov-Dec;3(6):600-3. doi: 10.4161/auto.4761.

Here we assessed the effects of CDDO on CCAAT enhancer-binding protein alpha (CEBPA), a transcription factor critical for granulocytic differentiation. In HL60 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, CDDO (0.01 to 2 muM) induces apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Conversely, subapoptotic doses of CDDO promote phagocytic activity and granulocytic-monocytic differentiation of HL60 cells through increased de novo synthesis of p42 CEBPA protein. CEBPA translational up-regulation is required for CDDO-induced granulocytic differentiation and depends on the integrity of the CEBPA upstream open reading frame (uORF). Moreover, CDDO increases the ratio of transcriptionally active p42 and the inactive p30 CEBPA isoform, which, in turn, leads to transcriptional activation of CEBPA-regulated genes (eg, GSCFR) and is associated with dephosphorylation of eIF2alpha and phosphorylation of eIF4E. In concordance with these results, CDDO induces a CEBPA ratio change and differentiation of primary blasts from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Because AML is characterized by arrested differentiation, our data suggest the inclusion of CDDO in the therapy of AML characterized by dysfunctional CEBPA expression.","['Koschmieder, Steffen', ""D'Alo, Francesco"", 'Radomska, Hanna', 'Schoneich, Christine', 'Chang, Ji Suk', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Kobayashi, Susumu', 'Levantini, Elena', 'Suh, Nanjoo', 'Di Ruscio, Annalisa', 'Voso, Maria Teresa', 'Watt, Julie C', 'Santhanam, Ramasamy', 'Sargin, Bulent', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Sporn, Michael B', 'Perrotti, Danilo', 'Berdel, Wolfgang E', 'Muller-Tidow, Carsten', 'Serve, Hubert', 'Tenen, Daniel G']","['Koschmieder S', ""D'Alo F"", 'Radomska H', 'Schoneich C', 'Chang JS', 'Konopleva M', 'Kobayashi S', 'Levantini E', 'Suh N', 'Di Ruscio A', 'Voso MT', 'Watt JC', 'Santhanam R', 'Sargin B', 'Kantarjian H', 'Andreeff M', 'Sporn MB', 'Perrotti D', 'Berdel WE', 'Muller-Tidow C', 'Serve H', 'Tenen DG']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (2-cyano-3,12-dioxoolean-1,9-dien-28-oic acid)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-2)', '0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E)', '6SMK8R7TGJ (Oleanolic Acid)']",IM,"['CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-2/metabolism', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Genes, abl', 'Granulocytes/*cytology/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Oleanolic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2007/08/03 09:00,2008/01/10 09:00,['2007/08/03 09:00'],"['2007/08/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/03 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Nov 15;110(10):3695-705. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-11-058941.

Mutations in C/EBPalpha occur in 10% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), leading to the expression of a 30-kDa dominant-negative isoform (C/EBPalphap30). In the present study, using a global proteomics approach to identify the target proteins of C/EBPalphap30, we show that Ubc9, an E2-conjugating enzyme essential for sumoylation, is increased in its expression when C/EBPalphap30 is induced. We confirmed the increased expression of Ubc9 in patients with AML with C/EBPalphap30 mutations compared with other subtypes. We further confirmed that the increase of Ubc9 expression was mediated through increased transcription. Furthermore, we show that Ubc9-mediated enhanced sumoylation of C/EBPalphap42 decreases the transactivation capacity on a minimal C/EBPalpha promoter. Importantly, overexpression of C/EBPalphap30 in granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-stimulated human CD34(+) cells leads to a differentiation block, which was overcome by the siRNA-mediated silencing of Ubc9. In summary, our data indicate that Ubc9 is an important C/EBPalphap30 target through which C/EBPalphap30 enhances the sumoylation of C/EBPalphap42 to inhibit granulocytic differentiation.","['Geletu, Mulu', 'Balkhi, Mumtaz Y', 'Peer Zada, Abdul A', 'Christopeit, Maximilian', 'Pulikkan, John A', 'Trivedi, Arun K', 'Tenen, Daniel G', 'Behre, Gerhard']","['Geletu M', 'Balkhi MY', 'Peer Zada AA', 'Christopeit M', 'Pulikkan JA', 'Trivedi AK', 'Tenen DG', 'Behre G']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (CEBPA protein, human)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', 'EC 2.3.2.23 (Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC9)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes, Dominant/physiology', 'Granulocytes/cytology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Lysine/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Mutant Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/*genetics', 'Receptors, Estrogen/genetics', 'SUMO-1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes/*genetics', '*Up-Regulation']",2007/08/03 09:00,2007/12/14 09:00,['2007/08/03 09:00'],"['2007/08/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/03 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Nov 1;110(9):3301-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-01-071035.

We have identified 2 sites within the PU.1 enhancer that strongly bind C/EBPalpha in a gel shift assay, and interaction with endogenous C/EBPalpha was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Mutation of these DNA elements reduced activity of a distal enhancer-promoter construct 2- or 5-fold in a myeloid cell line, while mutation of a weaker C/EBPalpha-binding site located in the promoter minimally reduced activity in this context. These findings strengthen the link between C/EBPalpha and PU.1 expression. Reduction of C/EBPalpha activity in cases of acute myeloid leukemia may therefore contribute to transformation by reducing PU.1 levels. In addition, induction of PU.1 by C/EBPalpha during normal hematopoiesis may contribute to stem cell commitment to the myeloid lineages and further commitment to monopoiesis.

Here, we identified a specific subgroup of AML, defined by an expression profile resembling that of AMLs with mutations in the myeloid transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha), while lacking such mutations. We found that in these leukemias, the CEBPA gene was silenced, which was associated with frequent promoter hypermethylation. The leukemias phenotypically showed aberrant expression of T-cell genes, of which CD7 was most consistent. We identified 2 mechanisms that may contribute to this phenotype. First, absence of Cebpa led to up-regulation of specific T-cell transcripts (ie, Cd7 and Lck) in hematopoietic stem cells isolated from conditional Cebpa knockout mice.

Mutations that result in constitutive activation of RAS proteins are associated with approximately 30% of all human cancers; however, different RAS oncogenes are preferentially associated with different types of human cancer. In myeloid malignancies, NRAS mutations are more frequent than KRAS mutations, whereas HRAS mutations are rare. The mechanism underlying the different frequencies of RAS isoforms mutated in myeloid leukemia is not known. In this study, we compared the leukemogenic potential of activated NRAS, KRAS, and HRAS in the same bone marrow transduction/transplantation model system.

One issue related to trials of the clinical lead inhibitor, D-1-methyl-tryptophan (D-1MT), concerns the extent of its biochemical specificity for IDO. Here, we report the discovery of a novel IDO-related tryptophan catabolic enzyme termed IDO2 that is preferentially inhibited by D-1MT. IDO2 is not as widely expressed as IDO but like its relative is also expressed in antigen-presenting dendritic cells where tryptophan catabolism drives immune tolerance. We identified two common genetic polymorphisms in the human gene encoding IDO2 that ablate its enzymatic activity. Like IDO, IDO2 catabolizes tryptophan, triggers phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2alpha, and (reported here for the first time) mobilizes translation of LIP, an inhibitory isoform of the immune regulatory transcription factor NF-IL6. Tryptophan restoration switches off this signaling pathway when activated by IDO, but not IDO2, arguing that IDO2 has a distinct signaling role. Our findings have implications for understanding the evolution of tumoral immune tolerance and for interpreting preclinical and clinical responses to D-1MT or other IDO inhibitors being developed to treat cancer, chronic infection, and other diseases.","['Metz, Richard', 'Duhadaway, James B', 'Kamasani, Uma', 'Laury-Kleintop, Lisa', 'Muller, Alexander J', 'Prendergast, George C']","['Metz R', 'Duhadaway JB', 'Kamasani U', 'Laury-Kleintop L', 'Muller AJ', 'Prendergast GC']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta)', '0 (Indoleamine-Pyrrole 2,3,-Dioxygenase)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '8DUH1N11BX (Tryptophan)', 'EC 1.13.11.11 (Tryptophan Oxygenase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta/metabolism', 'Dendritic Cells/drug effects/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Indoleamine-Pyrrole 2,3,-Dioxygenase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Tryptophan/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Tryptophan Oxygenase/*antagonists & inhibitors']",2007/08/03 09:00,2007/09/12 09:00,['2007/08/03 09:00'],"['2007/08/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/03 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2007 Aug 1;67(15):7082-7. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-1872.,"['67/15/7082 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-1872 [doi]']",,"['Lankenau Institute for Medical Research, Wynnewood, Pennsylvania 19096, USA.']","['CA100123/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA10954/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA82222/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we have applied lac operator array systems to study the effects of X-RARalpha versus wild-type RARalpha on large-scale chromatin structure. The targeting of these enhanced cyan fluorescent protein-lac repressor-tagged RARalpha-containing proteins to the gene-amplification chromosomal region by lac operator repeats led to local chromatin condensation, recruitment of nuclear receptor corepressor, and histone deacetylase complex. The addition of retinoic acid (RA) induced large-scale chromatin decondensation in cells expressing RARalpha; however, cells expressing X-RARalpha, especially PML-RARalpha, demonstrated insensitive response to this effect of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). Although we did not reveal differences in RA-dependent colocalization of either silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid or steroid receptor coactivator (SRC)-1 with RARalpha versus X-RARalpha, the hormone-independent association between SRC-1 and X-RARalpha on the array has been identified. Rather, compared with cells expressing RARalpha, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching of live transfected cells, demonstrated decreased mobility of SRC-1 on the X-RARalpha-bound chromatin. Thus, the impaired ability of APL fusion proteins to activate gene transcription in response to ATRA corresponds to their reduced ability to remodel chromatin, which may link to their ability to impair the mobility of key nuclear receptor coregulators.","['Qiu, Jihui', 'Huang, Ying', 'Chen, Guoqiang', 'Chen, Zhu', 'Tweardy, David J', 'Dong, Shuo']","['Qiu J', 'Huang Y', 'Chen G', 'Chen Z', 'Tweardy DJ', 'Dong S']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Biol Cell,Molecular biology of the cell,9201390,"['0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Cyan Fluorescent Protein)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (NCOR2 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 2)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (yellow fluorescent protein, Bacteria)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Histone Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (NCOA1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Nuclear Receptor Coactivator 1)']",IM,"['Bacterial Proteins/metabolism', '*Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Histone Acetyltransferases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Luminescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 2', 'Nuclear Receptor Coactivator 1', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*metabolism', 'Operator Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",2007/08/03 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2007/08/03 09:00'],"['2007/08/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/03 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Biol Cell. 2007 Oct;18(10):3941-51. doi: 10.1091/mbc.e07-03-0245.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The antileukemia activity of FI-700 was evaluated in human leukemia cell lines, mutant or wild-type (Wt)-FLT3-expressing mouse myeloid precursor cell line, 32D and primary acute myeloid leukemia cells, and in xenograft or syngeneic mouse leukemia models. RESULTS: FI-700 showed a potent IC(50) value against FLT3 kinase at 20 nmol/L in an in vitro kinase assay. FI-700 showed selective growth inhibition against mutant FLT3-expressing leukemia cell lines and primary acute myeloid leukemia cells, whereas it did not affect the FLT3 ligand (FL)-driven growth of Wt-FLT3-expressing cells. These antileukemia activities were induced by the significant dephosphorylations of mutant FLT3 and STAT5, which resulted in G(1) arrest of the cell cycle. Oral administration of FI-700 induced the regression of tumors in a s.c. tumor xenograft model and increased the survival of mice in an i.v. transplanted model. Furthermore, FI-700 treatment eradicated FLT3/ITD-expressing leukemia cells, both in the peripheral blood and in the bone marrow. In this experiment, the depletion of FLT3/ITD-expressing cells by FI-700 was more significant than that of Ara-C, whereas bone marrow suppression by FI-700 was lower than that by Ara-C.

WT1 class I peptide epitopes that were identified and shown to stimulate CD8(+) T cells are being tested as vaccine candidates in several clinical trials. The induction and maintenance of a robust memory CD8(+) cytotoxic T-cell response requires CD4(+) T-cell help. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Three HLA class II peptide epitopes of WT1 with high predictive affinities to multiple HLA-DRB1 molecules were identified using the SYFPEITHI algorithm. Due to the highly polymorphic nature of the HLA class II alleles, such reactivity is critical in the development of a broadly useful therapeutic. One of the WT1 CD4(+) peptide epitopes, 122-140, comprises a previously identified CD8(+) peptide epitope (126-134). By mutating residue 126 from an arginine to a tyrosine, we embedded a synthetic immunogenic analogue CD8(+) epitope (126-134) inside the longer peptide (122-140). This analogue was previously designed to improve immunogenicity and induce a potent CD8(+) response. RESULTS: WT1 peptides 328-349 and 423-441 are able to stimulate a peptide-specific CD4(+) response that can recognize WT1(+) tumor cells in multiple HLA-DRB1 settings as determined by IFN-gamma enzyme-linked immunospot assays. The mutated WT1 peptide epitope 122-140 is able to induce CD4(+) and cytotoxic CD8(+) WT1-specific T-cell responses that can recognize the native WT1 epitopes on the surface of human WT1(+) cancer cells. Cross-priming experiments showed that antigen-presenting cells pulsed with either mesothelioma or leukemia tumor lysates can process and present each of the CD4(+) peptides identified. CONCLUSIONS: These studies provide the rationale for using the WT1 CD4(+) peptides in conjunction with CD8(+) peptide epitopes to vaccinate patients with WT1-expressing cancers.","['May, Rena J', 'Dao, Tao', 'Pinilla-Ibarz, Javier', 'Korontsvit, Tatyana', 'Zakhaleva, Victoriya', 'Zhang, Rong H', 'Maslak, Peter', 'Scheinberg, David A']","['May RJ', 'Dao T', 'Pinilla-Ibarz J', 'Korontsvit T', 'Zakhaleva V', 'Zhang RH', 'Maslak P', 'Scheinberg DA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Epitopes)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DRB1 Chains)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '0R0008Q3JB (Chromium)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chromium/metabolism', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology/metabolism', 'Epitopes/genetics/*immunology', 'HLA-DR Antigens/metabolism', 'HLA-DRB1 Chains', 'Humans', 'Immunization', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Leukemia/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Mesothelioma/immunology/*pathology/therapy', 'Peptide Fragments/genetics/*immunology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*drug effects/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/immunology/pathology', 'WT1 Proteins/genetics/*immunology/metabolism']",2007/08/03 09:00,2007/10/30 09:00,['2007/08/03 09:00'],"['2007/08/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/30 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/03 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2007 Aug 1;13(15 Pt 1):4547-55. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-0708.,"['13/15/4547 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-0708 [doi]']",,"['Molecular Pharmacology and Chemistry Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021, USA.']","['F32-CA119479A/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 23766/PHS HHS/United States', 'R01 CA55349/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Clin Cancer Res. 2007 Sep 1;13(17):5226'],,,,,,,

Orthotopic KU-19-19 human bladder tumors exposed to intravesically administered RCR vectors exhibited 3%, 85 +/- 1.0%, and 100% of GFP expression at 7, 21, and 35 days after exposure, respectively. GFP staining was observed only in the tumor cells in the bladder. No detectable PCR products of GFP gene could be observed in distant organs. Treatment with RCR vectors containing yeast cytosine deaminase (CD) gene plus 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC) dramatically inhibited the growth of preestablished murine bladder tumor-2 tumors. A single course of 5-FC treatment resulted in a 50% animal survival in mice exposed to RCR-CD compared with a 0% survival in all controls over a 70-day follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: Intravesically administered RCR vectors can efficiently deliver genes to orthotopic bladder tumor without viral spread in distant organs. RCR-CD/5-FC suicide gene therapy promises to be a novel and potentially therapeutic modality for bladder cancer.","['Kikuchi, Eiji', 'Menendez, Silvia', 'Ozu, Choichiro', 'Ohori, Makoto', 'Cordon-Cardo, Carlos', 'Logg, Christopher R', 'Kasahara, Noriyuki', 'Bochner, Bernard H']","['Kikuchi E', 'Menendez S', 'Ozu C', 'Ohori M', 'Cordon-Cardo C', 'Logg CR', 'Kasahara N', 'Bochner BH']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antimetabolites)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'D83282DT06 (Flucytosine)', 'EC 3.5.4.1 (Cytosine Deaminase)']",IM,"['Administration, Intravesical', 'Animals', 'Antimetabolites/administration & dosage', 'Cytosine Deaminase/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Flucytosine/administration & dosage', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Genetic Vectors/*therapeutic use', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Nude', 'Plasmids', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Survival Rate', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Transgenes/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/genetics/*therapy', 'Virus Replication']",2007/08/03 09:00,2007/10/30 09:00,['2007/08/03 09:00'],"['2007/08/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/30 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/03 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2007 Aug 1;13(15 Pt 1):4511-8. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-0151.,"['13/15/4511 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-0151 [doi]']",,"['Departments of Urology and Pathology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021, USA']","['P01 CA59318/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA105171/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a phase I study of flavopiridol followed by 1-beta-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C) and mitoxantrone, overall response rate for adults with relapsed and refractory acute myelogenous leukemias (AML) was 31%. We have now completed a phase II study of sequential flavopiridol, ara-C, and mitoxantrone in 62 adults with poor-risk AML. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Flavopiridol (50 mg/m(2)) was given by 1-h infusion daily x 3 beginning day 1 followed by 2 gm/m(2)/72 h ara-C beginning day 6 and 40 mg/m(2) mitoxantrone on day 9. RESULTS: Flavopiridol caused a > or =50% decrease in peripheral blood blasts in 44% by median day 2 and > or =80% decrease in 26% by day 3. Self-limited tumor lysis occurred in 53%. Three (5%) died during therapy (2 multiorgan failure and 1 fungal pneumonia). Complete remissions (CR) were achieved in 12 of 15 (75%) newly diagnosed secondary AML, 18 of 24 (75%) first relapse after short CR (median CR, 9 months, including prior allotransplant), and 2 of 13 (15%) primary refractory but 0 of 10 multiply refractory AML. Disease-free survival for all CR patients is 40% at 2 years, with newly diagnosed patients having a 2-year disease-free survival of 50%. CONCLUSIONS: Flavopiridol has anti-AML activity directly and in combination with ara-C and mitoxantrone. This timed sequential regimen induces durable CRs in a significant proportion of adults with newly diagnosed secondary AML (including complex cytogenetics) and adults with AML in first relapse after short first CR.","['Karp, Judith E', 'Smith, B Douglas', 'Levis, Mark J', 'Gore, Steven D', 'Greer, Jacqueline', 'Hattenburg, Catherine', 'Briel, Janet', 'Jones, Richard J', 'Wright, John J', 'Colevas, A Dimitri']","['Karp JE', 'Smith BD', 'Levis MJ', 'Gore SD', 'Greer J', 'Hattenburg C', 'Briel J', 'Jones RJ', 'Wright JJ', 'Colevas AD']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Piperidines)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '45AD6X575G (alvocidib)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Flavonoids/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/drug therapy/pathology', 'Piperidines/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Survival Rate']",2007/08/03 09:00,2007/10/30 09:00,['2007/08/03 09:00'],"['2007/08/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/30 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/03 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2007 Aug 1;13(15 Pt 1):4467-73. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-0381.,"['13/15/4467 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-0381 [doi]']",,"['Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, Maryland 21231-1000, USA. jkarp2@jhmi.edu']","['M01-RR0052/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA70095/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report that oligodendrocyte apoptosis is regulated oppositely by c-Jun N-terminal kinase 3 (JNK3) and protein interacting with the mitotic kinase, never in mitosis A I (Pin1), the actions of which converge on myeloid cell leukemia sequence-1 (Mcl-1). Activated after injury, JNK3 induces cytochrome c release by facilitating the degradation of Mcl-1, the stability of which is maintained in part by Pin1. Pin1 binds Mcl-1 at its constitutively phosphorylated site, Thr163Pro, and stabilizes it by inhibiting ubiquitination. After injury JNK3 phosphorylates Mcl-1 at Ser121Pro, facilitating the dissociation of Pin1 from Mcl-1. JNK3 thus induces Mcl-1 degradation by counteracting the protective binding of Pin1. These results are confirmed by the opposing phenotypes observed between JNK3-/- and Pin1-/- mice: oligodendrocyte apoptosis and cytochrome c release are reduced in JNK3-/- but elevated in Pin1-/- mice. This report thus unveils a mechanism by which cytochrome c release is under the opposite control of JNK3 and Pin1, regulators for which the activities are intricately coupled.","['Li, Qi Ming', 'Tep, Chhavy', 'Yune, Tae Y', 'Zhou, Xiao Zhen', 'Uchida, Takafumi', 'Lu, Kun Ping', 'Yoon, Sung Ok']","['Li QM', 'Tep C', 'Yune TY', 'Zhou XZ', 'Uchida T', 'Lu KP', 'Yoon SO']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Neurosci,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,8102140,"['0 (NIMA-Interacting Peptidylprolyl Isomerase)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 10)', 'EC 5.2.1.8 (Peptidylprolyl Isomerase)', 'EC 5.2.1.8 (Pin1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 10/deficiency/genetics/*physiology', 'NIMA-Interacting Peptidylprolyl Isomerase', 'Oligodendroglia/cytology/*enzymology/pathology', 'Peptidylprolyl Isomerase/deficiency/genetics/*physiology', 'Spinal Cord Injuries/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Ubiquitin/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",2007/08/03 09:00,2007/08/29 09:00,['2007/08/03 09:00'],"['2007/08/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/29 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/03 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Neurosci. 2007 Aug 1;27(31):8395-404. doi: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2478-07.2007.,"['27/31/8395 [pii]', '10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2478-07.2007 [doi]']",,"['Center for Molecular Neurobiology and Department of Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, USA.']","['R01 AG022082/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS039472/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS039472-04/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS 39472/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,PMC3401937,,,,,,,,['NIHMS91785'],,,,,,,,,

This paper describes the relationship between HSV-1 genomes and ND10 in human fibroblasts that maintain the viral genomes in a quiescent state. We report that quiescent HSV-1 genomes detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) are associated with enlarged ND10-like structures, frequently such that the FISH-defined viral foci are apparently enveloped within a sphere of PML and other ND10 proteins. The number of FISH viral foci in each quiescently infected cell is concordant with the input multiplicity of infection, with each structure containing no more than a small number of viral genomes. A proportion of the enlarged ND10-like foci in quiescently infected cells contain accumulations of the heterochromatin protein HP1 but not other common markers of heterochromatin such as histone H3 di- or trimethylated on lysine residue 9. Many of the virally induced enlarged ND10-like structures also contain concentrations of conjugated ubiquitin. Quiescent infections can be established in cells that are highly depleted for PML. However, during the initial stages of establishment of a quiescent infection in such cells, other ND10 proteins (Sp100, hDaxx, and ATRX) are recruited into virally induced foci that are likely to be associated with HSV-1 genomes. These observations illustrate that the intimate connections between HSV-1 genomes and ND10 that occur during lytic infection also extend to quiescent infections.","['Everett, Roger D', 'Murray, Jill', 'Orr, Anne', 'Preston, Chris M']","['Everett RD', 'Murray J', 'Orr A', 'Preston CM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,['0 (Nuclear Proteins)'],IM,"['Cell Nucleus/pathology/ultrastructure/*virology', 'Fibroblasts/pathology/*virology', '*Genome, Viral', 'Herpes Simplex', 'Herpesvirus 1, Human/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism']",2007/08/03 09:00,2008/01/09 09:00,['2007/08/03 09:00'],"['2007/08/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/09 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/03 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2007 Oct;81(20):10991-1004. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00705-07.

Surgical treatment typically involves resection of endoventricular fibrosis and atrioventricular valve replacement. However, little is known of the clinicopathological behaviour and perioperative course of this disease in the early stages. Mitral valve repair seemingly offers an attractive surgical option in this scenario as it avoids prosthetic thrombosis--a recognized late complication of this disease. This was attempted in conjunction with left ventricular thrombectomy in a patient with acute hypereosinophilia and congestive heart failure associated with severe mitral regurgitation and restrictive cardiomyopathy. Although the early clinical and echocardiographic outcome was excellent, the patient deteriorated rapidly after 3 months when identical pathology relapsed in the left heart causing recurrent severe mitral regurgitation and heart failure. Cardiac function improved markedly following a redo bioprosthetic mitral valve replacement. Prosthetic valve function remained satisfactory until death occurred 2 months later from refractory acute lymphocytic leukaemia. Rapid disease recurrence jeopardizing a conserved mitral valve in acute eosinophilic endomyocarditis cautions against surgical repair despite its many advantages. A bioprosthesis is associated with reduced thrombotic complications and may be the treatment of choice for this rare pathology.","['Tang, Augustine', 'Karski, Jacek', 'Butany, Jagdish', 'David, Tirone']","['Tang A', 'Karski J', 'Butany J', 'David T']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Interact Cardiovasc Thorac Surg,Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgery,101158399,,,,2007/08/03 09:00,2007/08/03 09:01,['2007/08/03 09:00'],"['2007/08/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/03 09:01 [medline]', '2007/08/03 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Interact Cardiovasc Thorac Surg. 2004 Jun;3(2):406-8. doi: 10.1016/j.icvts.2004.02.018.,"['3/2/406 [pii]', '10.1016/j.icvts.2004.02.018 [doi]']",,"['Division of Cardiovascular Surgery, Toronto General Hospital, 200 Elizabeth Street, Toronto, Ont., Canada ON M5G 2C4. gus@tang-family.org']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report three TS patients with leukemia including one case of T-large granular lymphocyte leukemia (T-LGL), one rare case of coexistence of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and idiopathic myelofibrosis (IMF) and one case of a patient with AML-M2 who received autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT). T-LGL and coexistence of CLL and IMF associated with TS are reported for the first time while the last case represents the first report of SCT in a leukemia patient with TS. Our cases and the limited data of previously reported leukemia patients with TS suggest that TS is not associated with a specific type of leukemia and that presentation, clinical course and response to treatment are similar to that of the non-TS leukemia patients. However, these patients may have a higher risk of liver complications. Interestingly, in the mosaic TS patients, the abnormal clones were restricted to the monosomic 45,X cells, indicating that the leukemic clones possibly originate from the monosomic cell line. Even in cases with no additional chromosome abnormalities, the ratio of X/XX cells in bone marrow cells was significantly increased compared to that in constitutional karyotype, indicating that monosomic cells possibly provide a survival advantage for leukemia cells or that reduced programmed cell death may be responsible for the expansion of the monosomic cells.","['Manola, Kalliopi N', 'Sambani, Constantina', 'Karakasis, Dimitris', 'Kalliakosta, Georgia', 'Harhalakis, Nicholas', 'Papaioannou, Maria']","['Manola KN', 'Sambani C', 'Karakasis D', 'Kalliakosta G', 'Harhalakis N', 'Papaioannou M']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,,IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/complications', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications', 'Middle Aged', 'Monosomy', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Turner Syndrome/*complications']",2007/08/03 09:00,2008/05/07 09:00,['2007/08/03 09:00'],"['2007/04/03 00:00 [received]', '2007/05/31 00:00 [revised]', '2007/06/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/08/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/03 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2008 Mar;32(3):481-6. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2007.06.004.

Magnetic resonance imaging showed signs of diffuse infiltration into the subcutaneous tissue and the muscles of the left leg; a biopsy study of one of the subcutaneous nodules revealed a lymphoid infiltration by large B-cells. In this patient, the injury to the left peroneal nerve was probably secondary to a lymphoid infiltration of the nerve from adjacent infiltrated soft tissues. CONCLUSION: Peripheral neuropathy due to direct infiltration can be a neurological complication of CLL that has not be reported to date, but which is known to occur in other lymphoproliferative processes.","['Escolar, E', 'Garcia-Vela, J', 'Aladro, Y', 'Martinez-Menendez, B', 'Martin, A']","['Escolar E', 'Garcia-Vela J', 'Aladro Y', 'Martinez-Menendez B', 'Martin A']",['spa'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Spain,Rev Neurol,Revista de neurologia,7706841,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Chronic Disease', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*complications/genetics/pathology', 'Nervous System Diseases/*etiology/genetics/pathology']",2007/08/02 09:00,2008/02/13 09:00,['2007/08/02 09:00'],"['2007/08/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/13 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/02 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Rev Neurol. 2007 Aug 16-31;45(4):233-5.,['rn2007302 [pii]'],,"['Servicio de Neurologia, Hospital Universitario de Getafe, 28905 Getafe, Espana. escolaredu@hotmail.com']",,,,,,,,,Mononeuropatia en la leucemia linfatica cronica.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to frequent mutations in the Flt3 gene in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), Flt3 is regarded as a potential therapeutic target, but the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. Therefore, we investigated interactions of Flt3 and some Src family tyrosine kinases (SFKs), which are expressed predominantly or exclusively in hematopoietic cells and known to be involved in signal transduction by various RTKs. Employing sets of wt and mutant Flt3 and Hck, we analyzed protein binding as well as Flt3 phosphorylation and maturation in HEK-293 cells cotransfected with expression constructs encoding both binding partners. Kinase-inactive Hck-K269R was recruited to phosphotyrosine residues located in the juxtamembrane (JM) region of activated Flt3 via its SH2 domain. Several of the JM domain tyrosines were phophorylated by Hck and other SFKs. As apparent from the distribution of mature and hypoglycosylated Flt3, SFKs interfered with Flt3 maturation in a kinase-dependent manner. Together, these findings show a complex role of SFKs in Flt3 signaling and reveal a new function of SFKs in the maturation of RTKs.","['Mitina, Olga', 'Warmuth, Markus', 'Krause, Gunter', 'Hallek, Michael', 'Obermeier, Axel']","['Mitina O', 'Warmuth M', 'Krause G', 'Hallek M', 'Obermeier A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (HCK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-hck)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",IM,"['Cell Growth Processes/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Hematopoiesis/physiology', 'Humans', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-hck/metabolism', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Transfection', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*metabolism', 'src-Family Kinases/*metabolism']",2007/08/02 09:00,2007/12/07 09:00,['2007/08/02 09:00'],"['2007/04/25 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/08/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/02 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2007 Nov;86(11):777-85. doi: 10.1007/s00277-007-0344-0.

Herein, we investigated the mechanisms whereby small molecule Cox-2 selective inhibitors, SC-58125 (a Celebrex analog) and CAY10404 blunt survival of human B-cell lymphomas and chronic lymphocytic leukemia B-cells. SC-58125 and OSU03012 (a Celebrex analog that lacks Cox-2 inhibitory activity) both decreased intracellular glutathione (GSH) content in malignant human B-cells, as well as in Cox-2 deficient mouse B-cells. This new finding supports Cox-2 independent effects of SC-58125. Interestingly, SC-58125 also significantly increased B-cell reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, suggesting that ROS are a pathway that reduces malignant cell survival. Addition of GSH ethyl ester protected B lymphomas from the increased mitochondrial membrane permeability and reduced survival induced by SC-58125. Moreover, the SC-58125-mediated GSH depletion resulted in elevated steady-state levels of the glutamate cysteine ligase catalytic subunit mRNA and protein. These new findings of increased ROS and diminished GSH levels following SC-58125 exposure support novel mechanisms whereby a Cox-2 selective inhibitor reduces malignant B-cell survival. These observations also support the concept that certain Cox-2 selective inhibitors may have therapeutic value in combination with other drugs to kill malignant B lineage cells.","['Ryan, Elizabeth P', 'Bushnell, Timothy P', 'Friedman, Alan E', 'Rahman, Irfan', 'Phipps, Richard P']","['Ryan EP', 'Bushnell TP', 'Friedman AE', 'Rahman I', 'Phipps RP']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (3-(4-methylsulfonylphenyl)-4-phenyl-5-trifluoromethylisoxazole)', '0 (Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors)', '0 (Isoxazoles)', '0 (OSU 03012)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (Sulfones)', '162054-19-5', '(1-((4-methylsulfonyl)phenyl)-3-trifluoromethyl-5-(4-fluorophenyl)pyrazole)', '7W95D60F4J (S-ethyl glutathione)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'EC 6.3.2.2 (Glutamate-Cysteine Ligase)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Catalytic Domain/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclooxygenase 2/deficiency/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Glutamate-Cysteine Ligase/drug effects/genetics', 'Glutathione/analogs & derivatives/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Isoxazoles/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects', 'Pyrazoles/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/drug effects/genetics', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'Sulfones/pharmacology']",2007/08/02 09:00,2008/08/30 09:00,['2007/08/02 09:00'],"['2007/03/19 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/08/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/02 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2008 Mar;57(3):347-58. doi: 10.1007/s00262-007-0374-4.

Therefore, there is an urgent need for novel drugs with improved efficacy against tumor cells and with less toxicity on normal cells. Artesunate (ART), a powerful anti-malarial herbal compound, has been shown to inhibit growth of various tumor cell lines in vitro and of xenografted Kaposi's sarcoma in mice in vivo. However, the molecular mechanisms by which ART exerts its cytotoxicity have not been elucidated. The ART-class of anti-malarial compounds is attractive due to their activity against multidrug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax strains. Another salient feature of these compounds is the lack of severe side effects in malaria patients. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, we used T-cell leukemias as a model system to study the molecular mechanisms of ART-induced apoptosis. The most typical anticancer drugs are DNA intercalators such as Doxorubicin. To investigate drug sensitivity and resistance, we chose a Doxorubicin-resistant leukemia cell line and investigated the killing effect of ART on these cells. We show that ART induces apoptosis in leukemic T cells mainly through the mitochondrial pathway via generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), a mechanism different from Doxorubicin. This is confirmed by the fact that the antioxidant N-Acetyle-Cysteine (NAC) could completely block ROS generation and, consequently, inhibited ART-induced apoptosis. Therefore, ART can overcome the Doxorubicin-resistance and induce the Doxorubicin-resistant leukemia cells to undergo apoptosis. We also show that ART can synergize with Doxorubicin to enhance apoptotic cell death in leukemic T cells. This synergistic effect can be largely explained by the fact that ART and Doxorubicin use different killing mechanisms. CONCLUSIONS: Our studies raise the possibility to develop ART in combination with other established anticancer drugs which induce apoptosis through the pathways or mechanisms different from ART.","['Efferth, Thomas', 'Giaisi, Marco', 'Merling, Annette', 'Krammer, Peter H', 'Li-Weber, Min']","['Efferth T', 'Giaisi M', 'Merling A', 'Krammer PH', 'Li-Weber M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antimalarials)', '0 (Artemisinins)', '0 (Free Radical Scavengers)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '60W3249T9M (Artesunate)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Antimalarials/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Artemisinins/*pharmacology', 'Artesunate', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*physiology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Free Radical Scavengers/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism']",2007/08/02 09:00,2007/08/02 09:01,['2007/08/02 09:00'],"['2007/02/27 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/08/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/02 09:01 [medline]', '2007/08/02 09:00 [entrez]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2007 Aug 1;2(8):e693. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0000693.,['10.1371/journal.pone.0000693 [doi]'],,"['Pharmaceutical Biology of Natural Products, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.']",,,,,,20070801,PMC1933253,,,,,,,['NLM: Original DateCompleted: 20070806'],,,,,,,,,,

Because autologous serum was unavailable in these cases, we used allogeneic serum eye drops as an alternate option for treating their ocular surface disease. Both donors had serologic tests performed before donation. Use of the allogeneic serum eye drops had a beneficial clinical effect, with marked attenuation of the patients' symptoms.

In this retrospective study, 353 children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia treated with high-dose methotrexate according to the Nordic Society of Pediatric Haematology and Oncology-92 acute lymphoblastic leukaemia protocol were studied. Data from 18 patients with a subsequent central nervous system relapse and 335 event-free patients were available. In 34 patients the methotrexate concentrations were monitored repeatedly during each 24-h methotrexate intravenous infusion and a cerebrospinal fluid sample was taken at the end of the infusion. Using statistics separating interindividual and intraindividual variability, methotrexate concentration in cerebrospinal fluid was found to be significantly dependent upon both serum concentrations at the end of infusion and the area under the concentration curve in serum (P<0.0017 and <0.002, respectively). The logistic regression analysis revealed that high patient median serum methotrexate concentrations at the end of infusion were significantly associated with decreased risk for a central nervous system relapse in the standard risk group (P=0.02) and the number of courses with a calculated cerebrospinal fluid concentration of more than 1 mumol/l (P=0.048) with a decreased risk of a central nervous system relapse in the combined (standard risk and intermediate) risk group. In conclusion, methotrexate concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid are dependent on methotrexate concentrations in serum and serum area under the concentration curve.

The diagnostic utility of DBA.44, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) and of the recently propagated Annexin A1 is limited in this diagnostic setting since DBA.44 does not always label all HCL cells, TRAP is frequently weakly expressed whereas the numerous Annexin A1-positive hematopoietic cells interfere with the immunohistochemical recognition of sparse HCL cells. Therefore, we searched for antibodies suitable for the identification of minimal HCL infiltrates in formalin-fixed bone marrow trephines. Among the antibodies tested those directed against the T-cell associated transcription factor T-bet showed the required specificity: (1) T-bet is highly expressed in all 85 cases of HCL including 31 cases showing only minimal infiltrates, and (2) T-bet is exclusively expressed only on a subset of reactive T cells which are rare in bone marrow. Although T-bet is also weakly expressed in a proportion of the tumor cells of some small B-cell lymphomas (n=32/69) other than HCL, a reliable distinction is nevertheless easily possible because (1) T-bet is strongly expressed by all hairy cells of all HCL cases and (2) T-bet is not coexpressed in HCL with markers typical for other small B-cell lymphomas/leukemias (ie, CD23, CD5, CD10, and/or BCL6). Therefore, the immunohistochemical detection of T-bet in infiltrated bone marrow trephines represents an important adjunct for the diagnosis of HCL.","['Johrens, Korinna', 'Stein, Harald', 'Anagnostopoulos, Ioannis']","['Johrens K', 'Stein H', 'Anagnostopoulos I']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (T-Box Domain Proteins)', '0 (T-box transcription factor TBX21)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Examination/methods', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/pathology', 'T-Box Domain Proteins/*metabolism']",2007/08/02 09:00,2007/09/12 09:00,['2007/08/02 09:00'],"['2007/08/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/02 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Surg Pathol. 2007 Aug;31(8):1181-5. doi: 10.1097/PAS.0b013e318031045b.,"['10.1097/PAS.0b013e318031045b [doi]', '00000478-200708000-00006 [pii]']",,"['Consultation and Reference Center for Hematopathology at the Institute of Pathology, Charite Campus Benjamin Franklin, Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Germany. korinna.joehrens@charite.de']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, immunotoxins were developed to target CD123 only, which bypasses the dependence on other subunits to form intact IL-3R. Three anti-CD123 hybridomas (26292, 32701, and 32716) were selected on the basis of their affinity for CD123. Total RNAs were extracted from the 3 anti-CD123 hybridomas and used to clone the fragment of variable region (Fvs). The Fvs were assembled into single chain Fvs and fused to a 38-kd fragment of Pseudomonas exotoxin A to make recombinant immunotoxins. 26292(Fv)-PE38 was found to have the highest cytotoxic activity on the CD123 expressing leukemia cell line TF-1. It bound the cells with a kd of 3.5 nM. Another immunotoxin, 32716(Fv)-PE38, belonging to a different epitope group, had a similar binding ability but was less active, demonstrating the role of epitope selection in immunotoxin action.

The cases were diverse clinically and microscopically, fell short of the criteria necessary for a diagnosis of classical Sweet's syndrome, and were difficult to categorize at the outset. The systemic manifestations ranged from malaise alone to a combination of fever, chills, night sweats, and polyarthralgia. The clinical morphology of the cutaneous eruptions varied from being papulovesicular in 1 patient to mainly consisting of erythematous plaques and nodules in the remainder. The dermatologists' differential diagnoses included Sweet's syndrome in 3 cases, a drug eruption in 2, and other entities such as erythema nodosum and Well's syndrome. Biopsies in all cases revealed a dermal and/or subcutaneous infiltrate composed predominantly of mononuclear histiocytoid cells of myeloid origin. With the benefit of detailed clinicopathologic correlation, the cases were classified for the purpose of this report as follows: Sweet's-like neutrophilic dermatosis, histiocytoid (3 cases); subcutaneous Sweet's syndrome, histiocytoid (2 cases); histiocytoid neutrophilic dermatosis, unspecified (1 case). In addition, we describe a further instructive case that exhibited overlap with those in the series but proved ultimately to represent leukemia cutis.

The most commonly used techniques for MRD detection are qualitative and quantitative PCR methods, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), and cytogenetic analysis, which are often performed complementary in order to assess more precisely MRD. Here, we describe the most used sensitive real-time reverse-transcription (RT)-PCR methods for chronic and acute myeloid disorders. Besides protocols for real-time RT-PCR and multiplex RT-PCR procedures for the most common fusion-gene transcripts in acute and chronic myeloid disorders, methods for detection of disease-specific genetic mutated alterations as FLT3 gene-length mutations, and aberrantly expressed genes as WT1 gene transcripts, are described in detail for daily use.","['Elmaagacli, Ahmet H']",['Elmaagacli AH'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Methods Mol Med,Methods in molecular medicine,101123138,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (CBFbeta-MYH11 fusion protein)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics', 'Genes, Wilms Tumor', 'Genes, abl', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis/pathology/*therapy', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques/*methods', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",2007/08/02 09:00,2007/10/24 09:00,['2007/08/02 09:00'],"['2007/08/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/24 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/02 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Methods Mol Med. 2007;134:161-78. doi: 10.1007/978-1-59745-223-6_12.,"['1-59745-223-8:161 [pii]', '10.1007/978-1-59745-223-6_12 [doi]']",,"['Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, University Hospital of Essen, Essen, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to determine the characteristics, and the outcome of RSV infection with or without therapy with aerosolized ribavirin in leukemia patients. DESIGN AND METHODS: We reviewed the records of 52 leukemia patients with RSV infection seen at our institution between October 2000 and March 2005. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 47 years (range, 1-83 years). Most patients were male (65%) and had acute leukemia (65%); 46% had received salvage chemotherapy and 62% corticosteroids before RSV infection. Compared to the 25 patients with upper respiratory tract infection (URI), the 27 patients with pneumonia had a higher median APACHE II score at the time of the first assessment at the hospital for respiratory symptoms (11 vs 16), and a higher rate of corticosteroid treatment in the month preceding the infection (48% vs 74%) (all p < or =0.05). Twenty-four (46%) patients received aerosolized ribavirin. Patients who presented with URI and were treated with ribavirin were less likely than non-treated patients to develop pneumonia (68% vs 96%, p<0.01) and possibly die of pneumonia (6% vs 36%, p=0.1). Multiple logistic regression analysis identified high APACHE II score and lack of ribavirin treatment as independent predictors of progression to pneumonia (p=0.01). Five patients (10%) died within 30 days of RSV infection; all had pneumonia. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: RSV infection is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in leukemia patients; treatment with aerosolized ribavirin at the stage of URI may prevent pneumonia in some subsets of patients.","['Torres, Harrys A', 'Aguilera, Elizabeth A', 'Mattiuzzi, Gloria N', 'Cabanillas, Maria E', 'Rohatgi, Nidhi', 'Sepulveda, Carmen A', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Jiang, Ying', 'Safdar, Amar', 'Raad, Issam I', 'Chemaly, Roy F']","['Torres HA', 'Aguilera EA', 'Mattiuzzi GN', 'Cabanillas ME', 'Rohatgi N', 'Sepulveda CA', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Jiang Y', 'Safdar A', 'Raad II', 'Chemaly RF']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '49717AWG6K (Ribavirin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antiviral Agents/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*complications/drug therapy/virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections/*complications/drug therapy', 'Respiratory Syncytial Viruses/*metabolism', 'Ribavirin/therapeutic use', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors']",2007/08/02 09:00,2008/02/01 09:00,['2007/08/02 09:00'],"['2007/01/24 00:00 [received]', '2007/06/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/08/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/01 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/02 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2007 Sep;92(9):1216-23. doi: 10.3324/haematol.11300.

The underlying mechanisms, illustrated in the text and although quite diverse in different diseases, provide the rationale for new therapeutic strategies combining different NF-kB or proteasome inhibitors.

Genomic aberrations were analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) at various time points during the disease course of 64 CLL patients. Results were correlated with the mutation status of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain variableregion genes (VH) and clinical characteristics. Following a median observation time of 42.3 months (range 23.2-73) after first genetic study, 11 out of the 64 (17%) patients showed clonal evolution with the following newly acquired aberrations: del(17p13) (n=4), del(6q21) (n=3), del(11q23) (n=2), +(8q24) (n=1), and evolution from monoallelic to biallelic del(13q14) (n=3). Interestingly, clonal evolution only occurred among cases with unmutated VH status. The group with clonal evolution showed a higher rate of progression in Binet stage (82% vs. 28%), a possibly greater need for treatment (91% vs. 62% previously untreated patients received their first therapy), and a higher hazard risk of death (HR = 2.97, 95% CI 1.40-6.27, p=0.004) in multivariable analysis. The estimated median survival time after the occurrence of clonal evolution was 21.7 months. Expansion of the clone with del(17p13) was observed in all patients during treatment, indicating in vivo resistance to therapy. In multivariable Andersen-Gill regression analysis, clonal evolution was identified as an independent prognostic factor for overall survival. Clonal evolution only occurred in CLL with unmutated VH indicating to karyotypic instability as a pathomechanism. Acquisition of genomic aberrations was associated with poor outcome based on multivariable analysis. In vivo resistance to chemotherapy of CLL clones with del(17p13) emphasizes the need for alternative treatment approaches in these patients.","['Stilgenbauer, Stephan', 'Sander, Sandrine', 'Bullinger, Lars', 'Benner, Axel', 'Leupolt, Elke', 'Winkler, Dirk', 'Krober, Alexander', 'Kienle, Dirk', 'Lichter, Peter', 'Dohner, Hartmut']","['Stilgenbauer S', 'Sander S', 'Bullinger L', 'Benner A', 'Leupolt E', 'Winkler D', 'Krober A', 'Kienle D', 'Lichter P', 'Dohner H']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)'],IM,"['*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Genome, Human', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*pathology', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",2007/08/02 09:00,2008/02/01 09:00,['2007/08/02 09:00'],"['2006/08/31 00:00 [received]', '2007/06/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/08/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/01 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/02 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2007 Sep;92(9):1242-5. doi: 10.3324/haematol.10720.

For this reason, the correlation between an elevated body mass index (BMI) and clinical outcomes in patients with metastatic, castration-recurrent prostate cancer (CRPC) was evaluated. METHODS: A total of 1226 men with CRPC who were enrolled in 9 prospective clinical trials conducted by the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) for the treatment of metastatic disease were considered. Eligible patients had progressive prostate cancer during androgen deprivation therapy (with documented castrate levels of testosterone); an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 2; and adequate hematologic, renal, and hepatic function. Patients were classified based on BMI as normal (18.5-24.9 kg/m(2)), overweight (25-29.9 kg/m(2)), and mildly to severely obese (> or =30 kg/m(2)). RESULTS: Approximately 24% of the patients had a normal BMI, 43% were overweight, and 33% were mildly to severely obese. On multivariable analysis, BMI was found to be a statistically significant predictor of overall survival and prostate cancer-specific mortality. Compared with men with normal BMIs, the hazard ratios for death for overweight men and mildly to severely obese men were 0.80 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.68-0.93; P = .001) and 0.80 (95% CI, 0.68-0.94; P = .010), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with metastatic CRPC, obesity (as defined by an elevated BMI) appears to have a protective effect against overall mortality and prostate cancer-specific mortality. Alternatively, a higher BMI may reflect different cancer biology (ie, the lack of cachexia-producing substances). Further studies to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms behind these clinical observations are needed.","['Halabi, Susan', 'Ou, San-San', 'Vogelzang, Nicholas J', 'Small, Eric J']","['Halabi S', 'Ou SS', 'Vogelzang NJ', 'Small EJ']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Androgen Antagonists)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '3XMK78S47O (Testosterone)', 'EC 3.4.21.77 (Prostate-Specific Antigen)']",IM,"['African Americans/statistics & numerical data', 'Aged', 'Androgen Antagonists/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/*therapeutic use', '*Body Mass Index', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/blood/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Obesity/blood/*physiopathology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen/blood', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/blood/drug therapy/ethnology/*pathology/*therapy', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Testosterone/blood', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Whites/statistics & numerical data']",2007/08/01 09:00,2007/10/25 09:00,['2007/08/01 09:00'],"['2007/08/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/25 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/01 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 2007 Oct 1;110(7):1478-84. doi: 10.1002/cncr.22932.,['10.1002/cncr.22932 [doi]'],,"['Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina 27705, USA. susan.halabi@duke.edu']",['CA 36601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, new therapeutic options are urgently needed. One promising approach is the selective activation of apoptosis in tumor cells by the tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). This study investigated the pro-apoptotic potential of a novel TRAIL fusion protein designated scFvCD19:sTRAIL, consisting of a CD19-specific single-chain Fv antibody fragment (scFv) fused to the soluble extracellular domain of TRAIL (sTRAIL). Potent apoptosis was induced by scFvCD19:sTRAIL in several CD19-positive tumor cell lines, whereas normal blood cells remained unaffected. In mixed culture experiments, selective binding of scFvCD19:sTRAIL to CD19-positive cells resulted in strong induction of apoptosis in CD19-negative bystander tumor cells. Simultaneous treatment of CD19-positive cell lines with scFvCD19:sTRAIL and valproic acid (VPA) or Cyclosporin A induced strongly synergistic apoptosis. Treatment of patient-derived acute B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and chronic B-lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cells resulted in strong tumoricidal activity that was further enhanced by combination with VPA. In addition, scFvCD19:sTRAIL prevented engraftment of human Nalm-6 cells in xenotransplanted NOD/Scid mice. The pre-clinical data presented here warrant further investigation of scFvCD19:sTRAIL as a potential new therapeutic agent for CD19-positive B-lineage malignancies.","['Stieglmaier, Julia', 'Bremer, Edwin', 'Kellner, Christian', 'Liebig, Tanja M', 'ten Cate, Bram', 'Peipp, Matthias', 'Schulze-Koops, Hendrik', 'Pfeiffer, Matthias', 'Buhring, Hans-Jorg', 'Greil, Johann', 'Oduncu, Fuat', 'Emmerich, Bertold', 'Fey, Georg H', 'Helfrich, Wijnand']","['Stieglmaier J', 'Bremer E', 'Kellner C', 'Liebig TM', 'ten Cate B', 'Peipp M', 'Schulze-Koops H', 'Pfeiffer M', 'Buhring HJ', 'Greil J', 'Oduncu F', 'Emmerich B', 'Fey GH', 'Helfrich W']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fragments)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '614OI1Z5WI (Valproic Acid)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Antigens, CD19', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cyclosporine/administration & dosage', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fragments', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', '*TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Valproic Acid/administration & dosage', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2007/08/01 09:00,2008/03/05 09:00,['2007/08/01 09:00'],"['2007/02/20 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/08/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/01 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2008 Feb;57(2):233-46. doi: 10.1007/s00262-007-0370-8.

METHODS: The genotyping of class I HLA was performed by microlymphocytotoxicity and of class II by PCR-SSP (polymerase chain reaction - sequence specific of primers) (One Lambda, Canoga Park, CA, USA). RESULTS: In patients with LLA, frequencies of HLA-B45 and HLA-B56 were higher (P = 0.02; OR = 3.13; 95%IC = 0.94-10.44; P = 0.03; OR = 3.61; 95%IC = 0.47-27.64, respectively), than in controls. In patients with AML, the frequency of HLA-B7 (P = 0.01; OR = 2.41; 95%IC = 1.25-4.67) was higher than in controls. The presence of HLA-B45 (P= 0.01; OR = 3.29; 95%IC = 1.46-7.40), HLA-DRB1*04 (P = 0.002; OR = 2.17; 95%IC = 1.36-3.46) and HLA-DRB1*08 (P = 0.004; OR = 2.36; 95%IC = 1.34-4.16) was associated to increased risk of CML developing.

A monoclonal antibody (mAb) that targets VEGF suppresses tumor growth in murine cancer models and human patients. We investigated cellular and molecular events that mediate refractoriness of tumors to anti-angiogenic therapy. Inherent anti-VEGF refractoriness is associated with infiltration of the tumor tissue by CD11b+Gr1+ myeloid cells. Recruitment of these myeloid cells is also sufficient to confer refractoriness. Combining anti-VEGF treatment with a mAb that targets myeloid cells inhibits growth of refractory tumors more effectively than anti-VEGF alone. Gene expression analysis in CD11b+Gr1+ cells isolated from the bone marrow of mice bearing refractory tumors reveals higher expression of a distinct set of genes known to be implicated in active mobilization and recruitment of myeloid cells. These findings indicate that, in our models, refractoriness to anti-VEGF treatment is determined by the ability of tumors to prime and recruit CD11b+Gr1+ cells.","['Shojaei, Farbod', 'Wu, Xiumin', 'Malik, Ajay K', 'Zhong, Cuiling', 'Baldwin, Megan E', 'Schanz, Stefanie', 'Fuh, Germaine', 'Gerber, Hans-Peter', 'Ferrara, Napoleone']","['Shojaei F', 'Wu X', 'Malik AK', 'Zhong C', 'Baldwin ME', 'Schanz S', 'Fuh G', 'Gerber HP', 'Ferrara N']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Nat Biotechnol,Nature biotechnology,9604648,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD11b Antigen)', '0 (Gr-1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Chemokine)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (vascular endothelial growth factor A, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'CD11b Antigen/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Chemokine/*metabolism', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/*antagonists & inhibitors']",2007/08/01 09:00,2007/11/14 09:00,['2007/08/01 09:00'],"['2007/03/08 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/08/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/01 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nat Biotechnol. 2007 Aug;25(8):911-20. doi: 10.1038/nbt1323.

The magnitude of the beneficial effect of breastfeeding on blood pressure (-2 mmHg) and total cholesterol (-0.2 mmol/l) is likely to have public health implications. However, it is unknot known whether breastfeeding reduces the risk of cardiovascular mortality. Breastfeeding may protect against the development of celiac disease. The protective role of breastfeeding against type 1 diabetes seems likely, but the mechanisms involved are still under discussion. There is no convincing evidence that breastfeeding reduces the risk of leukemia and cancer. Breastfeeding is associated with a better cognitive development (-3 points) that is present as early as at 6 months of age and sustained throughout childhood and adolescence. The benefits of breast milk may be related to its high content in docosahexaenoic acid which plays an important role in brain development. Increasing the duration of breastfeeding is correlated with an increase in cognitive development.","['Turck, Dominique']",['Turck D'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Nestle Nutr Workshop Ser Pediatr Program,Nestle Nutrition workshop series.

Biol. 2 8). Here we describe a refined and extended version of the model that includes some of the complex interactions between cells and their surrounding environment. The present version takes into consideration several additional energy-consuming biochemical pathways such as protein and DNA synthesis, the tuning of extracellular pH and of the cell membrane potential. The control of the cell cycle, which was previously modeled by means of ad hoc thresholds, has been directly addressed here by considering checkpoints from proteins that act as targets for phosphorylation on multiple sites. As simulated cells grow, they can now modify the chemical composition of the surrounding environment which in turn acts as a feedback mechanism to tune cell metabolism and hence cell proliferation: in this way we obtain growth curves that match quite well those observed in vitro with human leukemia cell lines. The model is strongly constrained and returns results that can be directly compared with actual experiments, because it uses parameter values in narrow ranges estimated from experimental data, and in perspective we hope to utilize it to develop in silico studies of the growth of very large tumor cell populations (10(6) cells or more) and to support experimental research. In particular, the program is used here to make predictions on the behavior of cells grown in a glucose-poor medium: these predictions are confirmed by experimental observation.","['Chignola, Roberto', 'Del Fabbro, Alessio', 'Pellegrina, Chiara Dalla', 'Milotti, Edoardo']","['Chignola R', 'Del Fabbro A', 'Pellegrina CD', 'Milotti E']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Phys Biol,Physical biology,101197454,"['0 (Culture Media)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biophysics/*methods', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Computer Simulation', 'Culture Media/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Glucose/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Kinetics', 'Models, Biological', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology']",2007/08/01 09:00,2007/08/31 09:00,['2007/08/01 09:00'],"['2007/08/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/31 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/01 09:00 [entrez]']",epublish,Phys Biol. 2007 Jun 12;4(2):114-33. doi: 10.1088/1478-3975/4/2/005.,"['S1478-3975(07)43838-9 [pii]', '10.1088/1478-3975/4/2/005 [doi]']",,"['Dipartimento Scientifico e Tecnologico, Universita di Verona, Verona, Italy. roberto.chignola@univr.it']",,,,,,20070612,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This response cannot be ascribed to killing of all cancer cells in the tumours by targeted alpha therapy.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare linked database were used for women diagnosed with nonmetastatic breast cancer from 1992 to 2002. The primary end point was a claim with an inpatient or outpatient diagnosis of AML (International Classification of Diseases ninth revision, codes 205 to 208), comparing patients treated with and without adjuvant chemotherapy, and by differing chemotherapy regimens. The cumulative hazard of AML was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine factors independently associated with the development of AML. RESULTS: In this observational study, there were 64,715 patients: 10,130 received adjuvant chemotherapy and 54,585 did not. The median patient age was 75.6 years (range, 66 to 104 years). The mean follow-up was 54.8 months (range, 13 to 144 months). The absolute risk of developing AML at 10 years after any adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer was 1.8% versus 1.2% for women who had not received chemotherapy. The adjusted hazard ratio for AML with adjuvant chemotherapy versus none was 1.53 (95% CI, 1.14 to 2.06). Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) within the first year of diagnosis did not convey a significantly increased risk of AML (hazard ratio, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.67 to 1.92). CONCLUSION: There is a small but real increase in AML after adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer in older women. This study may underestimate the true incidence because myelodysplastic syndrome cannot be identified through claims. G-CSF use within the first year of diagnosis does not convey an increased risk of AML in older women.","['Patt, Debra A', 'Duan, Zhigang', 'Fang, Shenying', 'Hortobagyi, Gabriel N', 'Giordano, Sharon H']","['Patt DA', 'Duan Z', 'Fang S', 'Hortobagyi GN', 'Giordano SH']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Registries', 'Risk Assessment']",2007/08/01 09:00,2007/09/12 09:00,['2007/08/01 09:00'],"['2007/08/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/01 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2007 Sep 1;25(25):3871-6. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2007.12.0832.

This is likely due to the deregulated expression of genes controlling the switch between spermatogonial self-renewal and differentiation. Here we show that Plzf directly represses the transcription of kit, a hallmark of spermatogonial differentiation. Plzf represses both endogenous kit expression and expression of a reporter gene under the control of the kit promoter region. A discrete sequence of the kit promoter, required for Plzf-mediated kit transcriptional repression, is bound by Plzf both in vivo and in vitro. A 3-bp mutation in this Plzf binding site abolishes the responsiveness of the kit promoter to Plzf repression. A significant increase in kit expression is also found in the undifferentiated spermatogonia isolated from Plzf(-/-) mice. Thus, we suggest that one mechanism by which Plzf maintains the pool of spermatogonial stem cells is through a direct repression of kit expression.","['Filipponi, Doria', 'Hobbs, Robin M', 'Ottolenghi, Sergio', 'Rossi, Pellegrino', 'Jannini, Emmanuele A', 'Pandolfi, Pier Paolo', 'Dolci, Susanna']","['Filipponi D', 'Hobbs RM', 'Ottolenghi S', 'Rossi P', 'Jannini EA', 'Pandolfi PP', 'Dolci S']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-3)', '0 (Pou5f1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Zbtb16 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Consensus Sequence', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Germ Cells/cytology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-3/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/genetics/*metabolism', 'Spermatogonia/cytology/*physiology']",2007/08/01 09:00,2008/01/23 09:00,['2007/08/01 09:00'],"['2007/08/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/23 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/01 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2007 Oct;27(19):6770-81. doi: 10.1128/MCB.00479-07.

The unusual macrophage presence in the oviduct affected by EP could indicate macrophage contribution to the pathology. METHODS: Macrophages have important functions in reproduction that are reviewed in this work. They are needed for tissue remodelling and immune-regulatory roles, and are present both in the ovary and uterus. Numerous cytokines regulate monocytes recruitment, differentiation and function in the reproductive tract, among them leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), colony-stimulating factor 1 and transforming growth factor-beta are indispensable and non-redundant for reproductive outcome. Cytokine types and levels are modulated by estrogen, progesterone and seminal plasma, which drive the differentiation of monocytes to immunity cells or to immunosuppressed trophic and scavenging macrophages. RESULTS: Many risk factors for EP involve an inflammatory reaction that can induce the release of mononuclear phagocytes from the bone marrow and/or favour immunosuppressed trophic differentiation of newly recruited mononuclear phagocytes in the reproductive tract. These observations strengthen the hypothesis that immunosuppressed trophic and scavenging macrophages may have a role in EP onset. CONCLUSIONS: Macrophages may contribute to the regulation of tubal motility through prostaglandin production and induction of progesterone secretion. Considerations about LIF also suggest that macrophages may have a central role in ectopic receptivity.","['Tonello, A', 'Poli, G']","['Tonello A', 'Poli G']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Hum Reprod,"Human reproduction (Oxford, England)",8701199,['81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Embryo Implantation/physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/physiology', 'Macrophages/pathology/*physiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Pelvic Inflammatory Disease/complications', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy, Tubal/*etiology/pathology', 'Salpingitis/complications', 'Semen/immunology']",2007/08/01 09:00,2007/12/07 09:00,['2007/08/01 09:00'],"['2007/08/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/01 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hum Reprod. 2007 Oct;22(10):2577-84. doi: 10.1093/humrep/dem246.

Gene expression analyses have implicated Notch signaling in the expansion of these tripotential cells but there are limited data as to which signals are stimulating Notch activation. There is evidence that the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR)/gp130 receptor heterodimer induces Notch1 to maintain NSP populations during normal development. LIF and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) bind to these receptor components and they coordinate injury responses in the CNS. Therefore, the aim of these studies was to investigate whether CNTF and/or leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) participate in NSP expansion in the rat SVZ after hypoxia/ischemia (H/I) as well as to characterize the downstream events that regulate NSP numbers. We report that LIF mRNA is induced 48 h post-insult by 13-fold but that it returns almost to baseline by 72 h. Commensurate with increased LIF expression there is a corresponding increase in phosphorylated Stat-3 within the SVZ. Modeling the changes that occur in vivo, we show that LIF induces Stat-3 phosphorylation in neurospheres to enhance Delta-like-1 and Notch1 expression as well as to increase Notch1 activation. LIF also expands neurosphere number and size in vitro. Whereas CNTF can mimic the effects of LIF in vitro, CNTF expression in the SVZ was unchanged during recovery from H/I. Cumulatively, these data implicate LIF and not CNTF in the expansion of NSPs in the rat SVZ after perinatal brain injury. As both LIF expression and the endogenous regenerative response after brain injury are time-delimited, these findings provide insights into strategies to expand the endogenous pool of NSPs to repopulate the damaged brain.","['Covey, M V', 'Levison, S W']","['Covey MV', 'Levison SW']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Neuroscience,Neuroscience,7605074,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cerebral Ventricles/pathology', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects/physiology', 'Hypoxia-Ischemia, Brain/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/pharmacology', 'Neurons/drug effects/*physiology', 'Pregnancy', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Receptor, Notch1/metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Stem Cells/drug effects/*physiology', 'Time Factors']",2007/08/01 09:00,2008/01/26 09:00,['2007/08/01 09:00'],"['2007/02/08 00:00 [received]', '2007/06/18 00:00 [revised]', '2007/06/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/08/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/26 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/01 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Neuroscience. 2007 Aug 24;148(2):501-9. doi: 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2007.06.015.

Beside an enhanced cytotoxic activity corresponding to increasing effector/target (E:T) ratios, we could demonstrate an increasing cytotoxicity in a time-dependent manner over a time period of 8 h. The usefulness of this novel method was also confirmed with human tumour cells lines of various other origin including breast and ovarian carcinoma and Wilms tumour cells freshly isolated from a patient after surgery. In addition to flow cytometric analysis, we monitored NK-cell-mediated induction of target cell apoptosis via the caspase cascade in attacked NB cells by fluorescence microscopy after immunofluorescence staining of activated Caspase-3 (Casp-3) in combination with detection of CD45(+) and CD9(+) for discrimination between NK and NB cells.

We show that inhibition by imatinib of PDGFR signaling in osteoblasts activates osteoblast differentiation and inhibits osteoblast proliferation and that imatinib inhibits osteoclastogenesis by both stromal cell-dependent and direct effects on osteoclast precursors. INTRODUCTION: Imatinib mesylate, an orally active inhibitor of the c-abl, c-kit, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) tyrosine kinases, is in clinical use for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and gastrointestinal stromal cell tumors. Interruption of both c-kit and c-abl signaling in mice induces osteopenia, suggesting that imatinib might have adverse effects on the skeleton. However, biochemical markers of bone formation increase in patients with CML starting imatinib therapy, whereas bone resorption is unchanged, despite secondary hyperparathyroidism. We assessed the actions of imatinib on bone cells in vitro to study the cellular and molecular mechanism(s) underlying the skeletal effects we observed in imatinib-treated patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Osteoblast differentiation was assessed using a mineralization assay, proliferation by [(3)H]thymidine incorporation, and apoptosis by a TUNEL assay. Osteoclastogenesis was assessed using murine bone marrow cultures and RAW 264.7 cells. RT and multiplex PCR were performed on RNA prepared from human bone marrow samples, osteoblastic cells, and murine bone marrow cultures. Osteoprotegerin was measured by ELISA. RESULTS: The molecular targets of imatinib are expressed in bone cells. In vitro, imatinib increases osteoblast differentiation and prevents PDGF-induced inhibition of this process. Imatinib inhibits proliferation of osteoblast-like cells induced by serum and PDGF. In murine bone marrow cultures, imatinib inhibits osteoclastogenesis stimulated by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) and partially inhibits osteoclastogenesis induced by RANKL and macrophage-colony stimulating factor. Imatinib partially inhibited osteoclastogenesis in RANKL-stimulated RAW-264.7 cells. Treatment with imatinib increases the expression of osteoprotegerin in bone marrow from patients with CML and osteoblastic cells. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together with recent in vivo data, these results suggest a role for the molecular targets of imatinib in bone cell function, that inhibition by imatinib of PDGFR signaling in osteoblasts activates bone formation, and that the antiresorptive actions of imatinib are mediated by both stromal cell-dependent and direct effects on osteoclast precursors.","[""O'Sullivan, Susannah"", 'Naot, Dorit', 'Callon, Karen', 'Porteous, Fran', 'Horne, Anne', 'Wattie, Diana', 'Watson, Maureen', 'Cornish, Jill', 'Browett, Peter', 'Grey, Andrew']","[""O'Sullivan S"", 'Naot D', 'Callon K', 'Porteous F', 'Horne A', 'Wattie D', 'Watson M', 'Cornish J', 'Browett P', 'Grey A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Bone Miner Res,Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research,8610640,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Mice', 'Osteoblasts/cytology/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Osteoclasts/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Stromal Cells/enzymology']",2007/08/01 09:00,2008/01/10 09:00,['2007/08/01 09:00'],"['2007/08/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/01 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Bone Miner Res. 2007 Nov;22(11):1679-89. doi: 10.1359/jbmr.070719.,['10.1359/jbmr.070719 [doi]'],,"['Department of Medicine, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand. s.osullivan@auckland.ac.nz']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was aimed to elucidate the mechanisms attributing to apoptosis induced by R-PK deficiency. MATERIALS AND METHODS: SLC3 and a control Friend cell line, CBA2, were cultured in a condition of glucose deprivation or supplementation with 2-deoxyglucose, and apoptosis was detected by annexin V. We established two stable transfectants of SLC3 cells with human R-PK cDNA, and examined the effect of R-PK on an apoptotic feature by cell cycle analysis. Intracellular oxidation was measured with 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate. DNA microarray analysis was performed to examine gene-expression profiles between the two transfectants and parental SLC3. RESULTS: SLC3 was more susceptible than CBA2 to apoptosis induced by glycolytic inhibition. The forced expression of R-PK significantly decreased cells at the sub G0/G1 stage in an expression-level dependent manner. Microarray analysis showed that proapoptotic genes, such as Bad, Bnip3, and Bnip3l, were downregulated in the transfectants. In addition, peroxiredoxin 1 (Prdx1) and other antioxidant genes, such as Cat, Txnrd1, and Glrx1 were also downregulated. A significant decrease of dichlorofluorescein fluorescence was observed by R-PK expression. Preincubation with a glutathione precursor showed a significant decrease of apoptosis. CONCLUSION: These results indicated that glycolytic inhibition by R-PK gene mutation augmented oxidative stress in the Friend erythroleukemia cell, leading to activation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 as well as downstream proapoptotic gene expression. Thus, R-PK plays an important role as an antioxidant during erythroid differentiation.","['Aisaki, Ken-ichi', 'Aizawa, Shin', 'Fujii, Hisaichi', 'Kanno, Jun', 'Kanno, Hitoshi']","['Aisaki K', 'Aizawa S', 'Fujii H', 'Kanno J', 'Kanno H']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,['EC 2.7.1.40 (Pyruvate Kinase)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Erythrocytes/enzymology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Glycolysis/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', '*Mutation', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Oxidative Stress/*physiology', 'Pyruvate Kinase/blood/deficiency/*genetics']",2007/07/31 09:00,2007/09/19 09:00,['2007/07/31 09:00'],"['2006/11/13 00:00 [received]', '2007/05/08 00:00 [revised]', '2007/05/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/07/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/31 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2007 Aug;35(8):1190-200. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2007.05.005.,"['S0301-472X(07)00313-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2007.05.005 [doi]']",,"['Cellular and Molecular Toxicology Division, National Institute of Health and Sciences, Tokyo, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a result of its well known pathophysiology, straightforward diagnosis, well established prognostic factors, and treatment for the cause of disease, CML has been studied to an extent that far exceeds that expected from its frequency, and serves as a model disease for other cancers. Imatinib, an inhibitor of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase, has revolutionised treatment of this disease, and is now recommended as standard treatment for chronic-phase CML. Interferon alfa is an acceptable alternative treatment in the early chronic phase for patients who do not tolerate imatinib. If imatinib treatment fails, allogeneic stem-cell transplantation, a dose increase of imatinib, or new drugs are recommended. Up to 87% of patients achieve complete cytogenetic remission, therefore we provide guidance for monitoring disease status.

Growth inhibition in MDR-1 negative cells was in part due to increased rate of apoptosis. The enhanced inhibitory effect on the proteasome by loss of MDR-1 was corroborated by a reduced proteasomal activity.

Long-term survivors of childhood ALL, however, carry an elevated risk of early mortality from cardiac events and stroke and a disproportionately high prevalence of dyslipidemia and obesity, presumably as an adverse effect of treatment. METHODS: As part of a clinical follow-up study of 70 young adult survivors of childhood ALL, we evaluated the degree to which this high-risk group differed in knowledge about symptoms of heart attack and stroke from that of a population-based comparison group frequency-matched by age, sex, and body mass index. Questions from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System were used to assess health knowledge. RESULTS: Survivors of ALL scored considerably worse on symptom knowledge than did their population counterparts. The strongest association was observed for chest pain as a symptom of heart attack: ALL survivors were 14-fold more likely than the comparison group to answer the question incorrectly. Seventy-seven percent of survivors failed to identify pain in the jaw, neck, or back as a heart attack symptom. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate an important gap in knowledge and underscore the need for health education among survivors of childhood leukemia that includes information about symptoms of myocardial infarction and stroke.","['Gurney, James G', 'Donohue, Janet E', 'Ness, Kirsten K', ""O'Leary, Maura"", 'Glasser, Stephen P', 'Baker, K Scott']","['Gurney JG', 'Donohue JE', 'Ness KK', ""O'Leary M"", 'Glasser SP', 'Baker KS']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Ann Epidemiol,Annals of epidemiology,9100013,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System', 'Child', 'Female', '*Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Minnesota', 'Myocardial Infarction/*diagnosis/physiopathology', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Stroke/*diagnosis/physiopathology', '*Survivors']",2007/07/31 09:00,2008/01/03 09:00,['2007/07/31 09:00'],"['2007/05/21 00:00 [received]', '2007/05/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/07/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/03 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/31 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Epidemiol. 2007 Oct;17(10):778-81. doi: 10.1016/j.annepidem.2007.05.004.

Higher levels of CREB correlate with a less favorable prognosis in a small cohort of adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia.

The efficacy of fludarabine therapy is improved with the use of rituximab, as part of the initial therapeutic regimen or as maintenance therapy, and deserves consideration. The once-daily oral formulation was effective in the treatment of patients with relapsed indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; however, further studies are required to confirm its role and establish its efficacy relative to that of standard treatment in this patient population.

This is because of the higher number of patients with malignancies treated with intensive immunosuppressive therapy regimens as well as their improved survival from formerly fatal bacterial infections, and the rising number of patients undergoing allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell or organ transplantation. Early initiation of effective systemic antifungal treatment is essential for a successful clinical outcome in these patients; however, clinical clues for diagnosis are sparse and early microbiological proof of invasive aspergillosis (IA) is rare. Clinical diagnosis is based on pulmonary CT scan findings and non-culture based diagnostic techniques such as galactomannan or DNA detection in blood or bronchoalveolar lavage samples. Most promising outcomes can be expected in patients at high risk for aspergillosis in whom antifungal treatment has been started pre-emptively, backed up by laboratory and imaging findings. The gold standard of systemic antifungal treatment is voriconazole, which has been proven to be significantly superior to conventional amphotericin B and has led to a profound improvement of survival rates in patients with cerebral aspergillosis. Liposomal amphotericin B at standard dosages appears to be a suitable alternative for primary treatment, while caspofungin, amphotericin B lipid complex or posaconazole have shown partial or complete response in patients who had been refractory to or intolerant of primary antifungal therapy. Combination therapy with two antifungal compounds may be a promising future strategy for first-line treatment. Lung resection helps to prevent fatal haemorrhage in single patients with pulmonary lesions located in close proximity to larger blood vessels, but is primarily considered for reducing the risk of relapse during subsequent periods of severe immunosuppression. Strict reverse isolation appears to reduce the incidence of aspergillosis in allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients and patients with acute myeloid leukaemia undergoing aggressive anticancer therapy. Well designed, prospective randomised studies on infection control measures effective to prevent aspergillosis are lacking. Prophylactic systemic antifungal treatment with posaconazole significantly improves survival and reduces IA in acute myeloid leukaemia patients and reduces aspergillosis incidence rates in patients with intermediate-to-severe graft-versus-host reaction emerging after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Voriconazole prophylaxis may be suitable for prevention of IA as well; however, the results of large clinical trials are still awaited.","['Maschmeyer, Georg', 'Haas, Antje', 'Cornely, Oliver A']","['Maschmeyer G', 'Haas A', 'Cornely OA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",New Zealand,Drugs,Drugs,7600076,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)']",IM,"['Antifungal Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', '*Aspergillosis/diagnosis/epidemiology/prevention & control/therapy', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Neoplasms/immunology/therapy', 'Organ Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Quarantine', 'Risk Factors', 'Transplantation Immunology']",2007/07/31 09:00,2007/10/24 09:00,['2007/07/31 09:00'],"['2007/07/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/24 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/31 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Drugs. 2007;67(11):1567-601. doi: 10.2165/00003495-200767110-00004.,"['67114 [pii]', '10.2165/00003495-200767110-00004 [doi]']",,"['Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, Klinikum Ernst von Bergmann, Potsdam, Germany. gmaschmeyer@klinikumevb.de']",,281,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We therefore used a newly developed immunocytochemical procedure to determine the distribution of DM in the gastrointestinal tracts of rats after i.v. injection. Two hours after injection, DM was diffusely distributed in nuclei and most parts of the cytoplasm of intestinal epithelial cells. The cytoplasmic immunoreactivity for DM was most pronounced in small granules of the apical cytoplasm. Sixteen hours after injection, DM immunostaining was by and large absent in the villous epithelium but persisted in the intestinal crypts. In addition, staining was also detected in endothelial cells, scattered cells of the lamina propria and in smooth muscle cells. After 5 days, only little staining for DM remained. Similar findings were made in the colon. In the gastric mucosa, DM accumulation persisted at 16 h in some glandular cells but was lost from the surface epithelium. No staining was detected in saline-injected control rats. The distribution of DM accumulation correlated partially with the distribution of apoptotic cells as detected by the TUNEL procedure. Our results pinpoint that DM may exert prolonged effects on glandular and regenerative cells of the gastrointestinal tract-an observation that may explain the gastrointestinal toxicity of the drug. It seems possible that DM accumulation in surface epithelial cells is rapidly cleared through drug transporters.","['Ohara, Koji', 'Shin, Masashi', 'Nakamuta, Hiromichi', 'Larsson, Lars-Inge', 'Hougaard, David M', 'Fujiwara, Kunio']","['Ohara K', 'Shin M', 'Nakamuta H', 'Larsson LI', 'Hougaard DM', 'Fujiwara K']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Histochem Cell Biol,Histochemistry and cell biology,9506663,['ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/physiology', 'Daunorubicin/analysis/*pharmacokinetics', 'Gastrointestinal Tract/*chemistry/ultrastructure', '*Immunohistochemistry', 'Rats', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Tissue Distribution']",2007/07/31 09:00,2008/02/09 09:00,['2007/07/31 09:00'],"['2007/05/21 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/07/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/09 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/31 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Histochem Cell Biol. 2007 Sep;128(3):285-90. doi: 10.1007/s00418-007-0314-6.

Specifically, they can be used to test alternative hypotheses on underlying biological mechanisms for their consistency with real data and therefore to effectively guide the design of new experimental strategies or clinical trials. In this study, we present an overview of recently published mathematical approaches applied to the description of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). We discuss three different fields relevant to clinical issues: the pathogenesis of the malignancy, the treatment effects of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib, and the process of acquired treatment resistance highlighting both the differences and the consistencies in the proposed hypotheses and the resulting conclusions. The mathematical models presented agree that CML can adequately be described as a clonal competition between normal and leukemic stem cells for a common resource. Furthermore, a certain therapeutic effect of imatinib on leukemic stem cells turned out to be necessary to consistently explain clinical data on the long-term response of CML patients under imatinib treatment. However, the approaches described cannot resolve the question whether or not this effect is sufficient to ultimately eradicate malignant stem cells. A number of different hypotheses have been proposed concerning the initiation and the dynamics of treatment-resistant malignant stem cell clones. The theoretical results clearly indicate that further experimental effort with the particular focus on the quantitative monitoring of resistant clones will be required to definitely distinguish between these hypotheses.","['Roeder, Ingo', 'Glauche, Ingmar']","['Roeder I', 'Glauche I']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Germany,J Mol Med (Berl),"Journal of molecular medicine (Berlin, Germany)",9504370,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Benzamides', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*pathology', '*Models, Biological', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use']",2007/07/31 09:00,2009/05/12 09:00,['2007/07/31 09:00'],"['2007/04/05 00:00 [received]', '2007/06/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/05/25 00:00 [revised]', '2007/07/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/31 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Mol Med (Berl). 2008 Jan;86(1):17-27. doi: 10.1007/s00109-007-0241-y.

However, no pooled survival analysis has yet been done. We conducted a survival meta-analysis to compare allogeneic transplantation vs chemotherapy or autologous transplantation using an intention-to-treat approach. Our study included the controlled clinical trials, wherein allocation to allogeneic transplant was based on donor availability. The event-free individual survival data were reconstructed on the basis of published information and Kaplan-Meier graphs. We then generated the meta-analytic event-free survival curves for the two treatments. The mean survival gain per patient was estimated and a simplified cost-effectiveness assessment was carried out. In the allogeneic transplantation group, 293 patients were examined and 479 as controls (four trials). The event-free survival difference was statistically significant (P=0.011). The relative risk for event occurrence was 0.79 for the experimental group vs the controls (95% CI: 0.66-0.96; P=0.017). The mean survival gain was 1 year per patient. The cost per life-year gained was less than the conventional threshold of 50,000 euros.

The term ""repair foci"" has since been used to describe these protein accumulations. As a molecular marker for DNA damage, they have been immensely useful in the study of signal transduction pathways triggered by DNA damage while aiding in the identification of new factors involved in DNA repair. In spite of their importance, many other changes in the nuclear landscape correlate with DNA damage and repair processes. These include dramatic changes in chromatin ultrastructure and epigenetic modifications, which occur at the site of DNA breaks as well as globally throughout the nucleus. Besides chromatin, DNA damage also affects the dynamic behaviour, morphology and biochemical composition of various subnuclear domains, including the nucleolus, promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies and Cajal bodies. These changes in the nuclear landscape, the topic of this review, appear to be intimately linked to the cellular response to DNA damage and may prove as useful as repair foci in elucidating mechanisms of DNA repair.","['Dellaire, Graham', 'Bazett-Jones, David P']","['Dellaire G', 'Bazett-Jones DP']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,['9007-49-2 (DNA)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Nucleus/*genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA/metabolism', '*DNA Damage', '*DNA Repair', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/genetics/pathology', 'Signal Transduction']",2007/07/31 09:00,2007/09/27 09:00,['2007/07/31 09:00'],"['2007/07/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/27 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/31 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2007 Aug 1;6(15):1864-72. doi: 10.4161/cc.6.15.4560.

METHODS: Using the Automated Childhood Cancer Information (ACCIS) database, we carried out a period analysis of 10-year survival for the 1995-99 period. Analyses were carried out by diagnostic groups, age-group at diagnosis, sex and four European regions. RESULTS: Ten-year survival estimates for the 1995-99 period were 73% for any type of leukaemia, 78% for acute lymphoid leukaemia and 52% for acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia. The corresponding 10-year survival rates for all types of lymphomas, Hodgkin lymphoma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma were 84, 91 and 79%, respectively. These figures are much higher than those obtained by traditional (cohort-based) methods of survival analysis. A large difference in prognosis is still observed between the East and other parts of Europe.

Estimates of radiation doses from external sources and internal tritium uptakes were derived from dosimetry records through 1999. Radiation dose-mortality trends were evaluated for leukemia, leukemia excluding chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and myeloid leukemia. A positive association was observed between leukemia mortality and radiation dose under a 3-year lag assumption (excess relative rate/10 mSv = 0.04, 90% confidence interval: -0.00, 0.12). The association was of larger magnitude for leukemia excluding chronic lymphocytic leukemia (excess relative rate/10 mSv = 0.08, 90% confidence interval: 0.01, 0.20) and myeloid leukemia (excess relative rate/10 mSv = 0.12, 90% confidence interval: 0.02, 0.35). Compared with males, females had less complete dosimetry information; when analyses were restricted to males, the estimated association for each cause of death increased slightly in magnitude and goodness of fit. Exposures accrued 3-15 years prior were more strongly related to leukemia than exposures in the more distant past. This study provides evidence of positive associations between radiation dose and leukemia mortality among Savannah River Site workers.

Because the available laboratory-developed assays lack consensus on the appropriate design, reporting of results, and reference intervals, we developed and evaluated an integrated BCR-ABL assay that yields standardized results for any laboratory and can be performed by technicians with no specialized training. METHODS: We used the Cepheid Xpert BCR-ABL Monitor assay to measure both BCR-ABL and ABL (endogenous control) transcripts in blood samples from CML patients and healthy individuals. The assay involves 8 manual pipetting steps, fully automated nucleic acid purification, a nested qRT-PCR step, and data analysis. RESULTS: The BCR-ABL assay requires approximately 2 h 20 min and covers a 5-log concentration range with a lower detection limit for the BCR-ABL:ABL ratio of approximately 0.005%. Assay results were negative for 100% of the 56 known CML-negative samples (12 patients with other hematologic disorders and 44 healthy blood donors). Testing of CML-positive patients undergoing disease monitoring showed 85% agreement with negative results (17 of 20) and 100% agreement with positive results (26 of 26). An imprecision/portability study revealed no differences in performance between sites, days, instruments, and operators. CONCLUSIONS: The Xpert BCR-ABL Monitor assay provides a robust and reproducible alternative to laboratory-developed assays. Its ease of use may allow more laboratories to offer BCR-ABL testing for patients, and the short assay time enables same-day results for treating physicians.","['Winn-Deen, Emily S', 'Helton, Bret', 'Van Atta, Reuel', 'Wong, Wendy', 'Peralta, Jeffrey', 'Wang, James', 'Tsongalis, Gregory J', 'Belloni, Dorothy', 'Chan, David', 'Eshleman, James R', 'Gocke, Christopher D', 'Jobbagy, Zsolt', 'Beppu, Lan', 'Radich, Jerald P']","['Winn-Deen ES', 'Helton B', 'Van Atta R', 'Wong W', 'Peralta J', 'Wang J', 'Tsongalis GJ', 'Belloni D', 'Chan D', 'Eshleman JR', 'Gocke CD', 'Jobbagy Z', 'Beppu L', 'Radich JP']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Chem,Clinical chemistry,9421549,"['0 (Anticoagulants)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Anticoagulants', 'Blood Specimen Collection', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Hematologic Tests', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA/*blood', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2007/07/31 09:00,2007/09/29 09:00,['2007/07/31 09:00'],"['2007/07/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/29 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/31 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Chem. 2007 Sep;53(9):1593-600. doi: 10.1373/clinchem.2007.085472.

Neurotrophic factors are first synthesized in bronchial epithelial cells, immune cells, and other cells in the airway; they are then taken up by the synapse and are finally transported to dorsal root ganglia (C7-T5). Increased neurotrophic factors in dorsal root ganglia promote the synthesis and release of substance P. As a result, substance P causes a series of reactions such as contraction of airway smooth muscles, secretion of mucous fluids, seepage of capillary vessels, release of mediators of inflammation, and aggravation of airway hyperreactivity. It is interesting to note that the anatomic locations of dorsal root ganglia (C7-T5) are similar to a series of acupuncture points in traditional Chinese medicine. These points are all situated on 2 sides of the midspinal line, and most of them belong to Back-shu acupuncture points. In traditional Chinese medicine, Back-shu points can be used to treat patients with bronchial asthma through acupuncture and moxibustion. Is it a coincidence, or is there a real connection? These points possess similar neurotonia, physical function, and therapeutic effects; the functional area of Back-shu is composed of these points. When these points are pricked with a needle along the lower border of the spinous process, dorsal root ganglia and spinal nerves are stimulated; this can help to regulate the synthesis and release of neurotransmitters. It is hypothesized that dorsal root ganglia may be the targets of acupuncture in the treatment of asthma; in this process, acupuncture has an inhibitory effect on the uptake of neurotrophic factors, or it inhibits the synthesis and release of substance P in dorsal root ganglia. As a result, airway neurogenic inflammation in asthma is relieved.","['Feng, Jun Tao', 'Hu, Cheng Ping', 'Li, Xiao Zhao']","['Feng JT', 'Hu CP', 'Li XZ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Adv Ther,Advances in therapy,8611864,['0 (Nerve Growth Factors)'],,"['Acupuncture Therapy/*methods', 'Asthma/physiopathology/*therapy', '*Ganglia, Spinal', 'Humans', 'Nerve Growth Factors/metabolism']",2007/07/31 09:00,2007/09/20 09:00,['2007/07/31 09:00'],"['2007/07/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/20 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/31 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Adv Ther. 2007 May-Jun;24(3):598-602. doi: 10.1007/BF02848784.,"['639 [pii]', '10.1007/BF02848784 [doi]']",,"['Department of Respiratory Medicine, Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Hunan, China.']",,31,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated whether bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNC) of MDS patients also showed enhanced proliferation and apoptosis in vitro in comparison with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and normal BM (NBM). NBM showed a decrease in the number of clusters in time due to apoptosis of clusters and due to development of clusters into colonies with low apoptotic level. In MDS patients, about two-fold more clusters have developed at day 4, and in contrast with NBM, the total number of clusters at day 7 remained high in spite of an increasing percentage of apoptotic clusters (from 52 to 76%) in combination with more colony formation. The number of clusters and colonies showed a sharp decrease at day 10 because of persistently high apoptosis at cluster level and increasing apoptosis in colonies. BMMNC of AML patients showed a decreased proliferation with enhanced apoptosis at cluster level in contrast to a relatively low apoptotic levels in the colony-forming cells. This data show that increased proliferation is abrogated by enhanced apoptosis in MDS, whereas AML showed decreased proliferation with a low level of apoptosis in colony-forming cells. These growth profiles of BMMNC are independent of stromal influences and may represent intrinsic features of the MDS progenitors and accessory cell interactions.","['Span, Lambert F R', 'Rutten, Eugenie', 'Gemmink, Anita', 'Boezeman, Jan B M', 'Raymakers, Reinier A P', 'de Witte, Theo']","['Span LF', 'Rutten E', 'Gemmink A', 'Boezeman JB', 'Raymakers RA', 'de Witte T']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Apoptosis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*cytology', '*Cell Communication', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Stem Cells/cytology', 'Stromal Cells/*physiology']",2007/07/31 09:00,2008/02/27 09:00,['2007/07/31 09:00'],"['2006/12/01 00:00 [received]', '2007/06/12 00:00 [revised]', '2007/06/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/07/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/27 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/31 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2007 Dec;31(12):1659-67. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2007.06.013.

RESULTS: Twenty five patients with a mean age of 38.5 years were submitted for open splenectomy. Splenomegaly was found in 12 patients (48%). The most frequent abdominal wall incision was transverse left subcostal (64%). Average surgical time was 125 min, bleeding 485 ml, spleen weight 1553.6 g and mean size 15 x 11 x 12 cm. Mean hospital stay was 7.5 days. Eighteen patients (72%) did not have immediate complications. One patient (4%) developed surgical wound infection, two patients (8%) had significant pain, three patients (12%) had bleeding and one patient (4%) developed intraabdominal fluid collection. Twenty one patients (84%) did not have further complications. One patient (4%) developed multiple organ failure, another patient (4%) developed thrombocytopenia and another (4%) developed severe pain. During an average 81-month follow-up we found 14 patients (56%) asymptomatic, two patients (8%) with documented tumoral activity (angiosarcoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma) and one patient (4%) developed a second neoplasm. Six patients (24%) died due to underlying disease (chronic myeloid leukemia and lymphoma), one patient (4%) with active disease (Hodgkin's disease) and one patient (4%) died due to other causes.

This study investigated whether or not VAA-I can induce cytoskeletal breakdown in PLB-985D cells, as previously observed in undifferentiated PLB-985 cells. VAA-I was found to induce apoptosis in PLB-985D cells, as assessed by cytology and by degradation of gelsolin, an event known to occur via caspase-3 activation. VAA-I induced cytoskeletal breakdown based on the disruption of the F-actin network and cleavage of paxillin, vimentin and lamin B(1). In addition, we demonstrated, for the first time, that non-muscle myosin heavy chain IIA (NMHC-IIA) was cleaved by VAA-I treatment. Degradation of NMHC-IIA was reversed by the pan caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk in PLB-985D cells and neutrophils. However, unlike lamin B(1), no NMHC-IIA was detected on the cell surface of apoptotic neutrophils. In conclusion, PLB-985D cells responded in a similar manner to neutrophils regarding the degradation of the tested cytoskeletal. Therefore, PLB-985D cells may provide a suitable substitute for neutrophils in screening experiments, preventing extensive neutrophil cell isolation.","['Lavastre, Valerie', 'Binet, Francois', 'Moisan, Eliane', 'Chiasson, Sonia', 'Girard, Denis']","['Lavastre V', 'Binet F', 'Moisan E', 'Chiasson S', 'Girard D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Lamin Type B)', '0 (Paxillin)', '0 (Plant Preparations)', '0 (Plant Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 2)', '0 (Toxins, Biological)', '0 (VAA-I protein, Viscum album)', '0 (Vimentin)', '0 (lamin B1)', 'EC 3.2.2.22 (Ribosome Inactivating Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Nonmuscle Myosin Type IIA)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytoskeleton/drug effects/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Lamin Type B/analysis/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Neutrophils/*immunology', 'Nonmuscle Myosin Type IIA/analysis/*metabolism', 'Paxillin/analysis/metabolism', 'Plant Preparations/*therapeutic use', 'Plant Proteins/*therapeutic use', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Ribosome Inactivating Proteins', 'Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 2', 'Toxins, Biological/*therapeutic use', 'Vimentin/analysis/metabolism']",2007/07/31 09:00,2007/09/29 09:00,['2007/07/31 09:00'],"['2007/07/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/29 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/31 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2007 Aug;138(4):545-54. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2007.06692.x.,"['BJH6692 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2007.06692.x [doi]']",,"['INRS-Institut Armand-Frappier, Universite du Quebec, Pointe-Claire, QC, Canada.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although MYB levels are high in most neoplastic B cells, we found that, unexpectedly, both PEL cells and uncultured PEL patients' samples contained very low levels of MYB mRNA when compared to B-cell leukaemia samples obtained from KSHV(-) patients. These results were further confirmed at the protein level. Both latent viral FLICE inhibitory protein (v-FLIP) and early lytic viral G protein coupled receptor (v-GPCR) KSHV proteins were found to activate nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB and transrepress a MYB promoter reporter construct. In contrast, a dominant negative inhibitor of NF-kappaB (IkappaB-alpha) mutant prevented v-FLIP and v-GPCR from inhibiting MYB functions while a v-GPCR mutant that was impaired for NF-kappaB activation could not repress the MYB construct. Transduction of a v-FLIP expressing vector or stable transfection of v-GPCR both resulted in a marked downregulation of the endogenous MYB protein expression. However, MYB expression transactivated the lytic switch Replication and Transcription Activator (RTA) promoter in transient transfection assays. Taken together, our results demonstrate that, contrary to a number of other haematological malignancies, MYB expression is not required for PEL cell proliferation. Repressing MYB expression also helps in maintaining the virus in latency.","['Lacoste, Vincent', 'Nicot, Christophe', 'Gessain, Antoine', 'Valensi, Francoise', 'Gabarre, Jean', 'Matta, Hittu', 'Chaudhary, Preet M', 'Mahieux, Renaud']","['Lacoste V', 'Nicot C', 'Gessain A', 'Valensi F', 'Gabarre J', 'Matta H', 'Chaudhary PM', 'Mahieux R']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '0 (Rta protein, Human herpesvirus 8)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Gene Expression', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', '*Genes, myb', 'Herpesvirus 8, Human/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, AIDS-Related/metabolism/*virology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/metabolism/*virology', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb/analysis', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/metabolism', 'Sarcoma, Kaposi/metabolism/*virology', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Viral Proteins/metabolism', 'Virus Activation', 'Virus Latency']",2007/07/31 09:00,2007/09/29 09:00,['2007/07/31 09:00'],"['2007/07/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/29 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/31 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2007 Aug;138(4):487-501. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2007.06697.x.,"['BJH6697 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2007.06697.x [doi]']",,"[""Unite d'Epidemiologie et Physiopathologie des Virus Oncogenes, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.""]","['CA124621/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA85177/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report that overexpression of SKAP55 disrupts signaling from the TCR to the Ras-Erk-AP-1 pathway and transcription of the IL-2 gene in primary human T cells and in Jurkat T leukemia cells. In contrast, moderate overexpression of SKAP55 increased TCR-dependent AP-1 transcriptional activity, suggesting that high-level SKAP55 overexpression interfered with the assembly of functional signaling complexes required for TCR coupling to the Ras pathway. In support of this view, knock-down of SKAP55 by RNA interference resulted in decreased reporter gene activation and decreased ERK phosphorylation. In contrast, TCR-induced NF-kappaB activation was not affected. Since constitutively active forms of Ras or Raf-1 overcame the inhibitory effects of SKAP55 overexpression, we searched for a mechanism upstream of Ras and found that SKAP55 co-immunoprecipitated with the Ras activator RasGRP1. The binding of RasGRP1 to SKAP55 required the C-terminus of SKAP55 and was enhanced by tyrosine phosphorylation of SKAP55. These results suggest that SKAP55 modulates signal transduction from the TCR to Ras by binding to RasGRP1.","['Kosco, Karena A', 'Cerignoli, Fabio', 'Williams, Scott', 'Abraham, Robert T', 'Mustelin, Tomas']","['Kosco KA', 'Cerignoli F', 'Williams S', 'Abraham RT', 'Mustelin T']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Mol Immunol,Molecular immunology,7905289,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RASGRP1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (SKAP1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/*metabolism', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Phosphoproteins/chemistry/deficiency/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Interaction Mapping', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/enzymology', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/*metabolism', 'ras Proteins/*metabolism']",2007/07/31 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2007/07/31 09:00'],"['2007/02/13 00:00 [received]', '2007/05/20 00:00 [revised]', '2007/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/07/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/31 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Immunol. 2008 Jan;45(2):510-22. doi: 10.1016/j.molimm.2007.05.024.

We also did a randomised trial to establish the value of a late intensification course. METHODS: Patients aged 0-12 months were enrolled by 17 study groups in 22 countries between 1999 and 2005. Eligible patients were stratified for risk according to their peripheral blood response to a 7-day prednisone prophase, and then given a hybrid regimen based on the standard protocol for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, with some elements designed for treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia. Before the maintenance phase, a subset of patients in complete remission were randomly assigned to receive either standard treatment or a more intensive chemotherapy course with high-dose cytarabine and methotrexate. The primary outcomes were event-free survival (EFS) for the initial cohort of patients and disease-free survival (DFS) for the patients randomly assigned to a treatment group. Data were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT 00015873, and at controlled-trials.com, number ISRCTN24251487. FINDINGS: In the 482 enrolled patients who underwent hybrid treatment, 260 (58%) were in complete remission at a median follow-up of 38 (range 1-78) months, and EFS at 4 years was 47.0% (SE 2.6, 95% CI 41.9-52.1). Of 445 patients in complete remission after 5 weeks of induction treatment, 191 were randomised: 95 patients to receive a late intensification course, and 96 to a control group. At a median follow-up of 42 (range 1-73) months, 60 patients in the treatment group and 57 controls were disease-free. DFS at 4 years did not differ between the two groups (60.9% [SE 5.2] for treatment group vs 57.0% [5.5] for controls; p=0.81). During the intensification phase, of 71 patients randomly assigned to the treatment group, and for whom toxicity data were available, 35 (49%) had infections, 21 (30%) patients had mucositis, 22 (31%) patients had toxic effects on the liver, and 2 (3%) had neurotoxicity. All types of rearrangements in the (mixed lineage leukaemia) MLL gene, very high white blood cell count, age of younger than 6 months, and a poor response to the prednisone prophase were independently associated with inferior outcomes. INTERPRETATION: Patients treated with our hybrid protocol, and especially those who responded poorly to prednisone, had higher EFS than most reported outcomes for treatment of infant ALL. Delayed intensification of chemotherapy did not benefit patients.","['Pieters, Rob', 'Schrappe, Martin', 'De Lorenzo, Paola', 'Hann, Ian', 'De Rossi, Giulio', 'Felice, Maria', 'Hovi, Liisa', 'LeBlanc, Thierry', 'Szczepanski, Tomasz', 'Ferster, Alice', 'Janka, Gritta', 'Rubnitz, Jeffrey', 'Silverman, Lewis', 'Stary, Jan', 'Campbell, Myriam', 'Li, Chi-Kong', 'Mann, Georg', 'Suppiah, Ram', 'Biondi, Andrea', 'Vora, Ajay', 'Valsecchi, Maria Grazia']","['Pieters R', 'Schrappe M', 'De Lorenzo P', 'Hann I', 'De Rossi G', 'Felice M', 'Hovi L', 'LeBlanc T', 'Szczepanski T', 'Ferster A', 'Janka G', 'Rubnitz J', 'Silverman L', 'Stary J', 'Campbell M', 'Li CK', 'Mann G', 'Suppiah R', 'Biondi A', 'Vora A', 'Valsecchi MG']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Lancet,"Lancet (London, England)",2985213R,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage']",2007/07/31 09:00,2007/08/10 09:00,['2007/07/31 09:00'],"['2007/07/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/31 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Lancet. 2007 Jul 21;370(9583):240-250. doi: 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61126-X.,"['S0140-6736(07)61126-X [pii]', '10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61126-X [doi]']",,"[""Dutch Childhood Oncology Group (DCOG; Netherlands) Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, Netherlands.

We aimed to establish whether this treatment combination provided greater survival benefit than did chlorambucil or fludarabine. METHODS: 777 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia requiring treatment were randomly assigned to fludarabine (n=194) or fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide (196) for six courses, or chlorambucil (387) for 12 courses. The primary endpoint was overall survival, with secondary endpoints of response rates, progression-free survival, toxic effects, and quality of life. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number NCT 58585610. FINDINGS: There was no significant difference in overall survival between patients given fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, or chlorambucil. Complete and overall response rates were better with fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide than with fludarabine (complete response rate 38%vs 15%, respectively; overall response rate 94%vs 80%, respectively; p<0.0001 for both comparisons), which were in turn better than with chlorambucil (complete response rate 7%, overall response rate 72%; p=0.006 and 0.04, respectively). Progression-free survival at 5 years was significantly better with fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide (36%) than with fludarabine (10%) or chlorambucil (10%; p<0.00005). Fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide was the best combination for all ages, including patients older than 70 years, and in prognostic groups defined by immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (V(H)) mutation status and cytogenetics, which were tested in 533 and 579 cases, respectively. Patients had more neutropenia and days in hospital with fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide, or fludarabine, than with chlorambucil. There was less haemolytic anaemia with fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide (5%) than with fludarabine (11%) or chlorambucil (12%). Quality of life was better for responders, but preliminary analyses showed no significant difference between treatments. A meta-analysis of these data and those of two published phase III trials showed a consistent benefit for the fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide regimen in terms of progression-free survival. INTERPRETATION: Fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide should now become the standard treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and the basis for new protocols that incorporate monoclonal antibodies.","['Catovsky, D', 'Richards, S', 'Matutes, E', 'Oscier, D', 'Dyer, Mjs', 'Bezares, R F', 'Pettitt, A R', 'Hamblin, T', 'Milligan, D W', 'Child, J A', 'Hamilton, M S', 'Dearden, C E', 'Smith, A G', 'Bosanquet, A G', 'Davis, Z', 'Brito-Babapulle, V', 'Else, M', 'Wade, R', 'Hillmen, P']","['Catovsky D', 'Richards S', 'Matutes E', 'Oscier D', 'Dyer M', 'Bezares RF', 'Pettitt AR', 'Hamblin T', 'Milligan DW', 'Child JA', 'Hamilton MS', 'Dearden CE', 'Smith AG', 'Bosanquet AG', 'Davis Z', 'Brito-Babapulle V', 'Else M', 'Wade R', 'Hillmen P']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Lancet,"Lancet (London, England)",2985213R,"['18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Chlorambucil/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Survival Analysis', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives']",2007/07/31 09:00,2007/08/10 09:00,['2007/07/31 09:00'],"['2007/07/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/31 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Lancet. 2007 Jul 21;370(9583):230-239. doi: 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61125-8.,"['S0140-6736(07)61125-8 [pii]', '10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61125-8 [doi]']",,"['Section of Haemato-Oncology, Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, UK.

Significant progress in understanding the pathogenesis of AML has been achieved in the past few years. Two major types of genetic events are thought to give rise to leukemic transformation: alterations in the activity of transcription factors controlling hematopoietic differentiation and activation of components of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling pathways. This has led to the development of promising new therapeutic strategies for the disease. In this article, we will discuss recent developments in the field of molecularly targeted therapies for AML, which involve RTKs such as FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (Flt3), c-Kit and signal transduction via the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Initial results imply that targeting RTKs is a very promising approach for AML and that other receptors, such as the insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-IR), could also represent new targets in the future.","['Doepfner, Kathrin T', 'Boller, Danielle', 'Arcaro, Alexandre']","['Doepfner KT', 'Boller D', 'Arcaro A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol,Critical reviews in oncology/hematology,8916049,['EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",2007/07/31 09:00,2007/11/06 09:00,['2007/07/31 09:00'],"['2006/12/22 00:00 [received]', '2007/05/11 00:00 [revised]', '2007/05/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/07/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/31 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol. 2007 Sep;63(3):215-30. doi: 10.1016/j.critrevonc.2007.05.005.

He received consolidation therapy 3 months later with a matched-unrelated-donor stem-cell transplant. The disease relapsed in the bone marrow (BM) 9 months after the initial stem-cell transplant, and was successfully treated by repeat transplant from the same donor. Ten months following repeat transplant, the patient presented with an increasing number of extramedullary sites of biopsy-proven disease relapse (i.e. cranial and peripheral nerves, tongue, abdominal wall and chest wall). Repeated biopsy of the BM and chimera study showed no morphologic evidence of leukemic infiltrate with 100% donor-cell population. INVESTIGATIONS: Physical examination, complete blood count, BM biopsy, flow cytometry, cytogenetic analysis, chimera study, tongue biopsy, abdominal-wall biopsy, cytology and immunohistochemistry, CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis, MRI of the brain, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis. DIAGNOSIS: Isolated extramedullary relapse of acute myeloid leukemia after stem-cell transplant. MANAGEMENT: Primary leukemia treatment with idarubicin, cytarabine, etoposide, dexamethasone, tioguanine on protocol and salvage therapy with mitoxantrone and cytarabine combination for primary refractory disease. A matched-unrelated-donor stem-cell transplant for consolidation and donor-lymphocyte infusions were performed, followed by repeat unrelated-donor transplant for leukemia relapse in the marrow, radiation therapy and gemtuzumab ozogamicin for multiple sites of extramedullary leukemia relapse.","['Owonikoko, Taofeek', 'Agha, Mounzer', 'Balassanian, Ronald', 'Smith, Ryan', 'Raptis, Anastasios']","['Owonikoko T', 'Agha M', 'Balassanian R', 'Smith R', 'Raptis A']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Nat Clin Pract Oncol,Nature clinical practice.

We recently identified a naturally occurring leukemogenic splice variant, AML1-ETO9a (acute myeloid leukemia-1 transcription factor and the eight-twenty-one corepressor-9a), of t(8;21). To understand the leukemic potential of AML1-ETO9a, we performed microarray analysis with the murine multipotential hematopoietic FDCP-mix A4 cell line. We identified changes in expression of various genes including CD44. CD44 is a type I transmembrane protein and functions as the major cellular adhesion molecule for hyaluronic acid, a component of the extracellular matrix. CD44 is expressed in most human cell types and is implicated in myeloid leukemia pathogenesis. We show that the presence of AML1-ETO9a significantly increased the expression of CD44 at both RNA and protein levels. Furthermore, the CD44 promoter is bound by AML1-ETO9a and AML1-ETO at the chromatin level. In addition, in the AML1-ETO9a leukemia mouse model CD44 is regulated in a cell context-dependent manner. Thus, our observations suggest that AML1-ETO and its splice variant AML1-ETO9a are able to regulate the expression of the CD44 gene, linking the 8;21 translocation to the regulation of a cell adhesion molecule that is involved in the growth and maintenance of the AML blast/stem cells.","['Peterson, L F', 'Wang, Y', 'Lo, M-C', 'Yan, M', 'Kanbe, E', 'Zhang, D-E']","['Peterson LF', 'Wang Y', 'Lo MC', 'Yan M', 'Kanbe E', 'Zhang DE']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Survival', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/*genetics/metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/cytology/physiology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2007/07/28 09:00,2007/10/12 09:00,['2007/07/28 09:00'],"['2007/07/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/28 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Sep;21(9):2010-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404849.

CMC-544 inhibited in vitro growth of ALL cell lines more potently than that of Ramos B-lymphoma cells.

Several comorbidities have been observed in patients with Sweet's syndrome, particularly hemo-proliferative diseases. PATIENTS: We report the cases of two men aged 60 and 75 years with Sweet's syndrome associated in one case with myelodysplasia and in the other with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. These two patients had typical edematous plaques highly evocative of Sweet's syndrome. However, histological examination revealed superficial and deep perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate in the dermis on 5 occasions before the typical neutrophilic dermatosis of Sweet's could be diagnosed after respectively 2 and 4 years of progression. DISCUSSION: Histological findings in Sweet's syndrome are characteristic and constitute a major diagnostic factor. However, these two cases show that a lymphocytic infiltrate can occur months or even years before the appearance of typical neutrophilic infiltrate in patients with Sweet's syndrome.","['Boeckler, P', 'Noacco, G', 'Maradeix, S', 'Heid, E', 'Lipsker, D', 'Cribier, B']","['Boeckler P', 'Noacco G', 'Maradeix S', 'Heid E', 'Lipsker D', 'Cribier B']",['fre'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Ann Dermatol Venereol,Annales de dermatologie et de venereologie,7702013,"['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)', '0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '8W5C518302 (Dapsone)']",IM,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones/therapeutic use', 'Aged', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/therapeutic use', 'Dapsone/therapeutic use', 'Dermis/*pathology', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications/diagnosis/drug therapy/*pathology', '*Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neural Tube Defects/complications/diagnosis/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Sweet Syndrome/complications/diagnosis/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Treatment Outcome']",2007/07/28 09:00,2007/10/12 09:00,['2007/07/28 09:00'],"['2007/07/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/28 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Dermatol Venereol. 2007 Jun-Jul;134(6-7):559-63. doi: 10.1016/s0151-9638(07)89269-6.,"['MDOI-AD-06-2007-134-6-0151-9638-101019-200520009 [pii]', '10.1016/s0151-9638(07)89269-6 [doi]']",,"['Clinique Dermatologique, Hopitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg. peggy.boeckler@wanadoo.fr']",,,,,,,,,Infiltration lymphocytaire dermique precedant un syndrome de Sweet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report two patients with documented AML who developed spontaneous remission of their leukaemia shortly after an episode of severe sepsis and respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. The underlying mechanisms of spontaneous remission remain unclear but an association with preceding blood transfusions and severe systemic infections has been reported. An overwhelming immune response due to sepsis and leading to raised levels of TNF-alpha, INF-gamma, IL -2 and an increased activity of NK cells, cytotoxic T-cells and macrophages are thought to play an important role.

Genes within this family exhibit thioredoxin-dependent peroxidase activity and have been implicated in cellular functioning, including proliferation and differentiation. Recently, PRDX4 has been identified as a partner gene in a t(X;21) translocation in a patient with acute myeloid leukemia. To determine whether PRDX4 was involved in other translocations, leukemia cells from 15 patients with Xp22 abnormalities were screened for involvement of the gene using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). One sample from a 41-year-old woman with acute lymphoblastic leukemia showed three signals when hybridized with the PRDX4 probe. Cytogenetic analysis of the sample had identified a t(X;18)(p22;q23). Assuming that the three signals indicated a break within the PRDX4 gene, we performed FISH experiments and successfully narrowed the breakpoint on chromosome 18 to a 50-kb region. Subsequent analysis using spectral karyotyping showed that the leukemic cells had undergone multiple rearrangements and that a third X chromosome was present, albeit rearranged. Additional FISH experiments revealed that the third PRDX4 signal was the result of a third copy of the gene. Analysis of the other rearrangements has helped to characterize the multiple abnormalities within the leukemic cells.

However, acquisition of resistance may be a problem for patients being treated with tipifarnib. METHODS: We generated a tipifarnib-resistant BCR/ABL-positive cell line, K562/RR, and examined its characteristics. RESULTS: While levels of cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-7, cleaved caspase-9, and cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase were significantly increased in K562 cells, the levels were not changed in K562/RR cells with tipifarnib treatment, indicating that induction of apoptosis signaling mediated by tipifarnib is much less in K562/RR cells than in K562 cells. In addition, tipifarnib-mediated induction of cell-cycle blockage was abrogated in K562/RR cells. No mutation of farnesyltransferase alpha and beta genes was found and the level of unprocessed HDJ-2, which is a substrate of farnesyltransferase, was increased by tipifarnib treatment in K562/RR cells, suggesting that tipifarnib inhibits protein farnesylation in K562/RR cells in the same manner as in K562 cells and that mechanisms independent of farnesyltransferase activity are involved in the acquisition of resistance to tipifarnib in these cells. By DNA microarray analyses using a cDNA microarray comprising 25,000 genes, we identified 5 genes with higher expression levels in K562/RR cells than in K562 cells. These genes include beta-globin, calcium channel Caveolin 2, and FEN1, which is involved in DNA replication and repair, and CUGBP2, which may affect expression of cyclooxygenase 2. CONCLUSION: The results of this study provide useful information for clarification of the mechanisms of resistance to tipifarnib.","['Miyoshi, Takuji', 'Nagai, Tadashi', 'Kikuchi, Satoru', 'Ohmine, Ken', 'Nakamura, Makiko', 'Hanafusa, Toshiaki', 'Komatsu, Norio', 'Ozawa, Keiya']","['Miyoshi T', 'Nagai T', 'Kikuchi S', 'Ohmine K', 'Nakamura M', 'Hanafusa T', 'Komatsu N', 'Ozawa K']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Quinolones)', 'EC 2.5.1.29 (Farnesyltranstransferase)', 'MAT637500A (tipifarnib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor/*cytology/drug effects/enzymology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects/genetics', '*Farnesyltranstransferase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, abl', 'Humans', '*K562 Cells', 'Quinolones/*pharmacology']",2007/07/28 09:00,2007/11/02 09:00,['2007/07/28 09:00'],"['2006/11/10 00:00 [received]', '2007/05/24 00:00 [revised]', '2007/05/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/07/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/02 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/28 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2007 Sep;35(9):1358-65. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2007.05.020.

In this study, we sought to maximize the antileukemic activity of anti-CD19 receptor-modified CIK cells against B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). MATERIALS AND METHODS: CIK cells were transduced with retroviral vectors carrying different types of anti-CD19 chimeric receptors: anti-CD19-zeta, anti-CD19-DAP10, anti-CD19-4-1BB-zeta, and anti-CD19-CD28-zeta. A truncated form of the receptor was used as a control. Transduced CIK cells were then analyzed for their cytotoxic activity against ALL cells and for their capability to proliferate and to release cytokines after ALL encounter. RESULTS: CIK cells were efficiently transduced with all the anti-CD19 retroviral vectors. Anti-CD19 receptor expression conferred powerful killing activity against ALL cells. However, there were clear advantages when receptors containing the co-stimulatory molecules 4-1BB or CD28 were transduced. Such cells had significantly more potent cytotoxicity than cells expressing the anti-CD19-zeta or anti-CD19-DAP10. Moreover, the presence of 4-1BB or CD28 in the receptor increased the production of interleukin (IL)-2, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, TNF-beta, IL-5, IL-6, and IL-8 elicited by coculture with ALL cells. Notably, anti-CD19-4-1BB-zeta CIK cells secreted particularly low levels of interleukin-10 and proliferated strongly after contact with ALL cells. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-CD19 chimeric receptors delivering primary and costimulatory signals render CIK cells powerfully cytotoxic against ALL cells and induce secretion of immunostimulatory cytokines and proliferation. These results support the testing of genetically modified CIK cells in clinical trials.","['Marin, Virna', 'Kakuda, Harumi', 'Dander, Erica', 'Imai, Chihaya', 'Campana, Dario', 'Biondi, Andrea', ""D'Amico, Giovanna""]","['Marin V', 'Kakuda H', 'Dander E', 'Imai C', 'Campana D', 'Biondi A', ""D'Amico G""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', '*Antigens, CD19/metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/cytology/drug effects/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology/pathology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/*immunology', 'Signal Transduction/immunology', 'Transduction, Genetic']",2007/07/28 09:00,2007/11/02 09:00,['2007/07/28 09:00'],"['2006/12/21 00:00 [received]', '2007/05/24 00:00 [revised]', '2007/05/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/07/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/02 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/28 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2007 Sep;35(9):1388-97. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2007.05.018.

Several hundreds cases of Sweet's syndrome have been published. Sweet's syndrome presents in three clinical settings: classical (or idiopathic), malignancy-associated, and drug-induced. Classical Sweet's syndrome (CSS) usually presents in women between the age of 30 to 50 years, it is often preceded by an upper respiratory tract infection and may be associated with inflammatory bowel disease and pregnancy. Approximately one-third of patients with CSS experience recurrence of the dermatosis. The malignancy-associated Sweet's syndrome (MASS) can occur as a paraneoplastic syndrome in patients with an established cancer or individuals whose Sweet's syndrome-related hematologic dyscrasia or solid tumor was previously undiscovered; MASS is most commonly related to acute myelogenous leukemia. The dermatosis can precede, follow, or appear concurrent with the diagnosis of the patient's cancer. Hence, MASS can be the cutaneous harbinger of either an undiagnosed visceral malignancy in a previously cancer-free individual or an unsuspected cancer recurrence in an oncology patient. Drug-induced Sweet's syndrome (DISS) most commonly occurs in patients who have been treated with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, however, other medications may also be associated with DISS. The pathogenesis of Sweet's syndrome may be multifactorial and still remains to be definitively established. Clinical and laboratory evidence suggests that cytokines have an etiologic role. Systemic corticosteroids are the therapeutic gold standard for Sweet's syndrome. After initiation of treatment with systemic corticosteroids, there is a prompt response consisting of dramatic improvement of both the dermatosis-related symptoms and skin lesions. Topical application of high potency corticosteroids or intralesional corticosteroids may be efficacious for treating localized lesions. Other first-line oral systemic agents are potassium iodide and colchicine. Second-line oral systemic agents include indomethacin, clofazimine, cyclosporine, and dapsone. The symptoms and lesions of Sweet's syndrome may resolved spontaneously, without any therapeutic intervention; however, recurrence may follow either spontaneous remission or therapy-induced clinical resolution.","['Cohen, Philip R']",['Cohen PR'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Orphanet J Rare Dis,Orphanet journal of rare diseases,101266602,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Sweet Syndrome/chemically induced/diagnosis/*physiopathology']",2007/07/28 09:00,2007/10/12 09:00,['2007/07/28 09:00'],"['2007/07/05 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/07/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/28 09:00 [entrez]']",epublish,Orphanet J Rare Dis. 2007 Jul 26;2:34. doi: 10.1186/1750-1172-2-34.,"['1750-1172-2-34 [pii]', '10.1186/1750-1172-2-34 [doi]']",,"['University of Houston Health Center, Houston, Texas, USA. mitehead@aol.com']",,435,,,,20070726,PMC1963326,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A number of small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors with anti-FLT3 activity have been developed and several of these compounds have entered early phase clinical trials where clinical anti-leukaemic activity has been demonstrated. The depth and duration of clinical responses to FLT3 inhibitor monotherapy have been modest, however, and a number of mechanisms by which blasts may acquire resistance have been proposed. Based on preclinical evidence of synergy with conventional chemotherapy, several combination trials are now underway. FLT3 inhibition may also be effective used in combination with other molecularly targeted agents, in postchemotherapy stem-cell-directed maintenance therapy and in MLL-rearranged infant acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.","['Knapper, Steven']",['Knapper S'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors']",2007/07/28 09:00,2007/11/07 09:00,['2007/07/28 09:00'],"['2007/07/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/28 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2007 Sep;138(6):687-99. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2007.06700.x.

Additionally, cytoplasmic expression of cyclin B1 in epithelial malignancies is associated with a specific T-cell response and presumably also a humoral immune response. We therefore investigated (i) whether a similar expression pattern could be detected in native human acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cells and (ii) whether cyclin B1 specific antibodies could be detected in AML. METHODS: AML cell expression of cyclin B1 was analyzed by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Humoral immune response in AML patient sera against cyclin B1 was analyzed by ELISA. RESULTS: AML cell expression of cyclin B1 was detected for all 42 patients; but the percentage of cyclin B1 positive cells showed a wide variation between patients. Confocal microscopy demonstrated that 32/42 (76%) patient samples showed abnormal cytoplasmic expression. Furthermore, the cytoplasmic expression was maintained after 14 d of in vitro culture and differentiation of the AML cells towards a dendritic cell phenotype. Cyclin B1 specific serum antibodies could be detected for seven of 65 patients with untreated AML. CONCLUSIONS: Our studies demonstrate that primary human AML cells show aberrant cytoplasmic expression of cyclin B1 for a majority of patients and a specific humoral immune response was also detected for a subset of patients with untreated leukemia.","['Ersvaer, Elisabeth', 'Zhang, Jian-Ying', 'McCormack, Emmet', 'Olsnes, Astrid', 'Anensen, Nina', 'Tan, Eng M', 'Gjertsen, Bjorn Tore', 'Bruserud, Oystein']","['Ersvaer E', 'Zhang JY', 'McCormack E', 'Olsnes A', 'Anensen N', 'Tan EM', 'Gjertsen BT', 'Bruserud O']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CCNB1 protein, human)', '0 (Ccnb1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin B)', '0 (Cyclin B1)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/*blood', 'Antibody Formation', 'Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Nucleus/chemistry', 'Cyclin B/analysis/*immunology', 'Cyclin B1', 'Cytoplasm/*chemistry', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",2007/07/28 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2007/07/28 09:00'],"['2007/07/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/28 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2007 Sep;79(3):210-25. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2007.00899.x.

Identification of risk factors for infection is necessary for targeted prevention and surveillance. OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: An outbreak of VRE infection occurred at a tertiary cancer hospital between 1 August 2003 and 30 June 2005. Infection control measures recommended by the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America were used throughout the outbreak period. A matched case-control study was performed to identify risk factors for VRE infection. RESULTS: Fourteen VRE infections (13 episodes of bacteremia, one urinary tract infection) occurred a median of 10.5 d following hospital admission. All were due to Enterococcus faecium vanB. Univariate analysis identified the following variables to be significantly associated with VRE infection: presence of neutropenia, neutropenia >or=7 d, underlying diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and receipt of vancomycin, metronidazole or carbapenem antibiotic therapy in the 30 d prior to infection. On multivariate analysis, an underlying diagnosis of AML [odds ratio (OR), 15.00; P = 0.017] and vancomycin therapy during the previous 30 d (OR, 17.96; P = 0.036) were retained as independent risk factors for infection. CONCLUSIONS: Risk stratification for development of VRE infection is possible for patients with hematologic malignancy. Patients with AML represent a high-risk population, and targeted prevention strategies must include improved antibiotic stewardship, particularly judicious use of vancomycin therapy.","['Worth, Leon J', 'Thursky, Karin A', 'Seymour, John F', 'Slavin, Monica A']","['Worth LJ', 'Thursky KA', 'Seymour JF', 'Slavin MA']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,['6Q205EH1VU (Vancomycin)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Disease Outbreaks', '*Enterococcus faecium', 'Female', 'Gram-Positive Bacterial Infections/drug therapy/*etiology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Risk Factors', 'Vancomycin/therapeutic use', '*Vancomycin Resistance']",2007/07/28 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2007/07/28 09:00'],"['2007/07/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/28 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2007 Sep;79(3):226-33. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2007.00911.x.

The kinetics of apoptosis and cell toxicity were investigated by DNA laddering and the MTT and trypan blue assays, respectively. Total RNA was extracted and cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription. The splicing-related genes SRA1 and SC35, as well as the apoptosis-related gene BCL2 (Bcl-2), were amplified by PCR using gene-specific primers. The results showed that mRNA levels of SRA1 were up-regulated upon treatment with the antibiotic bleomycin, whereas they were down-regulated by treatment of HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells with cisplatin.

In this study we investigated for the first time the ability of ASLV-derived RCAS (replication-competent ALV LTR [avian leukosis virus long terminal repeat] with a splice acceptor) vectors to transduce rhesus macaque hematopoietic progenitors and long-term repopulating cells, in an autologous transplantation model. RCAS vectors can efficiently and stably transduce rhesus macaque CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells with an efficiency of transduction of up to 34% ex vivo. In two animals transplanted with RCAS vector-transduced autologous CD34+ cells, highly polyclonal hematopoietic reconstitution with sustained gene-marking levels in myeloid and lymphoid lineages was observed up to 18 months post-transplantation.

We also wanted to construct a simple, inexpensive prognosis score that would significantly predict TTT and survival in patients at the time of diagnosis and help practicing clinicians. In univariate analyses, patients with higher clinical stage, higher leukocyte count at diagnosis, shorter leukocyte doubling time, elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (IgV(H)) genes, and higher CD38 had a shorter overall survival and time-to-treatment (TTT). CLL cell Zap-70 expression was higher in patients with unmutated IgV(H), and those with higher Zap-70 tended to have shorter survival. IgV(H)4-34 or IgV(H)1-69 was the most common IgV(H) genes used (16 and 12%, respectively). Of those with IgV(H)1-69, 86% had unmutated IgV(H) and had a significantly shorter TTT. A cytogenetic abnormality was noted in 71% of the patients tested. Patients with 11q22 del and 17p13 del or complex abnormalities were significantly more likely to have unmutated IgV(H). We found that a prognostic score constructed using modified Rai stage, cellular CD38, and serum LDH (parameters easily obtained clinically) significantly predicted TTT and survival in patients at the time of diagnosis and performed as well or better than models using the newer markers.","['Weinberg, J Brice', 'Volkheimer, Alicia D', 'Chen, Youwei', 'Beasley, Bethany E', 'Jiang, Ning', 'Lanasa, Mark C', 'Friedman, Daphne', 'Vaccaro, Gina', 'Rehder, Catherine W', 'Decastro, Carlos M', 'Rizzieri, David A', 'Diehl, Louis F', 'Gockerman, Jon P', 'Moore, Joseph O', 'Goodman, Barbara K', 'Levesque, Marc C']","['Weinberg JB', 'Volkheimer AD', 'Chen Y', 'Beasley BE', 'Jiang N', 'Lanasa MC', 'Friedman D', 'Vaccaro G', 'Rehder CW', 'Decastro CM', 'Rizzieri DA', 'Diehl LF', 'Gockerman JP', 'Moore JO', 'Goodman BK', 'Levesque MC']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/genetics', 'Age of Onset', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*mortality/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors', 'Virginia', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/genetics']",2007/07/27 09:00,2008/01/10 09:00,['2007/07/27 09:00'],"['2007/07/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/27 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2007 Dec;82(12):1063-70. doi: 10.1002/ajh.20987.,['10.1002/ajh.20987 [doi]'],,"['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, VA and Duke University Medical Centers, 508 Fulton Street, Durham, North Carolina 27705, USA. brice@duke.edu']",['R01 CA090548/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Am J Hematol. 2008 Jan;83(1):90'],,,,,,,

The angiogenic status and the exact role of the angiogenic cytokines in lymphoid leukemia has not been fully elucidated. We have investigated the profile of the systemic components of angiogenic regulation in B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), namely vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), endostatin and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In B-ALL patients, sVEGF, and MMP-9 were significantly lower than control levels at diagnosis (p < 0.001) and increased to near control levels in remission (p>0.05). Both serum TNF-alpha and endostatin levels showed no significant difference at diagnosis (p>0.05) and in remission (p>0.05) compared to control levels. VEGF, TNF-alpha, MMP-9 and endostatin levels were not significantly correlated with peripheral white cell count or bone marrow blast cell count, but were positively correlated with platelet count. In B-CLL patients, serum VEGF, MMP-9 and TNF-alpha were significantly higher (p < 0.001 = 0.009, 0.007, respectively) and decreased to near control levels in remission (p>0.05 for all).

As survival rates have increased, clinicians and scientists have been afforded the opportunity to further develop treatments to improve the quality of life of survivors by minimizing the long-term adverse effects. When evaluating the effect of antileukemia therapy on the developing brain, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has been the preferred modality because it quantifies morphologic changes objectively and noninvasively. METHOD AND RESULTS: Computer-aided detection of changes on neuroimages enables us to objectively differentiate leukoencephalopathy from normal maturation of the developing brain. Quantitative tissue segmentation algorithms and relaxometry measures have been used to determine the prevalence, extent, and intensity of white matter changes that occur during therapy. More recently, diffusion tensor imaging has been used to quantify microstructural changes in the integrity of the white matter fiber tracts. MR perfusion imaging can be used to noninvasively monitor vascular changes during therapy. Changes in quantitative MR measures have been associated, to some degree, with changes in neurocognitive function during and after treatment. CONCLUSION: In this review, we present recent advances in quantitative evaluation of MR imaging and discuss how these methods hold the promise to further elucidate the pathophysiologic effects of treatment for childhood leukemia.","['Reddick, Wilburn E', 'Laningham, Fred H', 'Glass, John O', 'Pui, Ching-Hon']","['Reddick WE', 'Laningham FH', 'Glass JO', 'Pui CH']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Germany,Neuroradiology,Neuroradiology,1302751,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Brain Neoplasms/drug therapy/*pathology/*physiopathology', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', '*Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*pathology/*physiopathology']",2007/07/27 09:00,2008/03/28 09:00,['2007/07/27 09:00'],"['2007/04/30 00:00 [received]', '2007/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/07/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/27 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Neuroradiology. 2007 Nov;49(11):889-904. doi: 10.1007/s00234-007-0262-9.

Many authors advocate leaving a long redundant jejunal access loop to facilitate subsequent access. Reasoning that percutaneous access can be achieved transhepatically in patients with stenosis, this study reports the outcome of a policy of biliary repair without the use of a jejunal access loop. METHODS: Eleven patients undergoing biliary reconstruction over a 5-year period constituted the study population. Three (27%) were male, and the median (range) age at injury was 53 (26-75) years. Median delay from injury to repair was 2 (1-48) months. Bismuth stage was: stage I, 4; stage II, 5; and stage III, 2. Four patients had concomitant arterial injury. All underwent surgical repair by Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy without an access loop. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 13 (1-64) months. The principal postoperative complication was a hepatic abscess in one patient. There was one death during follow-up, from acute myeloid leukemia. One patient (9%) with a type III injury presented with a symptomatic recurrent biliary stricture 6 months after repair, and was successfully managed by percutaneous biliary dilatation, using a combination of transhepatic and jejunal loop puncture.

In addition, multicolor-FISH and array-comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) were applied to characterize clonal chromosome aberrations in more detail. Between January 2004 and December 2005, we prospectively analyzed 90 samples of 73 patients with proven or suspected CBMF disorders enrolled in a German Study Network of CBMF diseases. Clonal aberrations could be identified in four of 73 patients examined. In one child with congenital thrombocytopenia, Jacobsen syndrome [del(11)(q24)c] was diagnosed, and thus a CBMF could be excluded. In a girl with Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, two independent clones, one with an isochromosome i(7)(q10), another with a complex aberrant karyotype, were identified. Simultaneously, transition into a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) occurred. The brother, who was also afflicted with Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, showed an isochromosome i(7q) as a single aberration. In the fourth patient with severe congenital neutropenia, an add(21)(q22) marker containing a low-level amplification of the AML1 gene was identified at the time point of transition into acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). In summary, we suggest that follow-up of patients with CBMF using chromosome and FISH analyses will be helpful for the early detection of transition into MDS or AML and thus should be an integral part of the clinical management of these patients.","['Gohring, G', 'Karow, A', 'Steinemann, D', 'Wilkens, L', 'Lichter, P', 'Zeidler, C', 'Niemeyer, C', 'Welte, K', 'Schlegelberger, B']","['Gohring G', 'Karow A', 'Steinemann D', 'Wilkens L', 'Lichter P', 'Zeidler C', 'Niemeyer C', 'Welte K', 'Schlegelberger B']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomal Instability', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human/genetics', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Jacobsen Distal 11q Deletion Syndrome/complications/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications/congenital/*genetics', 'Neutropenia/complications/congenital/*genetics']",2007/07/27 09:00,2008/01/30 09:00,['2007/07/27 09:00'],"['2007/04/12 00:00 [received]', '2007/06/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/07/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/30 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/27 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2007 Oct;86(10):733-9. doi: 10.1007/s00277-007-0337-z.

Mechanisms of resistance to Bortezomib are undefined. Myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) is an antiapoptotic protein, which protects tumor cells against spontaneous and chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. In MM, specific downregulation of Mcl-1 induces apoptosis. Here, we examined the role of Mcl-1 in Bortezomib- and doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. We demonstrate that Bortezomib, but not doxorubicin, triggers caspase-dependent generation of a 28 kDa Mcl-1-fragment, in several MM cell lines, including MM.1S cells. Conversely, transient transfection of MM.1S cells with a previously reported 28 kDa Mcl-1(128-350) fragment, but not with the Mcl-1(1-127) fragment, induces apoptosis. Therefore, both downregulation of full-length antiapoptotic Mcl-1, as well as Bortezomib-induced generation of Mcl-1(128-350) cleaved protein, contribute to MM cell apoptosis. To verify further these findings, we next compared effects triggered by Bortezomib, doxorubicin and melphalan in Mcl-1(wt/wt) and Mcl-1(Delta/null) murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Our results show that Bortezomib, but not doxorubicin or melphalan, triggers Mcl-1 cleavage in Mcl-1(wt/wt), but not Mcl-1(Delta/null) MEFs and induces sub-G(1) phase cells; caspase-3 and -9, and PARP cleavage as well as morphological signs of apoptosis. Taken together, these results support an important role of Mcl-1 and a Mcl-1 fragment in Bortezomib-induced cell death in general, and in MM in particular. To prevent relapse of MM in patients treated with Bortezomib, we therefore recommend the combination of Bortezomib with agents that induce MM cell death independent of Mcl-1.","['Podar, K', 'Gouill, S L', 'Zhang, J', 'Opferman, J T', 'Zorn, E', 'Tai, Y-T', 'Hideshima, T', 'Amiot, M', 'Chauhan, D', 'Harousseau, J-L', 'Anderson, K C']","['Podar K', 'Gouill SL', 'Zhang J', 'Opferman JT', 'Zorn E', 'Tai YT', 'Hideshima T', 'Amiot M', 'Chauhan D', 'Harousseau JL', 'Anderson KC']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Boronic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Melphalan/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Multiple Myeloma/*enzymology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Protease Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pyrazines/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation']",2007/07/27 09:00,2008/02/29 09:00,['2007/07/27 09:00'],"['2007/07/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/29 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/27 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2008 Jan 31;27(6):721-31. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1210679.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the immunophenotypic subtype profiles of Iranian patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and its association to disease outcome. METHODS: In this study, a total of 60 Iranian patients with ALL were immunophenotyped by flow cytometry using a panel of monoclonal antibodies specific for CD2, CD3, CD5, CD10, CD13, CD14, CD19, CD20, CD33, CD34, CD45, HLA-DR and TdT molecules. RESULTS: The samples were initially categorized into T-ALL (n=9), B-ALL (n=50) and mixed lineage (n=1) based on the expression patterns of CD3 and CD19 molecules. B-ALL patients could further be classified into four subtypes, including Pro-B (n=7, 11.7%), Pre-B I (n=28, 46.7%), Pre-B II (n=13, 21.7%) and immature/mature B cells (n=2, 3.3%) on the basis of expression of CD10, CD19, CD20, HLA-DR and TdT. Clinical manifestations and laboratory findings of the patients did not reveal association with immunophenotypic subtypes of ALL, with the exception of mediastinal mass and WBC count at the time of diagnosis which were found to be significantly higher in patients with T-ALL compared with B-ALL (p=0.001 and 0.014), respectively.

We gave 173 patients two consecutive courses of high-dose chemotherapy consisting of 700 mg of carboplatin per square meter of body-surface area and 750 mg of etoposide per square meter, each for 3 consecutive days, and each followed by an infusion of autologous peripheral-blood hematopoietic stem cells; the other 11 patients received a single course of this treatment. In 110 patients, cytoreduction with one or two courses of vinblastine plus ifosfamide plus cisplatin preceded the high-dose chemotherapy. RESULTS: Of the 184 patients, 116 had complete remission of disease without relapse during a median follow-up of 48 months (range, 14 to 118). Of the 135 patients who received the treatment as second-line therapy, 94 were disease-free during follow-up; 22 of 49 patients who received treatment as third-line or later therapy were disease-free. Of 40 patients with cancer that was refractory to standard-dose platinum, 18 were disease-free. A total of 98 of 144 patients who had platinum-sensitive disease were disease-free, and 26 of 35 patients with seminoma and 90 of 149 patients with nonseminomatous germ-cell tumors were disease-free. Among the 184 patients, there were three drug-related deaths during therapy. Acute leukemia developed in three additional patients after therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Testicular tumors are potentially curable by means of high-dose chemotherapy plus hematopoietic stem-cell rescue, even when this regimen is used as third-line or later therapy or in patients with platinum-refractory disease.","['Einhorn, Lawrence H', 'Williams, Stephen D', 'Chamness, Amy', 'Brames, Mary J', 'Perkins, Susan M', 'Abonour, Rafat']","['Einhorn LH', 'Williams SD', 'Chamness A', 'Brames MJ', 'Perkins SM', 'Abonour R']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,"['6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/drug therapy/therapy', 'Neoplasms, Germ Cell and Embryonal/*drug therapy/mortality/secondary/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Salvage Therapy', 'Survival Analysis', 'Testicular Neoplasms/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology/therapy']",2007/07/27 09:00,2007/08/01 09:00,['2007/07/27 09:00'],"['2007/07/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/01 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/27 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,N Engl J Med. 2007 Jul 26;357(4):340-8. doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa067749.,"['357/4/340 [pii]', '10.1056/NEJMoa067749 [doi]']",['Copyright 2007 Massachusetts Medical Society.'],"['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, USA. leinhorn@iupui.edu']",,,"['N Engl J Med. 2007 Oct 25;357(17):1771-2; author reply 1773-4.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A panel of human melanoma cell lines and fresh melanoma isolates was assessed for their sensitivity to apoptosis induced by the MEK inhibitor U0126. The apoptotic pathways and regulatory mechanisms involved were examined by use of the inhibitor and small interfering RNA (siRNA) techniques. RESULTS: Inhibition of MEK induced apoptosis in the majority of melanoma cell lines through a mitochondrial pathway that was associated with the activation of Bax and Bak, release of mitochondrial apoptogenic proteins, and activation of caspase-3. However, apoptosis was independent of caspases and instead was associated with mitochondrial release of AIF as shown by the inhibition of apoptosis when AIF was knocked down by siRNA. Inhibition of MEK resulted in the up-regulation of the BH3-only proteins PUMA and Bim and down-regulation of the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1. These changes were critical for the induction of apoptosis by U0126 as siRNA knockdown of PUMA or Bim inhibited apoptosis, whereas siRNA knockdown of Mcl-1 increased apoptosis particularly in the apoptosis-resistant cell lines. CONCLUSIONS: Apoptosis of melanoma cells induced by the inhibition of the MEK/ERK pathway is mediated by the up-regulation/activation of PUMA and Bim and down-regulation of Mcl-1. Release of AIF rather than the activation of caspases seems to be the mediator of apoptosis. Our results suggest that cotargeting Mcl-1 and the MEK/ERK pathway may further improve treatment results in melanoma.","['Wang, Yu Fang', 'Jiang, Chen Chen', 'Kiejda, Kelly Anne', 'Gillespie, Susan', 'Zhang, Xu Dong', 'Hersey, Peter']","['Wang YF', 'Jiang CC', 'Kiejda KA', 'Gillespie S', 'Zhang XD', 'Hersey P']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BAD protein, human)', '0 (BAK1 protein, human)', '0 (BBC3 protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-Associated Death Protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BRAF protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*physiology', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Caspases/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Melanoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/*physiology', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/physiology', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*physiology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*physiology', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/physiology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/physiology', 'bcl-Associated Death Protein/physiology']",2007/07/27 09:00,2007/09/26 09:00,['2007/07/27 09:00'],"['2007/07/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/26 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/27 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2007 Aug 15;13(16):4934-42. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-0665.

Reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens extend HSCT to older patients and those with comorbidities who would otherwise not be suitable candidates for HSCT.

We evaluated outcomes of 64 CML patients with advanced-phase disease (80% beyond first chronic phase), not eligible for myeloablative preparative regimens due to older age or comorbid conditions, who were treated with fludarabine-based RIC regimens. Donor type was matched related (n =30), 1 antigen-mismatched related (n =4), or matched unrelated (n =30). With median follow-up of 7 years, overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were 33% and 20%, respectively, at 5 years.

Moreover, the CXCR5-CXCL13 axis plays a unique role in trafficking and homing of B1 cells. Here, we report that chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B cells express high levels of functional CXCR5. CXCR5 expression levels were similar on CLL B cells and normal CD5+ B cells, and higher compared with normal CD5- B cells, follicular B-helper T cells (T(FH) cells), or neoplastic B cells from other B-cell neoplasias. Stimulation of CLL cells with CXCL13 induces actin polymerization, CXCR5 endocytosis, chemotaxis, and prolonged activation of p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinases. Anti-CXCR5 antibodies, pertussis toxin, and wortmannin inhibited chemotaxis to CXCL13, demonstrating the importance of Gi proteins and PI3 kinases for CXCR5 signaling. Moreover, CLL patients had significantly higher CXCL13 serum levels than volunteers, and CXCL13 levels correlated with beta2 microglobulin. We detected CXCL13 mRNA expression by nurselike cells, and high levels of CXCL13 protein in supernatants of CLL nurselike cell cultures. By immunohistochemistry, we detected CXCL13+ expression by CD68+ macrophages in situ within CLL lymph nodes. These data suggest that CXCR5 plays a role in CLL cell positioning and cognate interactions between CLL and CXCL13-secreting CD68+ accessory cells in lymphoid tissues.","['Burkle, Andrea', 'Niedermeier, Matthias', 'Schmitt-Graff, Annette', 'Wierda, William G', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Burger, Jan A']","['Burkle A', 'Niedermeier M', 'Schmitt-Graff A', 'Wierda WG', 'Keating MJ', 'Burger JA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (CD68 antigen, human)', '0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (CXCL13 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL13)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR5)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Actins/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/metabolism', 'CD5 Antigens/metabolism', 'Chemokine CXCL12/metabolism', 'Chemokine CXCL13/blood/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte/physiology', 'Endocytosis', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/metabolism', 'Receptors, CXCR5/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Up-Regulation']",2007/07/27 09:00,2007/12/14 09:00,['2007/07/27 09:00'],"['2007/07/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/27 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Nov 1;110(9):3316-25. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-05-089409.

Consequently, these signals are included in all HIV-1 vectors. Here, we provide evidence demonstrating that these elements in such vectors are not absolutely required for vector transduction. In single-cycle infection assays, vectors with Psi deleted (DeltaPsi) were transduced with only a two- to fivefold reduction compared to the wild type. The transduction of DeltaPsi showed typical products of reverse transcription and vector integration; however, in vitro and in vivo dimerization assays demonstrated the lack of normal dimerization of the DeltaPsi vector. The reduction in transduction reflected a similar reduction in packaging. Nevertheless, a relatively high specificity of packaging was retained, as the DeltaPsi vector was encapsidated at a level 4 orders of magnitude higher than that for overexpressed, nonretroviral cellular mRNA and 15 orders of magnitude higher than that for a murine leukemia virus (MLV)-based vector, all containing the same reporter gene, suggesting a Psi-independent mechanism of packaging. The fact that HIV-1 and MLV vectors were encapsidated with a much higher level of efficiency than the cellular RNA suggests that the genomic RNAs of different retroviruses share common features and/or pathways that target them to encapsidation. Overall, these results formally demonstrate that packaging and dimerization signals are not required for the early stages of infection and can be deleted without risking a total loss of vector transduction. Deletion of these signals should enhance the safety of these vectors.","['Laham-Karam, Nihay', 'Bacharach, Eran']","['Laham-Karam N', 'Bacharach E']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Capsid/metabolism', 'Dimerization', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'HIV-1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Sequence Deletion', '*Transduction, Genetic', 'Virus Assembly/*genetics']",2007/07/27 09:00,2007/11/07 09:00,['2007/07/27 09:00'],"['2007/07/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/27 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2007 Oct;81(19):10687-98. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00653-07.

OBJECTIVE: We determined the association of cranial radiotherapy (CRT) and/or sex with levels of total, regional, and ectopic fat storage, metabolic risk, IGF-I, and leptin in adult ALL survivors. DESIGN, SETTING, PATIENTS: A cross-sectional analysis of 52 male (15 CRT treated) and 62 female (24 CRT treated) young adult ALL survivors was conducted. MAIN OUTCOMES: We assessed levels of visceral fat, sc abdominal and thigh fat, and liver and muscle fat using computed tomography, total fat and lean body mass using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, and IGF-I and leptin levels by radioimmunoassay. RESULTS: Controlled for age and race, ALL survivors treated with CRT had higher levels of abdominal and visceral fat, body fat percentage, metabolic risk (insulin resistance and dyslipidemia), and leptin but lower lean mass and IGF-I levels than non-CRT survivors (P </= 0.05 for each). Levels of IGF-I were inversely associated with total, abdominal, and visceral fat in both sexes (P < 0.05 for each). Female ALL survivors had less lean mass and visceral fat but higher total and sc abdominal fat than males (P < 0.05 for each). Neither sex nor CRT was associated with muscle and/or liver fat content (P > 0.1).

Telomeres form a protective loop structure (t-loop), which is thought to prevent them from being recognized as a double-strand break. Approximately 10% of human tumors prevent shortening of their telomeres by using a recombination-mediated alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) mechanism. ALT-positive human cells contain extrachromosomal telomere repeat (ECTR) DNA that may either be circular or linear. It has been proposed that ECTR may be generated by recombination events involving the t-loop. A proportion of the cells within ALT-positive cell populations contain promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies that contain telomeric DNA and telomere-binding proteins that are called ALT-associated PML bodies (APB). Although the presence of APBs is very useful for determining whether tumors and cell lines use the ALT mechanism, the function of APBs is unknown. It has previously been shown that telomeric DNA is particularly susceptible to damage by hydrogen peroxide and N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine. We report here that these DNA-damaging agents induce both linear and circular ECTR DNA in ALT cells and increase the proportion of cells that contain APBs. We partially purified APBs and showed that the telomeric repeat DNA they contain is predominantly linear. We propose that a function of APBs is to sequester linear telomeric DNA.","['Fasching, Clare L', 'Neumann, Axel A', 'Muntoni, Alessandra', 'Yeager, Thomas R', 'Reddel, Roger R']","['Fasching CL', 'Neumann AA', 'Muntoni A', 'Yeager TR', 'Reddel RR']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '12H3O2UGSF (Methylnitronitrosoguanidine)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus Structures/genetics/*metabolism', 'Chromosomes, Human', 'DNA Damage/*drug effects', 'DNA Repair', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'Intranuclear Inclusion Bodies/genetics/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Methylnitronitrosoguanidine/pharmacology', 'Telomere/*metabolism']",2007/07/27 09:00,2007/09/12 09:00,['2007/07/27 09:00'],"['2007/07/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/27 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2007 Aug 1;67(15):7072-7. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-1556.

Decreased 8-oxoguanine repair capacity due to variant forms of the OGG1 gene is a common feature of numerous cancer cell lines. One such cell line, human KG-1 leukemia cells, has previously been demonstrated to be deficient in the excision of 8-oxoguanine from oxidatively damaged DNA. KG-1 cells have a homozygous R229Q amino acid substitution in OGG1 that has been presumed to alter the function of OGG1 and result in elevated levels of genomic 8-oxoG and hypersensitivity to 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine nucleoside and ionizing radiation observed in KG-1 cells. METHODS: We characterized the enzymatic activity of R229Q OGG1 and the effect of the enzyme on cell survival following treatment with DNA damaging agents. RESULTS: R229Q OGG1 had activity similar to the wild-type enzyme, yet was easily heat inactivated at physiological temperature. R229Q OGG1 expressed in human cells had significantly lower activity than wild-type OGG1 and was also highly thermolabile. Expression of R229Q OGG1 sensitized KG-1 cells to killing by menadione and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine, but not ionizing radiation. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that decreased 8-oxoguanine repair in KG-1 is due to thermolability of R229Q OGG1 and that the enzyme variant increases cellular susceptibility to killing resulting from oxidative DNA damage. The R229Q OGG1 variant is a validated polymorphism prevalent in world populations and not an isolated mutation in KG-1 cells, thus the R229Q OGG1 allele may be a novel marker for cancer susceptibility.","['Hill, Jeff W', 'Evans, Michele K']","['Hill JW', 'Evans MK']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",England,Cancer Detect Prev,Cancer detection and prevention,7704778,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Vitamins)', '5614-64-2 (8-hydroxyguanine)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', '723JX6CXY5 (Vitamin K 3)', ""88847-89-6 (8-Hydroxy-2'-Deoxyguanosine)"", 'EC 3.2.2.- (DNA Glycosylases)', 'EC 3.2.2.- (oxoguanine glycosylase 1, human)', 'G9481N71RO (Deoxyguanosine)']",IM,"[""8-Hydroxy-2'-Deoxyguanosine"", 'Alleles', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics/radiation effects', 'DNA Damage/drug effects/radiation effects', 'DNA Glycosylases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Deoxyguanosine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression', 'Guanine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/enzymology/genetics/*therapy', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Vitamin K 3/pharmacology', 'Vitamins/pharmacology']",2007/07/27 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2007/07/27 09:00'],"['2007/05/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/07/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/27 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Detect Prev. 2007;31(3):237-43. doi: 10.1016/j.cdp.2007.05.001.

Powerful kernel-based methods are commonly used in microarray analyses with support vector machines (SVMs) to approach a wide range of classification problems. However, the standard vectorial data kernel family (linear, RBF, etc.) that takes vectorial data as input, often fails in prediction if the data come from different platforms or laboratories, due to the low gene overlaps or consistencies between the different datasets. RESULTS: We introduce a new type of kernel called maximum entropy (ME) kernel, which has no pre-defined function but is generated by kernel entropy maximization with sample distance matrices as constraints, into the field of SVM classification of microarray data. We assessed the performance of the ME kernel with three different data: heterogeneous kidney carcinoma, noise-introduced leukemia, and heterogeneous oral cavity carcinoma metastasis data. The results clearly show that the ME kernel is very robust for heterogeneous data containing missing values and high-noise, and gives higher prediction accuracies than the standard kernels, namely, linear, polynomial and RBF. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate its utility in effectively analyzing promiscuous microarray data of rare specimens, e.g., minor diseases or species, that present difficulty in compiling homogeneous data in a single laboratory.","['Fujibuchi, Wataru', 'Kato, Tsuyoshi']","['Fujibuchi W', 'Kato T']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,,IM,"['*Algorithms', '*Databases, Protein', 'Entropy', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Information Storage and Retrieval/methods', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2007/07/27 09:00,2007/10/30 09:00,['2007/07/27 09:00'],"['2007/01/16 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/07/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/30 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/27 09:00 [entrez]']",epublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2007 Jul 26;8:267. doi: 10.1186/1471-2105-8-267.,"['1471-2105-8-267 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2105-8-267 [doi]']",,"['National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Computational Biology Research Center, 2-42 Aomi, Koto-ku, Tokyo 135-0064, Japan. w.fujibuchi@aist.go.jp']",,,,,,20070726,PMC1994960,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our main goal was to determine the significance of elevated TK levels as a relapse marker during follow-up with child patients suffering from acute leukemia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: TK serum levels in 38 children with acute leukemia (34 lymphoblastic, 4 myeloblastic) were determined using radio-receptor analysis (RRA, Immunotech, Prague, USA). All patients included in this study had had TK examined before the start of the treatment and at least twice during the follow-up. RESULTS: Our results showed that TK serum levels at the time of diagnosis were extremely high (78-5826 U/l, median value 403 U/l, normal < 8 U/l), while in remission TK serum levels were much lower (5-80 U/l, median value 31 U/l). During relapse of acute leukemia (5 cases), TK levels increased considerably to measurements between 120-800 U/l (median value 324 U/l). The study showed that the elevation of TK serum levels during follow-up was a helpful marker for the recognition of an early stage of relapse and in some cases occurred as early as one month before the appearance of clinical signs. Sensitivity in this case was 87% and thus TK serum levels seem to be a very good parameter during follow-up because of acceptable sensitivity, low cost (4 $/sample) and the elimination of a requirement for screening of bone marrow samples. CONCLUSION: While TK serum levels were helpful in predicting relapse during follow-up, it is necessary to note that they did not correlate with prognosis in our group of patients during the time of the initial diagnosis of acute leukemia.","['Votava, Tomas', 'Topolcan, Ondrej', 'Holubec, Lubos Jr', 'Cerna, Zdenka', 'Sasek, Lumir', 'Finek, Jindrich', 'Kormunda, Stanislav']","['Votava T', 'Topolcan O', 'Holubec L Jr', 'Cerna Z', 'Sasek L', 'Finek J', 'Kormunda S']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Blood Sedimentation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Ferritins/blood', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunoassay', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*blood/*pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*blood', 'Prognosis', 'ROC Curve', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Thymidine Kinase/*blood']",2007/07/26 09:00,2007/09/20 09:00,['2007/07/26 09:00'],"['2007/07/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/20 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/26 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2007 Jul-Aug;27(4A):1925-8.,,,"['Department of Pediatrics, Charles University, Faculty of Medicine and Faculty Hospital, Pilsen, Czech Republic.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: K562 cells were cultured in different concentrations of anti-VEGF antibody. The recombinant eukaryotic expression plasmid (pcDNA3-RZ) containing anti-VEGF hairpin ribozyme gene and the vector-alone were introduced into K562 cells by lipofectamine mediation. Cell proliferative capacity was determined by MTT, colony formation assay and cells cycles analysis. Cell apoptosis was assayed by DNA ladder and Annexin V -FITC/PI flow cytometry. RESULTS: The anti-VEGF antibody was able to inhibit growth and induce apoptosis of K562 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Exposure to anti-VEGF antibody at 0. 165 microg/ml for 72 hours, the cells exhibited typical DNA ladders. The apoptosis rate peaked at antibody concentration of 0. 825 microg/ml. RT-PCR showed a decrease of MRP and TOPO II expression but a relative constant expression of GST. The introduction of exogenous anti-VEGF ribozyme gene resulted in a decrease of the proliferative capacity and colony forming efficiency from (30.5 +/- 3.3) % in control group to (16.3 +/- 2.8) % in K562/RZ group, higher G1 and lower S ratio in cell cycle distribution in comparison with the control groups.

In addition to lymphoproliferative disorders the expression of CD30 was found in both activated CD8+ and CD4+ Th2 cells which lead to the activation of B-cells and consequently to the inhibition of the Th1-type cellular immunity. The membrane-bound CD30 molecule can be proteolytically cleaved, thereby generating a soluble form (sCD30) of about 85 kDa. Low serum levels of soluble CD30 were found in healthy humans, whereas increased sCD30 serum concentrations were detected under pathophysiological situations such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, certain viral infections and adult T cell leukaemia/lymphoma. In addition, it has recently been suggested that pre- or post-transplant levels of sCD30 represent a biomarker for graft rejection associated with an impaired outcome for transplanted patients.

We show closer correlation with haematopoietic reconstitution when the CD34+ cell dose is calculated using ideal (IBW) rather than actual (ABW) body weight in 218 patients receiving peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) autograft for haematological malignancy. ABW was 21% greater than IBW thus the median CD34+ dose of 5.0 x 10(6)/kg (ABW) rose to 6.1 x 10(6)/kg when calculated by IBW. Neutrophils reached 0.5 x 10(9)/l in 11 days (range 8-21), while platelets reached 20 x 10(9)/l unsupported in 12 days (range 7-38). For both neutrophil and platelet engraftment, a greater inverse correlation was seen when IBW was used to calculate stem cell dose (r2=0.082 vs r2=0.104 for neutrophils and r2=0.085 vs r2=0.135 for platelets). Those non-myeloma patients who failed to achieve a CD34+ dose of 4 x 10(6) cells/kg by ABW but did so by IBW achieved neutrophil and platelet engraftment not significantly different from those who achieved that stem cell dose by both methods. This was not confirmed in patients treated for myeloma, possibly owing to inaccurate IBW in patients with skeletal height loss. We confirm that calculation of CD34+ cell dose by IBW safely predicts engraftment for patients with haematological malignancies other than myeloma undergoing PBSC autograft.","['Maclean, P S', 'Parker, A N', 'McQuaker, I G', 'Clark, A D', 'Farrell, E', 'Douglas, K W']","['Maclean PS', 'Parker AN', 'McQuaker IG', 'Clark AD', 'Farrell E', 'Douglas KW']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/blood', 'Antigens, CD34/blood', '*Body Weight', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/blood/pathology/*therapy', 'Neutrophils', 'Patient Selection', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Reference Values', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Autologous/*methods', 'Treatment Outcome']",2007/07/25 09:00,2007/10/25 09:00,['2007/07/25 09:00'],"['2007/07/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/25 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/25 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2007 Oct;40(7):665-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1705789.

We hypothesized that like ERG, BAALC expression might be of prognostic significance in acute T-lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and that ERG and BAALC expression together would better identify the patient's risk profile. PATIENTS AND METHODS: ERG and BAALC mRNA expression were determined by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in 153 adults with T-ALL. Patients were designated low or high ERG expressers and low or high BAALC expressers. RESULTS: High BAALC expression correlated with a higher frequency of early T-ALL (P < .0001), CD34 positivity (P < .0001), coexpression of myeloid markers (P = .0001), and high ERG expression (P = .03). High BAALC compared with low BAALC patients had an inferior relapse-free survival (RFS; P = .0008) and overall survival (OS; P = .0001). In contrast, patients with low expression of both ERG and BAALC (representing 41% of all T-ALL patients) had the most favorable outcome (P < .0001; 4-year RFS: low ERG/low BAALC 81%; P < .0001; 4-year OS: low ERG/low BAALC 69%). On multivariable analysis, low ERG/low BAALC expression was of independent favorable prognostic significance (RFS, P = .001; OS, P = .003). CONCLUSION: Low expression of both ERG and BAALC identifies T-ALL patients with a distinctly favorable long-term outcome.","['Baldus, Claudia D', 'Martus, Peter', 'Burmeister, Thomas', 'Schwartz, Stefan', 'Gokbuget, Nicola', 'Bloomfield, Clara D', 'Hoelzer, Dieter', 'Thiel, Eckhard', 'Hofmann, Wolf K']","['Baldus CD', 'Martus P', 'Burmeister T', 'Schwartz S', 'Gokbuget N', 'Bloomfield CD', 'Hoelzer D', 'Thiel E', 'Hofmann WK']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (BAALC protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ERG protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Organotechnetium Compounds)', '0 (Oximes)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcriptional Regulator ERG)', '0 (technetium Tc 99m 4,9-diaza-3,3,10,10-tetramethyldodecan-2,11-dione dioxime)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Organotechnetium Compounds', 'Oximes', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/mortality', 'Survival Rate', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics', 'Transcriptional Regulator ERG']",2007/07/25 09:00,2007/09/13 09:00,['2007/07/25 09:00'],"['2007/07/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/13 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/25 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2007 Aug 20;25(24):3739-45. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2007.11.5253.

However, its use as a chemotherapeutic drug has been limited by its deleterious side effects of systemic shock and widespread inflammatory responses. Some nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, such as sodium salicylate, have been shown to have a chemopreventive role in certain forms of cancer. Here, we reveal that sodium salicylate selectively enhances the apoptotic effects of TNF in human erythroleukemia cells but does not affect primary human lymphocytes or monocytes. Sodium salicylate did not affect the intracellular distribution of TNF receptors (TNFRs) but stimulated cell surface TNFR2 shedding. Erythroleukemia cells were shown to possess markedly greater basal NF-kappaB responses and elevated Fas-associated protein with death domain-like IL-1 converting enzyme (FLIP) levels. Sodium salicylate achieved its effects by reducing the elevated NF-kappaB responsiveness and FLIP levels and restoring the apoptotic response of TNF rather than the proliferative/proinflammatory effects of the cytokine in these cancer cells. Inhibition of NF-kappaB or FLIP levels in human erythroleukemia cells by pharmacological or molecular-biological means also resulted in switching the character of these cells from a TNF-responsive proliferative phenotype into an apoptotic one. These findings expose that the enhanced proliferative nature of human leukemia cells is caused by elevated NF-kappaB and FLIP responses and basal levels, reversible by sodium salicylate to allow greater apoptotic responsiveness of cytotoxic stimuli such as TNF. Such findings provide insight into the molecular mechanisms by which human leukemia cells can switch from a proliferative into an apoptotic phenotype.","['Rae, Colin', 'Langa, Susana', 'Tucker, Steven J', 'MacEwan, David J']","['Rae C', 'Langa S', 'Tucker SJ', 'MacEwan DJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Salicylates)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factors)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/metabolism', 'Salicylates/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factors/*pharmacology']",2007/07/25 09:00,2007/09/22 09:00,['2007/07/25 09:00'],"['2007/07/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/25 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2007 Jul 31;104(31):12790-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0701437104.

To clarify the basis for GSI resistance in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), we studied T-ALL cell lines with constitutive expression of the NOTCH intracellular domain (NICD), but that lacked C-terminal truncating mutations in NOTCH1. Each of the seven cell lines examined and 7 of 81 (8.6%) primary T-ALL samples harbored either a mutation or homozygous deletion of the gene FBW7, a ubiquitin ligase implicated in NICD turnover. Indeed, we show that FBW7 mutants cannot bind to the NICD and define the phosphodegron region of the NICD required for FBW7 binding. Although the mutant forms of FBW7 were still able to bind to MYC, they do not target it for degradation, suggesting that stabilization of both NICD and its principle downstream target, MYC, may contribute to transformation in leukemias with FBW7 mutations. In addition, we show that all seven leukemic cell lines with FBW7 mutations were resistant to the MRK-003 GSI. Most of these resistant lines also failed to down-regulate the mRNA levels of the NOTCH targets MYC and DELTEX1 after treatment with MRK-003, implying that residual NOTCH signaling in T-ALLs with FBW7 mutations contributes to GSI resistance.","[""O'Neil, Jennifer"", 'Grim, Jonathan', 'Strack, Peter', 'Rao, Sudhir', 'Tibbitts, Deanne', 'Winter, Christopher', 'Hardwick, James', 'Welcker, Markus', 'Meijerink, Jules P', 'Pieters, Rob', 'Draetta, Giulio', 'Sears, Rosalie', 'Clurman, Bruce E', 'Look, A Thomas']","[""O'Neil J"", 'Grim J', 'Strack P', 'Rao S', 'Tibbitts D', 'Winter C', 'Hardwick J', 'Welcker M', 'Meijerink JP', 'Pieters R', 'Draetta G', 'Sears R', 'Clurman BE', 'Look AT']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (F-Box Proteins)', '0 (F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7)', '0 (FBXW7 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 3.4.- (Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'F-Box Proteins/*genetics', 'F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, Notch/*genetics/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*genetics']",2007/07/25 09:00,2007/09/26 09:00,['2007/07/25 09:00'],"['2007/07/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/26 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/25 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2007 Aug 6;204(8):1813-24. doi: 10.1084/jem.20070876.

Furthermore, we identify inactivating FBW7 mutations in a large fraction of human T-ALL lines and primary leukemias. These mutations abrogate the binding of FBW7 not only to NOTCH1 but also to the two other characterized targets, c-Myc and cyclin E. The majority of the FBW7 mutations were present during relapse, and they were associated with NOTCH1 HD mutations. Interestingly, most of the T-ALL lines harboring FBW7 mutations were resistant to gamma-secretase inhibitor treatment and this resistance appeared to be related to the stabilization of the c-Myc protein.

The CTL activity of spleen cells from the immunized mice was assessed with LDH release test. RESULTS: The pVbcr-abl/mIL-7 and pVbcr-abl-immunized BALB/c mice elicited higher specific antibodies to p210bcr-abl protein. The specific antibody level of former group was higher than that in latter group, but the difference was statistically not significant.

In the Bovine Leukemia Virus-induced ovine leukemia model, silencing of viral gene expression has been proposed as a mechanism leading to immune evasion. However, whether proviral expression in tumors is completely suppressed in vivo was not conclusively demonstrated. Therefore, we studied viral expression in two selected experimentally-infected sheep, the virus or the disease of which had features that made it possible to distinguish tumor cells from their nontransformed counterparts. RESULTS: In the first animal, we observed the emergence of a genetically modified provirus simultaneously with leukemia onset. We found a Tax-mutated (TaxK303) replication-deficient provirus in the malignant B-cell clone while functional provirus (TaxE303) had been consistently monitored over the 17-month aleukemic period. In the second case, both non-transformed and transformed BLV-infected cells were present at the same time, but at distinct sites. While there was potentially-active provirus in the non-leukemic blood B-cell population, as demonstrated by ex-vivo culture and injection into naive sheep, virus expression was completely suppressed in the malignant B-cells isolated from the lymphoid tumors despite the absence of genetic alterations in the proviral genome. These observations suggest that silencing of viral genes, including the oncoprotein Tax, is associated with tumor onset. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that silencing is critical for tumor progression and identify two distinct mechanisms-genetic and epigenetic-involved in the complete suppression of virus and Tax expression. We demonstrate that, in contrast to systems that require sustained oncogene expression, the major viral transforming protein Tax can be turned-off without reversing the transformed phenotype. We propose that suppression of viral gene expression is a contributory factor in the impairment of immune surveillance and the uncontrolled proliferation of the BLV-infected tumor cell.","['Merimi, Makram', 'Klener, Pavel', 'Szynal, Maud', 'Cleuter, Yvette', 'Bagnis, Claude', 'Kerkhofs, Pierre', 'Burny, Arsene', 'Martiat, Philippe', 'Van den Broeke, Anne']","['Merimi M', 'Klener P', 'Szynal M', 'Cleuter Y', 'Bagnis C', 'Kerkhofs P', 'Burny A', 'Martiat P', 'Van den Broeke A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Leukemia/genetics/*veterinary', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'Sheep/virology', 'Sheep Diseases/genetics']",2007/07/25 09:00,2007/09/26 09:00,['2007/07/25 09:00'],"['2007/03/07 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/07/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/26 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/25 09:00 [entrez]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2007 Jul 23;4:51. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-4-51.,"['1742-4690-4-51 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-4-51 [doi]']",,"['Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institut Jules Bordet, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium. mmerimi@hotmail.com']",,,,,,20070723,PMC1948017,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is one of the most promising candidates for new cancer therapeutics. Combined treatment with nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), a lipoxygenase inhibitor, and TRAIL markedly induced apoptosis in Jurkat T-cell leukemia cells at suboptimal concentrations for each agent. The combined treatment efficiently activated caspase-3, -8 and -10, and Bid. The underling mechanism by which NDGA enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis was examined. NDGA did not change the expression levels of anti-apoptotic factors, Bcl-x(L), Bcl-2, cIAP-1, XIAP and survivin. The expression of death receptor-related genes was investigated and it was found that NDGA specifically up-regulated the expression of death receptor 5 (DR5) at mRNA and protein levels. Down-regulation of DR5 by small interfering RNA prevented the sensitizing effect of NDGA on TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, NDGA sensitized prostate cancer and colorectal cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. In contrast, NDGA neither enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis nor up-regulated DR5 expression in normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Another lipoxygenase inhibitor, AA861, also up-regulated DR5 and sensitized Jurkat and DU145 cells to TRAIL. These results indicate that lipoxygenase inhibitors augment the apoptotic efficiency of TRAIL through DR5 up-regulation in malignant tumor cells, and raise the possibility that the combination of lipoxygenase inhibitor and TRAIL is a promising strategy for malignant tumor treatment.","['Yoshida, Tatsushi', 'Shiraishi, Takumi', 'Horinaka, Mano', 'Nakata, Susumu', 'Yasuda, Takashi', 'Goda, Ahmed E', 'Wakada, Miki', 'Mizutani, Yoichi', 'Miki, Tsuneharu', 'Nishikawa, Akiyoshi', 'Sakai, Toshiyuki']","['Yoshida T', 'Shiraishi T', 'Horinaka M', 'Nakata S', 'Yasuda T', 'Goda AE', 'Wakada M', 'Mizutani Y', 'Miki T', 'Nishikawa A', 'Sakai T']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments)', '0 (Lipoxygenase Inhibitors)', '0 (Mutant Chimeric Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '7BO8G1BYQU (Masoprocol)', '80809-81-0 (2,3,5-trimethyl-6-(12-hydroxy-5,10-dodecadiynyl)-1,4-benzoquinone)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics/physiology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Benzoquinones/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments/genetics', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/enzymology/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Lipoxygenase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Masoprocol/pharmacology', 'Mutant Chimeric Proteins/physiology', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis/*genetics/physiology', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*physiology', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects/genetics']",2007/07/25 09:00,2007/10/18 09:00,['2007/07/25 09:00'],"['2007/07/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/18 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/25 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2007 Sep;98(9):1417-23. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2007.00559.x.

This study aims to assess the cost-effectiveness of stem cell transplantation from either cord blood or bone marrow/peripheral blood compared with no transplantation in adult patients with acute leukemias not expected to be cured with chemotherapy. METHODS: A systematic review was performed to estimate the efficacy of unrelated cord blood and bone marrow/peripheral blood stem cells (BM/PBSC) transplantations in adults with acute leukemia. A Markov decision analysis model using Monte Carlo simulations was used to calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: The estimated cumulative survival at 1 and 10 years were 27.9% and 14%, respectively, for cord blood recipients and 47% and 17.7%, respectively, for BM/PBSC recipients. Using conservative assumptions, the cost per life-year gained compared with no transplantation was US 16,346 dollars (95% CI 8695 dollars, 38,006 dollars) for BM/PBSC transplantation and US 34,360 dollars (95% CI 23,101 dollars, 89,417 dollars) for cord blood transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Although both types of stem cell transplantations are associated with a high short-term mortality and high cost, the cumulative gains in life-years of survivors can be substantial, resulting in ICERs compared with no transplantation that are usually considered acceptable. However there is less certainty about this conclusion with cord blood transplantation.","['Costa, Vania', 'McGregor, Maurice', 'Laneuville, Pierre', 'Brophy, James M']","['Costa V', 'McGregor M', 'Laneuville P', 'Brophy JM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",United States,Value Health,Value in health : the journal of the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research,100883818,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*economics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/surgery/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Quebec']",2007/07/25 09:00,2007/09/07 09:00,['2007/07/25 09:00'],"['2007/07/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/25 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Value Health. 2007 Jul-Aug;10(4):247-55. doi: 10.1111/j.1524-4733.2007.00180.x.,"['S1098-3015(10)60610-9 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1524-4733.2007.00180.x [doi]']",,"['Technology Assessment Unit, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC, Canada.']",,52,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we evaluated fibrate-mediated potentiation of statin-induced apoptosis in IM-9 human lymphoblasts. 2. The pro-apoptotic effects of statin and fibrate were measured by flow cytometry with biotin-annexin V, followed by addition of avidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate and propidium iodide. Apoptosis was confirmed using karyopyknotic staining, as well as detection of DNA fragmentation and caspase 3 activation. 3. Incubation of IM-9 cells with both 0.1 micromol/L cerivastatin and 200 micromol/L clofibrate had a synergistic effect compared with 0.1 micromol/L cerivastatin alone or 200 micromol/L clofibrate alone. The magnitude of apoptosis induced by various combinations of statins and clofibrate were as follows: cerivastatin (0.1 micromol/L) + clofibrate (200 micromol/L) > atorvastatin (0.1 micromol/L) + clofibrate (200 micromol/L) > pravastatin (100 micromol/L) + clofibrate (200 micromol/L). Other fibrates (bezafibrate and clinofibrate) did not show any synergistic effect. Furthermore, karyopyknotic staining, caspase 3 activation and DNA fragmentation demonstrated synergistic pro-apoptotic effects of statin and fibrate. 4.

Among the differentiation inducers tested, the sensitivity of cancer cells to IFNalpha was most strongly affected by cotylenin A.

Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and its receptor DR5 were early genes induced by the combination of cotylenin A and IFNalpha in carcinoma cells. Neutralizing antibody to TRAIL inhibited apoptosis, suggesting that cotylenin A and IFNalpha cooperatively induced apoptosis through the TRAIL signaling system. Combined treatment preferentially induced apoptosis in human lung cancer cells while sparing normal lung epithelial cells. In an analysis of various cancer cell lines, ovarian cancer cells were highly sensitive to combined treatment with cotylenin A and IFNalpha in terms of the inhibition of cell growth. This treatment was also effective toward ovarian cancer cells that were refractory to cisplatin, and significantly inhibited the growth of ovarian cancer cells as xenografts without apparent adverse effects. Ovarian cancer cells from patients were also sensitive to the combined treatment in primary cultures.

Activated microglia are reported to enhance motor neuron death by secreting neurotoxic cytokines in SOD1-transgenic mice. Recent studies have provided evidence that chronic stimulation leads microglia to acquire an anti-inflammatory phenotype, characterized by activated morphology and induction of neuroprotective and immunoregulatory molecules. However, little information is available on the protective functions of microglia in the ALS spinal cord. To investigate the roles of microglia in ALS, we examined the appearance of ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1-positive (Iba1-positive) microglia as correlated to the disease duration and immunohistochemical expression of neurogrowth factors in the ALS spinal cord. In this study, the number of Ibal-positive rod-like microglia significantly increased in the ALS spinal cord compared to controls. The number of ramified microglia was positively correlated with the number of normal-looking neurons and clinical duration of ALS patients; however, the number of rod-like microglia was not correlated with that of abnormal neurons, nor with the clinical duration of the disease. Some rod-like microglia were positive for anti-insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF II) and anti-leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) immunostaining. Motor neurons in the ALS spinal cords also showed immunore-activity for IGF-II, LIF and the receptors of IGF-II and LIE Taken together, these findings suggest that at least some microglia might have a protective effect on motor neurons in the ALS spinal cord.

SCL is essential for growth of megakaryocyte and erythroid progenitors. We have used a conditional knockout of SCL (SCL(-/Delta)) to examine its function in mast cells, critical effectors of the immune system. SCL(-/Delta) mice had markedly increased numbers of mast-cell progenitors (MCPs) within the peritoneal fluid, bone marrow, and spleen. Fractionation of bone marrow myeloid progenitors demonstrated that these MCPs were present in the megakaryocyte-erythroid-restricted cell fraction. In contrast, unilineage MCPs from control mice were present in the cell fraction with granulocyte-macrophage potential. The aberrant mast-cell differentiation of SCL(-/Delta) megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors was associated with increased expression of GATA-2. Despite increased numbers of MCPs in SCL(-/Delta) mice, numbers of mature tissue mast cells were not increased unless SCL(-/Delta) mice were treated with IL-3 and stem-cell factor. In part, this may be due to a requirement for SCL in normal mast-cell maturation: SCL(-/Delta) mast cells had reduced expression of the high-affinity IgE receptor and mast cell proteases, MCP-5 and MCP-6. Together, these studies suggest that loss of SCL leads to aberrant mast-cell differentiation of megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors.","['Salmon, Jessica M', 'Slater, Nicholas J', 'Hall, Mark A', 'McCormack, Matthew P', 'Nutt, Stephen L', 'Jane, Stephen M', 'Curtis, David J']","['Salmon JM', 'Slater NJ', 'Hall MA', 'McCormack MP', 'Nutt SL', 'Jane SM', 'Curtis DJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Gata2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Erythroid Cells/cytology', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Macrophages/cytology', 'Mast Cells/*cytology/pathology', 'Megakaryocytes/cytology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Stem Cells/cytology', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transfection', 'Up-Regulation']",2007/07/24 09:00,2008/01/10 09:00,['2007/07/24 09:00'],"['2007/07/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Nov 15;110(10):3573-81. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-10-053124.

The transducers of regulated CREB activity (TORCs) were a recently identified family of CREB co-activators that bind to CREB to enhance CRE-mediated transcription. TORC3, a TORC family protein, dramatically enhances Tax-mediated transcription from the LTR. In this study, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using the N-terminal region of TORC3 as bait and identified B-cell chronic lymphatic leukemia protein 3 (BCL3) as a protein interacting with TORC3. This interaction was confirmed by glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments with detection by Western blotting. The ankyrin repeat domain of BCL3 interacted with TORC3. By using a luciferase assay, we determined that BCL3 inhibited transcription from the HTLV-1 LTR in a manner dependent on TORC3. Knockdown of endogenous BCL3 using RNA interference enhanced transcriptional activation of CRE. Treatment with trichostatin A, a potent inhibitor of the transcriptional co-repressor HDAC, partially reversed the inhibitory effect of BCL3. These results suggest that BCL3 functions as a repressor of HTLV-1 LTR-mediated transcription through interactions with TORC3. In addition to stimulating transcription from the HTLV-1 LTR, Tax also enhances BCL3 expression; thus, transcription from the LTR is regulated by both positive and negative feedback mechanisms.","['Hishiki, Takayuki', 'Ohshima, Takayuki', 'Ego, Takeshi', 'Shimotohno, Kunitada']","['Hishiki T', 'Ohshima T', 'Ego T', 'Shimotohno K']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (B-Cell Lymphoma 3 Protein)', '0 (BCL3 protein, human)', '0 (CREB1 protein, human)', '0 (CRTC3 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)']",IM,"['B-Cell Lymphoma 3 Protein', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Gene Products, tax/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Protein Binding/physiology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Repressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects/*physiology', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects/physiology']",2007/07/24 09:00,2007/11/09 09:00,['2007/07/24 09:00'],"['2007/07/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/09 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2007 Sep 28;282(39):28335-28343. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M702656200.

To provide an example of the most recent developments in this field, we have selected several compounds, namely artesunate, homoharringtonine, arsenic trioxide and cantharidin, that are found in natural TCM products and that have the potential for use in cancer therapy. Controlled clinical studies have shown that homoharringtonine and arsenic trioxide can exert profound activity against leukaemia.

RA mediates its biologic effects through specific retinoic acid receptors (RARs) which serve as ligand-activated nuclear transcription factors. The Ca(++)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMKs) are multifunctional serine/threonine kinases that are regulated by Ca(++) signaling. We have observed significant cross-talk between these Ca(++) and RA signaling pathways that regulates the differentiation of myeloid leukemia cells. We observe that CaMKIIgamma is the CaMK that is predominantly expressed in myeloid cells. This enzyme localizes to the promoter of RAR target genes, physically interacts with and phosphorylates RARalpha and inhibits RAR transcriptional activity. KN-62, a pharmacological inhibitor of the CaMKs, enhances both retinoic acid receptor transcriptional activity as well as the terminal in vitro differentiation of certain myeloid leukemia cell lines including HL-60. However, this compound, as well as related synthetic analogs that enhance HL-60 terminal differentiation, fails to inhibit the growth of HL-60 xenografts in NOD-SCID mice likely because of the unfavorable pharmacokinetics displayed by these compounds. Nevertheless, our observations suggest that CaMKIIgamma may provide a new therapeutic target for the treatment of the RA-responsive human myeloid leukemias.","['Si, Jutong', 'Mueller, LeMoyne', 'Schuler, Aaron', 'Simon, Julian', 'Collins, Steven J']","['Si J', 'Mueller L', 'Schuler A', 'Simon J', 'Collins SJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Retracted Publication']",United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Rara protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '63HM46XPOW (KN 62)', '84477-87-2 (1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Type 2)']",IM,"['1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Type 2/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tretinoin/metabolism']",2007/07/24 09:00,2007/12/21 09:00,['2007/07/24 09:00'],"['2007/05/24 00:00 [received]', '2007/05/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/07/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2007 Nov-Dec;39(3):307-15. doi: 10.1016/j.bcmd.2007.05.009.

This study explored the effects of histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) MS-275, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), and LBH589 on both human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-1)-infected T cells (MT-1, -2, -4, and HUT102) and freshly isolated ATL cells harvested from patients.

For example, MS-275, SAHA, and LBH589 effectively inhibited the proliferation of MT-1 cells with ED(50s) of 6microM, 2.5microM, and 100nM, respectively, as measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylithiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay on day 2 of culture. In addition, HDACIs induced cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase and apoptosis of HTLV-1-infected T-cells in conjunction with regulation of apoptosis-related proteins. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that exposure of HTLV-1-infected T-cells to HDACIs for 48h inhibited formation of the NF-kappaB/DNA binding complex. Moreover, we found that HDACIs accumulated NF-kappaB and inhibitory subunit of NF-kappaB in the cytoplasm in conjunction with the down-regulation of NF-kappaB in the nucleus, suggesting that HDACIs blocked nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB.

As an adjuvant treatment, radiotherapy can be effective, but has the potential to damage the child's developing nervous system at a crucial time-with a resultant reduction in IQ and cognitive impairment, endocrinopathy, and risk of second malignancy. We aimed to assess the role of a primary chemotherapy strategy in avoiding or delaying radiotherapy in children younger than 3 years with intracranial ependymoma. METHODS: Between December, 1992, and April, 2003, we enrolled 89 children with ependymoma who were aged 3 years or younger at diagnosis, of whom nine had metastatic disease on pre-operative imaging. After maximal surgical resection, children received alternating blocks of myelosuppressive and non-myelosuppressive chemotherapy every 14 days for an intended duration of 1 year. Radiotherapy was withheld unless local imaging (ie, from the child's treatment centre) showed progressive disease. FINDINGS: 50 of the 80 patients with non-metastatic disease progressed, 34 of whom were irradiated for progression. The 5-year cumulative incidence of freedom from radiotherapy for the 80 non-metastatic patients was 42% (95% CI 32-53). With a median follow-up of 6 years (range 1.5-11.3), overall survival for the non-metastatic patients at 3 years was 79.3% (95% CI 68.5-86.8) and at 5 years 63.4% (51.2-73.4). The corresponding values for event-free survival were 47.6% (36.2-58.1) and 41.8% (30.7-52.6). There was no significant difference in event-free or overall survival between complete and incomplete surgical resection, nor did survival differ according to histological grade, age at diagnosis, or site of disease. In 47 of 59 (80%) patients who progressed, relapse resulted from local control only. The median time to progression for the 59 patients who progressed was 1.6 years (range 0.1-10.2 years). The median age at irradiation of the whole group was 3.6 years (range 1.5-11.9). For the 80 non-metastatic patients, the 23 who achieved the highest relative dose intensity of chemotherapy had the highest post-chemotherapy 5-year overall survival of 76% (95% CI 46.6-91.2), compared with 52% (33.3-68.1) for the 32 patients who achieved the lowest relative dose intensity of chemotherapy. INTERPRETATION: This protocol avoided or delayed radiotherapy in a substantial proportion of children younger than 3 years without compromising survival. These results suggest, therefore, that primary chemotherapy strategies have an important role in the treatment of very young children with intracranial ependymoma.","['Grundy, Richard G', 'Wilne, Sophie A', 'Weston, Claire L', 'Robinson, Kath', 'Lashford, Linda S', 'Ironside, James', 'Cox, Tim', 'Chong, W Kling', 'Campbell, Richard H A', 'Bailey, Cliff C', 'Gattamaneni, Rao', 'Picton, Sue', 'Thorpe, Nicky', 'Mallucci, Conor', 'English, Martin W', 'Punt, Jonathan A G', 'Walker, David A', 'Ellison, David W', 'Machin, David']","['Grundy RG', 'Wilne SA', 'Weston CL', 'Robinson K', 'Lashford LS', 'Ironside J', 'Cox T', 'Chong WK', 'Campbell RH', 'Bailey CC', 'Gattamaneni R', 'Picton S', 'Thorpe N', 'Mallucci C', 'English MW', 'Punt JA', 'Walker DA', 'Ellison DW', 'Machin D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Lancet Oncol,The Lancet.

However, the origin of these hematopoietic precursor cells and the molecular mechanisms underlying their development in the spleen is uncertain. The V617F mutation in the Janus Kinase 2 gene (JAK2(V617F)) was recently shown to be frequently and preferentially present in the peripheral blood and bone marrow cells of CMPD patients, and the resulting dysregulation of its downstream targets is important to CMPD pathogenesis. To determine the occurrence and potential role of JAK2(V617F) in splenic EMH cells, we studied splenectomy specimens from 47 patients with significant EMH. JAK2(V617F) was detected by real-time PCR melting curve analysis in 22 specimens, including 11/17 chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis, 7/7 polycythemia vera, 1/1 essential thrombocythemia, 1/3 CMPD unclassifiable, 1/5 chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, 0/5 chronic myelogenous leukemia, 1/3 myelodysplastic syndrome and 0/6 acute myeloblastic leukemia cases, whereas only the JAK2 wild-type allele was detected in the other 25. Nineteen of 20 cases with adequate bone marrow samples available for molecular examination demonstrated concordant JAK2 genotypes. Laser-capture microdissection was then used to enrich the EMH and non-EMH splenic cell fractions, confirming that the mutant alleles specifically originated from the EMH cells. Furthermore, megakaryocytes in the JAK2(V617F)-positive splenectomy specimens expressed higher levels of Bcl-xL, an antiapoptotic protein and downstream target of the JAK2/STAT5 pathway. Thus, JAK2(V617F) is frequently present in splenic EMH cells associated with CMPD, but it is rarely identified in splenic EMH cells associated with other myeloid disorders. Our results indicate that the precursor cells leading to extramedullary hematopoietic expansion in CMPD most likely originate from the transformed bone marrow clone. Also, dysregulation of downstream pathways such as Bcl-xL may be important to CMPD disease pathogenesis in the spleen.","['Hsieh, Pin-Pen', 'Olsen, Randy J', ""O'Malley, Dennis P"", 'Konoplev, Sergej N', 'Hussong, Jerry W', 'Dunphy, Cherie H', 'Perkins, Sherrie L', 'Cheng, Liang', 'Lin, Pei', 'Chang, Chung-Che']","['Hsieh PP', 'Olsen RJ', ""O'Malley DP"", 'Konoplev SN', 'Hussong JW', 'Dunphy CH', 'Perkins SL', 'Cheng L', 'Lin P', 'Chang CC']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells/chemistry/enzymology', 'Chronic Disease', 'Hematopoiesis, Extramedullary/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Janus Kinase 2/*genetics/metabolism', 'Lasers', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/enzymology/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/enzymology/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/blood/enzymology/genetics', 'Megakaryocytes/chemistry/enzymology', 'Microdissection/methods', '*Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/enzymology/genetics', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/blood/enzymology/*genetics/metabolism', 'Polycythemia Vera/blood/enzymology/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/blood/enzymology/genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Spleen/chemistry/enzymology', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/blood/enzymology/genetics', 'United States', 'bcl-X Protein/analysis']",2007/07/24 09:00,2007/10/27 09:00,['2007/07/24 09:00'],"['2007/07/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/27 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mod Pathol. 2007 Sep;20(9):929-35. doi: 10.1038/modpathol.3800826.

Previous reports have shown that the inhibition of TRF2 results in the apoptosis of cancer cells. In this study, we demonstrated that arsenic trioxide (As2O3) induced in vitro growth inhibition and/or apoptosis of human T-cell leukemia cell line Molt-4 in a caspase-independent manner. Telomerase activity was not inhibited, although the level of the reverse transcriptase subunit of the human telomerase gene (hTERT) mRNA expression was down regulated during the early times and then recovered to the level found in untreated controls about 48 hours after treatment with As2O3. Furthermore, a remarkable telomere shortening related to exposure of As2O3 was observed in 50 population doubling. Inc ontrast, the alteration of telomere length did not occur after exposure to higher concentration of As2O3 (10 microM) for 24 hours and 48 hours, respectively, suggesting that the shortening of telomeres induced by As2O3 is dependent of a series of cell division cycles. Chromosomal analysis showed that As2O3 exposure caused chromosomal end-to-end fusion in human T-cell leukemia cells while downregulation of TRF2 was observed. Finally, the inhibition of TRF2 protein expression and the sensitivity to As2O3 in a panel of leukemia cell lines were checked. The data revealed that inhibition of TRF2 rendered leukemia cells more susceptible to As2O3. In conclusion, the downregulation of TRF2 by As2O3 contribute to chromosomal end-to-end fusion, and apoptosis in leukemia cells, suggesting that TRF2 could be an attractive target for new therapies of leukemia.","['Jiao, Yangwen', 'Zhang, Weifang', 'Liu, Junqing', 'Ni, Wanmao', 'Xu, Weilai', 'Jin, Jie', 'Qian, Wenbin']","['Jiao Y', 'Zhang W', 'Liu J', 'Ni W', 'Xu W', 'Jin J', 'Qian W']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 2)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (TERT protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', '*Chromosomal Instability', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Telomerase/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Telomere/*drug effects', 'Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 2/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",2007/07/24 09:00,2008/02/29 09:00,['2007/07/24 09:00'],"['2007/07/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/29 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2007 Aug;6(8):1186-92. doi: 10.4161/cbt.6.8.4381.

Our results show that Beclin 1 directly interacts with Bcl-2, Bcl-x(L), Bcl-w and to a lesser extent with Mcl-1. Beclin 1 does not bind the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins. The interaction between Beclin 1 and the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-x(L) was inhibited by BH3-only proteins, but not by multi-domain proteins. Sequence alignment and structural modeling suggest that Beclin 1 contains a putative BH3-like domain which may interact with the hydrophobic grove of Bcl-x(L).

METHODS: The diagnosis was based on repeated demonstration of budding yeast cells and arthroconidia by direct microscopic examination of sputum and by isolation of T. asahii in culture of sputum and blood. The update is largely based upon literature search in Medline and Review of Medical and Veterinary Mycology. RESULTS: A 41-year-old male presented with acute myeloblastic leukemia, cough and fever. He had received cytotoxic drug therapy, broad spectrum antibiotics and was neutropenic. Trichosporon asahii was repeatedly demonstrated in his sputum by direct microscopy and culture, and also isolated from blood. It was identified by appropriate morphological and physiological characteristics viz., arthroconidium formation, diazonium blue B reaction, urease activity and assimilation of carbon and nitrogen compounds. The identification was confirmed by PCR amplification and direct DNA sequencing of internally transcribed spacer (ITS) 1 and ITS2 of rDNA. CONCLUSION: With greater awareness of etiologic significance of T. asahii, trichosporonosis is likely to be recognised more frequently than apparent from the available published reports.","['Chowdhary, A', 'Ahmad, S', 'Khan, Z U', 'Doval, D C', 'Randhawa, H S']","['Chowdhary A', 'Ahmad S', 'Khan ZU', 'Doval DC', 'Randhawa HS']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Indian J Med Microbiol,Indian journal of medical microbiology,8700903,,,,2007/07/24 09:00,2007/07/24 09:01,['2007/07/24 09:00'],"['2007/07/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/24 09:01 [medline]', '2007/07/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Indian J Med Microbiol. 2004 Jan-Mar;22(1):16-22.,,,"['Department of Medical Mycology, Vallabhbhai Patel Chest Institute, University of Delhi, New Delhi - 110 007, India.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inhibitors ofBcr-Abl have significantly improved the treatment of CML. Most notable is the inhibitor imatinib, which produces remissions in all phases of CML and is the current standard of care. However, imatinib resistance occurs in a significant proportion of patients, mainly through the development of mutations in the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase domain that impair imatinib binding. Attempts to circumvent resistance to imatinib led to the discovery of nilotinib (Tasigna; Novartis AG), a novel, potent and selective oral Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitor. Preclinical and clinical investigations have demonstrated that nilotinib effectively overcomes imatinib resistance. Efficacy has been observed in models of CML and other myeloproliferative disorders that are driven by Bcr-Abl and related kinases. In a phase II clinical trial in CML, major cytogenetic response rates were 52 and 33% for chronic- and accelerated-phase disease, respectively. Nilotinib has been filed for approval in the US and EU for use in Philadelphia-positive leukemias in patients who are resistant or intolerant to imatinib.

Viruses transform keratinocytes by activation of cancer-promoting genes. Viral proteins may directly act as oncogenes that drive cells to proliferate or generate inflammatory responses and cause regeneration of injured cells that eventually lead to malignant transformation. Accelerated viral carcinogenesis is observed in the immune-deficient host. Decreased T-cell reactivity and lower number of antigen-presenting cells in the skin assist in viral escape and emergence of skin tumors. Three pathogenic human viruses associated with skin neoplasms are described: human papilloma virus (HPV), Kaposi's sarcoma (KS)-associated herpesvirus and human T-cell leukemia virus type 1. HPV was linked to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the skin after its role in SCC of the cervix has been discovered. In the rare autosomal recessive epidermodysplasia verruciformis, an increased susceptibility to specific HPV strains initially results in widespread wart infection and later in life in the development of SCC over the sun-exposed skin. The role of HPV in nonmelanoma skin cancer of immune competent hosts is more difficult to prove. The discovery of human herpesvirus 8 as the causative pathogen of KS was made following the AIDS epidemic, and its role in all clinical variants of this tumor was confirmed. KS-associated herpesvirus exerts its tumorigenic effect through a wide repertoire of genes that regulate angiogenesis, inflammation, and cell cycle. Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 causes adult T-cell leukemia and is often associated with skin eruptions that share common features with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. In summary, studies of oncogenic viruses shed light on molecular mechanisms leading to tumor formation and aid in recognition of new pathways of carcinogenesis.","['Molho-Pessach, Vered', 'Lotem, Michal']","['Molho-Pessach V', 'Lotem M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Curr Probl Dermatol,Current problems in dermatology,0147371,,IM,"['Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/physiopathology/virology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', '*Herpesvirus 8, Human', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', '*Papillomaviridae', 'Sarcoma, Kaposi/physiopathology/virology', 'Skin Neoplasms/physiopathology/*virology']",2007/07/21 09:00,2007/09/26 09:00,['2007/07/21 09:00'],"['2007/07/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/26 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/21 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Curr Probl Dermatol. 2007;35:39-51. doi: 10.1159/000106409.,"['000106409 [pii]', '10.1159/000106409 [doi]']",,"['Department of Dermatology, Hadassah Hebrew University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel.']",,69,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1159/000106409 [doi],,,,,,

A whole cell (Wc) vaccine has been known to induce a Th1 biased immune response while an acellular (Ac) vaccine tends to induce that of the Th2 type. Natural infection by B. pertussis helps to maintain a robust Th1 memory in the host population. To examine the adjuvant activity of the pertussis vaccine, we immunized mice with an ovalbumin peptide as a model tumor antigen, and monitored the development of anti-tumor activities. The addition of either the Ac or the Wc vaccine helped expand the specific CD8 T cells. However, there was a marked difference in the induced cytolytic activity where the Wc vaccine was superior to the Ac. The Wc vaccine was also more effective in inducing in vivo tumor rejection. The adjuvant activity was not only effective against ovalbumin, but was also evident when an endogenous tumor antigen, Wilms' tumor 1 gene product, was targeted. These results indicate that, although the Wc vaccine does not share the same antigen specificity with tumor cells, it can aid in the development of highly cytolytic CD8 T cells as an adjuvant at the site of peptide immunization.","['Yano, Arisa', 'Komatsu, Toshihiro', 'Ishibashi, Masahide', 'Udaka, Keiko']","['Yano A', 'Komatsu T', 'Ishibashi M', 'Udaka K']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Australia,Microbiol Immunol,Microbiology and immunology,7703966,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Pertussis Vaccine)', '0 (Vaccines, Acellular)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '9006-59-1 (Ovalbumin)']",IM,"['*Adjuvants, Immunologic', 'Animals', 'Cancer Vaccines/*immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/immunology/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Ovalbumin/immunology', 'Peptides/*immunology', 'Pertussis Vaccine/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Th1 Cells/immunology', 'Th2 Cells/immunology', 'Vaccines, Acellular/immunology', 'WT1 Proteins/*immunology']",2007/07/21 09:00,2008/01/01 09:00,['2007/07/21 09:00'],"['2007/07/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/01 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/21 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Microbiol Immunol. 2007;51(7):685-99. doi: 10.1111/j.1348-0421.2007.tb03957.x.,"['JST.JSTAGE/mandi/51.685 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1348-0421.2007.tb03957.x [doi]']",,"['Department of Immunology, Kochi Medical School, Nankoku, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recruitment of activated T cells to host target tissues or sites of leukemic infiltration (graft-versus-leukemia [GVL]) is likely mediated by chemokine receptor-ligand interactions. We examined the contribution of donor cell CCR1 expression to the development of GVHD and GVL using a well-established murine SCT model (B6 --> B6D2F1) and CCR1-deficient mice (CCR1(-/-)). Allo-SCT with CCR1(-/-) donor cells significantly reduced systemic and target organ GVHD severity, and CCR1 expression on both T cells and accessory cells contributed to GVHD mortality. Significant GVL activity was preserved following CCR1(-/-) SCT, but the survival advantage diminished with increasing tumor burden. We then explored the effects of CCR1 expression on allo-specific T-cell responses. Although cytolytic effector function was maintained on a per-cell basis, T-cell proliferation and IFNgamma secretion were significantly reduced both in vivo and in vitro. T-cell function was partially dependent on interactions between CCR1 and CCL5. Collectively, these data demonstrate that CCR1 expression on donor cells contributes to the development of both GVHD and GVL, and suggest that CCR1/CCL5 receptor-ligand interactions modulate allo-specific T-cell responses occurring in this context.","['Choi, Sung W', 'Hildebrandt, Gerhard C', 'Olkiewicz, Krystyna M', 'Hanauer, David A', 'Chaudhary, Meghana N', 'Silva, Ines A', 'Rogers, Clare E', 'Deurloo, Daphne T', 'Fisher, Jacki M', 'Liu, Chen', 'Adams, David', 'Chensue, Stephen W', 'Cooke, Kenneth R']","['Choi SW', 'Hildebrandt GC', 'Olkiewicz KM', 'Hanauer DA', 'Chaudhary MN', 'Silva IA', 'Rogers CE', 'Deurloo DT', 'Fisher JM', 'Liu C', 'Adams D', 'Chensue SW', 'Cooke KR']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Ccl5 protein, mouse)', '0 (Ccr1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Chemokine CCL5)', '0 (Receptors, CCR1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chemokine CCL5/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/genetics/*immunology/mortality', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Protein Binding/physiology', 'Receptors, CCR1/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Survival Analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2007/07/21 09:00,2007/12/14 09:00,['2007/07/21 09:00'],"['2007/07/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/21 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Nov 1;110(9):3447-55. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-05-087403.

ATO exerts its effect mainly through elevated oxidative stress, but the exact molecular mechanism remains elusive. The thioredoxin (Trx) system comprising NADPH, thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), and Trx and the glutathione (GSH) system composed of NADPH, glutathione reductase, and GSH supported by glutaredoxin are the two electron donor systems that control cellular proliferation, viability, and apoptosis. Recently, the selenocysteine-dependent TrxR enzyme has emerged as an important molecular target for anticancer drug development. Here, we have discovered that ATO irreversibly inhibits mammalian TrxR with an IC(50) of 0.25 microM. Both the N-terminal redox-active dithiol and the C-terminal selenothiol-active site of reduced TrxR may participate in the reaction with ATO. The inhibition of MCF-7 cell growth by ATO was correlated with irreversible inactivation of TrxR, which subsequently led to Trx oxidation. Furthermore, the inhibition of TrxR by ATO was attenuated by GSH, and GSH depletion by buthionine sulfoximine enhanced ATO-induced cell death. These results strongly suggest that the ATO anticancer activity is by means of a Trx system-mediated apoptosis.

From F(1) fish, we obtained 2,045 sequences representing 933 unique retroviral integrations. A total of 599 were mappable to the current genomic assembly (Zv6), and 233 of the integrations landed within genes. By inbreeding fish carrying proviral integrations in 25 different genes, we were able to demonstrate that in approximately 50% of the gene ""hits,"" the mRNA transcript levels were reduced by >/=70%, with the highest probability for mutation occurring if the integration was in an exon or first intron. Based on these data, the mutagenic frequency for the retrovirus is nearly one in five integrations. In addition, a strong mutagenic effect is seen when murine leukemia virus integrates specifically in the first intron of genes but not in other introns. Three of 19 gene inactivation events had embryonic defects. Using the strategy we outlined, it is possible to identify 1 mutagenic event for every 30 sequencing reactions done on the F(1) fish. This is a 20- to 30-fold increase in efficiency when compared with the current resequencing approach [targeting induced local lesions in genomes (TILLING)] used in zebrafish for identifying mutations in genes. Combining this increase in efficiency with cryopreservation of sperm samples from the F(1) fish, it is now possible to create a stable resource that contains mutations in every known zebrafish gene.","['Wang, Dongmei', 'Jao, Li-En', 'Zheng, Naizhong', 'Dolan, Kyle', 'Ivey, Jessica', 'Zonies, Seth', 'Wu, Xiaolin', 'Wu, Kangmai', 'Yang, Hongbo', 'Meng, Qingchao', 'Zhu, Zuoyan', 'Zhang, Bo', 'Lin, Shuo', 'Burgess, Shawn M']","['Wang D', 'Jao LE', 'Zheng N', 'Dolan K', 'Ivey J', 'Zonies S', 'Wu X', 'Wu K', 'Yang H', 'Meng Q', 'Zhu Z', 'Zhang B', 'Lin S', 'Burgess SM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Genome/*genetics', 'Homozygote', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis/*genetics', 'Physical Chromosome Mapping', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Selection, Genetic', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics', 'Zebrafish/*genetics']",2007/07/21 09:00,2007/09/11 09:00,['2007/07/21 09:00'],"['2007/07/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/11 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/21 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2007 Jul 24;104(30):12428-33. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0705502104.

17640862,NLM,MEDLINE,20071107,20210108,1592-8721 (Electronic) 0390-6078 (Linking),92,8,2007 Aug,Functional characterization of novel telomerase RNA (TERC) mutations in patients with diverse clinical and pathological presentations.,1013-20,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Functional characterization of heterozygous TERC (telomerase RNA component) and TERT (telomerase reverse transcriptase) mutations found in autosomal dominant dyskeratosis congenita (DC) and aplastic anemia (AA) shows that telomerase function is defective and that this is associated with short telomeres. This leads to reduced cell longevity with maximal impact on tissues with high proliferate potential. The aim of this study was to establish the role of TERC in the pathophysiology of uncharacterized patients with AA with some features of DC. DESIGN AND METHODS: The TERC gene was screened for mutations by denaturing high performance liquid chromatography. To determine the functional significance of TERC mutations telomerase activity was assessed in an in vitro (TRAP) assay and telomere length of patients' samples was determined using Southern blot analysis. RESULTS This study led to the identification of four novel TERC mutations (G178A, C180T, D52-86 and G2C) and a recurrent TERC mutation (D110-113GACT). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Two of the de novo TERC mutations (G178A and C180T) found uniquely produce a clinical phenotype in the first generation, differing from previously published cases in which individuals in the first generation are usually asymptomatic. Curiously these mutations are located near the triple-helix domain of TERC. We also observed that the recurrent D110-113GACT can present with AA, myelodysplasia or leukemia. The D52-86 is associated with varied phenotypes including pulmonary disease (pulmonary fibrosis) as the first presentation. In summary, this study reports the functional characterization of several novel TERC mutations associated with varied hematologic and extra-hematologic presentations.","['Marrone, Anna', 'Sokhal, Priya', 'Walne, Amanda', 'Beswick, Richard', 'Kirwan, Michael', 'Killick, Sally', 'Williams, Mike', 'Marsh, Judith', 'Vulliamy, Tom', 'Dokal, Inderjeet']","['Marrone A', 'Sokhal P', 'Walne A', 'Beswick R', 'Kirwan M', 'Killick S', 'Williams M', 'Marsh J', 'Vulliamy T', 'Dokal I']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (telomerase RNA)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dyskeratosis Congenita/*genetics', 'Female', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Humans', 'Intellectual Disability/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation', 'Nevus, Pigmented/genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Pedigree', 'Phenotype', 'Pigmentation Disorders/genetics', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis/genetics', 'RNA/*genetics', 'Telomerase/deficiency/*genetics', 'Telomere/*ultrastructure']",2007/07/21 09:00,2007/11/08 09:00,['2007/07/21 09:00'],"['2007/02/20 00:00 [received]', '2007/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/07/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/08 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/21 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2007 Aug;92(8):1013-20. doi: 10.3324/haematol.11407.

In contrast to low expression of survivin in normal differentiated adult tissues, very high levels of survivin have been described in a number of different tumors. Overexpression of survivin was found to correlate with poor prognosis in a variety of cancers including hematologic malignancies. To date, however, there is no information available on the prognostic role of survivin in pediatric precursor B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (BCP-ALL), the most frequent malignancy in childhood. DESIGN AND METHODS: In a retrospective study including 66 pediatric patients we analyzed the impact of survivin protein levels on outcome in BCP-ALL. RESULTS: Survivin overexpression, with an up to ten-fold increase of the normal level, was detected in 65% of the leukemic samples in contrast to negligible expression in non-malignant hematopoietic cells. Despite considerable variety of expression levels in ALL cells, there was no association of survivin levels with established risk factors. However, patients suffering relapse of disease or death had significantly higher survivin expression than those with a favorable outcome. Overexpression of survivin is a significant prognostic marker for 3 year relapse free, event-free and overall survival, again independent of the established prognostic factors in ALL, such as age and leukocyte count at diagnosis as assessed in multivariate analysis. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Overexpression of survivin in BCP-ALL identifies patients with a high risk of early relapse. Upon confirmation in a prospective analysis, survivin expression may, in the future, serve to further refine treatment stratification with intensification of therapy in those patients prone to relapse.","['Troeger, Anja', 'Siepermann, Meinolf', 'Escherich, Gabriele', 'Meisel, Roland', 'Willers, Reinhardt', 'Gudowius, Sonja', 'Moritz, Thomas', 'Laws, Hans-Juergen', 'Hanenberg, Helmut', 'Goebel, Ulrich', 'Janka-Schaub, Gritta E', 'Mahotka, Csaba', 'Dilloo, Dagmar']","['Troeger A', 'Siepermann M', 'Escherich G', 'Meisel R', 'Willers R', 'Gudowius S', 'Moritz T', 'Laws HJ', 'Hanenberg H', 'Goebel U', 'Janka-Schaub GE', 'Mahotka C', 'Dilloo D']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Survivin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Apoptosis', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/*analysis/physiology', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/*analysis/physiology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis/physiology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survivin', 'Treatment Outcome']",2007/07/21 09:00,2007/11/08 09:00,['2007/07/21 09:00'],"['2006/08/18 00:00 [received]', '2007/04/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/07/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/08 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/21 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2007 Aug;92(8):1043-50. doi: 10.3324/haematol.10675.

The conditioning regimens, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis and supportive policies were uniform for all patients. DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed the results of CBT performed in 30 patients, aged <18 years, affected by high risk ALL. As conditioning regimen, all patients received 12 Gy fractionated total body irradiation, etoposide, cyclophosphamide and horse anti-lymphocyte globulin. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of 6-methylprednisolone and cyclosporine A. RESULTS The cumulative incidence of engraftment was 93% (95% CI:0.85-0.93). The cumulative incidence of grade III-IV acute and chronic GVHD was 7% (95% CI:0.01-0.19) and 33% (95% CI: 0.17-0.64), respectively. The 9-year cumulative incidence of transplant-related mortality and relapse was 34% (95% CI:0.13-0.45) and 31% (95% CI:0.16-0.61), respectively. The 9-year overall survival, leukemia-free survival and event-free survival were 42% (95% CI:0.52-0.93), 47% (95% CI:0.25-0.61) and 46% (95% CI:0.33-0.61), respectively. A number of CFU-GM <1 x 10(4)/Kg of recipient body weight was the only factor that negatively affected all outcome parameters both in univariate and multivariate analyses. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The infused cell dose expressed as in vitro progenitor cell growth represents the most important pre-transplant factor affecting the long-term outcome after an unrelated CBT in young patients with high risk ALL. The number of CFU-GM should thus be considered in the selection process of cord blood units for transplant.","['Iori, Anna Paola', 'Arcese, William', 'Milano, Filippo', 'Calabrese, Elisabetta', 'Torelli, Giovanni Fernando', 'Barberi, Walter', 'Mascolo, Maria Grazia', 'De Felice, Lidia', 'Screnci, Maria', 'Lucarelli, Barbarella', 'Malandruccolo, Luigi', 'Perrone, Maria Paola', 'Salvatori, Simona', 'Laurenti, Luca', 'Iannella, Emilia', 'Ricci, Roberto', 'Moleti, Maria Luisa', 'Foa, Robin']","['Iori AP', 'Arcese W', 'Milano F', 'Calabrese E', 'Torelli GF', 'Barberi W', 'Mascolo MG', 'De Felice L', 'Screnci M', 'Lucarelli B', 'Malandruccolo L', 'Perrone MP', 'Salvatori S', 'Laurenti L', 'Iannella E', 'Ricci R', 'Moleti ML', 'Foa R']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/mortality/*statistics & numerical data', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Postoperative Complications/mortality', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/mortality/*surgery', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Risk', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Survival Analysis', '*Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Treatment Outcome']",2007/07/21 09:00,2007/11/08 09:00,['2007/07/21 09:00'],"['2007/01/16 00:00 [received]', '2007/05/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/07/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/08 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/21 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2007 Aug;92(8):1051-8. doi: 10.3324/haematol.11271.

We document its expression, and also that of PD-1 (another recently described marker of germinal center T cells to which a new antibody has been raised), in normal and neoplastic lymphoid tissue to evaluate the suggestion that helper T cells within the germinal centers of human lymphoid tissue are the cell of origin of angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), and to assess the diagnostic value of these two markers. DESIGN AND METHODS: Expression of SAP and PD-1 was investigated by immunohistochemistry in paraffin-embedded tissue sections and in cell lines. Western blotting was performed on cell lines, and antibody specificity was confirmed by immunostaining of transfected cells. RESULTS Screening on more than 500 lymphoma biopsies showed that 95% (40/42) of cases of AITL expressed at least one of these markers. SAP was also expressed on many cases (15/21) of acute T lymphoblastic leukemia, in keeping with its presence in cortical thymocytes. However, PD-1 and SAP were also found in a minority of cases of peripheral T-cell lymphoma other than AITL, in contrast to a report that the former marker is specific for AITL. This observation raises the possibility that such non-angioimmunoblastic cases may be related to germinal center helper T cells. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: These two markers provide additional evidence that AITL arises from germinal center T cells. They may also prove of value in the diagnosis of this disease since a negative reaction was rarely observed in this disorder.","['Roncador, Giovanna', 'Garcia Verdes-Montenegro, Jose-Francisco', 'Tedoldi, Sara', 'Paterson, Jennifer C', 'Klapper, Wolfram', 'Ballabio, Erica', 'Maestre, Lorena', 'Pileri, Stefano', 'Hansmann, Martin-Leo', 'Piris, Miguel A', 'Mason, David Y', 'Marafioti, Teresa']","['Roncador G', 'Garcia Verdes-Montenegro JF', 'Tedoldi S', 'Paterson JC', 'Klapper W', 'Ballabio E', 'Maestre L', 'Pileri S', 'Hansmann ML', 'Piris MA', 'Mason DY', 'Marafioti T']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PDCD1 protein, human)', '0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor)', '0 (SH2D1A protein, human)', '0 (Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Associated Protein)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*analysis', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*analysis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*analysis', 'Germinal Center/*pathology', 'Hodgkin Disease/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunoblastic Lymphadenopathy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*analysis', 'Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating/chemistry/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/chemistry/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis', 'Palatine Tonsil/pathology', 'Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor', 'Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Associated Protein', 'Spleen/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*chemistry/pathology', 'Thymus Gland/pathology']",2007/07/21 09:00,2007/11/08 09:00,['2007/07/21 09:00'],"['2006/10/13 00:00 [received]', '2007/05/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/07/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/08 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/21 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2007 Aug;92(8):1059-66. doi: 10.3324/haematol.10864.

Our study examined whether IR induced tissue factor (TF) expression and procoagulability. We further investigated coordinated gene alterations associated with TF upregulation in the myelomonocytic leukemia THP-1 cells. DESIGN AND METHODS: TF expression was determined by quantitative Reverse Transcriptase (TaqMan) PCR, TF ELISA and TF activity by a two stage chromogenic assay in the time course of days 1, 3, 7, 10, and 17 post IR. To detect IR-induced alterations in gene expression, Affymetrix HG U133 Plus 2.0 microarrays were used. RESULTS IR induced a significant increase in TF/GAPDH mRNA ratios and cellular TF protein on days 3 and 7 post IR (20 Gy [p>or=0.01] and 40 Gy [p <or=0.01 vs. control]), suggesting a late and persistent induction of TF. An increase in cellular TF activity was already found 1 day post IR (20 Gy and 40 Gy [p>or=0.001] vs. control respectively), suggesting IR immediately alters the cellular thrombogenicity. TF upregulation post IR was confirmed in PBMNCs. Gene expression profiling showed IR increased the expression of inflammatory and apoptosis-related pathways known to be involved in the regulation of TF expression. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: TF upregulation together with inflammation and apoptosis may increase the thrombogenicity of tissues. The demonstrated upregulation of TF might play a pivotal role in radiation associated thrombosis.","['Goldin-Lang, Petra', 'Pels, Klaus', 'Tran, Quoc-Viet', 'Szotowski, Bjoern', 'Wittchen, Frank', 'Antoniak, Silvio', 'Willich, Tobias', 'Witt, Henning', 'Hummel, Michael', 'Lenze, Dido', 'Poller, Wolfgang', 'Schultheiss, Heinz-Peter', 'Rauch, Ursula']","['Goldin-Lang P', 'Pels K', 'Tran QV', 'Szotowski B', 'Wittchen F', 'Antoniak S', 'Willich T', 'Witt H', 'Hummel M', 'Lenze D', 'Poller W', 'Schultheiss HP', 'Rauch U']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (3-(4-methylphenylsulfonyl)-2-propenenitrile)', '0 (Blood Coagulation Factors)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Sulfones)', '0 (macrophage procoagulant activity)', '9035-58-9 (Thromboplastin)', 'EC 3.4.21.6 (Factor Xa)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics/radiation effects', 'Blood Coagulation Factors/*biosynthesis/genetics/radiation effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Factor Xa/biosynthesis', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Inflammation', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/blood/complications/*pathology', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Nitriles/pharmacology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Particle Accelerators', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sulfones/pharmacology', 'Thrombophilia/*etiology', 'Thromboplastin/*biosynthesis/genetics']",2007/07/21 09:00,2007/11/08 09:00,['2007/07/21 09:00'],"['2006/08/25 00:00 [received]', '2007/05/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/07/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/08 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/21 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2007 Aug;92(8):1091-8. doi: 10.3324/haematol.10702.

The median age of the RIST group was significantly higher than that of the CST group (53 years versus 40 years, P<.01). The RIST group also included a higher proportion of patients with an HCT-specific comorbidity index (HCT-CI) of 1 or more than the CST group (65% versus 37%, P=.03). The probabilities of achieving complete remission and the incidences of grades II-IV and III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) in the CST and RIST groups were, respectively, 77% and 64%, 50% and 50%, and 23% and 28%, with no significant differences. Similarly, there was no difference in the 2-year probabilities of nonrelapse mortality (NRM, 36% and 38%), progressive disease or relapse (PD 51% and 49%), overall survival (OS, 31% and 38%), and progression-free survival (PFS, 28% and 29%). Multivariate analyses revealed that a higher HCT-CI score and transplant from donors other than HLA-matched relatives were associated with increased risks of NRM and poor OS, and patients who received chemotherapy within 2 months before HCT were associated with increased risks of PD, poor OS, and PFS after transplantation. After adjusting for these variables, the risks of NRM, PD, OS, and PFS in the RIST group were not significantly different from those in the CST group. In conclusion, these results suggest that the antileukemia/lymphoma effect associated with RIST is comparable to that associated with CST. RIST appears to be feasible for the treatment of hematologic malignancies not in remission.","['Maruyama, Dai', 'Fukuda, Takahiro', 'Kato, Ruri', 'Yamasaki, Satoshi', 'Usui, Eiji', 'Morita-Hoshi, Yuriko', 'Kim, Sung-Won', 'Mori, Shin-ichiro', 'Heike, Yuji', 'Makimoto, Atsushi', 'Tajima, Kinuko', 'Tanosaki, Ryuji', 'Tobinai, Kensei', 'Takaue, Yoichi']","['Maruyama D', 'Fukuda T', 'Kato R', 'Yamasaki S', 'Usui E', 'Morita-Hoshi Y', 'Kim SW', 'Mori S', 'Heike Y', 'Makimoto A', 'Tajima K', 'Tanosaki R', 'Tobinai K', 'Takaue Y']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*adverse effects/methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2007/07/21 09:00,2007/09/19 09:00,['2007/07/21 09:00'],"['2007/02/01 00:00 [received]', '2007/04/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/07/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/21 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2007 Aug;13(8):932-41. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2007.04.004.

This study examines the long-term outcomes of a large cohort of patients with myeloma who were treated with myeloablative alloSCT at a single center. Comparisons are made with those who were treated with autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). Between January 1989 and February 2002, 158 patients age<or=55 years underwent SCT for myeloma. Seventy-two patients underwent myeloablative alloSCT (58 related; 14 unrelated), whereas 86 patients underwent ASCT. Most patients received single-agent high dose dexamethasone or VAD (vincristine, adriamycin, dexamethasone) therapy pre-SCT. Conditioning regimens were melphalan-based for all ASCT patients, whereas the alloSCT patients received melphalan-based (70%), total-body irradiation (TBI)-based (18%), or other (13%). Patients who underwent alloSCT were younger, had a higher Durie-Salmon stage disease, and a shorter median time from diagnosis to transplant. Myeloma subtypes were similar between groups. Other pre-SCT (BMT) characteristics were similar except that ASCT patients had a higher proportion of cases that received palliative radiotherapy pre-SCT. Disease response pre-SCT was similar. At last follow-up, 61 of 158 patients are alive with a median follow-up of 88.4 months (range: 35.5-208.5). The overall survival (OS) of the alloSCT cohort was 48.1% at 5 years and 39.9% at 10 years compared to 46.2% at 5 years and 30.8% at 10 years for the ASCT cohort (P=.94). The event-free survival of the alloSCT cohort was 33.3% at 5 years and 31.4% at 10 years compared to 32.9% and 15.2%for the ASCT cohort (P=.64). Treatment-related mortality (TRM) at 1 year was 22% for the alloSCT cohort and 14% in the ASCT cohort (P=.21). Cumulative incidence of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) was 72% and the cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD (cGVHD) was 68% at 2 years. Neither aGVHD nor cGVHD had an influence on OS or event-free survival, although 5 of 14 patients who have received donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) have had disease response. The risk of relapse was reduced in those who developed aGVHD (P=.02) but not cGVHD (P=.23). In conclusion, although there are patient who are alive without disease>10 years post myeloablative alloSCT, similarly there are long-term survivors post-ASCT. Myeloablative alloSCT should not be considered standard treatment, and should only be considered in the context of a clinical trial.","['Kuruvilla, John', 'Shepherd, John D', 'Sutherland, Heather J', 'Nevill, Thomas J', 'Nitta, Janet', 'Le, Aulan', 'Forrest, Donna L', 'Hogge, Donna E', 'Lavoie, Julye C', 'Nantel, Stephen H', 'Toze, Cynthia L', 'Smith, Clayton A', 'Barnett, Micheal J', 'Song, Kevin W']","['Kuruvilla J', 'Shepherd JD', 'Sutherland HJ', 'Nevill TJ', 'Nitta J', 'Le A', 'Forrest DL', 'Hogge DE', 'Lavoie JC', 'Nantel SH', 'Toze CL', 'Smith CA', 'Barnett MJ', 'Song KW']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,,IM,"['Adult', 'Cohort Studies', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease', 'Graft vs Tumor Effect', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2007/07/21 09:00,2007/09/19 09:00,['2007/07/21 09:00'],"['2007/01/11 00:00 [received]', '2007/04/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/07/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/21 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2007 Aug;13(8):925-31. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2007.04.006.

The annual rates of allogeneic HSCT per 10 million population in Australia and New Zealand in 2004 were similar to those in European countries of comparable socioeconomic status. Among the most prominent trends between 1998 and 2004 were increases in the numbers of allogeneic HSCT using peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC), the emergence of reduced intensity conditioning in allogeneic HSCT, increases in numbers of autologous HSCT for recipients aged 60 and over, increases in allogeneic HSCT with unrelated donors, and decreases in numbers of allogeneic HSCT for chronic myelogenous leukemia and autologous HSCT for breast cancer. The cumulative incidence of transplant-related mortality (TRM) at 100 days posttransplant progressively fell over the years 1992 to 2003 and was 8.1% for allogeneic HSCT and 1.1% for autologous HSCT in 2003.

In our study, MOG was shown to specifically inhibit the growth of human leukemia cell lines and primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) blasts via induction of apoptosis, with the evidence of mitochondrial DeltaPsim loss, reactive oxygen species production, caspases activation and nuclear fragmentation. Furthermore, it was shown that thiol-containing antioxidants completely blocked MOG-induced mitochondrial DeltaPsim loss and subsequent cell apoptosis, while the inhibition of apoptosis by benzyloxy-carbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone only partially attenuated mitochondrial DeltaPsim loss, indicating that MOG-induced redox imbalance is an early event upstream to mitochondrial DeltaPsim loss and caspase-3 activation. Consistently, it was found that MOG rapidly decreased the intracellular glutathione (GSH) content in a dose-dependent manner and the significance of GSH depletion in MOG-induced apoptosis was further supported by the protective effects of tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ) and the facilitative effects of DL-buthionine (S,R)-sulfoximine (BSO). Furthermore, it was showed that GSH depletion induced by MOG rendered some leukemia cell lines more sensitive to arsenic trioxide (As2O3), doxorubicin or cisplatin. Additionally, the synergistic apoptotic effects of MOG with As2O3 were detected in HL-60 and primary AML cells, but not in normal cells, suggesting the selective toxicity of their combination to the malignant cells.

A search was made of a computerised histopathology database covering the period from 1988 to 2004 inclusive to identify cases of testicular and paratesticular pathologies, and the clinical and histopathological features reviewed. Five hundred and fifty-one appropriate specimens underwent histological examination during the period. Three hundred and eleven (56%) presented with an impalpable testis with or without intersex disorder and 121 (22%) with a testicular/paratesticular mass. While metastatic leukaemic testicular involvement (N = 47) was the commonest tumour identified in this preselected series, at a peak of 8 years, primary testicular tumours such as yolk sac and teratoma were most commonly identified in infancy. Of 109 (20%) presenting with an acutely painful scrotum, the largest group (47%) represented torsion of the appendix testis.

Indirubin, a traditional Chinese medicine, was clinically used in the treatment of chronic myelocytic leukemia as well as some autoimmune diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, and so on. The effects of indirubin on CD4(+)CD25(+)Treg cells, which play a critical role in controlling autoimmunity, have not been addressed. In the present study, we observed the cell levels, phenotypes, and immunoregulatory function of CD4(+)CD25(+)Treg cells in indirubin-treated mice. Treatment with indirubin significantly enhanced the ratios of CD4(+)CD25(+)Treg cells or CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+)Treg cells to CD4(+)T cells in peripheral blood, lymph nodes, and spleens (P < 0.01 compared with control mice). CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+)Treg cells to CD4 single positive cells in the thymi of indirubin-treated mice were significantly higher than those in control mice. Furthermore, splenic CD4(+)CD25(+)Treg cells in indirubin-treated mice showed immunosuppressive ability on the immune response of T effector cells to alloantigens or mitogen as efficiently as the control CD4(+)CD25(+)Treg cells in vitro. The present studies indicate that CD4(+)CD25(+)Treg cells are more resistant to indirubin than effector T cells in vivo. The selectively enhanced CD4(+)CD25(+)Treg cell levels by indirubin made host to be more favorable for immune tolerance induction, which opened one possibility for indirubin to treat autoimmune diseases.","['Zhang, Aijun', 'Qu, Yanyan', 'Zhang, Baojun', 'Zhang, Lianjun', 'Zeng, Chun', 'Peng, Jianxia', 'Ji, Xuebin', 'Hou, Ming', 'Zhao, Yong']","['Zhang A', 'Qu Y', 'Zhang B', 'Zhang L', 'Zeng C', 'Peng J', 'Ji X', 'Hou M', 'Zhao Y']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,J Mol Med (Berl),"Journal of molecular medicine (Berlin, Germany)",9504370,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit)', 'V86L8P74GI (indirubin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Autoimmune Diseases/*therapy', 'CD4 Antigens/*immunology', 'Cell Count', 'Female', 'Immune Tolerance/drug effects', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/cytology/*drug effects/*immunology', 'Thymus Gland/cytology/drug effects/immunology']",2007/07/20 09:00,2008/03/08 09:00,['2007/07/20 09:00'],"['2007/03/27 00:00 [received]', '2007/05/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/05/15 00:00 [revised]', '2007/07/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/08 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/20 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Mol Med (Berl). 2007 Nov;85(11):1263-70. doi: 10.1007/s00109-007-0235-9.

A novel genetic knockout model was established that allowed us for the first time to analyze HIV-1 integration in the absence of LEDGF/p75 protein. Supporting a crucial role for the cofactor in viral replication, HIV-1 vector integration and reporter gene expression were significantly reduced in LEDGF-null cells. Yet, integrase processed the viral cDNA termini normally and maintained its local target DNA sequence preference during integration. Preintegration complexes extracted from knockout cells moreover supported normal levels of DNA strand transfer activity in vitro. In contrast, HIV-1 lost its strong bias toward integrating into transcription units, displaying instead increased affinity for promoter regions and CpG islands. Our results reveal LEDGF/p75 as a critical targeting factor, commandeering lentiviruses from promoter- and/or CpG island-proximal pathways that are favored by other members of Retroviridae. Akin to yeast retrotransposons, disrupting the lentiviral targeting mechanism significantly perturbs overall integration.","['Shun, Ming-Chieh', 'Raghavendra, Nidhanapati K', 'Vandegraaff, Nick', 'Daigle, Janet E', 'Hughes, Siobhan', 'Kellam, Paul', 'Cherepanov, Peter', 'Engelman, Alan']","['Shun MC', 'Raghavendra NK', 'Vandegraaff N', 'Daigle JE', 'Hughes S', 'Kellam P', 'Cherepanov P', 'Engelman A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Psip1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (lens epithelium-derived growth factor)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Integrases)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/deficiency/genetics/*physiology', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Consensus Sequence', 'CpG Islands', 'DNA/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Deletion', 'HIV-1/genetics/pathogenicity/*physiology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Integrases/metabolism', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*physiology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/pathogenicity', 'Mice', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Transcription Factors/deficiency/genetics/*physiology', 'Virus Integration/genetics/*physiology']",2007/07/20 09:00,2007/09/06 09:00,['2007/07/20 09:00'],"['2007/07/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/20 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Genes Dev. 2007 Jul 15;21(14):1767-78. doi: 10.1101/gad.1565107.,"['21/14/1767 [pii]', '10.1101/gad.1565107 [doi]']",,"['Department of Cancer Immunology and AIDS, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Division of AIDS, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.']","['G0600009/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'R01 AI039394/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 AI039394/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI39394/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,PMC1920171,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BCR/ABL signaling has been studied in cell lines and murine models, but the transforming effects of BCR/ABL are highly dependent on cellular context, and mechanisms responsible for the transformation of primitive human hematopoietic cells remain poorly understood. Current targeted therapies fail to eliminate malignant CML progenitors, and improved understanding of crucial molecular mechanisms of progenitor transformation may facilitate the development of improved therapeutic approaches. We investigated the role of BCR/ABL tyrosine 177 (BCR/ABL-Y177) in CML progenitor transformation by comparing the effects of expression of Y177-mutated BCR/ABL, wild-type BCR/ABL, or green fluorescent protein alone on normal CD34(+) cells. We show that BCR/ABL-Y177 plays a critical role in CML progenitor expansion, proliferation, and survival. BCR/ABL expression results in enhanced Ras and Akt activity but reduced mitogen-activated protein kinase activity in human hematopoietic cells, which is reversed by BCR/ABL-Y177 mutation. Blocking BCR/ABL-Y177-mediated signaling enhances targeting of CML progenitors by imatinib mesylate.

Using protein stability shift assays, we identified a family of imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazines to specifically interact with and inhibit PIM kinases with low nanomolar potency. The high-resolution crystal structure of a PIM1 inhibitor complex revealed that imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazines surprisingly interact with the NH(2)-terminal lobe helix alphaC rather than with the kinase hinge region. Thus, the identified inhibitors are ATP competitive but not ATP mimetic compounds, explaining their enhanced selectivity with respect to conventional type I kinase inhibitors. One of the identified imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazines (K00135) was further tested in several hematopoietic cellular systems. First, K00135 dose-dependently impaired survival of murine Ba/F3 cells that have been rendered cytokine independent by overexpression of human PIMs. Second, K00135 impaired survival and clonogenic growth of a panel of human acute leukemia cells. Third, exposure of K00135 significantly suppressed in vitro growth of leukemic blasts from five acute myelogenous leukemia patients but not of normal umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells. In vitro kinase assays and immunoblotting using lysates from human MV4;11 leukemic cells showed inhibition of phosphorylation of known PIM downstream targets, such as BAD and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1, by K00135.

C/EBPalpha is inactivated by mutation in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and is considered a human tumor suppressor in AML. Although C/EBPalpha mutations have not been observed in malignancies other than AML, greatly diminished expression of C/EBPalpha occurs in numerous human epithelial cancers including lung, liver, endometrial, skin, and breast, suggesting a possible tumor suppressor function. However, direct evidence for C/EBPalpha as an epithelial tumor suppressor is lacking due to the absence of C/EBPalpha mutations in epithelial tumors and the lethal effect of C/EBPalpha deletion in mouse model systems. To examine the function of C/EBPalpha in epithelial tumor development, an epidermal-specific C/EBPalpha knockout mouse was generated. The epidermal-specific C/EBPalpha knockout mice survived and displayed no detectable abnormalities in epidermal keratinocyte proliferation, differentiation, or apoptosis, showing that C/EBPalpha is dispensable for normal epidermal homeostasis. In spite of this, the epidermal-specific C/EBPalpha knockout mice were highly susceptible to skin tumor development involving oncogenic Ras. These mice displayed decreased tumor latency and striking increases in tumor incidence, multiplicity, growth rate, and the rate of malignant progression. Mice hemizygous for C/EBPalpha displayed an intermediate-enhanced tumor phenotype. Our results suggest that decreased expression of C/EBPalpha contributes to deregulation of tumor cell proliferation. C/EBPalpha had been proposed to block cell cycle progression through inhibition of E2F activity. We observed that C/EBPalpha blocked Ras-induced and epidermal growth factor-induced E2F activity in keratinocytes and also blocked Ras-induced cell transformation and cell cycle progression. Our study shows that C/EBPalpha is dispensable for epidermal homeostasis and provides genetic evidence that C/EBPalpha is a suppressor of epithelial tumorigenesis.","['Loomis, Kari D', 'Zhu, Songyun', 'Yoon, Kyungsil', 'Johnson, Peter F', 'Smart, Robert C']","['Loomis KD', 'Zhu S', 'Yoon K', 'Johnson PF', 'Smart RC']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/*genetics', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Epidermis/*metabolism', 'Epithelial Cells/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Keratinocytes/cytology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mutation', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'ras Proteins/metabolism']",2007/07/20 09:00,2007/08/22 09:00,['2007/07/20 09:00'],"['2007/07/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/20 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2007 Jul 15;67(14):6768-76. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-0139.,"['67/14/6768 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-0139 [doi]']",,"['Cell Signaling and Cancer Group, Department of Environmental and Molecular Toxicology and Functional Genomics Program, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC 27695, USA.']","['R01 CA046637/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES012473/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 46637/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ES 12473/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,PMC3773581,,,,,,,,['NIHMS509727'],,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we identified a unique subpopulation of Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph(+)) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells coexpressing markers of endothelial cells (including VE-cadherin, PECAM-1, and Flk-1) and committed B-lineage progenitors. After long-term coculture with bone marrow stromal cells, tumor cells formed hematopoietic colonies and cords, expressed early stem- cell markers, and showed endothelial sprouting. Gene expression profiles of LSCs were altered in the presence of stromal cell contact. Stromal cell contact promoted leukemic cell VE-cadherin expression, stabilized beta-catenin, and up-regulated Bcr-abl fusion gene expression. Our study indicates that these specific tumor cells are uniquely positioned to respond to microenvironment-derived self-renewing and proliferative cues. Ph(+)/VE-cadherin(+) tumor subpopulation circumvents the requirement of exogenous Wnt signaling for self-renewal through stromal cell support of leukemic cell VE-cadherin expression and up-regulated Bcr-abl tyrosine kinase activity.

Treated patients generally develop recurrent disease requiring additional therapy, which can cause worsening immune dysfunction, myelosuppression, and selection for chemotherapy-resistant leukemia-cell subclones. Cellular immune therapy promises to mitigate these complications and potentially provide for curative treatment. Most experience with this is in the use of allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), in which graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects can be observed and shown responsible for long-term disease-free survival. However, use of allo-HSCT for CLL is limited because of the lack of suitable donors and the treatment-related morbidity/mortality for elderly patients, who constitute the majority at risk for developing this disease. The GVL effect, however, suggests there are specific CLL-associated antigens that could be targeted in autologous cellular immune therapy. Effective strategies for this will have to overcome the disease-related acquired immune deficiency and the capacity of the leukemia-cell to induce T-cell tolerance, thereby compromising the activity of even conventional vaccines in patients with this disease. We will discuss the different strategies being developed to overcome these limitations that might provide for effective cellular immune therapy of CLL.","['Kater, Arnon P', 'van Oers, Marinus H J', 'Kipps, Thomas J']","['Kater AP', 'van Oers MH', 'Kipps TJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', '*Transplantation Immunology', 'Transplantation, Autologous/*immunology/methods']",2007/07/20 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2007/07/20 09:00'],"['2007/07/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/20 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Oct 15;110(8):2811-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-01-068932.

We identified and characterized 7 cases of clinically benign clonal B-cell lymphocytosis. The clonal lymphocytes were clearly of CD5- and non-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) phenotype. All cases had mild to moderate absolute lymphocytosis. The clonal population accounted for 95% to 99% of B cells. For a follow-up period of 4 to 16 years, clonal lymphocytosis was persistent but virtually not progressing. Patients' conditions remained clinically stable and asymptomatic. The clonal populations had somatic hypermutations of the VH gene in 6 cases, indicating a germinal center or post-germinal center B-lymphocyte origin. Clonal cytogenetic aberrations were found in 5 of 6 cases, with 2 clones bearing isochromosome 17q that resulted in loss of p53 and 2 other clones with 7q abnormalities. By the presence of absolute lymphocytosis, this series differs from MBL cases identified by sensitive flow cytometry in normal populations. The phenotypic profiles are distinct from that of benign CLL. We suggest these CD5-B-cell lymphocytosis cases may represent an intermediate condition between covert clonal expansions and overt malignancy.","['Amato, Dominick', 'Oscier, David G', 'Davis, Zadie', 'Mould, Sarah', 'Zheng, Jianing', 'Kolomietz, Elena', 'Wang, Chen']","['Amato D', 'Oscier DG', 'Davis Z', 'Mould S', 'Zheng J', 'Kolomietz E', 'Wang C']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,"['0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'B-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'CD5 Antigens/*analysis', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics', 'Lymphocytosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation']",2007/07/20 09:00,2007/08/24 09:00,['2007/07/20 09:00'],"['2007/07/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/24 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/20 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 2007 Aug;128(2):333-8. doi: 10.1309/WB56ET6AGM44TM5T.,"['Y3030GL4T5841181 [pii]', '10.1309/WB56ET6AGM44TM5T [doi]']",,"['Department of Medicine, Mount Sinai Hospital, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Between January 2002 and December 2004, 175 consecutive Port-A-Cath insertions were followed for a total of 75,000 days (median, 407; range, 6-1,074). Incidence of catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs), other complications and CRBSI-related port removals were analysed for cases with acute leukaemia versus other malignancies. RESULTS: A total of 33 CRBSIs were encountered in 26 cases (18.9%), an infection rate of 0.44 episodes per 1,000 catheter days. While mean preoperative platelet count was 125.34 x 10(9)/L in children with acute leukaemia and 392.11 x 10(9)/L in those with other malignancies (p < 0.01), the incidence of all complications were similar between both subgroups. Staphylococcus epidermidis (23.1%) and Klebsiella spp. (19.2%) were most commonly isolated from infected ports. Median patient age and duration of implantation in CRBSI-related port removals was 1.5 years and 111 days respectively, and 10.0 years and 414 days respectively in CRBSIs without port removal. CONCLUSION: Minimal complications are associated with Port-A-Cath insertions, even in thrombocytopaenic leukaemic patients. The dominance of Gram-negative organisms in CRBSIs parallels the changing trend of nosocomial infectious agents involved in catheter-related infections.","['Loh, Amos H P', 'Chui, Chan-Hon']","['Loh AH', 'Chui CH']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],China,Asian J Surg,Asian journal of surgery,8900600,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Catheterization, Central Venous/*adverse effects', 'Catheters, Indwelling/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Sepsis/*epidemiology']",2007/07/20 09:00,2007/10/10 09:00,['2007/07/20 09:00'],"['2007/07/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/20 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Asian J Surg. 2007 Jul;30(3):193-9. doi: 10.1016/S1015-9584(08)60022-6.,"['S1015-9584(08)60022-6 [pii]', '10.1016/S1015-9584(08)60022-6 [doi]']",,"[""Department of Paediatric Surgery, KK Women's and Children's Hospital, Singapore. aloh@alumni.nus.edu.sg""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their etiopathogenesis has been unclear, as has their relationship to similar lesions arising in other settings of chronic immunodeficiency. We identified 12 polypoid lesions (from 8 immunosuppressed patients aged 6 months to 13 years) among all tongue lesions biopsied over the course of 13 years at our institution. Clinical history, histologic and ultrastructural features, special stains (Gram, Grocott methenamine silver, acid-fast bacilli, CD34, actin, desmin, human herpesvirus-8), in situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus, and cytogenetic features were studied. Immunocompromise was from bone marrow transplantation for severe combined immunodeficiency (n = 1) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 3), hypogammaglobulinemia (n = 2), 22q11 deletion syndrome (n = 1), and asthma therapy (n = 1). Histologic examination revealed fibrous stromal cores with squamous epithelial covering and various degrees of ulceration and accompanying inflammation and granulation tissue. In 2 patients lesions were multiple in number. Fibroblasts were variably positive for smooth muscle actin and desmin and negative for CD34. Special stains, immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and ultrastructural examination identified no organisms except occasional surface bacteria. The tongue lesion from 1 patient with Down's syndrome showed t(2;9)(p11;q34)+21 (translocation not seen in peripheral blood). Another patient had constitutional del 22q11. All transplant patients had Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (translocations involving 9q34 and 22q11). Patients with congenital immunosuppression had polyps arise at significantly younger ages than did patients with acquired immunosuppression. Immunosuppression-related lingual polyps are a fibroproliferative process occurring in patients with bone marrow transplantation and other immune-deficient conditions.

Here, 19 imatinib treated CML patients in first chronic phase were vaccinated with BCR-ABL peptides spanning the e14a2 fusion junction, some of which were linked to the pan DR epitope PADRE to augment CD4+ T cell help. Six vaccinations were given over 9 weeks, together with sargramostim. All patients developed mild local reactions. T cell responses to PADRE were seen in all patients. Fourteen of 19 patients developed T cell responses to BCR-ABL peptides. The development of an anti-BCR-ABL T cell response correlated with a subsequent fall in BCR-ABL transcripts. No molecular benefit was seen in the 5 patients not in major cytogenetic response (MCR) at baseline. However, of the 14 patients in MCR at baseline, 13 developed at least 1 log fall in BCR-ABL transcripts, though this occurred several months after completing vaccination, consistent with an effect at a primitive CML stem cell level. Vaccination may improve the fall in BCR-ABL transcripts in patients who have received imatinib for more than 12 months. BCR-ABL peptide vaccination may improve control of CML, especially in patients responding well to imatinib. Randomised trials are required to address this further.","['Rojas, J M', 'Knight, K', 'Wang, L', 'Clark, R E']","['Rojas JM', 'Knight K', 'Wang L', 'Clark RE']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Cancer Vaccines/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Dendritic Cells/cytology', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Peptides/*chemistry', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism']",2007/07/20 09:00,2007/12/12 09:00,['2007/07/20 09:00'],"['2007/07/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/20 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Nov;21(11):2287-95. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404858.

ITF2357 activated the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, upregulated p21 and downmodulated Bcl-2 and Mcl-1. The drug induced hyperacetylation of histone H3, H4 and tubulin. When studied in more physiological conditions, ITF2357 was still strongly cytotoxic for the interleukin-6 (IL-6)-dependent MM cell line CMA-03, or for AML samples maximally stimulated by co-culture on mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), but not for the MSCs themselves. Interestingly, ITF2357 inhibited the production of IL-6, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and interferon-gamma by MSCs by 80-95%. Finally, the drug significantly prolonged survival of severe combined immunodeficient mice inoculated with the AML-PS in vivo passaged cell line already at the 10 mg/kg oral dose.

Despite their long survival in vivo, B-CLL cells undergo rapid spontaneous apoptosis ex vivo. To maintain survival in vitro, we established a coculture system using the human bone marrow-derived stromal cell line HS-5. The microenvironment in these cocultures lead to B-CLL cell survival for at least several months and therefore provided a tool for valid in vitro analysis, mimicking the in vivo situation. Although primary B lymphocytes are notoriously resistant to most gene transfer techniques, we achieved high transfection efficiency and cell viability in this coculture system by using a nucleofection-based strategy. Surprisingly, the introduction of circular plasmid DNA into B cells and B-CLL cells induced rapid apoptosis, which was independent of the type of transgene used, but dependent on the DNA concentration. However, transfection of these cells with mRNA was highly efficient and resulted in sustained cell viability and potent transgene expression. The described procedure represents a new approach to study gene function in primary B cells and B-CLL cells.","['Seiffert, M', 'Stilgenbauer, S', 'Dohner, H', 'Lichter, P']","['Seiffert M', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'Dohner H', 'Lichter P']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Nucleic Acids)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology', 'Cell Culture Techniques/*methods', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Nucleic Acids/genetics', 'Plasmids/pharmacokinetics', 'RNA, Messenger/pharmacokinetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacokinetics', 'Stromal Cells/cytology', 'Transfection/*methods', 'Transgenes/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2007/07/20 09:00,2007/10/12 09:00,['2007/07/20 09:00'],"['2007/07/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/20 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Sep;21(9):1977-83. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404863.

Increase in caspase-8 messenger RNA and protein expression disabled tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced proliferation and restored sensitivity toward TRAIL-induced apoptosis which was inhibited by transfection of p53 decoy oligonucleotides, p53 shRNA and caspase-8 shRNA. Upregulation of caspase-8 and sensitization toward TRAIL-induced apoptosis was found both in a broad panel of tumor cell lines with downregulated caspase-8 and in TRAIL-resistant primary tumor cells of children with acute leukemia.

To provide direct evidence for the role of HIF-1alpha in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell differentiation and its mechanisms, we generated myeloid leukemic U937T transformants, in which HIF-1alpha was tightly induced by tetracycline withdrawal. The results showed that the conditional HIF-1alpha induction triggered granulocytic differentiation of these transformants, while the suppression of HIF-1alpha expression by specific short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) effectively inhibited hypoxia-induced differentiation of U937 cells, as evidenced by morphology, maturation-related antigens as well as expressions of myeloid differentiation signatures and hematopoietic cells-specific cytokine receptors. The specific shRNAs-inhibited expression of HIF-1beta, an essential partner for transcription activity of HIF-1, failed, while the inhibition of hematopoietic differentiation-critical CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-alpha (C/EBPalpha) significantly eliminated HIF-1alpha-mediated myeloid leukemic cell differentiation. Collectively, this work provided several lines of direct evidence for the role of HIF-1alpha protein through its nontranscriptional activity in myeloid cell differentiation, in which C/EBPalpha elicits a role as an effector downstream to HIF-1alpha.

Sca-1(+) cells were used because of their ability to home to, and engraft into, the bone marrow cavity. The human FGF-2 gene was modified to increase protein secretion and stability by adding the bone morphogenic protein (BMP)-2/4 hybrid signal sequence and by mutating two key cysteines. Retro-orbital injection of Sca-1(+) cells transduced with a Moloney leukemia virus (MLV)-based vector expressing the modified FGF-2 gene into sub-lethally irradiated W(41)/W(41) recipient mice resulted in long-term engraftment, more than 100-fold elevation in serum FGF-2 level, increased serum bone-formation markers, and massive endosteal bone formation. In recipient mice showing very high serum FGF-2 levels (>2,000 pg/ml), this enhanced endosteal bone formation was so robust that the marrow space was filled with bony tissues and insufficient calcium was available for the mineralization of all the newly formed bone, which led to secondary hyperparathyroidism and osteomalacia.

This study evaluated the hypothesis that fludarabine can replace cyclophosphamide for myeloablative allogeneic SCT. Ninety-five patients underwent allogeneic SCT from HLA-identical donors, following BuCy2 (n=55) or busulfan+fludarabine (BF, n=40). The efficacy of fludarabine compared to cyclophosphamide was retrospectively evaluated. The BF group exhibited a shorter duration until engraftment (P=0.001), lower incidence of acute and chronic GVHD (P<0.001 and P=0.003, respectively), and non-relapse mortality (NRM) (P=0.039). Furthermore, the event-free survival and overall survival were significantly higher for the BF group compared to the BuCy2 group (P=0.004 and 0.002, respectively). After adjusting for age, the risk status of disease, GVHD prophylaxis and donor type, the BF regimen was found to be an independent favorable risk factor for event-free survival (hazard ratio (HR), 0.181; 95% confidence interval, 0.045-0.720; P=0.016) and overall survival (HR, 0.168; 0.035-0.807; P=0.026). The replacement of cyclophosphamide with fludarabine for myeloablative conditioning seems to be more effective in terms of short-term NRM, and GVHD compared to BuCy2 regimen in allogeneic transplantation.","['Chae, Y S', 'Sohn, S K', 'Kim, J G', 'Cho, Y Y', 'Moon, J H', 'Shin, H J', 'Chung, J S', 'Cho, G J', 'Yang, D H', 'Lee, J-J', 'Kim, Y-K', 'Kim, H-J']","['Chae YS', 'Sohn SK', 'Kim JG', 'Cho YY', 'Moon JH', 'Shin HJ', 'Chung JS', 'Cho GJ', 'Yang DH', 'Lee JJ', 'Kim YK', 'Kim HJ']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Myeloablative Agonists)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Arterial Occlusive Diseases/chemically induced/mortality', 'Busulfan/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Cyclophosphamide/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/mortality', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/mortality', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/mortality', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloablative Agonists/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation Conditioning/adverse effects/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives']",2007/07/20 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2007/07/20 09:00'],"['2007/07/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/20 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2007 Sep;40(6):541-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1705770.

We studied absolute numbers of dendritic cell (DC) subsets and chimerism in T cells and two subsets of blood DCs (myeloid DCs (MDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (PDCs)) in relation to DLI-induced alloreactivity. Based on T cell and DC chimerism, we identified three groups. Four patients were completely donor chimeric in T cells and DC subsets. These patients had an early stage of relapse, and three of the four patients attained complete molecular remission (CMolR) without significant GVHD. Six patients were completely donor in T cells and mixed chimeric in DC subsets. All patients entered CMolR, but this was associated with GVHD in four and cytopenia in three patients. Five patients had mixed chimerism in T cells and complete recipient chimerism in MDC; only two patients entered CMolR. Our data suggest that the combination of donor T cells and mixed chimerism in DC subsets induces a potent graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect in association with GVHD.

We report two patients in whom donor-to-recipient transmission occurred through hematopoietic transplant by means of chromosomally integrated (CI) HHV-6. Iatrogenic transmission manifested at engraftment as asymptomatic elevation of HHV-6 viral DNA of 3600 and 15 400 DNA copies/ml in plasma and 6.1 x 10(6) and 9.7 x 10(5) DNA copies/ml in the whole blood.

Our established array CGH platform consists of 2,304 BAC/PAC clones covering the whole genome at 1.3-mega base resolutions. Using this technique, we were thus able to reveal disease-specific genomic alterations and the candidate target genes in various lymphomas. We herein report the characteristic genomic alterations of malignant lymphomas including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma (FL) and adult T cell lymphoma/leukemia (ATLL). The combined use of the array CGH data with gene expression profiling and specific gene rearrangement analyses further delineated the subtype-specific genomic alterations. For instance, we revealed that activated B-cell-like DLBCL is characterized by a gain of chromosome 3, 18q and loss of 9 p21, whereas the germinal center B-cell-like DLBCL is characterized by a gain of 2p15, 7q, and 12q. Among these genomic alterations,we found the 9 p21 loss (p16INK4a locus) to be the most aggressive type of DLBCL. Comparisons of the genome profiles of FL,both with and without BCL2 rearrangement, also revealed the existence of a unique subgroup: trisomy 3 FL. Comparison of genome profiles between acute type and lymphoma types of adult T cell lymphoma also demonstrated that acute and lymphoma types are genomically distinct subtypes, and thus may develop tumors via distinct genetic pathways. In addition to identifying disease-specific genomic alterations, we also discovered several target genes of the genomic gains and losses. Furthermore,we developed a computer algorithm to classify lymphoma diseases or subtypes on the basis of copy number gains and losses. We applied the algorithm to the classifications of DLBCL and MCL diseases and ABC and GCB subtypes. The method correctly classified the DLBCL and MCL diseases at 89%, and ABC and GCB subtypes at 83%. These results demonstrate that copy number gains and losses detected by array CGH could be used for classifying lymphomas into biologically and clinically distinct diseases or subtypes. The genomic copy number alterations detected by array CGH are therefore considered to have the potential to help diagnose or classify different disease entities and tumor subtypes.","['Tagawa, Hiroyuki']",['Tagawa H'],['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

METHODS: Dual-color dual-fusion BCR-ABL probe and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were use to detect chromosome preparations from 48 randomly selected CML patients in blast crisis (CML-BC). If only one fusion signal was detected in interphase cells with FISH, metaphase cells were simultaneously observed to determine if there were deletions on der (9). Chromosome preparations made at diagnosis from those with der (9) deletions in CML-BC were also assayed to determine if der (9) deletions occurred at the time of Philadelphia translocation. Patients in chronic phase were treated with hydroxyurea. RESULTS: Of the 48 CML-BC cases, 8 (16.7%) showed der (9) deletions and the deletions also existed in chromosome preparations made at diagnosis. The group with der (9) deletions had significantly shorter duration of chronic phase and overall survival than the group without (P < 0.05). There was no difference in the probability of the der (9) deletions between the cases transformed to acute lymphoid leukemia and those to acute myeloid leukemia (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: FISH technique can effectively detect der (9) deletions. Der (9) deletions occur at the time of Philadelphia translocation. CML patients with der (9) deletions have more rapid process and poor prognosis. Hydroxyurea could not reverse the poor prognosis of der (9) deletions in CML. Der (9) deletions might not lead to transformation to specific type in CML.","['Wu, Wei', 'Li, Jian-Yong', 'Shen, Yun-Feng', 'Cao, Xiang-Shan', 'Qiu, Hai-Rong', 'Xu, Wei']","['Wu W', 'Li JY', 'Shen YF', 'Cao XS', 'Qiu HR', 'Xu W']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua nei ke za zhi,16210490R,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', '*Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis']",2007/07/20 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2007/07/20 09:00'],"['2007/07/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/20 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi. 2007 May;46(5):386-8.,,,"['Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Real-time quantitative retroversion polymerase chain reaction (RQ-RT-PCR) method was established for detecting WT1 and GAPDH expression levels in the BM of 109 CML and 23 non-leukemic patients with Light Cycler. Normalized WT1 expression level (WT1(N)) was determined as a ratio between WT1 and GAPDH expression times 10(4). RESULTS: The median expression levels of WT1(N) in 23 CML patients of accelerate phase (CML-AP) and 22 CML patients of blast crisis (CML-BC) were statistically higher than those of 64 CML patients of chronic phase (CML-CP) and 23 non-leukemic controls (103.71 and 129.44 vs 3.44 and 1.47). No statistic differences were found between the CML-CP group and control group, nor between the CML-AP group and CML-BC group. Furthermore, the WT1(N) levels were correlated to the BCR/ABL fusion gene expression levels. Dynamic change of WT1(N) levels in 7 CML patients before or after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation showed that WT1 expression levels could predict relapse of leukemia. CONCLUSION: WT1 expression levels in CML patients in accelerate phase or blast crisis were strikingly higher than those in non-leukemic patients or CML patients in chronic phase, in whom WT1 expression was undetectable or showed low expression. WT1 gene could be an useful marker for detecting MRD and evaluating therapeutic efficacy in CML.","['Cao, Xiang-shan', 'Gu, Wei-ying', 'Chen, Zi-xing', 'Hu, Shao-yan', 'He, Jun', 'Cen, Jian-nong']","['Cao XS', 'Gu WY', 'Chen ZX', 'Hu SY', 'He J', 'Cen JN']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua nei ke za zhi,16210490R,['0 (WT1 Proteins)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'WT1 Proteins/*genetics']",2007/07/20 09:00,2008/07/12 09:00,['2007/07/20 09:00'],"['2007/07/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/20 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi. 2007 Apr;46(4):277-9.,,,"[""The Third Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, The First People's Hospital of Changzhou, Changzhou 213003, China.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All patients had de novo AML except for two with therapy-related AML. Various factors were assessed for their impact on morbidity and mortality, particularly the role of pre-induction leukapharesis and cranial irradiation. The most significant risk factors for ICH were the presence of two or more symptoms of leukostasis (odds ratios [OR] 10.6, 95% CI: 2.67-42.02; P = 0.001) and respiratory distress (OR 5.41, 95% CI: 1.44-20.32, P = 0.012).

Many malignant cells have non-functional p53 rendering them more ""aggressive"" in nature. Arrest in p53-negative cells occurs at the G2M cell cycle checkpoint. Failure of DNA damaged cells to arrest at G2 results in entry into mitosis and potential death through aberrant mitosis and/or apoptosis. The pivotal kinase regulating the G2M checkpoint is Cdk1/cyclin B whose activity is controlled by phosphorylation. The p53-negative myeloid leukemia cell lines K562 and HL-60 were used to determine Cdk1 phosphorylation status during etoposide treatment. Cdk1 tyrosine 15 phosphorylation was associated with G2M arrest, but not with cell death. Cdk1 tyrosine 15 phosphorylation also led to suppression of nuclear cyclin B-associated Cdk1 kinase activity. However cell death, associated with broader tyrosine phosphorylation of Cdk1 was not attributed to tyrosine 15 alone. This broader phosphoryl isoform of Cdk1 was associated with cyclin A and not cyclin B. Alternative phosphorylations sites were predicted as tyrosines 4, 99 and 237 by computer analysis. No similar pattern was found on Cdk2. These findings suggest novel Cdk1 phosphorylation sites, which appear to be associated with p53-independent cell death following etoposide treatment.","['Higginbottom, Karen', 'Jahnke, Ulrike', 'Newland, Adrian C', 'Cotter, Finbarr E', 'Allen, Paul David']","['Higginbottom K', 'Jahnke U', 'Newland AC', 'Cotter FE', 'Allen PD']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Cyclin A)', '0 (Cyclin B)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2 Protein Kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis/drug effects/physiology', 'CDC2 Protein Kinase/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/physiology', 'Cyclin A/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cyclin B/metabolism', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Multiprotein Complexes/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism']",2007/07/20 09:00,2008/03/28 09:00,['2007/07/20 09:00'],"['2007/07/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/20 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Apoptosis. 2007 Oct;12(10):1847-55. doi: 10.1007/s10495-007-0104-6.,['10.1007/s10495-007-0104-6 [doi]'],,"[""Centre for Haematology, Institute of Cell and Molecular Sciences, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary's University of London, 4 Newark Street, London, E1 2AT, UK.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It inhibited cell proliferation with IC50 approximately 12 microg/ml and produced apoptosis as measured by various biological end points e.g. increased sub-G0 DNA fraction, DNA ladder formation, enhanced AnnexinV-FITC binding of the cells. Further, initial events involved massive reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) formation, which were significantly inhibited by their respective inhibitors. Persistent high levels of NO and ROS caused Bcl-2 cleavage and translocation of Bax to mitochondria, which lead to loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsim) and release of cytochrome c, AIF, Smac/DIABLO to the cytosol. These events were associated with decreased expression of survivin and ICAD with attendant activation of caspases leading to PARP cleavage. Furthermore, TPD up regulated the expression of cell death receptors DR4 and TNF-R1 level, leading to caspase-8 activation. These studies thus demonstrate that TPD produces oxidative stress in cancer cells that triggers self-demise by ROS and NO regulated activation of both the intrinsic and extrinsic signaling cascades.","['Bhushan, Shashi', 'Kumar, Ajay', 'Malik, Fayaz', 'Andotra, Samar Singh', 'Sethi, Vijay Kumar', 'Kaur, Indu Pal', 'Taneja, Subhash Chandra', 'Qazi, Ghulam Nabi', 'Singh, Jaswant']","['Bhushan S', 'Kumar A', 'Malik F', 'Andotra SS', 'Sethi VK', 'Kaur IP', 'Taneja SC', 'Qazi GN', 'Singh J']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (3alpha, 24-dihydroxyurs-12-ene)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Birc5 protein, mouse)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Free Radical Scavengers)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Reactive Nitrogen Species)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Survivin)', '0 (Triterpenes)', '0 (caspase-activated DNase inhibitor)', '22584-04-9 (Isothiuronium)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'ES8C3884JW (S-methylisothiopseudouronium)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/metabolism', 'Animals', '*Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis/drug effects/physiology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Boswellia/*chemistry', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/metabolism', 'Free Radical Scavengers/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Isothiuronium/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Macrophages, Peritoneal/cytology/metabolism', 'Membrane Potentials/physiology', 'Mice', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/metabolism', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Molecular Structure', 'Nitric Oxide/metabolism', 'Plant Extracts/*chemistry', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Reactive Nitrogen Species/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins', 'Survivin', '*Triterpenes/chemistry/pharmacology']",2007/07/20 09:00,2008/03/28 09:00,['2007/07/20 09:00'],"['2007/07/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/20 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Apoptosis. 2007 Oct;12(10):1911-26. doi: 10.1007/s10495-007-0105-5.,['10.1007/s10495-007-0105-5 [doi]'],,"['Division of Pharmacology, Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Canal Road, Jammu, 180001, India.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The STATs are thus involved in the regulation of implantation, establishing uterine receptivity and regulation of the maternal immune response. It seems that STATs can orchestrate signals from hormones and cytokines in different cell types and may therefore generate numerous biological effects, despite the relatively small number of receptors activating the JAK/STAT pathway.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used differential display-polymerase chain reaction (DD-PCR) to study critically the global gene expression profile of the oral tumour versus normal epithelium. The differential expression of fished out cDNA were confirmed by Northern blot and reverse transcription-PCR. The differentially expressed cDNA were cloned, sequenced and matched for homology in the GenBank database. RESULTS: We identified 13 cDNA that showed differential expression. Out of these we selected four cDNA showing consistent reproducibility. One of the cDNA expressed exclusively in tumour had a homology to DEK, a putative oncogene, and is linked to leukaemia, various cancers, HIV infection and several autoimmune disorders. Another cDNA expressed only in tumour had homology to sorcin protein. Sorcin is a 22-kDa calcium-binding protein and is associated with drug resistance in various cell lines. Apparently, sorcin expression might be responsible for drug resistance of OSCC and poor prognosis. Another cDNA showing 10 times overexpression in cheek tumour as compared to normal had homology to CDK6 gene. Hence, it seems from our results that CDK6 is dysregulated during oral carcinogenesis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Apoptosis was checked by measuring the DNA fragmentation and determining the ratio of apoptotic/necrotic cells. The relationship between the induction of apoptosis and G(1), S or G(2) block in the cell cycle has also been investigated and cytogenetical evaluation of chromosomal aberrations in both cell lines has been carried out. The regulation of expression of Bax and Bcl-2 was also checked by western blotting after Ciprofloxacin treatment. RESULTS: We observed that the resistance of the subline was caused by a small percentage of cells that underwent apoptosis during continuous exposure to Ciprofloxacin in comparison with the parental cell line, whereas the percentage of necrotic cells remained unchanged. The WEHI-3B cells showed a G(2) block and a higher degree of cytogenetic damage after drug exposure. The two cell lines expressed the same level of Bax and Bcl-2 following stimulation by Ciprofloxacin. Only in the resistant subclone, the ratio Bcl-2/Bax reversed in the anti-apoptotic gene expression. CONCLUSION: The resistance to ciprofloxacin observed is not related to mitochondrial function and although Bcl-2/Bax ratio behaviour does not fully explain the resistance of the WEHI3B/CPX subclone it is consistent with phenotypic character of resistance to CPX. The toxic effect on sensitive cells could be mediated by the cell cycle arrest whereas in the resistant clone, the prolonged G(2) phase could play a key role to favour cell cycle progression and proliferation.","['Pessina, A', 'Bonomi, A', 'Casati, S', 'Collotta, A', 'Croera, C', 'Marafante, E', 'Palitti, F', 'Gribaldo, L']","['Pessina A', 'Bonomi A', 'Casati S', 'Collotta A', 'Croera C', 'Marafante E', 'Palitti F', 'Gribaldo L']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Cell Prolif,Cell proliferation,9105195,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '5E8K9I0O4U (Ciprofloxacin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Ciprofloxacin/*toxicity', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",2007/07/20 09:00,2007/08/30 09:00,['2007/07/20 09:00'],"['2007/07/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/30 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/20 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Prolif. 2007 Aug;40(4):568-79. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2184.2007.00456.x.,"['CPR456 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2184.2007.00456.x [doi]']",,"['Department of Public Health, Microbiology, Virology, University of Milan, Milan, Italy. augusto.pessina@unimi.it']",,,,,,,PMC6495790,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The RC regimen consisted of rituximab given on day 1 and 2-CdA (days 2-6). The RCC protocol included rituximab (day 1), 2-CdA (days 2-4) and cyclophosphamide given on days 2-4. The courses were re-administered at time intervals of 4 weeks or longer if severe myelosuppression occurred. RESULTS: Forty-six patients with CLL entered the study. Eighteen patients were treated with RC and 28 with RCC regimen. The median number of courses administered were three cycles (range 1-6). Three (6.5%) patients (95% CI: 1-14%) achieved a complete response and 31 (67%) patients (95% CI: 50-83%) a partial response. According to the particular regimen, the overall response rate was obtained in 12 (67%) patients treated with RC (95% CI: 45-89%) and in 22 patients (78%) treated with RCC (95% CI: 62-93%). The median progression free survival of responders to RC/RCC regimens was 12 months (range 4-46). Hypersensitivity to rituximab occurred in 16 (33%) patients, mostly during the first infusion of the drug. Grade 3/4 neutropenia was seen in six (13%) patients, grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia in three (9%) patients and grade 3/4 infections were observed in ten (28%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that both RC and RCC regimens are feasible in heavily pretreated patients with CLL, showing also distinct therapeutic activity and relatively low toxicity, even in patients previously treated with cladribine-based protocols.","['Robak, Tadeusz', 'Smolewski, Piotr', 'Cebula, Barbara', 'Grzybowska-Izydorczyk, Olga', 'Blonski, Jerzy Z']","['Robak T', 'Smolewski P', 'Cebula B', 'Grzybowska-Izydorczyk O', 'Blonski JZ']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/adverse effects/*immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Cladribine/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Rituximab', 'Survival Rate']",2007/07/20 09:00,2007/09/01 09:00,['2007/07/20 09:00'],"['2007/07/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/01 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/20 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2007 Aug;79(2):107-13. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2007.00889.x.,"['EJH889 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2007.00889.x [doi]']",,"['Department of Hematology, Medical University of Lodz and Copernicus Memorial Hospital, Lodz, Poland. robaktad@csk.umed.lodz.pl']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study assesses another important measure of treatment effectiveness: the health-related quality of life (HRQL) of survivors. METHODS: All new patients diagnosed in a 3-year period were eligible if free of disease for at least 2 years after therapy and at least 7 years of age at the time of study. A sample of convenient subjects for comparison was obtained from schools and clinics for well children. During a 7-month period, Spanish language interviewer-administered questionnaires were used to collect Health Utilities Index data from survivors and the comparison group (self-reports), and from proxies (parents, physicians, and teachers). RESULTS: Of 113 eligible survivors, 95 (84%) participated together with 96 ""control"" subjects. Control subjects have a higher mean HRQL utility score than survivors (P < 0.001). The mean score for survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL): 0.72 (n = 49) is higher than the score for survivors of brain tumors: 0.60 (n = 20), as expected. Inter-rater agreement is highest between survivors and parents, and lowest between controls and physicians or teachers. CONCLUSIONS: The burden of morbidity in survivors of childhood cancer in Uruguay is considerable and greater than that in a comparative group of healthy children. Survivors of ALL have better HRQL than survivors of brain tumors, mirroring experience elsewhere. The level of inter-rater agreement is related to the degree of familiarity of the pair-members of respondents with each other.","['Fluchel, Mark', 'Horsman, John R', 'Furlong, William', 'Castillo, Luis', 'Alfonz, Yasmine', 'Barr, Ronald D']","['Fluchel M', 'Horsman JR', 'Furlong W', 'Castillo L', 'Alfonz Y', 'Barr RD']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Health Status', '*Health Status Indicators', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*psychology', 'Observer Variation', 'Parents', 'Physicians', 'Proxy', 'Quality of Life/*psychology', 'Registries', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Survivors/*psychology', 'Uruguay']",2007/07/20 09:00,2008/03/26 09:00,['2007/07/20 09:00'],"['2007/07/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/26 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/20 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2008 Apr;50(4):838-43. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21299.,['10.1002/pbc.21299 [doi]'],"['(c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","[""Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We investigated infectious complications in 293 children during different treatment phases of the multicenter protocol COALL-06-97. We also evaluated whether therapy reduction in prognostically good risk patients receiving either the low risk or high risk treatment arm would lead to fewer infectious complications. RESULTS: Thirty of 293 patients had no infections; 263 patients had 682 infectious complications (median 2, range 1-9), five of them lethal. Two thirds of the infections occurred during periods of neutropenia. The most frequent infectious episodes were fever of unknown origin (FUO): 483/682 (70.8%), microbiologically documented infections (MDI): 100/682 (14.6%), (61 gram-positive, 36 gram-negative, 3 fungal isolates), and clinically documented infections (CDI): 99/682 (14.5%). With standard reinduction, 44% low risk and 57% high risk patients had infections versus 26% low risk and 38% high risk patients with reduced reinduction therapy (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Most patients treated with intensive combination therapy for ALL experience one to several serious infections during treatment.

RESULTS: IGFBP-2 expression was significantly higher in AML cells than in healthy cells of peripheral MNC (P < 0.001) and of bone marrow cells (P < 0.01). Conversely, AML cells showed significantly lower IGFBP-3 and IGF-I gene expression compared to controls (P = 0.02; P < 0.001).

A multivariate analysis identified the IGFBP-2 mRNA expression as an independent factor for the prediction of relapse. Furthermore, the probability of relapse-free survival (RFS) in patients with IGFBP-2 mRNA level >0.1000 was 28%; whereas, the probability of RFS in patients with IGFBP-2 mRNA level <0.1000 was 62% (P = 0.04, log-rank test).

Morphological examination associated with immunophenotyping is, in most cases, likely to distinguish these CD5 negative entities. However, the diagnosis can be difficult to make on morphological criteria, especially in patients without absolute lymphocytosis. Based on histologic, cytogenetic and molecular studies, SLVL emerges as a distinct entity. SLVL has a relatively clinical benign course but a few patients could require treatment, because of a symptomatic splenomegaly and/or a severe cytopenia. In symptomatic patients HCV negative, the frontline treatment remains questionable. Splenectomy, regarded as the most effective treatment, could be required for diagnostic purposes: however, relapse occur in 30% of cases. Fludarabine (FDR), a purine analogue and deoxycoformycin (DCF) can induce a maintained response in a substantial proportion of patients with SLVL and could be used as a first line treatment.

Its ability to induce apoptosis in various malignant cell lines has made it a potential treatment agent for other malignancies and many clinical trials are currently in progress to evaluate its clinical usefulness for multiple myeloma and glioblastoma cancer. In the present study, we investigated the metabolism of As2O3 regarding its cellular biotransformation and interaction with metallothionein (MT) as a possible protective responses of cells to arsenic-induced cytotoxicity. The study was performed on two types of cell treated with As2O3: (1) human astrocytoma (glioblastoma) cell line U87MG treated with 0.6 microM arsenic for 0, 3, 12, 24, and 48 h or 12 microM arsenic for 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h and (2) bone marrow cells (BM) from two patients with multiple myeloma (MM) treated with 7 microM arsenic for 0, 43, and 67 h. Cotreatment with vitamin C (1 mg/mL) was tested in longer exposure of MM BM cells. Traces of methylation products (mainly monomethylarsenic acid) were detected in cell lysates of both cell types and in pellets of U87 MG cells, although we found problems with column-sample interactions in cases where methanol pretreatment of the sample was not used. Pentavalent inorganic arsenic (AsV) was identified in both cell types, and up to 80% of total As in MM bone marrow cell lysates was present as AsV. Such an occurrence (generation) of pentavalent arsenic after As2O3 treatment demonstrates the presence of biological oxidation of trivalent arsenic, which could represent an additional protective mechanism of the cell. Vitamin C decreased As cell content and increased the percentage of pentavalent inorganic arsenic (in the growth medium and cells). The presence of metallothionein (MT) and its response to arsenic treatment was checked in all U87 MG cells, in the control, and in one exposed sample of MM BM cells. During 48 h exposure to 0.6 or 12 muM arsenic MTI/II levels increased in U87 MG cells, but with variable Zn levels, increased Cu levels, and As binding observed in traces only. Involvement of the MT-III isoform was negligible. In contrast, 43 h exposure to 7 microMarsenic did not increase MT content in multiple myeloma cells, and the levels even decreased with respect to the control. To evaluate the importance of the observed processes, MTs in U87 and AsIII-AsV conversion in MM BM cells, which could represent a resistance response of cancer cells treated by As2O3, longer-term observation with different arsenic concentrations should be performed.","['Falnoga, Ingrid', 'Slejkovec, Zdenka', 'Pucer, Anja', 'Podgornik, Helena', 'Tusek-Znidaric, Magda']","['Falnoga I', 'Slejkovec Z', 'Pucer A', 'Podgornik H', 'Tusek-Znidaric M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biol Trace Elem Res,Biological trace element research,7911509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacokinetics/toxicity', 'Apoptosis', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*analysis/*pharmacokinetics', 'Ascorbic Acid/metabolism', 'Astrocytoma/*drug therapy', 'Biotransformation', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatography, Ion Exchange', 'Humans', 'Models, Chemical', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy', 'Oxides/*analysis/*pharmacokinetics', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Time Factors']",2007/07/20 09:00,2007/09/27 09:00,['2007/07/20 09:00'],"['2006/07/31 00:00 [received]', '1999/11/30 00:00 [revised]', '2006/08/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/07/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/27 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/20 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biol Trace Elem Res. 2007 Apr;116(1):5-28. doi: 10.1007/BF02685915.,"['BTER:116:1:5 [pii]', '10.1007/BF02685915 [doi]']",,"['Department of Environmental Sciences, Jozef Stefan Institute, Jamova 39, 1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: K562, LAMA 84, and primary CML patient-derived CD34(+) mononuclear cells were exposed to vorinostat followed by sorafenib, after which effects on cell viability and various survival signaling pathways were monitored by flow cytometry, clonogenic assays, and Western blotting. Real-time reverse transcription-PCR was used to monitor gene expression, and the functional contribution of p21(CIP1) and Mcl-1 down-regulation were determined in cells transfected with corresponding constructs. RESULTS: Pretreatment (24 h) with vorinostat followed by sorafenib optimally induced mitochondrial injury and cell death in Bcr/Abl(+) cells (e.g., K562 and LAMA 84). Similar results were obtained in imatinib mesylate-resistant cells expressing activated Lyn as well as in primary CD34(+) bone marrow cells obtained from CML patients. This regimen also markedly inhibited CML cell colony formation. Combined but not individual treatment of CML cells with vorinostat and sorafenib triggered pronounced mitochondrial dysfunction (i.e., cytochrome c, Smac, and AIF release), caspase activation, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, and down-regulation of Mcl-1. Sorafenib also blocked vorinostat-mediated induction of p21(CIP1). Down-regulation of Mcl-1 was caspase and transcription independent, whereas p21(CIP1) down-regulation was partially caspase and transcription dependent. Enforced expression of p21(CIP1) and particularly Mcl-1 significantly attenuated vorinostat/sorafenib-mediated lethality. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that combined treatment with vorinostat and sorafenib synergistically induces apoptosis in CML cells through a process that involves Mcl-1 down-regulation and inhibition of p21(CIP1) induction.","['Dasmahapatra, Girija', 'Yerram, Nitin', 'Dai, Yun', 'Dent, Paul', 'Grant, Steven']","['Dasmahapatra G', 'Yerram N', 'Dai Y', 'Dent P', 'Grant S']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Retracted Publication']",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Benzenesulfonates)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyridines)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '58IFB293JI (Vorinostat)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)']",IM,"['Benzenesulfonates/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/*genetics', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Niacinamide/analogs & derivatives', 'Phenylurea Compounds', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology', 'Sorafenib', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vorinostat']",2007/07/20 09:00,2007/09/18 09:00,['2007/07/20 09:00'],"['2007/07/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/18 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/20 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2007 Jul 15;13(14):4280-90. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-0835.,"['13/14/4280 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-0835 [doi]']",,"['Department of Medicine, Massey Cancer Center, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia 23298, USA.']","['CA 100866/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 93738/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,"['NIH Guide Grants Contracts. 2015 Dec 18;:NOT-OD-16-040.

Therefore, we investigated combining these two drugs in human leukemia cell lines in vitro. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We initially examined the effects of ara-C and DAC on human leukemia cell lines HL60, ML-1, RAji, and Jurkat. We measured IC(50) of DAC and ara-C in these cell lines and calculated a combination index of these two drugs given either simultaneously or sequentially. In searching for mechanisms relative to epigenetic regulation for this effect, we examined DNA methylation of LINE and Alu repetitive elements as a surrogate for global genomic DNA methylation. In addition, we sorted Annexin V positive and negative cells and measured differences in LINE methylation between them. RESULTS: The combination of DAC and ara-C showed additive induction of cell death in ML-1 and synergistic induction in HL60, Raji, and Jurkat. Sequentially, DAC followed by ara-C was a synergistic combination in all cell lines. Low-dose DAC induced more hypomethylation than high doses of the drug, whereas ara-C had no effects on methylation. The combination of ara-C with DAC either together or DAC followed by ara-C resulted in inhibition of LINE demethylation in HL60. The RIL gene, which is silenced by DNA hypermethylation, was activated by DAC, but the addition of ara-C to DAC reduced RIL gene activation. DAC treatment increased H3 Lys(9) acetylation of Alu elements, whereas ara-C had no effect, and the addition of ara-C to DAC inhibited this effect. Finally, we showed that after DAC exposure, Annexin V positive cells were more hypomethylated than Annexin V negative cells. CONCLUSION: The combination of DAC and ara-C showed additive or synergistic effects on cell death in four human leukemia cell lines in vitro, but antagonism in terms of epigenetic effects. One possible explanation for these paradoxical observations is that hypomethylated cells are sensitized to cell killing by ara-C. These data suggest that DAC used in combination with ara-C has clinical potential in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia.","['Qin, Taichun', 'Youssef, Emile M', 'Jelinek, Jaroslav', 'Chen, Rong', 'Yang, Allen S', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Issa, Jean-Pierre J']","['Qin T', 'Youssef EM', 'Jelinek J', 'Chen R', 'Yang AS', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Issa JP']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Annexin A5/metabolism', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects/genetics', 'Decitabine', 'HL-60 Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2007/07/20 09:00,2007/09/18 09:00,['2007/07/20 09:00'],"['2007/07/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/18 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/20 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2007 Jul 15;13(14):4225-32. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-2762.,"['13/14/4225 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-2762 [doi]']",,"['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Six patients who were receiving imatinib (400 mg/d) as part of their ongoing treatment for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) received a dose containing a trace quantity (13.6 kBq) of (14)C-imatinib. Blood samples were collected from patients before and at various times up to 72 h after administration of the test dose and were processed to provide samples of plasma and peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). Samples were analyzed by AMS, with chromatographic separation of parent compound from metabolites. In addition, plasma samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LCMS). RESULTS: Analysis of the AMS data indicated that imatinib was rapidly absorbed and could be detected in plasma up to 72 h after administration. Imatinib was also detectable in PBL at 24 h after administration of the (14)C-labeled dose. Comparison of plasma concentrations determined by AMS with those derived by LCMS analysis gave similar average estimates of area under plasma concentration time curve (26 +/- 3 versus 27 +/- 11 microg/mL.h), but with some variation within each individual. CONCLUSIONS: Using this technique, data were obtained in a small number of patients on the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of imatinib in the context of chronic dosing, which could shed light on possible pharmacologic causes of resistance to imatinib in CML.","['Boddy, Alan V', 'Sludden, Julieann', 'Griffin, Melanie J', 'Garner, Colin', 'Kendrick, John', 'Mistry, Pritesh', 'Dutreix, Catherine', 'Newell, David R', ""O'Brien, Stephen G""]","['Boddy AV', 'Sludden J', 'Griffin MJ', 'Garner C', 'Kendrick J', 'Mistry P', 'Dutreix C', 'Newell DR', ""O'Brien SG""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Middle Aged', 'Particle Accelerators', 'Piperazines/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use']",2007/07/20 09:00,2007/09/18 09:00,['2007/07/20 09:00'],"['2007/07/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/18 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/20 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2007 Jul 15;13(14):4164-9. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-2179.,"['13/14/4164 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-2179 [doi]']",,"['Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom.

Acteoside inhibited the proliferation of HL-60 cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner with an IC50, approximately 30 microM. DNA flow cytometric analysis indicated that acteoside blocked cell cycle progression at the G1 phase in HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells. Among the G1 phase cell cycle-related proteins, the levels of cyclin-dependent protein kinase (CDK)2, CDK6, cyclin D1, cyclin D2, cyclin D3 and cyclin E were reduced by acteoside, whereas the steady-state level of CDK4 was unaffected. The protein and mRNA levels of CDK inhibitors (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors), such as p21(CIP1/WAF1) and p27(KIP1), were gradually increased after acteoside treatment in a time-dependent manner. In addition, acteoside markedly enhanced the binding of p21(CIP1/WAF1) and p27(KIP1) to CDK4 and CDK6, resulting in the reduction of CDK2, CDK4 and CDK6 activities. Moreover, the hypophosphorylated form of retinoblastoma increased, leading to the enhanced binding of protein retinoblastoma (pRb) and E2F1. Our results further suggest that acteoside is a potent inducer of differentiation of HL-60 cells based on biochemical activities and the expression level of CD14 cell surface antigen. In conclusion, the onset of acteoside-induced G1 arrest of HL-60 cells prior to the differentiation appears to be tightly linked to up-regulation of the p21(CIP1/WAF1) and p27(KIP1) levels and decreases in the CDK2, CDK4 and CDK6 activities. These findings, for the first time, reveal the mechanism underlying the anti-proliferative effect of acteoside on human promyelocytic HL-60 cells.","['Lee, Kyung-Won', 'Kim, Hyoung Ja', 'Lee, Yong Sup', 'Park, Hee-Jun', 'Choi, Jong-Won', 'Ha, Joohun', 'Lee, Kyung-Tae']","['Lee KW', 'Kim HJ', 'Lee YS', 'Park HJ', 'Choi JW', 'Ha J', 'Lee KT']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Glucosides)', '0 (Phenols)', '0 (Stilbenes)', '3TGX09BD5B (acteoside)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/pharmacology', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'Glucosides/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells/*cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Muscle Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Phenols/*pharmacology', 'Resting Phase, Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Resveratrol', 'Stilbenes/pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",2007/07/20 09:00,2008/03/15 09:00,['2007/07/20 09:00'],"['2007/07/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/15 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/20 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2007 Sep;28(9):1928-36. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgm126.

The broad-spectrum inhibitors cathepsin inhibitor III and E-64d gave comparable dose-dependent inhibition of Moloney MLV Env and VSV G pseudotypes, suggesting that the decrease did not involve the envelope protein. Whereas, CA-074 Me gave a biphasic response that differentiated between Moloney MLV Env and VSV G at low concentrations, at which the drug is highly selective for cathepsin B, but was similar for both glycoproteins at higher concentrations, at which CA-074 Me inhibits other cathepsins. Moloney MLV infection was lower on cathepsin B knockout fibroblasts than wild-type cells, whereas VSV G infection was not reduced on the B-/- cells. Taken together, these results support the notion that cathepsin B acts at an envelope-dependent step while another cathepsin acts at an envelope-independent step, such as uncoating or viral-DNA synthesis. Virus binding was not affected by CA-074 Me, whereas syncytium induction was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner, consistent with cathepsin B involvement in membrane fusion. Western blot analysis revealed specific cathepsin B cleavage of SU in vitro, while TM and CA remained intact. Infection could be enhanced by preincubation of Moloney MLV with cathepsin B, consistent with SU cleavage potentiating infection. These data suggested that during infection of NIH 3T3 cells, endocytosis brings Moloney MLV to early lysosomes, where the virus encounters cellular proteases, including cathepsin B, that cleave SU.","['Kumar, Pankaj', 'Nachagari, Deepa', 'Fields, Carolyn', 'Franks, John', 'Albritton, Lorraine M']","['Kumar P', 'Nachagari D', 'Fields C', 'Franks J', 'Albritton LM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Dipeptides)', '134448-10-5 (N-(3-propylcarbamoyloxirane-2-carbonyl)-isoleucyl-proline)', 'EC 3.4.22.1 (Cathepsin B)', 'GMW67QNF9C (Leucine)', 'L5W337AOUR (aloxistatin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cathepsin B/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Dipeptides/pharmacology', 'Endocytosis', 'Leucine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*enzymology', 'Lysosomes/enzymology/virology', '*Membrane Fusion/drug effects', 'Mice', '*Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'NIH 3T3 Cells']",2007/07/20 09:00,2007/11/07 09:00,['2007/07/20 09:00'],"['2007/07/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/20 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2007 Oct;81(19):10506-14. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02853-06.

To identify amino acid residues in XPR1 important for virus entry, we tested mouse cells derived from evolutionarily divergent species for susceptibility to prototypical PMVs, XMVs, and the wild mouse isolate CasE#1. CasE#1 has a variant XMV/PMV host range, and sequence analysis of the CasE#1 env gene identifies segments related to PMVs and XMVs. Cells from the Asian mouse species Mus pahari show a unique pattern of susceptibility to these three viruses; these cells are susceptible to XMVs and CasE#1 but are resistant to PMVs, whereas NIH 3T3 cells show the reciprocal pattern, susceptibility to only PMVs. The M. pahari XPR1 gene differs from that of NIH 3T3 in the two extracellular loops (ECLs) previously shown to mediate virus entry (M. Marin, C. S. Tailor, A. Nouri, S. L. Kozak, and D. Kabat, J. Virol. 73:9362-9368, 1999, and N. S. Van Hoeven and A. D. Miller, Retrovirology 2:76, 2005). Using transfected hamster cells expressing chimeric and mutated XPR1s, we demonstrated that the susceptibility differences between NIH 3T3 and M. pahari cells are receptor mediated, that PMV entry requires residues in ECL3, that the CasE#1 entry determinant is in ECL4, and that determinants for XMV entry are in both ECL3 and ECL4. Additional substitutions in ECL3 and ECL4 modulate virus susceptibility and suggest that ECL3 and ECL4 may contribute to the formation of a single virus receptor site. The position of M. pahari at the base of the Mus phylogenetic tree indicates that XPR1-mediated susceptibility to XMVs is the ancestral type in this genus and that the phenotypic variants of mouse XPR1 likely arose in conjunction with exposure to gammaretrovirus infections and coevolutionary adaptations in the viral envelope.","['Yan, Yuhe', 'Knoper, Ryan C', 'Kozak, Christine A']","['Yan Y', 'Knoper RC', 'Kozak CA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Xenotropic and Polytropic Retrovirus Receptor)', '0 (Xpr1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Chimera', 'Cricetinae', 'Gammaretrovirus/*physiology', 'Genes, Viral', 'Genetic Variation', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Phylogeny', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/genetics/*physiology', 'Receptors, Virus/genetics/*physiology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', '*Virus Internalization', 'Xenotropic and Polytropic Retrovirus Receptor']",2007/07/20 09:00,2007/11/07 09:00,['2007/07/20 09:00'],"['2007/07/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/20 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2007 Oct;81(19):10550-7. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00933-07.

Infection is causally linked to the development of extensive syncytia in brain capillary endothelial cells (BCEC). These viruses also induce cell fusion of murine cell lines, such as SC-1 and NIH 3T3, which are otherwise resistant to MLV-induced syncytium formation. Although the virulence of these viruses maps within the env gene, the mechanism of fusion enhancement is not fully determined. To this end, we examined the capacity of the syncytium-inducing (SI) TR1.3 and W102G MLVs to overcome the fusion inhibitory activity inherent in the full-length Env cytoplasmic tail. These studies showed that the TR1.3 and W102G Envs did not induce premature cleavage of p2E, nor did they override p2E fusion inhibition. Indeed, in the presence of mutations that disrupt p2E function, the TR1.3 and W102G Envs significantly increased the extent of cell fusion compared to that with the non-syncytium-inducing MLV FB29. Surprisingly, we also observed that TR1.3 and W102G Envs failed to elicit syncytium formation in these in vitro assays. Coexpression of gag-pol with env restored syncytium formation, and accordingly, mutations within gag-pol were used to examine the minimal functional requirements for the SI phenotype. The results indicate that both gag-dependent particle budding and cleavage of p2E are required to activate the SI phenotype of TR1.3 and W102G viruses. Collectively, these data suggest that the TR1.3 and W102G viruses induce cell fusion by the fusion-from-without pathway.","['Murphy, Samuel L', 'Gaulton, Glen N']","['Murphy SL', 'Gaulton GN']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Fusion Proteins, gag-pol)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fusion Proteins, gag-pol/metabolism', 'Gene Products, env/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Products, gag/genetics/*metabolism', 'Giant Cells/*virology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/metabolism/*pathogenicity', '*Membrane Fusion', 'Mice', 'Mutation']",2007/07/20 09:00,2007/11/07 09:00,['2007/07/20 09:00'],"['2007/07/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/20 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2007 Oct;81(19):10777-85. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00816-07.

HTLV-1 contains both regulatory and accessory genes in four pX open reading frames. pX ORF-II encodes two proteins, p13 and p30, whose roles are still being defined in the virus life cycle and in HTLV-1 virus-host cell interactions. Proviral clones of HTLV-1 with pX ORF-II mutations diminish the ability of the virus to maintain viral loads in vivo. p30 expressed exogenously differentially modulates CREB and Tax-responsive element-mediated transcription through its interaction with CREB-binding protein/p300 and while acting as a repressor of many genes including Tax, in part by blocking tax/rex RNA nuclear export, selectively enhances key gene pathways involved in T-cell signaling/activation. RESULTS: Herein, we analyzed the role of p30 in cell cycle regulation. Jurkat T-cells transduced with a p30 expressing lentivirus vector accumulated in the G2-M phase of cell cycle. We then analyzed key proteins involved in G2-M checkpoint activation. p30 expression in Jurkat T-cells resulted in an increase in phosphorylation at serine 216 of nuclear cell division cycle 25C (Cdc25C), had enhanced checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) serine 345 phosphorylation, reduced expression of polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), diminished phosphorylation of PLK1 at tyrosine 210 and reduced phosphorylation of Cdc25C at serine 198. Finally, primary human lymphocyte derived cell lines immortalized by a HTLV-1 proviral clone defective in p30 expression were more susceptible to camptothecin induced apoptosis. Collectively these data are consistent with a cell survival role of p30 against genotoxic insults to HTLV-1 infected lymphocytes. CONCLUSION: Collectively, our data are the first to indicate that HTLV-1 p30 expression results in activation of the G2-M cell cycle checkpoint, events that would promote early viral spread and T-cell survival.","['Datta, Antara', 'Silverman, Lee', 'Phipps, Andrew J', 'Hiraragi, Hajime', 'Ratner, Lee', 'Lairmore, Michael D']","['Datta A', 'Silverman L', 'Phipps AJ', 'Hiraragi H', 'Ratner L', 'Lairmore MD']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Viral Core Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (CDC25C protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 1)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (cdc25 Phosphatases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/physiology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'G2 Phase/*genetics/immunology', 'Genes, pX', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/methods', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 1', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology/metabolism/physiology', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Viral Core Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'cdc25 Phosphatases/metabolism']",2007/07/20 09:00,2007/09/05 09:00,['2007/07/20 09:00'],"['2007/04/19 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/07/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/20 09:00 [entrez]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2007 Jul 16;4:49. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-4-49.,"['1742-4690-4-49 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-4-49 [doi]']",,"['Center for Retrovirus Research, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA. datta.15@osu.edu']","['P01 CA100730/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA100730-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-70529/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA100730/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,20070716,PMC1937004,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The physiological actions of retinoids are mediated primarily by the retinoic acid receptors alpha, beta, and gamma (RARs) and rexinoid receptors alpha, beta, and gamma. Although mutations in RARalpha, via the PML-RARalpha fusion proteins, result in acute promyelocytic leukemia, RARs have generally not been reported to be mutated or part of fusion proteins in carcinomas. However, the retinoid signaling pathway is often compromised in carcinomas. Altered retinol metabolism, including low levels of lecithin:retinol acyl trasferase and retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2, and higher levels of CYP26A1, has been observed in various tumors. RARbeta(2) expression is also reduced or is absent in many types of cancer. A greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which retinoids induce cell differentiation, and in particular stem cell differentiation, is required in order to solve the issue of retinoid resistance in tumors, and thereby to utilize RA and synthetic retinoids more effectively in combination therapies for human cancer.","['Mongan, Nigel P', 'Gudas, Lorraine J']","['Mongan NP', 'Gudas LJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Differentiation,Differentiation; research in biological diversity,0401650,"['0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoids)', '11103-57-4 (Vitamin A)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*metabolism/prevention & control', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*agonists/genetics/*metabolism', 'Retinoids/metabolism/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Vitamin A/metabolism']",2007/07/20 09:00,2008/02/09 09:00,['2007/07/20 09:00'],"['2007/07/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/09 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/20 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Differentiation. 2007 Nov;75(9):853-70. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-0436.2007.00206.x.
