The roles of some polymorphisms in genes encoding enzymes critical for the biotransformation of imatinib have been previously examined. This study, hence, evaluated some other unstudied functionally significant polymorphisms in CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP3A5. Trough imatinib blood levels and genotypes were determined in 42 CML patients by an HPLC-UV technique and a Sequenom iPLEX assay, respectively. Statistical analysis of the influence of genetic polymorphisms on standardized trough level detected no significant relationship. However, higher trough levels were observed in two homozygous carriers of CYP2C8*2 while diminished imatinib levels were seen in two homozygous carriers of CYP3A5*7. The study findings suggest that polymorphisms in drug metabolizing enzymes may be significant for imatinib therapy only in instances where all copies of the relevant studied genes are functionally impaired.","['Adehin, Ayorinde', 'Adeagbo, Babatunde A', 'Kennedy, Martin A', 'Bolaji, Oluseye O', 'Olugbade, Tiwalade A', 'Bolarinwa, Rahman A', 'Durosinmi, Muheez A']","['Adehin A', 'Adeagbo BA', 'Kennedy MA', 'Bolaji OO', 'Olugbade TA', 'Bolarinwa RA', 'Durosinmi MA']","['a Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy , Obafemi Awolowo University , Ile-Ife , Nigeria.', 'a Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy , Obafemi Awolowo University , Ile-Ife , Nigeria.', 'b Department of Pathology and Carney Centre for Pharmacogenomics , University of Otago , Christchurch , New Zealand.', 'a Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy , Obafemi Awolowo University , Ile-Ife , Nigeria.', 'a Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy , Obafemi Awolowo University , Ile-Ife , Nigeria.', 'c Department of Haematology and Immunology , Obafemi Awolowo University , Ile-Ife , Nigeria.', 'c Department of Haematology and Immunology , Obafemi Awolowo University , Ile-Ife , Nigeria.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-6722-1970', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6445-8526', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8295-7150']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180509,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 1.14.13.- (CYP2C9 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.13.- (Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (CYP1A2 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (CYP2C8 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (CYP3A5 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C8)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Biological Variation, Population/*genetics', 'Biotransformation', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2/genetics/metabolism', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C8/genetics/metabolism', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9/genetics/metabolism', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A/genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nigeria', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Prospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*CYP1A2', '*CYP2C8', '*CYP2C9', '*CYP3A5', '*Imatinib', '*chronic myeloid leukemia']",2018/05/10 06:00,2020/01/01 06:00,['2018/05/10 06:00'],"['2018/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/01 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2018.1466291 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2019 Jan;60(1):216-221. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2018.1466291.

The study, ""REhabilitation, including Social and Physical activity and Education in Children and Teenagers with cancer"" (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01772862) examines the efficacy of multimodal rehabilitation strategies introduced at cancer diagnosis. This article addresses the feasibility of and obstacles to testing physical function in children with cancer. METHODS: The intervention group comprised 46 males and 29 females aged 6-18 years (mean +/- SD: 11.3 +/- 3.1 years) diagnosed with cancer from January 2013 to April 2016. Testing at diagnosis and after 3 months included timed-up-and-go, sit-to-stand, flamingo balance, handgrip strength, and the bicycle ergometer cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET). RESULTS: Of the 75 children, 92% completed a minimum of one test; two children declined testing and four were later included. Completion was low for CPET (38/150, 25%) but was high for handgrip strength (122/150, 81%). Tumor location, treatment-related side effects, and proximity to chemotherapy administration were primary obstacles for testing physical function. Children with extracranial solid tumors and central nervous system tumors completed significantly fewer tests than those with leukemia and lymphoma. Children with leukemia demonstrated reduced lower extremity function, that is, 24% reduction at 3 months testing in timed-up-and-go (P = 0.005) and sit-to-stand (P = 0.002), in contrast with no reductions observed in the other diagnostic groups. CONCLUSION: Children with cancer are generally motivated to participate in physical function tests. Future studies should address diagnosis specific obstacles and design testing modalities that facilitate physical function tests in this target group.","['Nielsen, Martin K F', 'Christensen, Jesper F', 'Frandsen, Thomas L', 'Thorsteinsson, Troels', 'Andersen, Lars B', 'Christensen, Karl B', 'Nersting, Jacob', 'Faber, Marianne', 'Schmiegelow, Kjeld', 'Larsen, Hanne B']","['Nielsen MKF', 'Christensen JF', 'Frandsen TL', 'Thorsteinsson T', 'Andersen LB', 'Christensen KB', 'Nersting J', 'Faber M', 'Schmiegelow K', 'Larsen HB']","['Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, The Juliane Marie Center, University Hospital (Rigshospitalet), Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Faculty of Health Science, Institute for Clinical Medicine, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Center for Inflammation and Metabolism/Center for Physical Activity (CIM/CFAS), University Hospital (Rigshospitalet), Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, The Juliane Marie Center, University Hospital (Rigshospitalet), Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, The Juliane Marie Center, University Hospital (Rigshospitalet), Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Sports Medicine, Norwegian School for Sports Sciences, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Sports Medicine, Norwegian School for Sports Sciences, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Biostatistics, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, The Juliane Marie Center, University Hospital (Rigshospitalet), Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, The Juliane Marie Center, University Hospital (Rigshospitalet), Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, The Juliane Marie Center, University Hospital (Rigshospitalet), Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Faculty of Health Science, Institute for Clinical Medicine, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, The Juliane Marie Center, University Hospital (Rigshospitalet), Copenhagen, Denmark.']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-8495-5274', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0829-4993', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7152-3106']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180509,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*rehabilitation', '*Physical Fitness', '*Physical Therapy Modalities']",['NOTNLM'],"['*childhood cancer', '*feasibility', '*physical function', '*rehabilitation']",2018/05/10 06:00,2019/05/11 06:00,['2018/05/10 06:00'],"['2017/10/06 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/21 00:00 [revised]', '2018/03/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/11 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.27100 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2018 Aug;65(8):e27100. doi: 10.1002/pbc.27100.

Nevertheless, the distinctive cytological characteristics of the blood cells are subjective and influenced by the reviewer's interpretation and, because of that, translating subjective morphological examination into objective parameters is a challenge. METHODS: The use of digital microscopy systems has been extended in the clinical laboratories. As automatic analyzers have some limitations for abnormal or neoplastic cell detection, it is interesting to identify quantitative features through digital image analysis for morphological characteristics of different cells. RESULT: Three main classes of features are used as follows: geometric, color, and texture. Geometric parameters (nucleus/cytoplasmic ratio, cellular area, nucleus perimeter, cytoplasmic profile, RBC proximity, and others) are familiar to pathologists, as they are related to the visual cell patterns. Different color spaces can be used to investigate the rich amount of information that color may offer to describe abnormal lymphoid or blast cells. Texture is related to spatial patterns of color or intensities, which can be visually detected and quantitatively represented using statistical tools. CONCLUSION: This study reviews current and new quantitative features, which can contribute to optimize morphology through blood cell digital image processing techniques.","['Merino, A', 'Puigvi, L', 'Boldu, L', 'Alferez, S', 'Rodellar, J']","['Merino A', 'Puigvi L', 'Boldu L', 'Alferez S', 'Rodellar J']","['Biomedical Diagnostic Centre, Hospital Clinic, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Mathematics, Barcelona Est Engineering School, Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Biomedical Diagnostic Centre, Hospital Clinic, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Mathematics, Barcelona Est Engineering School, Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Mathematics, Barcelona Est Engineering School, Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,,IM,"['Blood Cells/*pathology', 'Cell Shape', 'Color', 'Humans', '*Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Microscopy/trends']",['NOTNLM'],"['blood', 'leukemia', 'lymphoma', 'morphology']",2018/05/10 06:00,2018/10/03 06:00,['2018/05/10 06:00'],"['2018/01/05 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ijlh.12832 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2018 May;40 Suppl 1:54-61. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.12832.,['(c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Exposure to pesticides such as permethrin and malathion has been associated with hematological malignancies in epidemiological studies. However, biological evidence showing if these chemicals induce genetic aberrations involved in the etiology of leukemia and lymphoma is missing. In our previous work, we have shown that a single high exposure (200 mum, 24 hours) of permethrin and malathion induce damage in genes associated with hematological malignancies in peripheral blood mononuclear cells analyzed by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). In the present study, we assessed by FISH whether exposure to low concentrations (0.1 mum, 72 hours) of permethrin and malathion induce aberrations in KMT2A and IGH genes, which are involved in the etiology of leukemia and lymphoma. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were exposed to the chemicals, and damage in these genes was assessed on interphases and metaphases. We observed that both chemicals at low concentration induced structural aberrations in KMT2A and IGH genes. A higher level of damage was observed in KMT2A gene with malathion treatment and in IGH gene with permethrin exposure. We also observed numerical aberrations induced by these chemicals. The most frequent aberrations detected on interphase FISH were also observed on metaphases. Our results show that permethrin and malathion induce genetic damage in genes associated with hematological cancer, at concentrations biologically relevant. In addition, damage was observed on dividing cells, which suggests that these cells maintain their proliferation capacity in spite of the genetic damage they possess.","['Navarrete-Meneses, M P', 'Pedraza-Melendez, A I', 'Salas-Labadia, C', 'Moreno-Lorenzana, D', 'Perez-Vera, P']","['Navarrete-Meneses MP', 'Pedraza-Melendez AI', 'Salas-Labadia C', 'Moreno-Lorenzana D', 'Perez-Vera P']","['Laboratorio de Genetica y Cancer, Departamento de Genetica Humana, Instituto Nacional de Pediatria, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.', 'Posgrado en Ciencias Biologicas, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.', 'Laboratorio de Genetica y Cancer, Departamento de Genetica Humana, Instituto Nacional de Pediatria, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.', 'Laboratorio de Genetica y Cancer, Departamento de Genetica Humana, Instituto Nacional de Pediatria, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.', 'Catedra CONACYT-Instituto Nacional de Pediatria, Mexico.', 'Laboratorio de Genetica y Cancer, Departamento de Genetica Humana, Instituto Nacional de Pediatria, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-2686-4101', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3301-7357', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3029-4241', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5662-6991']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180509,England,J Appl Toxicol,Journal of applied toxicology : JAT,8109495,"['0 (Insecticides)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '509F88P9SZ (Permethrin)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'U5N7SU872W (Malathion)']",IM,"['Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/chemically induced/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', '*DNA Damage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Insecticides/*toxicity', 'Interphase', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*drug effects/enzymology/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*chemically induced/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Malathion/*toxicity', 'Male', 'Metaphase', 'Mitotic Index', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Permethrin/*toxicity', 'Risk Assessment']",['NOTNLM'],"['*IGH', '*KMT2A', '*MLL', '*insecticides', '*leukemia', '*lymphoma', '*malathion', '*permethrin']",2018/05/10 06:00,2019/10/28 06:00,['2018/05/10 06:00'],"['2018/02/01 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/22 00:00 [revised]', '2018/03/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/28 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jat.3638 [doi]'],ppublish,J Appl Toxicol. 2018 Sep;38(9):1262-1270. doi: 10.1002/jat.3638.

RESULTS: We detected significantly greater osteogenesis and chondrogenesis in CD200/MSCs than in mock-transfected MSCs. In addition, the immune regulatory function of MSCs in mixed lymphocyte reactions was enhanced by CD200 gene transfection. In CD200/MSCs, the secretion of inflammatory cytokines, i.e., IL-6 and IL-8, was reduced, and levels of the anti-inflammatory factors IL-10, FOXP3, and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 were elevated. Finally, CD200 transfection increased the stemness of MSCs, as evidenced by greater colony numbers in colony-forming unit fibroblast assays and analyses of NANOG and OCT-4 expression. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that CD200/MSCs have therapeutic applications, and further in-depth research should focus on the development of a clinically applicable cell-based therapeutic strategy.","['Kim, Hye Joung', 'Kim, Kyoung-Woon', 'Kwon, Yong-Rim', 'Kim, Bo-Mi', 'Kim, Yoo-Jin']","['Kim HJ', 'Kim KW', 'Kwon YR', 'Kim BM', 'Kim YJ']","['Laboratory of Hematological Disease and Transplant Immunology, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Hematology, Convergent Research Consortium for Immunologic Disease, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Hematology, Convergent Research Consortium for Immunologic Disease, Seoul, Korea.', 'Laboratory of Hematological Disease and Transplant Immunology, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Hematology, Convergent Research Consortium for Immunologic Disease, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Hematology, Convergent Research Consortium for Immunologic Disease, Seoul, Korea.', 'Laboratory of Hematological Disease and Transplant Immunology, Seoul, Korea. yoojink@catholic.ac.kr.', 'Department of Hematology, Convergent Research Consortium for Immunologic Disease, Seoul, Korea. yoojink@catholic.ac.kr.', ""Catholic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Center, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, 222 Banpo-Daero, Seocho-Gu, Seoul, 06591, Korea. yoojink@catholic.ac.kr."", 'Leukemia Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea. yoojink@catholic.ac.kr.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180509,Netherlands,Biotechnol Lett,Biotechnology letters,8008051,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', 'UQ4V77A8VA (antigens, CD200)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/*biosynthesis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*physiology', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chondrogenesis', '*Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/metabolism', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Osteogenesis']",['NOTNLM'],"['Adipogenesis', 'CD200', 'Chondrogenesis', 'Immune regulation', 'Mesenchymal stromal cells', 'Osteogenesis']",2018/05/10 06:00,2019/07/05 06:00,['2018/05/10 06:00'],"['2017/11/22 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/05 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10529-018-2561-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s10529-018-2561-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Biotechnol Lett. 2018 Oct;40(9-10):1425-1433. doi: 10.1007/s10529-018-2561-0.

Natural killer (NK) cells have been used to treat incurable cancers. Recent studies have investigated the effectiveness of NK-cell-derived exosomes (NK-Exo) for treating incurable cancers such as melanoma, leukemia, and neuroblastoma; however, NK-Exo have not been used to treat glioblastoma. In the present study, we investigated the antitumor effects of NK-Exo against aggressive glioblastoma both in vitro and in vivo and determined the tumor-targeting ability of NK-Exo by performing fluorescence imaging. Methods: U87/MG cells were transfected with the enhanced firefly luciferase (effluc) and thy1.1 genes; thy1.1-positive cells were selected using microbeads. U87/MG/F cells were assessed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), western blotting, and luciferase-activity assays. NK-Exo were isolated by ultracentrifugation, purified by density gradient centrifugation, and characterized by transmission electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering (DLS), nanoparticle-tracking analysis (NTA), and western blotting. Cytokine levels in NK-Exo were compared to those in NK cells and NK-cell medium by performing an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). NK-Exo-induced apoptosis of cancer cells was confirmed by flow cytometry and western blotting. In vivo therapeutic effects and specificity of NK-Exo against glioblastoma were assessed in a xenograft mouse model by fluorescence imaging. Xenograft mice were treated with NK-Exo, which was administered seven times through the tail vein. Tumor growth was monitored by bioluminescence imaging (BLI), and tumor volume was measured by ultrasound imaging. The mice were intraperitoneally injected with dextran sulfate 2 h before NK-Exo injection to decrease the liver uptake and increase the tumor specificity of NK-Exo. Results: RT-PCR and western blotting confirmed the gene and protein expression of effluc in U87/MG/F cells, with the bioluminescence activity of U87/MG/F cells increasing with an increase in cell number. NTA and DLS results indicated that the size of NK-Exo was ~100 nm, and the western blot results confirmed that NK-Exo expressed exosome markers CD63 and Alix. We confirmed the in vitro cytotoxic effects of NK-Exo on U87/MG/F cells by performing BLI, and the killing effect on U87/MG and U87MG/F cells was measured by CCK-8 and MTT assays (p < 0.001). ELISA results indicated that NK-Exo contained tumor necrosis factor-alpha and granzyme B. In vivo NK-Exo treatment inhibited tumor growth compared to in control mice (p < 0.001), and pretreatment of xenograft mice with dextran sulfate 2 h before NK-Exo treatment increased the antitumor effect of NK-Exo (p < 0.01) compared to in control and NK-Exo-alone-treated mice. Conclusion: NK-Exo targeted and exerted antitumor effects on glioblastoma cells both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting their utility in treating incurable glioblastoma.","['Zhu, Liya', 'Oh, Ji Min', 'Gangadaran, Prakash', 'Kalimuthu, Senthilkumar', 'Baek, Se Hwan', 'Jeong, Shin Young', 'Lee, Sang-Woo', 'Lee, Jaetae', 'Ahn, Byeong-Cheol']","['Zhu L', 'Oh JM', 'Gangadaran P', 'Kalimuthu S', 'Baek SH', 'Jeong SY', 'Lee SW', 'Lee J', 'Ahn BC']","['Department of Nuclear Medicine, School of Medicine, Kyungpook National University, Kyungpook National University Hospital, Daegu, South Korea.', 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, School of Medicine, Kyungpook National University, Kyungpook National University Hospital, Daegu, South Korea.', 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, School of Medicine, Kyungpook National University, Kyungpook National University Hospital, Daegu, South Korea.', 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, School of Medicine, Kyungpook National University, Kyungpook National University Hospital, Daegu, South Korea.', 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, School of Medicine, Kyungpook National University, Kyungpook National University Hospital, Daegu, South Korea.', 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, School of Medicine, Kyungpook National University, Kyungpook National University Hospital, Daegu, South Korea.', 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, School of Medicine, Kyungpook National University, Kyungpook National University Hospital, Daegu, South Korea.', 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, School of Medicine, Kyungpook National University, Kyungpook National University Hospital, Daegu, South Korea.', 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, School of Medicine, Kyungpook National University, Kyungpook National University Hospital, Daegu, South Korea.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Retracted Publication']",20180423,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,['0 (Cytokines)'],IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Brain Neoplasms/immunology/therapy', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytokines/immunology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Exosomes/*immunology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Glioblastoma/immunology/*therapy', 'Heterografts', 'Immunotherapy', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude']",['NOTNLM'],"['*exosomes', '*glioblastoma', '*immunotherapy', '*natural killer cells', '*tumor targeting']",2018/05/10 06:00,2018/05/10 06:01,['2018/05/10 06:00'],"['2017/08/14 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/10 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2018.00824 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2018 Apr 23;9:824. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2018.00824. eCollection 2018.,,,,PMC5924812,,['Front Immunol. 2019 Jul 16;10:1770.

The germinal center (GC) is involved in the generation of donor-specific antibody-producing plasma cells and memory B cells, which are often poorly controlled by current treatments. Myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1), an antiapoptotic member of the B-cell lymphoma-2 family, is essential for maintenance of the GC reaction and B-cell differentiation. During chronic AMR (cAMR), tertiary lymphoid structures resembling GCs appear in the rejected organ, suggesting local lymphoid neogenesis. We report the infiltration of the kidneys with B cells expressing Mcl-1 in patients with cAMR. We modulated GC viability by impairing B-cell receptor signaling, by spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) inhibition. SYK inhibition lowers viability and Mcl-1 protein levels in Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines. This downregulation of Mcl-1 is coordinated at the transcriptional level, possibly by signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), as shown by (1) the impaired translocation of STAT3 to the nucleus following SYK inhibition, and (2) the lower levels of Mcl-1 transcription upon STAT3 inhibition. Mcl-1 overproduction prevented cells from entering apoptosis following SYK inhibition. In vitro studies with primary tonsillar B cells confirmed that SYK inhibition impaired cell survival and decreased Mcl-1 protein levels. It also impaired B-cell activation and immunoglobulin G secretion by tonsillar B cells. These findings suggest that the SYK-Mcl-1 pathway could be targeted, to improve graft survival by manipulating the humoral immune response.","['Roders, Nathalie', 'Herr, Florence', 'Ambroise, Gorbatchev', 'Thaunat, Olivier', 'Portier, Alain', 'Vazquez, Aime', 'Durrbach, Antoine']","['Roders N', 'Herr F', 'Ambroise G', 'Thaunat O', 'Portier A', 'Vazquez A', 'Durrbach A']","['Institut Francilien de Recherche en Nephrologie et Transplantation (IFRNT), Service de Nephrologie, Hopital Bicetre, Le Kremlin Bicetre, France.', 'INSERM UMRS-MD 1197, Villejuif, France.', 'Universite Paris Sud, Orsay, France.', 'Institut Francilien de Recherche en Nephrologie et Transplantation (IFRNT), Service de Nephrologie, Hopital Bicetre, Le Kremlin Bicetre, France.', 'INSERM UMRS-MD 1197, Villejuif, France.', 'Universite Paris Sud, Orsay, France.', 'INSERM UMRS-MD 1197, Villejuif, France.', 'Universite Paris Sud, Orsay, France.', 'French National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) Unit 1111, Lyon, France.', 'Department of Transplantation, Nephrology and Clinical Immunology, Edouard Herriot University Hospital, Lyon, France.', 'Claude Bernard University Lyon 1, Lyon, France.', 'INSERM UMRS-MD 1197, Villejuif, France.', 'Universite Paris Sud, Orsay, France.', 'INSERM UMRS-MD 1197, Villejuif, France.', 'Universite Paris Sud, Orsay, France.', 'Institut Francilien de Recherche en Nephrologie et Transplantation (IFRNT), Service de Nephrologie, Hopital Bicetre, Le Kremlin Bicetre, France.', 'INSERM UMRS-MD 1197, Villejuif, France.', 'Universite Paris Sud, Orsay, France.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180424,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,"['0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (SYK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)']",IM,"['Antibody Formation/immunology', 'Apoptosis/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Germinal Center/immunology', 'Graft Rejection/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Humoral/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*immunology', 'Syk Kinase/antagonists & inhibitors/*immunology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*antibody-mediated rejection', '*apoptosis', '*germinal center B-cells', '*myeloid cell leukemia-1', '*spleen tyrosine kinase inhibition']",2018/05/10 06:00,2018/05/10 06:01,['2018/05/10 06:00'],"['2017/11/06 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/10 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2018.00787 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2018 Apr 24;9:787. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2018.00787. eCollection 2018.,,,,PMC5928208,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: We used literature searches to identify previously reported cases of primary dural MZL. We also reviewed clinical, pathologic, and radiographic data of an adult patient with concurrent dural MZL and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). Results: We identified 104 cases of dural MZL in the literature. None of them presented concurrently with another type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This is the first report of composite lymphoma consisting of dural MZL and CLL/SLL in the bone marrow and lymph nodes. Conclusion: Primary dural MZL is a rare, indolent low-grade CNS lymphoma, with a relatively good prognosis. Its treatment is multidisciplinary and often requires surgical intervention due to brain compression, along with low to moderate doses of radiotherapy and/or systemic chemotherapy.","['Bustoros, Mark', 'Liechty, Benjamin', 'Zagzag, David', 'Liu, Cynthia', 'Shepherd, Timothy', 'Gruber, Deborah', 'Raphael, Bruce', 'Placantonakis, Dimitris G']","['Bustoros M', 'Liechty B', 'Zagzag D', 'Liu C', 'Shepherd T', 'Gruber D', 'Raphael B', 'Placantonakis DG']","['Department of Neurosurgery, NYU School of Medicine, New York, NY, United States.', 'Department of Pathology, NYU School of Medicine, New York, NY, United States.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, NYU School of Medicine, New York, NY, United States.', 'Department of Pathology, NYU School of Medicine, New York, NY, United States.', 'Perlmutter Cancer Center, NYU Langone Medical Center, New York, NY, United States.', 'Brain Tumor Center, NYU Langone Medical Center, New York, NY, United States.', 'Department of Pathology, NYU School of Medicine, New York, NY, United States.', 'Department of Radiology, NYU School of Medicine, New York, NY, United States.', 'Perlmutter Cancer Center, NYU Langone Medical Center, New York, NY, United States.', 'Brain Tumor Center, NYU Langone Medical Center, New York, NY, United States.', 'Department of Neurology, NYU School of Medicine, New York, NY, United States.', 'Perlmutter Cancer Center, NYU Langone Medical Center, New York, NY, United States.', 'Department of Medicine, NYU School of Medicine, New York, NY, United States.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, NYU School of Medicine, New York, NY, United States.', 'Perlmutter Cancer Center, NYU Langone Medical Center, New York, NY, United States.', 'Brain Tumor Center, NYU Langone Medical Center, New York, NY, United States.', 'Kimmel Center for Stem Cell Biology, NYU School of Medicine, New York, NY, United States.', 'Neuroscience Institute, NYU School of Medicine, New York, NY, United States.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180424,Switzerland,Front Neurol,Frontiers in neurology,101546899,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['central nervous system lymphoma', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma', 'composite lymphoma', 'dura', 'extranodal marginal zone lymphoma']",2018/05/10 06:00,2018/05/10 06:01,['2018/05/10 06:00'],"['2017/09/09 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/10 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fneur.2018.00267 [doi]'],epublish,Front Neurol. 2018 Apr 24;9:267. doi: 10.3389/fneur.2018.00267. eCollection 2018.,,,,PMC5928293,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Determination of phenolic acid contents were conducted by an optimized LC-ESI-MS/MS method. The results show that Kalanchoe daigremontiana Raym.-Hamet & H. Perrier (using ASE extraction) and Kalanchoe pinnata (Lam.) Pers. contain the highest amounts of phenolic acids, while Kalanchoe nyikae Engl. the lowest ones. Among phenolic acids ferulic, caffeic and protocatechuic acids were occurring in the highest quantities in the analysed species. The greatest amounts of ferulic and protocatechuic acids were found in K. daigremontiana and K. pinnata. Moreover, the antiradical and cytotoxic activities of Kalanchoe extracts were investigated. All tested extracts possessed antioxidant activity. The obtained IC50 values (mug/mL) ranged from 49.9 mug/mL to 1410 mug/mL, indicating a large variation of the activity of the analysed extracts. Cytotoxicity assays revealed dose-dependent effects in the cells lines tested. Only K. pinnata extract showed a high cytotoxicity against the H-9 human T cell line. Other extracts (K. daigremontiana, Kalanchoe milloti, K. nyikae) showed more pronounced cytotoxicity towards J45.01 cells (human acute lymphoblastic leukaemia T cells). The present study demonstrated that Kalanchoe extracts have significant antioxidant and cytotoxic effects. This suggests that these species can be used as new sources of natural antioxidants and potential anticancer compounds.","['Bogucka-Kocka, Anna', 'Zidorn, Christian', 'Kasprzycka, Malgorzata', 'Szymczak, Grazyna', 'Szewczyk, Katarzyna']","['Bogucka-Kocka A', 'Zidorn C', 'Kasprzycka M', 'Szymczak G', 'Szewczyk K']","['Chair and Department of Pharmaceutical Botany, Medical University of Lublin, 1 Chodzki Street, 20-093 Lublin, Poland.', 'Institut fur Pharmazie der Universitat Innsbruck, Abteilung Pharmakognosie, Innrain 80/82, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Chair and Department of Pharmaceutical Botany, Medical University of Lublin, 1 Chodzki Street, 20-093 Lublin, Poland.', 'Botanical Garden, University of Maria Sklodowska-Curie, 3 Slawinkowska Street, 20-810 Lublin, Poland.', 'Chair and Department of Pharmaceutical Botany, Medical University of Lublin, 1 Chodzki Street, 20-093 Lublin, Poland.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160201,Saudi Arabia,Saudi J Biol Sci,Saudi journal of biological sciences,101543796,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Antioxidant activity', 'Cytotoxicity', 'Kalanchoe', 'LC-MS', 'Phenolic acids']",2018/05/10 06:00,2018/05/10 06:01,['2018/05/10 06:00'],"['2015/08/08 00:00 [received]', '2015/12/06 00:00 [revised]', '2016/01/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/10 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.sjbs.2016.01.037 [doi]', 'S1319-562X(16)00039-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Saudi J Biol Sci. 2018 May;25(4):622-630. doi: 10.1016/j.sjbs.2016.01.037.

While skeletal abnormalities are commonly seen in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) prior to initiating osteotoxic therapy, little is known about the alterations to the bone marrow microenvironment during leukemogenesis. Therefore, in this study, we focused on the development of precursor-B cell ALL (pre-B ALL) in an immunocompetent BCR-ABL1(+) model. Here we show that hematopoiesis was perturbed, B lymphopoiesis was impaired, collagen production was reduced, and the number of osteoblastic cells was decreased in the bone marrow microenvironment. As previously found in children with ALL, the leukemia-bearing mice exhibited severe bone loss during leukemogenesis. Leukemia cells produced high levels of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB ligand (RANKL), sufficient to cause osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. In vivo administration of zoledronic acid rescued leukemia-induced bone loss, reduced disease burden and prolonged survival in leukemia-bearing mice. Taken together, we provide evidence that targeting leukemia-induced bone loss is a therapeutic strategy for pre-B ALL.","['Cheung, Laurence C', 'Tickner, Jennifer', 'Hughes, Anastasia M', 'Skut, Patrycja', 'Howlett, Meegan', 'Foley, Bree', 'Oommen, Joyce', 'Wells, Julia E', 'He, Bo', 'Singh, Sajla', 'Chua, Grace-Alyssa', 'Ford, Jette', 'Mullighan, Charles G', 'Kotecha, Rishi S', 'Kees, Ursula R']","['Cheung LC', 'Tickner J', 'Hughes AM', 'Skut P', 'Howlett M', 'Foley B', 'Oommen J', 'Wells JE', 'He B', 'Singh S', 'Chua GA', 'Ford J', 'Mullighan CG', 'Kotecha RS', 'Kees UR']","['Telethon Kids Cancer Centre, Telethon Kids Institute, University of Western Australia, Perth, WA, Australia.

To address these questions, we used targeted single-cell sequencing of total bone marrow cells and CD34(+)CD38(-) multipotent progenitor cells for four T-ALL cases. Hierarchical clustering detected a dominant leukemia cluster at diagnosis, accompanied by a few smaller clusters harboring only a fraction of the mutations. We developed a graph-based algorithm to determine the order of mutation acquisition. Two of the four patients had an early event in a known oncogene (MED12, STAT5B) among various pre-leukemic events. Intermediate events included loss of 9p21 (CDKN2A/B) and acquisition of fusion genes, while NOTCH1 mutations were typically late events. Analysis of CD34(+)CD38(-) cells and myeloid progenitors revealed that in half of the cases somatic mutations were detectable in multipotent progenitor cells. We demonstrate that targeted single-cell sequencing can elucidate the order of mutation acquisition in T-ALL and that T-ALL development can start in a multipotent progenitor cell.","['De Bie, Jolien', 'Demeyer, Sofie', 'Alberti-Servera, Llucia', 'Geerdens, Ellen', 'Segers, Heidi', 'Broux, Michael', 'De Keersmaecker, Kim', 'Michaux, Lucienne', 'Vandenberghe, Peter', 'Voet, Thierry', 'Boeckx, Nancy', 'Uyttebroeck, Anne', 'Cools, Jan']","['De Bie J', 'Demeyer S', 'Alberti-Servera L', 'Geerdens E', 'Segers H', 'Broux M', 'De Keersmaecker K', 'Michaux L', 'Vandenberghe P', 'Voet T', 'Boeckx N', 'Uyttebroeck A', 'Cools J']","['Center for Human Genetics, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Center for Cancer Biology, VIB, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Leuvens Kanker Instituut (LKI), KU Leuven - UZ Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Center for Human Genetics, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Center for Cancer Biology, VIB, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Leuvens Kanker Instituut (LKI), KU Leuven - UZ Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Center for Human Genetics, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Center for Cancer Biology, VIB, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Leuvens Kanker Instituut (LKI), KU Leuven - UZ Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Center for Human Genetics, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Center for Cancer Biology, VIB, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Leuvens Kanker Instituut (LKI), KU Leuven - UZ Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Leuvens Kanker Instituut (LKI), KU Leuven - UZ Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Pediatric Hemato-Oncology, UZ Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Center for Human Genetics, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Center for Cancer Biology, VIB, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Leuvens Kanker Instituut (LKI), KU Leuven - UZ Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Leuvens Kanker Instituut (LKI), KU Leuven - UZ Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Hematology, UZ Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Center for Human Genetics, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Leuvens Kanker Instituut (LKI), KU Leuven - UZ Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Center for Human Genetics, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Leuvens Kanker Instituut (LKI), KU Leuven - UZ Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Hematology, UZ Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Center for Human Genetics, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Hinxton, Cambridge, UK.', 'Department of Oncology, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, UZ Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Leuvens Kanker Instituut (LKI), KU Leuven - UZ Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Pediatric Hemato-Oncology, UZ Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Center for Human Genetics, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium. jan.cools@kuleuven.vib.be.', 'Center for Cancer Biology, VIB, Leuven, Belgium. jan.cools@kuleuven.vib.be.', 'Leuvens Kanker Instituut (LKI), KU Leuven - UZ Leuven, Leuven, Belgium. jan.cools@kuleuven.vib.be.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4168-060X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4719-1935', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6626-5843']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180418,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/analysis', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Multipotent Stem Cells/metabolism', '*Mutation', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics', 'Whole Genome Sequencing']",,,2018/05/10 06:00,2019/04/02 06:00,['2018/05/10 06:00'],"['2017/11/09 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/02/28 00:00 [revised]', '2018/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/02 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-018-0127-8 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-018-0127-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2018 Jun;32(6):1358-1369. doi: 10.1038/s41375-018-0127-8.

This complex process is regulated by various extracellular and intracellular signals including microRNAs (miRNAs). We characterised the miRNA profile of human CD34(+)CD38(+) myeloid progenitor cells, and mature monocytes and granulocytes isolated from cord blood using TaqMan Low Density Arrays. We identified 19 miRNAs that increased in both cell types relative to the CMP and 27 that decreased. miR-125b and miR-10a were decreased by 10-fold and 100-fold respectively in the mature cells. Using in vitro granulopoietic differentiation of human CD34(+) cells we show that decreases in both miR-125b and miR-10a correlate with a loss of CD34 expression and gain of CD11b and CD15 expression. Candidate target mRNAs were identified by co-incident predictions between the miRanda algorithm and genes with increased expression during differentiation. Using luciferase assays we confirmed MCL1 and FUT4 as targets of miR-125b and the transcription factor KLF4 as a target of miR-10a. Together, our data identify miRNAs with differential expression during myeloid development and reveal some relevant miRNA-target pairs that may contribute to physiological differentiation.","['Rajasekhar, Megha', 'Schmitz, Ulf', 'Flamant, Stephane', 'Wong, Justin J-L', 'Bailey, Charles G', 'Ritchie, William', 'Holst, Jeff', 'Rasko, John E J']","['Rajasekhar M', 'Schmitz U', 'Flamant S', 'Wong JJ', 'Bailey CG', 'Ritchie W', 'Holst J', 'Rasko JEJ']","['Gene & Stem Cell Therapy Program, Centenary Institute, University of Sydney, Camperdown, 2050, Australia.', 'Sydney Medical School, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.', 'Gene & Stem Cell Therapy Program, Centenary Institute, University of Sydney, Camperdown, 2050, Australia.', 'Sydney Medical School, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.', 'Gene & Stem Cell Therapy Program, Centenary Institute, University of Sydney, Camperdown, 2050, Australia.', 'Sydney Medical School, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.', 'Gene & Stem Cell Therapy Program, Centenary Institute, University of Sydney, Camperdown, 2050, Australia.', 'Sydney Medical School, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.', 'Gene Regulation in Cancer Laboratory, Centenary Institute, University of Sydney, Camperdown, 2050, Australia.', 'Gene & Stem Cell Therapy Program, Centenary Institute, University of Sydney, Camperdown, 2050, Australia.', 'Sydney Medical School, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.', 'Gene & Stem Cell Therapy Program, Centenary Institute, University of Sydney, Camperdown, 2050, Australia.', 'Sydney Medical School, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.', 'Sydney Medical School, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.', 'Origins of Cancer Program, Centenary Institute, University of Sydney, Camperdown, 2050, Australia.', 'Gene & Stem Cell Therapy Program, Centenary Institute, University of Sydney, Camperdown, 2050, Australia. j.rasko@centenary.org.au.', 'Sydney Medical School, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia. j.rasko@centenary.org.au.', 'Cell and Molecular Therapies, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Camperdown, 2050, Australia. j.rasko@centenary.org.au.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-0377-9318'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180508,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (KLF4 protein, human)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Factor 4)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN10 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN125 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (FUT4 protein, human)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (Fucosyltransferases)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/genetics', 'Antigens, CD34/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Fetal Blood/cytology/metabolism', 'Fucosyltransferases/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/genetics', 'Granulocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Monocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics', 'Myelopoiesis/*genetics']",,,2018/05/10 06:00,2019/10/15 06:00,['2018/05/10 06:00'],"['2017/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-018-24203-7 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-018-24203-7 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2018 May 8;8(1):7264. doi: 10.1038/s41598-018-24203-7.,,,,PMC5940821,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These molecular studies have allowed us to learn about potential targeted therapies for patients with advanced cancers. Perhaps the best-known example of success in precision medicine is chronic myeloid leukemia and its response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting the BCR-ABL kinase. Since that original discovery, the role of molecular therapeutics has expanded, and it now presents us with treatment options for common malignancies and rare atypical tumors. In this article, we present a case of a 61-year-old female with a recurrent pulmonary inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor. Subsequent molecular studies revealed an ALK rearrangement. The significance of this alteration in this tumor type and its therapeutic implications are discussed herein. KEY POINTS: This case exemplifies the heterogeneous behavior of inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors (IMTs) and the current role of targeted therapy in the therapeutic armamentarium of neoplastic processes.As evidenced by the different mutations found in IMTs, it is of great importance to perform next-generation sequencing in uncommon neoplasms.These studies can find different potential targets and therapeutic options for patients devoid of standard effective therapies.","['Vargas-Madueno, Fernando', 'Gould, Edwin', 'Valor, Raul', 'Ngo, Nhu', 'Zhang, Linsheng', 'Villalona-Calero, Miguel A']","['Vargas-Madueno F', 'Gould E', 'Valor R', 'Ngo N', 'Zhang L', 'Villalona-Calero MA']","['Miami Cancer Institute at Baptist Health South Florida, Miami, Florida, USA fernandovarg@baptisthealth.net.', 'Department of Humanities, Health & Society, Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine at the Florida International University, Miami, Florida, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Baptist Health South Florida, Miami, Florida, USA.', 'Department of Interventional Pulmonology, Subsection Chief, Pulmonary, Interventional Pulmonology Baptist Hospital of Miami, Miami, Florida, USA.', 'Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.', 'Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.', 'Miami Cancer Institute at Baptist Health South Florida, Miami, Florida, USA.', 'Department of Humanities, Health & Society, Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine at the Florida International University, Miami, Florida, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20180508,United States,Oncologist,The oncologist,9607837,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (EML4-ALK fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Muscle Tissue/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics']",,,2018/05/10 06:00,2019/10/28 06:00,['2018/05/10 06:00'],"['2018/01/09 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/28 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['theoncologist.2018-0014 [pii]', '10.1634/theoncologist.2018-0014 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncologist. 2018 Oct;23(10):1127-1132. doi: 10.1634/theoncologist.2018-0014.

Clinical results indicated that increases in bosutinib oral exposures were supraproportional at the lower doses (50-200 mg) and approximately dose-proportional at the higher doses (200-600 mg). Bosutinib is a substrate of CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein and exhibits pH-dependent solubility with moderate intestinal permeability. These findings led us to investigate the factors influencing the underlying pharmacokinetic mechanisms of bosutinib with physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models. Our primary objectives were to: 1) refine the previously developed bosutinib PBPK model on the basis of the latest oral bioavailability data and 2) verify the refined PBPK model with P-glycoprotein kinetics on the basis of the bosutinib drug-drug interaction (DDI) results with ketoconazole and rifampin. Additionally, the verified PBPK model was applied to predict bosutinib DDIs with dual CYP3A/P-glycoprotein inhibitors. The results indicated that 1) the refined PBPK model adequately described the observed plasma concentration-time profiles of bosutinib and 2) the verified PBPK model reasonably predicted the effects of ketoconazole and rifampin on bosutinib exposures by accounting for intestinal P-glycoprotein inhibition/induction. These results suggested that bosutinib DDI mechanism could involve not only CYP3A4-mediated metabolism but also P-glycoprotein-mediated efflux on absorption. In summary, P-glycoprotein kinetics could constitute an element in the PBPK models critical to understanding the pharmacokinetic mechanism of dual CYP3A/P-glycoprotein substrates, such as bosutinib, that exhibit nonlinear pharmacokinetics owing largely to a saturation of intestinal P-glycoprotein-mediated efflux.","['Yamazaki, Shinji', 'Loi, Cho-Ming', 'Kimoto, Emi', 'Costales, Chester', 'Varma, Manthena V']","['Yamazaki S', 'Loi CM', 'Kimoto E', 'Costales C', 'Varma MV']","['Pharmacokinetics, Dynamics and Metabolism, Pfizer Worldwide Research & Development, San Diego, California (S.Y., C.-M.L.) and Groton, Connecticut (E.K., C.C., M.V.V.) shinji.yamazaki@pfizer.com.', 'Pharmacokinetics, Dynamics and Metabolism, Pfizer Worldwide Research & Development, San Diego, California (S.Y., C.-M.L.) and Groton, Connecticut (E.K., C.C., M.V.V.).', 'Pharmacokinetics, Dynamics and Metabolism, Pfizer Worldwide Research & Development, San Diego, California (S.Y., C.-M.L.) and Groton, Connecticut (E.K., C.C., M.V.V.).', 'Pharmacokinetics, Dynamics and Metabolism, Pfizer Worldwide Research & Development, San Diego, California (S.Y., C.-M.L.) and Groton, Connecticut (E.K., C.C., M.V.V.).', 'Pharmacokinetics, Dynamics and Metabolism, Pfizer Worldwide Research & Development, San Diego, California (S.Y., C.-M.L.) and Groton, Connecticut (E.K., C.C., M.V.V.).']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180508,United States,Drug Metab Dispos,Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals,9421550,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inhibitors)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Quinolines)', '5018V4AEZ0 (bosutinib)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A)', 'R9400W927I (Ketoconazole)', 'VJT6J7R4TR (Rifampin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'Administration, Oral', 'Aniline Compounds/*pharmacokinetics', 'Biological Availability', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A/metabolism', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inhibitors/pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Interactions/*physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intestinal Mucosa/*metabolism', 'Ketoconazole/pharmacokinetics', 'Male', 'Nitriles/*pharmacokinetics', 'Quinolines/*pharmacokinetics', 'Rifampin/pharmacokinetics']",,,2018/05/10 06:00,2018/11/14 06:00,['2018/05/10 06:00'],"['2018/01/08 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/14 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['dmd.118.080424 [pii]', '10.1124/dmd.118.080424 [doi]']",ppublish,Drug Metab Dispos. 2018 Aug;46(8):1200-1211. doi: 10.1124/dmd.118.080424.

Donor sex and parity are well-established risk factors for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), with male donors typically associated with lower rates of GVHD. Well-matched unrelated donors (URDs) have also been associated with increased risks of GVHD as compared with matched sibling donors. These observations raise the question of whether male URDs would lead to more (or less) favorable transplant outcomes as compared with parous female sibling donors. We used the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research registry to complete a retrospective cohort study in adults with acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or myelodysplastic syndrome, who underwent T-cell replete HCT from these 2 donor types (parous female sibling or male URD) between 2000 and 2012. Primary outcomes included grade 2 to 4 acute GVHD (aGVHD), chronic GVHD (cGVHD), and overall survival. Secondary outcomes included disease-free survival, transplant-related mortality, and relapse. In 2813 recipients, patients receiving male URD transplants (n = 1921) had 1.6 times higher risk of grade 2 to 4 aGVHD (P < .0001). For cGVHD, recipient sex was a significant factor, so donor/recipient pairs were evaluated. Female recipients of male URD grafts had a higher risk of cGVHD than those receiving parous female sibling grafts (relative risk [RR] = 1.43, P < .0001), whereas male recipients had similar rates of cGVHD regardless of donor type (RR = 1.09, P = .23). Donor type did not significantly affect any other end point. We conclude that when available, parous female siblings are preferred over male URDs.","['Kumar, Anita J', 'Kim, Soyoung', 'Hemmer, Michael T', 'Arora, Mukta', 'Spellman, Stephen R', 'Pidala, Joseph A', 'Couriel, Daniel R', 'Alousi, Amin M', 'Aljurf, Mahmoud D', 'Cahn, Jean-Yves', 'Cairo, Mitchell S', 'Cutler, Corey S', 'Farhan, Shatha', 'Gergis, Usama', 'Hale, Gregory A', 'Hashmi, Shahrukh K', 'Inamoto, Yoshihiro', 'Kamble, Rammurti T', 'Kharfan-Dabaja, Mohamed A', 'MacMillan, Margaret L', 'Marks, David I', 'Nakasone, Hideki', 'Norkin, Maxim', 'Qayed, Muna', 'Ringden, Olle', 'Schouten, Harry C', 'Schultz, Kirk R', 'Solh, Melhem M', 'Teshima, Takanori', 'Urbano-Ispizua, Alvaro', 'Verdonck, Leo F', 'Gale, Robert Peter', 'Hamilton, Betty K', 'Majhail, Navneet S', 'Loren, Alison W']","['Kumar AJ', 'Kim S', 'Hemmer MT', 'Arora M', 'Spellman SR', 'Pidala JA', 'Couriel DR', 'Alousi AM', 'Aljurf MD', 'Cahn JY', 'Cairo MS', 'Cutler CS', 'Farhan S', 'Gergis U', 'Hale GA', 'Hashmi SK', 'Inamoto Y', 'Kamble RT', 'Kharfan-Dabaja MA', 'MacMillan ML', 'Marks DI', 'Nakasone H', 'Norkin M', 'Qayed M', 'Ringden O', 'Schouten HC', 'Schultz KR', 'Solh MM', 'Teshima T', 'Urbano-Ispizua A', 'Verdonck LF', 'Gale RP', 'Hamilton BK', 'Majhail NS', 'Loren AW']","['Tufts Medical Center, Boston, MA.', 'Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, Department of Medicine, and.', 'Institute for Health and Society, Department of Biostatistics, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI.', 'Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, Department of Medicine, and.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology and Transplantation, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota Medical Center, Minneapolis, MN.', 'Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, National Marrow Donor Program/Be The Match, Minneapolis, MN.', 'Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, H.

A secondary objective of this study was to assess the impact of blinatumomab on health-related quality of life (HRQL) as measured by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30). This analysis included the 342 of 405 randomized patients for whom baseline and >/=1 postbaseline result were available in any EORTC multi-item scale or single-item measure. In general, patients receiving blinatumomab (n = 247) reported better posttreatment HRQL across all QLQ-C30 subscales, based on descriptive mean change from baseline, than did those receiving chemotherapy (n = 95). The hazard ratios for time to deterioration (TTD) of >/=10 points from baseline in HRQL or death ranged from 0.42 to 0.81 in favor of blinatumomab, with the upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval <1.0 across all measures, except insomnia, social functioning, and financial difficulties; sensitivity analysis of TTD in HRQL without the event of death were consistent with these findings. When treatment effect over time was tested using a restricted maximum likelihood-based mixed model for repeated measures analysis, P < .05 was reached for blinatumomab vs chemotherapy for all subscale measures except financial difficulties. The clinically meaningful benefits in overall survival and HRQL support the clinical value of blinatumomab in patients with R/R Ph(-) BCP-ALL when compared with chemotherapy.

We wondered whether miR-363 was detectable in plasma, which is an essential precondition for further studies to assess its usefulness as a biomarker. Using samples from two clinical trials: one enrolling patients with advanced disease and the other asymptomatic patients with early stage disease, we determined plasma miR-363 levels and secondly investigated the distribution of this miRNA between plasma and particle bound fractions in patients and normal subjects. RESULTS: Advanced disease (n = 95) was associated with higher levels of miR-363 than early stage disease (n = 45) or normal subjects (n = 11) but there was no association with markers of prognosis. The distribution of specific miRNA between particle bound and plasma protein fractions was investigated using size exclusion chromatography on plasma from patients (n = 4) and normal subjects (n = 3). ~ 20% of total miR-16 and miR-363 is particle bound in patients while there was no detectable particle bound material in normal subjects. Our work demonstrates that miR-363 levels are raised in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia patients and raises the possibility that distribution of circulating miRNA between plasma fractions differs in health and disease.","['Alharthi, Afaf', 'Beck, Daniel', 'Howard, Dena R', 'Hillmen, Peter', 'Oates, Melanie', 'Pettitt, Andrew', 'Wagner, Simon D']","['Alharthi A', 'Beck D', 'Howard DR', 'Hillmen P', 'Oates M', 'Pettitt A', 'Wagner SD']","['Leicester Cancer Research Centre and Ernest and Helen Scott Haematological Research Unit, University of Leicester, Room 104, Hodgkin Building, Lancaster Road, Leicester, LE1 7HB, UK.', 'Leicester Cancer Research Centre and Ernest and Helen Scott Haematological Research Unit, University of Leicester, Room 104, Hodgkin Building, Lancaster Road, Leicester, LE1 7HB, UK.', 'St James Institute of Oncology, Leeds, UK.', 'St James Institute of Oncology, Leeds, UK.', 'University of Liverpool, Level 6, Duncan Building, Daulby Street, Liverpool, L69 3GA, UK.', 'University of Liverpool, Level 6, Duncan Building, Daulby Street, Liverpool, L69 3GA, UK.', 'Leicester Cancer Research Centre and Ernest and Helen Scott Haematological Research Unit, University of Leicester, Room 104, Hodgkin Building, Lancaster Road, Leicester, LE1 7HB, UK. sw227@le.ac.uk.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8914-0370'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180508,England,BMC Res Notes,BMC research notes,101462768,"['0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (MIRN16 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN363 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Blood Proteins/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/*genetics', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*blood/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Reference Standards', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia', 'Extracellular vesicle', 'miRNA']",2018/05/10 06:00,2018/09/25 06:00,['2018/05/10 06:00'],"['2018/04/02 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13104-018-3391-9 [doi]', '10.1186/s13104-018-3391-9 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Res Notes. 2018 May 8;11(1):280. doi: 10.1186/s13104-018-3391-9.,,,"['07/01/38/DH_/Department of Health/United Kingdom', '07/01/38/Health Technology Assessment Programme']",PMC5941460,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such comprehensive, valid and detailed information on cancer trend is badly needed for planning a cancer control program in the country. METHODS: All cancer cases were abstracted from patients' medical records - based on clinical, histopathology, and radiological diagnosis. Data were coded using the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O) and the International Classification of Childhood Cancer (ICCC-3) to code childhood tumors. The CanReg4 program was used to analyze the data for 15 years study period. RESULTS: A total of 6974 cases were included in this study, 47% were males and 53% females. The overall annual incidence rate was 21.6/100,000 populations; however, the incidence in males was little lower than in females (20.0 and 22.9 per 100,000 populations, respectively). The top five cancers among males were leukaemia (10.5%), nonhodgkin lymphoma [(NHL), 10.1%], colon (7.5%), Hodgkin diseases [(HD), 6.1%] and stomach cancer (5.1%). For females, breast cancer was the top (30.0%), followed by leukaemia (7.6%), NHL (6.6%), colonic (4.9%) and ovarian cancer (4.5%). CONCLUSION: Our findings reveal that, there is urgent need to commence the early screening of breast cancer due to its high frequency among Yemeni women. The government should give more support for cancer registries in the country to sustain its vital contribution to cancer care.","['Bawazir, Amen Ahmed']",['Bawazir AA'],"['College of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Aden, Khormaksar, Aden, Yemen. bawazir56@hotmail.com.', 'Community and Environmental Health Department, College of Public Health and Health Informatics.

But at the turn of the 21st century, some expression irregularities were observed, raising doubts about how closely the cell line paralleled normal human T cells. While numerous expression deficiencies have been described in Jurkat, genetic explanations have only been provided for a handful of defects. RESULTS: Here, we report a comprehensive catolog of genomic variation in the Jurkat cell line based on whole-genome sequencing. With this list of all detectable, non-reference sequences, we prioritize potentially damaging mutations by mining public databases for functional effects. We confirm documented mutations in Jurkat and propose links from detrimental gene variants to observed expression abnormalities in the cell line. CONCLUSIONS: The Jurkat cell line harbors many mutations that are associated with cancer and contribute to Jurkat's unique characteristics. Genes with damaging mutations in the Jurkat cell line are involved in T-cell receptor signaling (PTEN, INPP5D, CTLA4, and SYK), maintenance of genome stability (TP53, BAX, and MSH2), and O-linked glycosylation (C1GALT1C1). This work ties together decades of molecular experiments and serves as a resource that will streamline both the interpretation of past research and the design of future Jurkat studies.","['Gioia, Louis', 'Siddique, Azeem', 'Head, Steven R', 'Salomon, Daniel R', 'Su, Andrew I']","['Gioia L', 'Siddique A', 'Head SR', 'Salomon DR', 'Su AI']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California, 92037, USA. lhgioia@scripps.edu.', 'Next Generation Sequencing Core, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California, 92037, USA.', 'Next Generation Sequencing Core, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California, 92037, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California, 92037, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California, 92037, USA.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1302-2340'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180508,England,BMC Genomics,BMC genomics,100965258,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Databases, Genetic', 'Genomic Instability/genetics', '*Genomics', 'Glycosylation', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', '*Mutation', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', '*Whole Genome Sequencing']",['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer', 'Genome stability', 'Jurkat', 'T-cell', 'T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'T-cell receptor', 'Whole-genome sequencing']",2018/05/10 06:00,2018/12/18 06:00,['2018/05/10 06:00'],"['2017/05/30 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12864-018-4718-6 [doi]', '10.1186/s12864-018-4718-6 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Genomics. 2018 May 8;19(1):334. doi: 10.1186/s12864-018-4718-6.,,,"['U19 AI063603/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR001114/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'U19 AI063603/National Institutes of Health', 'UL1 TR001114/National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences']",PMC5941560,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a result of their interaction and diverse context-specific functions, this study aimed to emphasize the diagnostic and prognostic impacts of WT1 and p53 expression in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). METHODS: Twelve bone marrow (BM) biopsies were obtained from AML patients who were diagnosed in accordance with the French-American-British diagnostic criteria. For comparative purposes, nine normal BM biopsies were included. The expression rate of WT1 and p53 were determined by an immunohistochemistry assay. RESULTS: A significantly higher (p < 0.005) and strongly correlated ( = 0.855, p = 0.001) expression rates of WT1 and p53 were observed in the BM of AML patients in comparison to control BM. Furthermore, relapsed AML patients had significantly higher expression of WT1, but not p53, when compared to newly diagnosed patients. In regard of patient's responsiveness to chemotherapy, no significant difference was reported between good and poor responders. However, the relative ratio of p53 to WT1 expression was evidently correlated to the responsiveness groups (p < 0.05), where the ratio was observed to be significantly higher among poor responders. Poor responders were characterized by a statistically significant and dominant p53 expression (p53/WT1 > 1.0) while both good responding patients and control subjects had a dominant WT1 expression (p53/WT1 < 1.0). CONCLUSIONS: The enhanced expression levels of WT1 and p53 proteins in the BM of AML patients is supportive of their intermediate role in the pathogenesis of the disease. WT1 expression rate may encompass a negative prognostic value of the disease. Furthermore, the ratio of p53/WT expression may serve as a hallmark of the patient's responsiveness to chemotherapy, where a dominant WT1 expression may reveal good responsiveness to chemotherapy. Herein, we are proposing a kinetic model where the p53/WT1 ratio might be useful as a laboratory approach to evaluate the prognostic value of AML including the patient's responsiveness to chemotherapeutic regimen.","['Bani-Ahmad, Mohammad A', 'Al-Sweedan, Suleimman A', 'Al-Asseiri, Mohammad A', 'Alkhatib, Ahed J']","['Bani-Ahmad MA', 'Al-Sweedan SA', 'Al-Asseiri MA', 'Alkhatib AJ']",,,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Germany,Clin Lab,Clinical laboratory,9705611,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '0 (WT1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*biosynthesis', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*biosynthesis', 'WT1 Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Young Adult']",,,2018/05/09 06:00,2019/09/10 06:00,['2018/05/09 06:00'],"['2018/05/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7754/Clin.Lab.2017.170915 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Lab. 2018 Mar 1;64(3):357-363. doi: 10.7754/Clin.Lab.2017.170915.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among the three compounds, 3 showed the highest binding affinity to IDH1 with significant calculated binding free energy. Enzymatic kinetics demonstrated that 3 inhibited mutant enzyme in a noncompetitive manner. The half effective concentration of 3 for reducing the concentration of D-2HG in HT1080 cells was 35.97muM. The levels of histone H3K9me3 methylation in HT1080 cells were reduced by treating with 3. Furthermore, knockdown of mutant IDH1 in HT1080 cells decreased the anti-proliferative sensitivity to 3.

Our previous study has shown that in response to DNA damage HUWE1 was downregulated in CUL4B-mediated ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation, and CUL4B-mediated regulation of HUWE1 was important for cell survival upon DNA damage. CUL4B is a core component of the CUL4B Ring ligase complexes containing ROC1, DDB1 and a DDB1-Cullin Associated Factors (DCAFs), the latter of which are DDB1-binding WD40 adaptors critical for substrate recognition and recruitment. However, the identity of DCAF in CRL4B that mediates degradation of HUWE1 remains elusive. Here we report that RBBP7 is the DCAF in the CRL4B complex bridging the DDB1-CUL4B-ROC1 to HUWE1. Loading of HUWE1 to the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex resulted in its polyubiquitination, and consequently its proteasome mediated degradation. Overexpression of RBBP7 promoted HUWE1 protein degradation, while depletion of RBBP7 stabilized HUWE1, and hence accelerated the degradation of MCL-1 and BRCA1, two substrates of HUWE1 that are critical in apoptosis and DNA damage repair. Taken together, these data reveal CRL4B(RBBP7) is the E3 ligase responsible for the proteasomal degradation of HUWE1, and further provide a potential strategy for cancer therapy by targeting HUWE1 and the CUL4B E3 ligase complex.","['Liu, Fei', 'Cao, Li', 'Zhang, Ting', 'Chang, Fen', 'Xu, Yongjie', 'Li, Qin', 'Deng, Jingcheng', 'Li, Li', 'Shao, Genze']","['Liu F', 'Cao L', 'Zhang T', 'Chang F', 'Xu Y', 'Li Q', 'Deng J', 'Li L', 'Shao G']","['Department of Cell Biology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing, 100191, China; Department of Pathology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'Department of Cell Biology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'Department of Cell Biology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'Department of Cell Biology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'Department of Cell Biology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'Department of Cell Biology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'Department of Cell Biology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'Department of Cell Biology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'Department of Cell Biology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing, 100191, China.

This work resulted in compound 28 (MI-1481), which showed very potent inhibition of the menin-MLL1 interaction (IC50 = 3.6 nM), representing the most potent reversible menin-MLL1 inhibitor reported to date. The crystal structure of the menin-28 complex revealed a hydrogen bond with Glu366 and hydrophobic interactions, which contributed to strong inhibitory activity of 28. Compound 28 also demonstrates pronounced activity in MLL leukemia cells and in vivo in MLL leukemia models. Thus, 28 is a valuable menin-MLL1 inhibitor that can be used for potential therapeutic applications and in further studies regarding the role of menin in cancer.","['Borkin, Dmitry', 'Klossowski, Szymon', 'Pollock, Jonathan', 'Miao, Hongzhi', 'Linhares, Brian M', 'Kempinska, Katarzyna', 'Jin, Zhuang', 'Purohit, Trupta', 'Wen, Bo', 'He, Miao', 'Sun, Duxin', 'Cierpicki, Tomasz', 'Grembecka, Jolanta']","['Borkin D', 'Klossowski S', 'Pollock J', 'Miao H', 'Linhares BM', 'Kempinska K', 'Jin Z', 'Purohit T', 'Wen B', 'He M', 'Sun D', 'Cierpicki T', 'Grembecka J']","['Department of Pathology , University of Michigan , Ann Arbor , Michigan 48109 , United States.', 'Department of Pathology , University of Michigan , Ann Arbor , Michigan 48109 , United States.', 'Department of Pathology , University of Michigan , Ann Arbor , Michigan 48109 , United States.', 'Department of Pathology , University of Michigan , Ann Arbor , Michigan 48109 , United States.', 'Department of Pathology , University of Michigan , Ann Arbor , Michigan 48109 , United States.', 'Department of Pathology , University of Michigan , Ann Arbor , Michigan 48109 , United States.', 'Department of Pathology , University of Michigan , Ann Arbor , Michigan 48109 , United States.', 'Department of Pathology , University of Michigan , Ann Arbor , Michigan 48109 , United States.', 'College of Pharmacy , University of Michigan , Ann Arbor , Michigan 48109 , United States.', 'College of Pharmacy , University of Michigan , Ann Arbor , Michigan 48109 , United States.', 'College of Pharmacy , University of Michigan , Ann Arbor , Michigan 48109 , United States.', 'Department of Pathology , University of Michigan , Ann Arbor , Michigan 48109 , United States.', 'Department of Pathology , University of Michigan , Ann Arbor , Michigan 48109 , United States.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-6180-9095'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20180523,United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (MEN1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (thienopyrimidine)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Design', 'Female', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Models, Molecular', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology']",,,2018/05/09 06:00,2019/05/21 06:00,['2018/05/09 06:00'],"['2018/05/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/21 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00071 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 2018 Jun 14;61(11):4832-4850. doi: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00071.

Although some OCSFA (e.g., C15:0 and C17:0) are found in meats and dairy products, sources and metabolism of C19:0 and C23:0 are relatively unknown, and the influence of non-dietary determinants, including genetic factors, on circulating levels of OCSFA is not established. OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the biological processes that influence circulating levels of OCSFA by investigating associations between genetic variation and OCSFA. DESIGN: We performed a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of plasma phospholipid/erythrocyte levels of C15:0, C17:0, C19:0, and C23:0 among 11,494 individuals of European descent. We also investigated relationships between specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the lactase (LCT) gene, associated with adult-onset lactase intolerance, with circulating levels of dairy-derived OCSFA, and evaluated associations of candidate sphingolipid genes with C23:0 levels. RESULTS: We found no genome-wide significant evidence that common genetic variation is associated with circulating levels of C15:0 or C23:0. In two cohorts with available data, we identified one intronic SNP (rs13361131) in myosin X gene (MYO10) associated with C17:0 level (P = 1.37x10-8), and two intronic SNP (rs12874278 and rs17363566) in deleted in lymphocytic leukemia 1 (DLEU1) region associated with C19:0 level (P = 7.07x10-9). In contrast, when using a candidate-gene approach, we found evidence that three SNPs in LCT (rs11884924, rs16832067, and rs3816088) are associated with circulating C17:0 level (adjusted P = 4x10-2). In addition, nine SNPs in the ceramide synthase 4 (CERS4) region were associated with circulating C23:0 levels (adjusted P<5x10-2). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that circulating levels of OCSFA may be predominantly influenced by non-genetic factors. SNPs associated with C17:0 level in the LCT gene may reflect genetic influence in dairy consumption or in metabolism of dairy foods. SNPs associated with C23:0 may reflect a role of genetic factors in the synthesis of sphingomyelin.","['de Oliveira Otto, Marcia C', 'Lemaitre, Rozenn N', 'Sun, Qi', 'King, Irena B', 'Wu, Jason H Y', 'Manichaikul, Ani', 'Rich, Stephen S', 'Tsai, Michael Y', 'Chen, Y D', 'Fornage, Myriam', 'Weihua, Guan', 'Aslibekyan, Stella', 'Irvin, Marguerite R', 'Kabagambe, Edmond K', 'Arnett, Donna K', 'Jensen, Majken K', 'McKnight, Barbara', 'Psaty, Bruce M', 'Steffen, Lyn M', 'Smith, Caren E', 'Riserus, Ulf', 'Lind, Lars', 'Hu, Frank B', 'Rimm, Eric B', 'Siscovick, David S', 'Mozaffarian, Dariush']","['de Oliveira Otto MC', 'Lemaitre RN', 'Sun Q', 'King IB', 'Wu JHY', 'Manichaikul A', 'Rich SS', 'Tsai MY', 'Chen YD', 'Fornage M', 'Weihua G', 'Aslibekyan S', 'Irvin MR', 'Kabagambe EK', 'Arnett DK', 'Jensen MK', 'McKnight B', 'Psaty BM', 'Steffen LM', 'Smith CE', 'Riserus U', 'Lind L', 'Hu FB', 'Rimm EB', 'Siscovick DS', 'Mozaffarian D']","['Division of Epidemiology, Human Genetics and Environmental Sciences, the University of Texas Health Science Center, School of Public Health, Houston, TX, United States of America.', 'Cardiovascular Health Research Unit, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, United States of America.', 'Department of Nutrition and Epidemiology, Harvard T.H.

Yet, prolonged GC use is hampered by deleterious GC-related side effects and the emergence of GC resistance. To tackle and overcome these GC-related problems, the applicability of selective glucocorticoid receptor agonists and modulators was studied, in search of fewer side-effects and at least equal therapeutic efficacy as classic GCs. Compound A (CpdA) is a prototypical example of such a selective glucocorticoid receptor modulator and does not support GR-mediated transactivation. Here, we examined whether the combination of CpdA with the classic GC dexamethasone (Dex) may improve GC responsiveness of MM and ALL cell lines. We find that the combination of Dex and CpdA does not substantially enhance GC-mediated cell killing. In line, several apoptosis hallmarks, such as caspase 3/7 activity, PARP cleavage and the levels of cleaved-caspase 3 remain unchanged upon combining Dex with CpdA. Moreover, we monitor no additional inhibition of cell proliferation and the homologous downregulation of GR is not counteracted by the combination of Dex and CpdA. In addition, CpdA is unable to modulate Dex-liganded GR transactivation and transrepression, yet, Dex-mediated transrepression is also aberrant in these lymphoid cell lines. Together, transrepression-favoring compounds, alone or combined with GCs, do not seem a valid strategy in the treatment of lymphoid malignancies.","['Clarisse, Dorien', 'Van Wesemael, Karlien', 'Tavernier, Jan', 'Offner, Fritz', 'Beck, Ilse M', 'De Bosscher, Karolien']","['Clarisse D', 'Van Wesemael K', 'Tavernier J', 'Offner F', 'Beck IM', 'De Bosscher K']","['Receptor Research Laboratories, Nuclear Receptor Lab (NRL) and Cytokine Receptor Lab (CRL), Department for Biomolecular Medicine, VIB-UGent Center for Medical Biotechnology, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Cancer Research (LECR), Department of Radiation Oncology and Experimental Cancer Research, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent (CRIG), Ghent, Belgium.', 'Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Cancer Research (LECR), Department of Radiation Oncology and Experimental Cancer Research, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Receptor Research Laboratories, Nuclear Receptor Lab (NRL) and Cytokine Receptor Lab (CRL), Department for Biomolecular Medicine, VIB-UGent Center for Medical Biotechnology, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent (CRIG), Ghent, Belgium.', 'Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Cancer Research (LECR), Department of Radiation Oncology and Experimental Cancer Research, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Health Sciences, Odisee University College, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Receptor Research Laboratories, Nuclear Receptor Lab (NRL) and Cytokine Receptor Lab (CRL), Department for Biomolecular Medicine, VIB-UGent Center for Medical Biotechnology, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent (CRIG), Ghent, Belgium.']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-5059-9718'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180508,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Aziridines)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '54P5FEX9FH (aziridine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Aziridines/*administration & dosage/chemistry', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dexamethasone/*administration & dosage', 'Glucocorticoids/administration & dosage/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/genetics', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects']",,,2018/05/09 06:00,2018/08/02 06:00,['2018/05/09 06:00'],"['2018/01/24 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0197000 [doi]', 'PONE-D-18-02528 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2018 May 8;13(5):e0197000. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0197000. eCollection 2018.,,,,PMC5940183,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we found predominantly poly-functional effector/effector memory CCR7(-) /CD45RA(+/-) /CD8(+) LAA peptide-specific T cells with varying CD95 expression in 34 of 100 tested HIs, whereas CD4(+) T cells responses were restricted to 5. Most frequent LAA peptide-specific T cell responses were directed against WT1 and PRAME peptides with a prevalence of 20 and 17%, respectively, showing the highest magnitude (0.16% +/- 0.22% (mean +/- SD)) for PRAME peptides. Cytotoxicity of PRAME peptide-specific T cells was demonstrated by specific killing of PRAME peptide-pulsed T2 cells. Furthermore, the proliferative capacity of PRAME peptide-specific T cells was confined to HIs responsive toward PRAME peptide challenge corroborating the accuracy of the screening results. In conclusion, we identified PRAME as a promising target antigen for adoptive leukemia therapy.","['Matko, Sarah', 'Manderla, Julia', 'Bonsack, Maria', 'Schmitz, Marc', 'Bornhauser, Martin', 'Tonn, Torsten', 'Odendahl, Marcus']","['Matko S', 'Manderla J', 'Bonsack M', 'Schmitz M', 'Bornhauser M', 'Tonn T', 'Odendahl M']","['Experimental Transfusion Medicine, Medical Faculty Carl Gustav Carus, TU Dresden, Germany.', 'Institute for Transfusion Medicine Dresden, German Red Cross Blood Donation Service North-East, Dresden, Germany.', 'Experimental Transfusion Medicine, Medical Faculty Carl Gustav Carus, TU Dresden, Germany.', 'Institute for Transfusion Medicine Dresden, German Red Cross Blood Donation Service North-East, Dresden, Germany.', 'Center for Regenerative Therapies Dresden (CRTD), Dresden, Germany.', 'Center for Regenerative Therapies Dresden (CRTD), Dresden, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) partner site Dresden; and German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Immunology, Medical Faculty, TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'National Center for Tumor Diseases, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Center for Regenerative Therapies Dresden (CRTD), Dresden, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) partner site Dresden; and German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine 1, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'National Center for Tumor Diseases, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Experimental Transfusion Medicine, Medical Faculty Carl Gustav Carus, TU Dresden, Germany.', 'Institute for Transfusion Medicine Dresden, German Red Cross Blood Donation Service North-East, Dresden, Germany.', 'Center for Regenerative Therapies Dresden (CRTD), Dresden, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) partner site Dresden; and German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Experimental Transfusion Medicine, Medical Faculty Carl Gustav Carus, TU Dresden, Germany.', 'Institute for Transfusion Medicine Dresden, German Red Cross Blood Donation Service North-East, Dresden, Germany.']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-5317-765X'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180708,Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CTAG1B protein, human)', '0 (IFNG protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (PRAME protein, human)', '0 (Survivin)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '0 (WT1 protein, human)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology/metabolism', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/transplantation', 'Cell Line', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Memory/immunology', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Interferon-gamma/immunology', 'Leukemia/immunology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Survivin/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'WT1 Proteins/immunology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Adoptive immunotherapy', '*Antigen-specific T cells', '*Leukemia associated antigens', '*PRAME', '*WT1']",2018/05/09 06:00,2019/03/21 06:00,['2018/05/09 06:00'],"['2017/11/03 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/10 00:00 [revised]', '2018/05/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/21 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.201747399 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 2018 Aug;48(8):1400-1411. doi: 10.1002/eji.201747399.

NK cells are the primary mediators of the anti-leukaemia effect of allogeneic HSCT, and infusion of allogeneic NK cells has shown promise as a means of inducing remission and preventing relapse of several different haematological malignancies. The effectiveness of these treatments is limited, however, when tumours express human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-E, a ligand for the inhibitory receptor NKG2A, which is expressed by the vast majority of post-transplant reconstituted and ex-vivo expanded NK cells. It is possible to enhance NK cell cytotoxicity against HLA-E(pos) malignancies by increasing the proportion of NK cells expressing NKG2C (the activating receptor for HLA-E) and lacking the corresponding inhibitory receptor NKG2A. The proportion of NKG2C(pos) /NKG2A(neg) NK cells is typically low in healthy adults, but it can be increased by CMV infection or ex-vivo expansion of NK cells using HLA-E-transfected feeder cells and interleukin (IL)-15. In this review, we will discuss the role of CMV-driven NKG2C(pos) /NKG2A(neg) NK cell expansion on anti-tumour cytotoxicity and disease progression in the context of haematological malignancies, and explore the possibility of harnessing NKG2C(pos) /NKG2A(neg) NK cells for cancer immunotherapy.","['Bigley, A B', 'Baker, F L', 'Simpson, R J']","['Bigley AB', 'Baker FL', 'Simpson RJ']","['Department of Nutritional Sciences, The University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'Department of Health and Human Performance, University of Houston, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Nutritional Sciences, The University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'Department of Health and Human Performance, University of Houston, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Nutritional Sciences, The University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'Department of Health and Human Performance, University of Houston, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'Department of Immunobiology, The University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-6172-7623'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",,England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,"['0 (HLA-E antigen)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (KLRC2 protein, human)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily C)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cytomegalovirus/*physiology', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/etiology/*immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/etiology/*immunology/therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Interleukin-15/metabolism', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily C/metabolism', 'Postoperative Complications/*immunology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*NK-cells', '*NKG2C', '*immunotherapy', '*leukemia', '*myeloma']",2018/05/09 06:00,2019/06/27 06:00,['2018/05/09 06:00'],"['2018/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/27 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cei.13152 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 2018 Sep;193(3):265-274. doi: 10.1111/cei.13152.,['(c) 2018 British Society for Immunology.'],,['R21 CA197527/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC6150251,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The base excision repair (BER) pathway corrects oxidatively damaged mutagenic bases and plays an important role in maintaining genetic stability. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the relationship between BER functional polymorphisms and AML relapse. We focused on five major polymorphisms: OGG1 S326C, MUTYH Q324H, APE1 D148E, XRCC1 R194W, and XRCC1 R399Q. Ninety-four adults with AML who achieved first complete remission were recruited. Genotyping was performed with the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. The OGG1 S326C CC genotype (associated with lower OGG1 activity) was observed more frequently in patients with AML relapse [28.9 vs. 8.9%, odds ratio (OR) = 4.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.35-12.70, P = 0.01]. Patients with the CC genotype exhibited shorter relapse-free survival (RFS). Moreover, the TCGA database suggested that low OGG1 expression in AML cells is associated with a higher frequency of mutations. The present findings suggest that the OGG1 S326C polymorphism increased the probability of AML relapse and may be useful as a prognostic factor for AML relapse risk.","['Gotoh, Nanami', 'Saitoh, Takayuki', 'Takahashi, Noriyuki', 'Kasamatsu, Tetsuhiro', 'Minato, Yusuke', 'Lobna, Alkebsi', 'Oda, Tsukasa', 'Hoshino, Takumi', 'Sakura, Toru', 'Shimizu, Hiroaki', 'Takizawa, Makiko', 'Handa, Hiroshi', 'Yokohama, Akihiko', 'Tsukamoto, Norifumi', 'Murakami, Hirokazu']","['Gotoh N', 'Saitoh T', 'Takahashi N', 'Kasamatsu T', 'Minato Y', 'Lobna A', 'Oda T', 'Hoshino T', 'Sakura T', 'Shimizu H', 'Takizawa M', 'Handa H', 'Yokohama A', 'Tsukamoto N', 'Murakami H']","['Graduate School of Health Sciences, Gunma University, 3-39-22 Showa-machi, Maebashi, Gunma, 371-8514, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Health Sciences, Gunma University, 3-39-22 Showa-machi, Maebashi, Gunma, 371-8514, Japan. tsaitoh@gunma-u.ac.jp.', 'Graduate School of Health Sciences, Gunma University, 3-39-22 Showa-machi, Maebashi, Gunma, 371-8514, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Health Sciences, Gunma University, 3-39-22 Showa-machi, Maebashi, Gunma, 371-8514, Japan.', 'Department of Virology and Preventive Medicine, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, Gunma, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Health Sciences, Gunma University, 3-39-22 Showa-machi, Maebashi, Gunma, 371-8514, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Genetics, Institute for Molecular and Cellular Regulation, Gunma University, Gunma, Japan.', 'Leukemia Research Center, Saiseikai Maebashi Hospital, Gunma, Japan.', 'Leukemia Research Center, Saiseikai Maebashi Hospital, Gunma, Japan.', 'Oncology Center, Gunma University Hospital, Gunma, Japan.', 'Department of Medicine and Clinical Science, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, Gunma, Japan.', 'Department of Medicine and Clinical Science, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, Gunma, Japan.', 'Division of Blood Transfusion Service, Gunma University Hospital, Gunma, Japan.', 'Oncology Center, Gunma University Hospital, Gunma, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Health Sciences, Gunma University, 3-39-22 Showa-machi, Maebashi, Gunma, 371-8514, Japan.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180508,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'EC 3.2.2.- (DNA Glycosylases)', 'EC 3.2.2.- (oxoguanine glycosylase 1, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Glycosylases/*genetics', 'DNA Repair/*genetics/*physiology', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', '*Genetic Association Studies', '*Genotype', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Prognosis', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Recurrence', 'Risk', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Base excision repair', 'DNA damage', 'OGG1', 'Polymorphisms']",2018/05/09 06:00,2018/11/07 06:00,['2018/05/09 06:00'],"['2018/02/08 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/24 00:00 [revised]', '2018/05/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/07 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-018-2464-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-018-2464-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2018 Sep;108(3):246-253. doi: 10.1007/s12185-018-2464-9.

In previous works, we established human interleukin-15 (hIL-15) gene-modified NKL cells (NKL-IL15) and demonstrated their efficiency against human hepatocarcinoma cells (HCCs) in vitro and in vivo. To further assess the applicability of NKL-IL15 cells in adoptive cellular immunotherapy for human leukemia, here we report their natural cytotoxicity against leukemia in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: Flow cytometry, ELISA and MTT methods were performed for molecular expression, cell proliferation and cytotoxicity assays. Leukemia xenograft NOD/SCID mice were established by subcutaneous injection with K562 cells, and then treated with irradiated NKL cells. RESULTS: We found NKL-IL15 cells displayed a significant high cytolysis activity against both human leukemia cell lines and primary leukemia cells from patients, accompanied with up-regulated expression of molecules related to NK cell cytotoxicity such as perforin, granzyme B and NKp80. Moreover, cytokines secreted by NKL-IL15 cells, including TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma, could induce the expression of NKG2D ligands on target cells, which increased the susceptibility of leukemia cells to NK cell-mediated cytolysis. Encouragingly, NKL-IL15 cells significantly inhibited the growth of leukemia cells in xenografted NOD/SCID mice and prolonged the survival of tumor-bearing mice dramatically. Furthermore, NKL-IL15 cells displayed stimulatory effects on hPBMCs, indicating the immunesuppressive status of leukemia patients could be improved by NKL-IL15 cell treatment. CONCLUSIONS: These results provided evidence that IL-15 gene-modification could augment NK cell-mediated anti-human leukemia function, which would improve primary NK cell-based immunotherapy for leukemia in future.","['Jiang, Wen', 'Zhang, Cai', 'Tian, Zhigang', 'Zhang, Jian']","['Jiang W', 'Zhang C', 'Tian Z', 'Zhang J']","['Institute of Immunopharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Shandong University, 44 Wenhua West Road, Jinan, China.', 'Institute of Immunopharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Shandong University, 44 Wenhua West Road, Jinan, China.', 'Institute of Immunopharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Shandong University, 44 Wenhua West Road, Jinan, China.', 'Institute of Immunopharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Shandong University, 44 Wenhua West Road, Jinan, China. zhangj65@sdu.edu.cn.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5106-1397'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180508,Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,"['0 (IL15 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-15)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Interleukin-15/*genetics/immunology', 'K562 Cells', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology/*physiology', 'Leukemia/immunology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Middle Aged', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['Gene modification', 'Interleukin 15', 'Leukemia', 'NK cell']",2018/05/09 06:00,2018/06/29 06:00,['2018/05/09 06:00'],"['2017/12/25 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/29 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00432-018-2654-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s00432-018-2654-0 [pii]']",ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2018 Jul;144(7):1279-1288. doi: 10.1007/s00432-018-2654-0.

The median coefficient of variation (CV) value of the bosutinib C0 for one patient (intrapatient) during bosutinib therapy was 25.9% (range: 7.66-44.24%). During bosutinib therapy, 17 of 30 patients received 300 mg/day bosutinib. The interpatient CV value for the bosutinib C0 after administration of 300 mg/day was 45.0%. There were no significant differences in the bosutinib C0 between genotypes for ABCB1, ABCG2, and CYP3A4 polymorphisms. However, the bosutinib C0 in patients with the NR1I2 7635G/G or 8055T/T genotype was significantly lower than those in patients with the 7635A allele or 8055C allele, respectively (P = 0.050 and 0.022, respectively). In addition, the bosutinib C0 in patients with both NR1I2 7635G/G and 8055T/T genotypes was significantly lower than those in patients with other genotypes (P = 0.022). Because patients with the NR1I2 7635G/G or 8055T/T genotype may have increased activity of pregnane X receptor-regulated genes and thereafter higher intestinal expression of CYP3A4 and ABC efflux drug transporters, these patients may have a lower bosutinib C0. Therefore, information on the NR1I2 genotype may be useful for achieving optimal systemic exposure of bosutinib.","['Abumiya, Maiko', 'Mita, Akiko', 'Takahashi, Saori', 'Yoshioka, Tomoko', 'Kameoka, Yoshihiro', 'Takahashi, Naoto', 'Miura, Masatomo']","['Abumiya M', 'Mita A', 'Takahashi S', 'Yoshioka T', 'Kameoka Y', 'Takahashi N', 'Miura M']","['Department of Pharmacy, Akita University Hospital, 1-1-1 Hondo, Akita, 010-8543, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nephrology, and Rheumatology, Akita University Graduate School of Medicine, Akita, Japan.', 'Clinical Research Promotion and Support Center, Akita University Hospital, Akita, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nephrology, and Rheumatology, Akita University Graduate School of Medicine, Akita, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nephrology, and Rheumatology, Akita University Graduate School of Medicine, Akita, Japan.', 'Clinical Research Promotion and Support Center, Akita University Hospital, Akita, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nephrology, and Rheumatology, Akita University Graduate School of Medicine, Akita, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Akita University Hospital, 1-1-1 Hondo, Akita, 010-8543, Japan. m-miura@hos.akita-u.ac.jp.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7120-2425'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180507,United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ABCG2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2)', '0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (NR1I2 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Pregnane X Receptor)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Quinolines)', '0 (Receptors, Steroid)', '5018V4AEZ0 (bosutinib)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A)', 'EC 1.14.14.55 (CYP3A4 protein, human)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/genetics', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2/*genetics', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aniline Compounds/administration & dosage/*blood', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Nitriles/administration & dosage/*blood', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Pregnane X Receptor', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/blood', 'Quinolines/administration & dosage/*blood', 'Receptors, Steroid/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['Bosutinib', 'NR1I2', 'Plasma trough concentration', 'Polymorphism', 'Pregnane X receptor']",2018/05/08 06:00,2018/09/06 06:00,['2018/05/09 06:00'],"['2018/04/10 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/06 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12032-018-1146-z [doi]', '10.1007/s12032-018-1146-z [pii]']",epublish,Med Oncol. 2018 May 7;35(6):90. doi: 10.1007/s12032-018-1146-z.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the prognostic value of the percentage of leukemic cells with 13q- in Chinese CLL patients with isolated 13q- remained to be determined. Using interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), we identified 82 patients (25.4%) with isolated 13q deletion from a cohort of 323 untreated CLL patients. Among patients with isolated 13q deletion, cases of 13q- cells >/= 80% (13q-H) had significantly shorter time to first treatment (TTT) than those of < 80% 13q- cells (13q-L) (median 11 vs. 92 months, p = 0.0016). A higher lymphocyte count (p = 0.0650) was associated with 13q-H, while other clinical, immunophenotypic, or molecular features did not differ between patients with 13q-H and 13q-L. Although 13q-H only showed marginal significance in multivariate analysis of TTT (hazards ratio 2.007; 95% confidence interval 0.975-4.129; p = 0.059), it helped refine the risk stratification based on Binet stage or immunoglobulin heavy chain variable gene (IGHV) status. In cases in Binet A or B stage, patients with 13q-H had a significantly shorter TTT (median TTT 18 months vs. undefined, p = 0.0101). And in IGHV mutated patients, 13q-H was also associated with reduced TTT (median TTT 13q-H. 18 months vs. 13q-L undefined, p = 0.0163). In conclusion, the prognosis of CLL patients with isolated 13q deletion was heterogeneous with 13q-H identifying patients with worse outcome.","['Miao, Yuqing', 'Miao, Yi', 'Shi, Ke', 'Sun, Qian',

Fifteen patients achieved CR (79%), but levels of minimal residual disease (MRD) after induction were comparable with those previously observed using a modified pediatric protocol.

Abnormal serum ANG levels are commonly reported in various diseases. However, whether ANG can serve as a diagnostic or prognostic marker for different diseases remains a matter of debate. Methods: Here, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature utilizing PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus search engines to identify all publications comparing plasma or serum ANG levels between patients with different diseases and healthy controls, as were studies evaluating circulating ANG levels in healthy populations, pregnant women, or other demographic populations. Results: This study demonstrated that the serum ANG concentration in healthy populations was 336.14 +/- 142.83 ng/ml and remained relatively stable in different populations and regions. We noted no significant differences in serum ANG levels between patients and healthy controls, except in cases in which patients suffered from cancer or cardiovascular diseases. The serum ANG concentrations were significantly higher in patients who developed colorectal cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, multiple myeloma, myelodysplastic syndromes, and heart failure than those in healthy controls.

Caregivers of cancer patients thus deal with the management of their own psychological distress along with the child's illness. Aim: Coping plays a crucial role in improving the caregivers' physical and emotional well-being. Spirituality is an important means of consolation, strength, and emotional support during this phase. The present study aims to investigate the impact of coping and spirituality on caregiver burden. Methods: A total of 100 caregivers of children between the age group of 3-11 years, diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia were the participants of the study. The participants were recruited from cancer hospitals in Hyderabad. The study adopted a between-group design to find out if mothers and fathers differed in their coping strategies, spirituality, and caregiver burden. The study also adopted a correlation design to find the relationship between coping, spirituality, and caregiver burden. Descriptive statistics and multiple linear regression analysis were conducted to identify if coping and spirituality predict caregiver burden. Results: The results showed no significant difference in the burden experienced by both mothers and fathers; however, mothers and fathers used different coping strategies and differed on the dimensions of spirituality. The results of multiple linear regression indicated that dimensions of coping and spirituality were significant predictors of caregiver burden. Conclusion: Cancer in the child impacts the parent's burden but providing sufficient support and implementing effective coping strategies, will help in mitigating the intensity of caregiver burden. It is essential that the hospital authorities and policymakers understand that a professional health psychologist could be a liaison between the doctor, patient, and the caregiver in bringing down the levels of burden and psychological distress in caregivers as well as patients.","['Chivukula, Usha', 'Kota, Sirisha', 'Nandinee, Durgesh']","['Chivukula U', 'Kota S', 'Nandinee D']","['Centre for Health Psychology University of Hyderabad, Hyderabad, India.', 'Department of Psychology, St. Francis College for Women, Hyderabad, India.', 'Centre for Health Psychology, University of Hyderabad, Hyderabad, Telangana, India.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Indian J Palliat Care,Indian journal of palliative care,101261221,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'caregiver burden', 'coping', 'spirituality']",2018/05/08 06:00,2018/05/08 06:01,['2018/05/09 06:00'],"['2018/05/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/08 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/IJPC.IJPC_209_17 [doi]', 'IJPC-24-189 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Palliat Care. 2018 Apr-Jun;24(2):189-195. doi: 10.4103/IJPC.IJPC_209_17.,,,,PMC5915888,,,['There are no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we demonstrate that UTX suppresses myeloid leukemogenesis through noncatalytic functions, a property shared with its catalytically inactive Y-chromosome paralog, UTY (or KDM6C). In keeping with this, we demonstrate concomitant loss/mutation of KDM6A (UTX) and UTY in multiple human cancers. Mechanistically, global genomic profiling showed only minor changes in H3K27me3 but significant and bidirectional alterations in H3K27ac and chromatin accessibility; a predominant loss of H3K4me1 modifications; alterations in ETS and GATA-factor binding; and altered gene expression after Utx loss. By integrating proteomic and genomic analyses, we link these changes to UTX regulation of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling, coordination of the COMPASS complex and enhanced pioneering activity of ETS factors during evolution to AML. Collectively, our findings identify a dual role for UTX in suppressing acute myeloid leukemia via repression of oncogenic ETS and upregulation of tumor-suppressive GATA programs.","['Gozdecka,

Here, we test a complementary hypothesis of ""heterozygote advantage"" regarding the role of HLA and NHL, whereby HLA diversity is beneficial and homozygous HLA loci are associated with increased disease risk. HLA alleles at class I and II loci were imputed from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using SNP2HLA for 3,617 diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL), 2,686 follicular lymphomas (FL), 2,878 chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphomas (CLL/SLL), 741 marginal zone lymphomas (MZL), and 8,753 controls of European descent. Both DLBCL and MZL risk were elevated with homozygosity at class I HLA-B and -C loci (OR DLBCL = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.06-1.60; OR MZL = 1.45, 95% CI = 1.12-1.89) and class II HLA-DRB1 locus (OR DLBCL = 2.10, 95% CI = 1.24-3.55; OR MZL = 2.10, 95% CI = 0.99-4.45). Increased FL risk was observed with the overall increase in number of homozygous HLA class II loci (P trend < 0.0001, FDR = 0.0005). These results support a role for HLA zygosity in NHL etiology and suggests that distinct immune pathways may underly the etiology of the different NHL subtypes.Significance: HLA gene diversity reduces risk for non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

The lack of in vitro and in vivo models has severely hampered drug testing in a disease that is poorly responsive to common chemoimmunotherapeutic combinations as well as to novel kinase inhibitors. Here we report for the first time the establishment and genomic characterization of two patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDX) models of Richter syndrome, RS9737 and RS1316. Richter syndrome xenografts were genetically, morphologically, and phenotypically stable and similar to the corresponding primary tumor. RS9737 was characterized by biallelic inactivation of CDKN2A and TP53, monoallelic deletion of 11q23 (ATM), and mutations of BTK, KRAS, EGR2, and NOTCH1 RS1316 carried trisomy 12 and showed mutations in BTK, KRAS, MED12, and NOTCH2 RNA sequencing confirmed that in both cases >80% of the transcriptome was shared between primary tumor and PDX. In line with the mutational profile, pathway analyses revealed overactivation of the B-cell receptor, NFkappaB, and NOTCH pathways in both tumors, potentially providing novel tumor targets. In conclusion, these two novel models of Richter syndrome represent useful tools to study biology and response to therapies of this highly aggressive and still incurable tumor.Significance: Two patient-derived xenograft models of Richter syndrome represent the first ex vivo model to study biology of the disease and to test novel therapeutic strategies.

These phenotypes are related to the stem cell leukemia/lymphoma syndrome (SCLL), which arises through the effects of the activated FGFR1 kinase on gene transcription, which includes miRNA dysregulation. In a screen for miRNAs that are directly regulated by FGFR1, and which stimulate cell proliferation and survival, we identified miR-339-5p, which is highly upregulated in cells carrying various different chimeric kinases. Overexpression of miR-339-5p in SCLL cell types enhances cell survival and inhibition of its function leads to reduced cell viability. miR-339-5p overexpression protects cells from the consequences of FGFR1 inactivation, promoting cell-cycle progression and reduced apoptosis. Transient luciferase reporter assays and qRT-PCR detection of endogenous miR-339-5p expression in stably transduced cell lines demonstrated that BCR-FGFR1 can directly regulate miR-339-5p expression. This correlation between miR-339-5p and FGFR1 expression is also seen in primary human B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In a screen to identify targets of miR-339-5p, we identified and verified the BCL2L11 and BAX genes, which can promote apoptosis. In vivo, SCLL cells forced to overexpress miR-339-5p show a more rapid onset of disease and poorer survival compared with parental cells expressing endogenous levels of miR-339-5p. Analysis of human primary B-cell precursor ALL shows a significant higher expression of miR339-5p compared with the two cohorts of CLL patient samples, suggesting direct roles in disease progression and supporting the evidence generated in mouse models of SCLL.Significance: Proapoptiotic genes that are direct targets of miR-339-5p significantly influence promotion and aggressive development of leukemia/lymphomas associated with FGFR1 overexpression.

Failure to demethylate and to consequently reactivate methylation-silenced genes in cancer contributes to chemotherapeutic resistance, yet the regulatory mechanisms of DNA demethylation in response to chemotherapeutic agents remain unclear. Here, we show that promyelocytic leukemia (PML) recruits ten-eleven translocation dioxygenase 2 (TET2) to regulate DNA modification and cell proliferation in response to chemotherapeutic agents. TET2 was required by multiple chemotherapeutic agents (such as doxorubicin) to prmote 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) formation. Stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture, followed by immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry, identified potential binding partners of TET2, of which PML mostly enhanced 5hmC formation. PML physically bound to TET2 via the PML C-terminal domain and recruited TET2 to PML-positive nuclear bodies. This interaction was disrupted by the PML-RARA t(15;17) mutation, which stems from chromosomal translocation between DNA encoding the C-terminal domain of PML and the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA) gene. In response to chemotherapeutic drugs, PML recruited TET2, regulated DNA modification, reactivated methylation-silenced genes, and impaired cell proliferation. Knockout of PML abolished doxorubicin-promoted DNA modification. In addition, PML and TET2 levels positively correlated with improved overall survival in patients with head and neck cancer. These findings shed insight into the regulatory mechanisms of DNA modification in response to chemotherapeutic agents.Significance: Promyeloctic leukemia protein recruits TET2, regulating DNA modification and cell proliferation in response to chemotherapeutic agents.

It has been recognised as a distinct entity in the WHO 2008 classification of haematolymphoid neoplasm. This disease usually presents with cutaneous involvement as the first manifestation, with subsequent or simultaneous spread to bone marrow and peripheral blood with leukaemic dissemination. Gingival lesion as the first manifestation, in the absence of a cutaneous lesion, is an uncommon presentation of this rare disease. We report a case of an elderly woman, aged 84 years, who presented with a lump on the mandibular gingiva and ipsilateral otalgia without any cutaneous lesion and associated with an highly aggressive and rapid leukaemia. This case is an addition to the handful of those cases of BPDCN which presents without cutaneous involvement, but it is exceedingly rare for clinical features that make it a unique case in the literature.","['Viviano, Massimo', 'Cocca, Serena', 'Miracco, Clelia', 'Parrini, Stefano']","['Viviano M', 'Cocca S', 'Miracco C', 'Parrini S']","['Dentistry Department, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Senese, University of Siena, Siena, Italy.', 'ENT Department, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Senese, University of Siena, Siena, Italy.', 'Department of Pathological Anatomy Unit, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Senese, University of Siena, Siena, Italy.', 'Department of Dentistry, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Senese, University of Siena, Siena, Italy.']",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20180507,England,BMJ Case Rep,BMJ case reports,101526291,,IM,"['Aged, 80 and over', 'Deglutition Disorders/diagnosis/etiology', 'Dendritic Cells/*pathology', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Gingiva/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/complications/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mandible/diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Pain/diagnosis/etiology', 'Radiography, Panoramic/methods', 'Rare Diseases', 'Skin Neoplasms/*pathology']",['NOTNLM'],"['dentistry and oral medicine', 'head and neck cancer', 'mouth']",2018/05/08 06:00,2018/10/16 06:00,['2018/05/09 06:00'],"['2018/05/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/16 06:00 [medline]']","['bcr-2018-224623 [pii]', '10.1136/bcr-2018-224623 [doi]']",epublish,BMJ Case Rep. 2018 May 7;2018. pii: bcr-2018-224623. doi: 10.1136/bcr-2018-224623.,"['(c) BMJ Publishing Group Ltd (unless otherwise stated in the text of the article)', '2018.

METHODS: MTT assay and flow cytometry were used to evaluate chloroquine-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis in human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells, respectively. The ATP levels in chloroquine-treated cells were detected using an ATP assay kit. PCR and Western blotting were used to detect the expression levels of miR-26b and Mcl-1 in the cells, respectively. RESULTS: Chloroquine inhibited the proliferation of HepG2 cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Treatments with 80 micromol/L chloroquine for 24, 48, and 72 h induced survival rates of (71.59-/+0.2)%, (45.40-/+0.5)%, and (26.34-/+1.4)% in the cells. Treatments with chloroquine at 40, 80, and 160 micromol/L for 5 h resulted in obviously lowered intracellular ATP levels in the cells to 87.80%, 71.29%, and 38.02% of the control level, respectively. At 80 micromol/L, chloroquine significantly increased the expression of miR-26b and down-regulated the expression of Mcl-1 in HepG2 cells, and the application of the miR-26b inhibitor increased the cellular expression of Mcl-1. CONCLUSION: s Chloroquine can inhibit the cell proliferation, reduce ATP level and induce apoptosis in HepG2 cells possibly through miR-26b-mediated regulation of Mcl-1.","['Sun, Xiao-Jin', 'Ma, Lin-Yan', 'Zhang, Meng-Xiao', 'Wang, Ying', 'Zhang, Pei', 'Jiang, Chen-Chen', 'Liu, Hao']","['Sun XJ', 'Ma LY', 'Zhang MX', 'Wang Y', 'Zhang P', 'Jiang CC', 'Liu H']","['Department of Pharmacy, Bengbu Medical College, Biochemical Drugs Engineering and Technological Research Center of Anhui Province, Bengbu 233030, China.

Several factors influence the breakage rate at these sites including transcription, DNA sequence, and topological tension. These factors favor non-B DNA structures that permit formation of transient single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), making the DNA more vulnerable to agents such as the enzyme activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Certain DNA lesions created during the ssDNA state persist after the DNA resumes its normal duplex structure. We propose that factors favoring both formation of transient ssDNA and persistent DNA lesions are key in determining the DNA breakage mechanism.","['Pannunzio, Nicholas R', 'Lieber, Michael R']","['Pannunzio NR', 'Lieber MR']","['University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine, Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, Los Angeles, CA 90033, USA.', 'University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine, Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, Los Angeles, CA 90033, USA; Department of Pathology, Keck School of Medicine of USC, Los Angeles, CA 90033, USA; Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, Keck School of Medicine of USC, Los Angeles, CA 90033, USA; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Keck School of Medicine of USC, Los Angeles, CA 90033, USA; Section of Molecular and Computational Biology, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90089, USA.

Many patients have deep molecular responses, a prerequisite for TKI therapy discontinuation. We aimed to define precise conditions for stopping treatment. METHODS: In this prospective, non-randomised trial, we enrolled patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia at 61 European centres in 11 countries. Eligible patients had chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukaemia, had received any TKI for at least 3 years (without treatment failure according to European LeukemiaNet [ELN] recommendations), and had a confirmed deep molecular response for at least 1 year. The primary endpoint was molecular relapse-free survival, defined by loss of major molecular response (MMR; >0.1% BCR-ABL1 on the International Scale) and assessed in all patients with at least one molecular result. Secondary endpoints were a prognostic analysis of factors affecting maintenance of MMR at 6 months in learning and validation samples and the cost impact of stopping TKI therapy. We considered loss of haematological response, progress to accelerated-phase chronic myeloid leukaemia, or blast crisis as serious adverse events. This study presents the results of the prespecified interim analysis, which was done after the 6-month molecular relapse-free survival status was known for 200 patients. The study is ongoing and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01596114. FINDINGS: Between May 30, 2012, and Dec 3, 2014, we assessed 868 patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia for eligibility, of whom 758 were enrolled. Median follow-up of the 755 patients evaluable for molecular response was 27 months (IQR 21-34). Molecular relapse-free survival for these patients was 61% (95% CI 57-64) at 6 months and 50% (46-54) at 24 months. Of these 755 patients, 371 (49%) lost MMR after TKI discontinuation, four (1%) died while in MMR for reasons unrelated to chronic myeloid leukaemia (myocardial infarction, lung cancer, renal cancer, and heart failure), and 13 (2%) restarted TKI therapy while in MMR. A further six (1%) patients died in chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukaemia after loss of MMR and re-initiation of TKI therapy for reasons unrelated to chronic myeloid leukaemia, and two (<1%) patients lost MMR despite restarting TKI therapy. In the prognostic analysis in 405 patients who received imatinib as first-line treatment (learning sample), longer treatment duration (odds ratio [OR] per year 1.14 [95% CI 1.05-1.23]; p=0.0010) and longer deep molecular response durations (1.13 [1.04-1.23]; p=0.0032) were associated with increasing probability of MMR maintenance at 6 months. The OR for deep molecular response duration was replicated in the validation sample consisting of 171 patients treated with any TKI as first-line treatment, although the association was not significant (1.13 [0.98-1.29]; p=0.08). TKI discontinuation was associated with substantial cost savings (an estimated euro22 million). No serious adverse events were reported. INTERPRETATION: Patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia who have achieved deep molecular responses have good molecular relapse-free survival. Such patients should be considered for TKI discontinuation, particularly those who have been in deep molecular response for a long time. Stopping treatment could spare patients from treatment-induced side-effects and reduce health expenditure.

Hospital antibiotic utilization rates were reported as days of therapy (DOTs) per 1,000 neutropenic days. Negative binomial regression was used to estimate hospital utilization rates, adjusting for patient covariates including demographics, transplant characteristics, and severity of illness. To better quantify the magnitude of hospital variation and to explore hospital-level drivers in addition to patient-level drivers of variation, mixed-effects negative binomial models were also constructed.RESULTSAdjusted hospital rates of antipseudomonal antibiotic use varied from 436 to 1121 DOTs per 1,000 neutropenic days, and rates of broad-spectrum, gram-positive antibiotic use varied from 153 to 728 DOTs per 1,000 neutropenic days. We detected variability by hospital in choice of antipseudomonal agent (ie, cephalosporins, penicillins, and carbapenems), but gram-positive coverage was primarily driven by vancomycin use. Considerable center-level variability remained even after controlling for additional hospital-level factors. Antibiotic use was not strongly associated with days of significant illness or mortality.CONCLUSIONAmong a homogenous population of children undergoing HCT for acute leukemia, both the quantity and spectrum of antibiotic exposure in the immediate posttransplant period varied widely. Antimicrobial stewardship initiatives can apply these data to optimize the use of antibiotics in transplant patients.Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol 2018;797-805.","['Elgarten, Caitlin W', 'Arnold, Staci D', 'Li, Yimei', 'Huang, Yuan-Shung V', 'Riches, Marcie L', 'Gerber, Jeffrey S', 'Aplenc, Richard', 'Saber, Wael', 'Fisher, Brian T']","['Elgarten CW', 'Arnold SD', 'Li Y', 'Huang YV', 'Riches ML', 'Gerber JS', 'Aplenc R', 'Saber W', 'Fisher BT']","[""1Division of Oncology,The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia,Philadelphia,Pennsylvania."", ""3Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center,Children's Healthcare of Atlanta,Emory University,Atlanta,Georgia."", ""1Division of Oncology,The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia,Philadelphia,Pennsylvania."", ""4Center of Pediatric Clinical Effectiveness,The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia,Philadelphia,Pennsylvania."", '5Division of Hematology/Oncology,University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,Chapel Hill,North Carolina.', '2Center for Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics,Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania,Philadelphia,Pennsylvania.', ""1Division of Oncology,The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia,Philadelphia,Pennsylvania."", '7Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research,Milwaukee,Wisconsin.', '2Center for Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics,Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania,Philadelphia,Pennsylvania.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20180508,United States,Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,Infection control and hospital epidemiology,8804099,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Carbapenems)', '0 (Penicillins)', '6Q205EH1VU (Vancomycin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antimicrobial Stewardship', 'Carbapenems/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Utilization/*statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Gram-Positive Bacteria', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals, Pediatric', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Male', 'Penicillins/therapeutic use', 'Registries', 'Regression Analysis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Vancomycin/therapeutic use']",,,2018/05/08 06:00,2019/04/30 06:00,['2018/05/09 06:00'],"['2018/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/30 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0899823X1800096X [pii]', '10.1017/ice.2018.96 [doi]']",ppublish,Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol. 2018 Jul;39(7):797-805. doi: 10.1017/ice.2018.96.

We used flow cytometric analysis to examine the early stages of apoptosis induced by bornyl cis-4-hydroxycinnamate in the two melanoma cell lines and employed comparative proteomic analysis to investigate the effects of this compound on protein expression in A375 cells. Master maps generated by PDQuest software from two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) analysis of A375 cells showed that the expression levels of 35 proteins were significantly altered, with 18 proteins upregulated and 17 downregulated. The proteomics study identified several proteins that are involved in mitochondrial dysfunction and endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress), in addition to apoptosis-associated proteins, including prohibitin, hypoxia-upregulated protein 1, stress 70 protein, 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78), and protein deglycase DJ-1 (protein DJ-1) in melanoma cells exposed to bornyl cis-4-hydroxycinnamate. The treatment also resulted in a marked decline of the mitochondrial membrane potential, in cytochrome C release into the cytosol, in the activation of Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), Bcl-2-associated death promoter protein (Bad), caspase-3, and caspase-9, and in the decreased expression of p-Bad, B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-xl, and induced myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein-1 (Mcl-1), indicating that apoptosis induced by bornyl cis-4-hydroxycinnamate was mediated by the mitochondria through the caspase-dependent pathway. Also, salubrinal (an eukaryotic initiation factor 2&alpha; inhibitor; eIF2&alpha; inhibitor) was able to protect the cells from bornyl cis-4-hydroxycinnamate-induced apoptosis. Bornyl cis-4-hydroxycinnamate-related cell death also implied that the protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK)(-)eIF2&alpha;(-)ATF4(-)CHOP signal pathways was activated upon bornyl cis-4-hydroxycinnamate treatment. Altogether, our results support the conclusion that bornyl cis-4-hydroxycinnamate-induced apoptosis in melanoma cells is associated with mechanisms correlated with the activation of caspase cascades, mitochondrial dysfunction, and endoplasmic reticulum stress, and indicate that this molecule has the potential to be developed as a chemotherapeutic agent for human melanoma.","['Yang, Tzu-Yen', 'Wu, Yu-Jen', 'Chang, Chi-I', 'Chiu, Chien-Chih', 'Wu, Mei-Li']","['Yang TY', 'Wu YJ', 'Chang CI', 'Chiu CC', 'Wu ML']","['Department of Food Science, National Pingtung University of Science and Technology, Pingtung 91202, Taiwan. gini0307@yahoo.com.tw.', 'Department of Beauty Science, Meiho University, Pingtung 91202, Taiwan. x00002180@meiho.edu.tw.', 'Department of Biological Science and Technology, Meiho University, Pingtung 91202, Taiwan. x00002180@meiho.edu.tw.', 'Department of Biological Science and Technology, National Pingtung University of Science and Technology, Pingtung 91201, Taiwan. changchii@mail.npust.edu.tw.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung 80708, Taiwan. woodnettle2002@gmail.com.', 'Department of Food Science, National Pingtung University of Science and Technology, Pingtung 91202, Taiwan. mlwu@mail.npust.edu.tw.']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-7307-2468'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180504,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Coumaric Acids)', '0 (Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP)', '0 (HSPA5 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Coumaric Acids/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/drug effects/genetics', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Melanoma/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Piper betle/chemistry', 'Plant Stems/chemistry', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",['NOTNLM'],"['apoptosis', 'bornyl cis-4-hydroxycinnamate', 'endoplasmic reticulum stress', 'melanoma', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'proteomic']",2018/05/08 06:00,2018/09/22 06:00,['2018/05/09 06:00'],"['2018/04/06 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/22 00:00 [revised]', '2018/04/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/22 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms19051370 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms19051370 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2018 May 4;19(5). pii: ijms19051370. doi: 10.3390/ijms19051370.,,,,PMC5983650,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study is to report growth patterns of our retinoblastoma (Rb) population who were treated with OAC in a retrospective, single center (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center) review of 341 patients treated between 2006 and 2016. Children who only received OAC were classified as naive; those who were treated initially with systemic chemotherapy and subsequently presented to our center for OAC were termed secondary; and a small group of patients who received single-agent systemic chemotherapy prior to OAC were labeled bridge. For all patients, height and weight were recorded at monthly intervals during OAC (short-term) and then annually during a follow-up period (long-term) up to 3 years after treatment. Excluded from this study were children who received external radiation therapy and those with genetic syndromes, which are independently associated with growth derangements. During OAC, there was no significant difference in growth velocity between the naive and secondary groups. In either group, number of treatments also did not affect growth rate. Three years after the end of OAC, naive patients were in the 68th percentile by height (95% CI 61.30, 74.63) compared to secondary patients in the 61st percentile (95% CI 51.1, 71.47). Both groups were in the same weight percentiles during the first two years of follow-up but at the three-year follow-up period, naive patients were in the 63rd percentile (95% CI 57.4, 69.4) and secondary patients were in the 60th percentile (95% CI 50.4, 69.7).

In childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia, endoglin is associated with adverse outcome. In bone marrow, endoglin identifies the repopulating hematopoietic stem cells. Mast cells are a component of normal tissue and play an important role in the regulation of several processes, including inflammation and neoplasia. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of endoglin as a biological marker of mast cells compared with the gold standard stains. We studied 15 specimens of neurofibroma, 9 of mastocytosis, and 6 of fibrous scar tissue through immunohistochemistry (for endoglin and mast cell tryptase) and histochemical staining using toluidine blue. Quantitative analysis of the cells was performed by counting 5 hotspots. The validity of endoglin as a mast cell marker was assessed by intraclass correlation coefficient. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare mast cell count for each marker. A strong endoglin expression was found in the cytoplasmic granules of mast cells within the 3 groups. Similar results were observed with mast cell tryptase as well as toluidine blue. The intraclass correlation coefficient revealed that endoglin is a highly reliable biomarker of mast cells when compared with mast cell tryptase and toluidine blue. In conclusion, endoglin may assist in the diagnosis and pathogenesis study of various processes associated with mast cells. An endoglin-neutralizing treatment for solid cancers and leukemia could also affect mastocytes and the immunologic system.","['Trentin Brum, Suellen', 'Demasi, Ana Paula', 'Fantelli Stelini, Rafael', 'Cintra, Maria Leticia', 'Cavalcanti de Araujo, Vera', 'Borges Soares, Andresa']","['Trentin Brum S', 'Demasi AP', 'Fantelli Stelini R', 'Cintra ML', 'Cavalcanti de Araujo V', 'Borges Soares A']","['Department of Oral Pathology, Sao Leopoldo Mandic Institute and Research Center.', 'Department of Oral Pathology, Sao Leopoldo Mandic Institute and Research Center.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, University of Campinas (UNICAMP), Campinas, SP, Brazil.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, University of Campinas (UNICAMP), Campinas, SP, Brazil.', 'Department of Oral Pathology, Sao Leopoldo Mandic Institute and Research Center.', 'Department of Oral Pathology, Sao Leopoldo Mandic Institute and Research Center.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol,Applied immunohistochemistry & molecular morphology : AIMM,100888796,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Endoglin)', '15XUH0X66N (Tolonium Chloride)', 'EC 3.4.21.59 (Tryptases)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Endoglin/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Mast Cells/*metabolism', 'Mastocytosis/*metabolism', 'Neurofibroma/*metabolism', 'Tolonium Chloride', 'Tryptases/metabolism']",,,2018/05/08 06:00,2020/07/24 06:00,['2018/05/08 06:00'],"['2018/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/24 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/PAI.0000000000000668 [doi]'],ppublish,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol. 2019 Sep;27(8):613-617. doi: 10.1097/PAI.0000000000000668.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Children and young adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia are at high risk for associated poor bone outcomes due to contributing effects of chemotherapy and supportive care. Evidence-based vitamin D guidelines are lacking in this population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective study following the implementation of an institutional guideline for standardized monitoring and supplementing vitamin D based on 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and patient age. Goal 25-hydroxyvitamin D level was defined as >/=30 ng/mL and levels were checked every 3 months. RESULTS: Over a period of 22 months, 69 patients (median age, 6.7 y) were included. At diagnosis, 42 patients (60.8%) were insufficient. Among insufficient patients at diagnosis, 83.3% became sufficient at first repeat level following supplementation. At completion of the study 95.6% of patients were sufficient. Insufficiency was more common in winter than summer at baseline (74.3% vs. 47.1%, P=0.03), though the impact of seasonality was overcome following the algorithm. Throughout the study 4 patients had supratherapeutic but nontoxic levels. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D replacement guidelines implemented in the pediatric and young adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia population markedly increased the percentage of vitamin D sufficient patients in a short period of time.","['Young, Jennifer', 'Welin, Elizabeth', 'Braeutigam, Carina', 'Gilger, Elizabeth', 'Lane, Adam', 'Salloum, Ralph']","['Young J', 'Welin E', 'Braeutigam C', 'Gilger E', 'Lane A', 'Salloum R']","['Divisions of Pharmacy.', 'Nutrition.', 'Cancer and Blood Diseases Institute.', 'Cancer and Blood Diseases Institute.', ""Division of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Immune Deficiency, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH."", 'Cancer and Blood Diseases Institute.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['1406-16-2 (Vitamin D)', 'A288AR3C9H (25-hydroxyvitamin D)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Algorithms', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Seasons', 'Vitamin D/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics']",,,2018/05/08 06:00,2019/05/14 06:00,['2018/05/08 06:00'],"['2018/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/14 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MPH.0000000000001204 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2018 Nov;40(8):594-597. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0000000000001204.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Indeed, CML is now associated with near-normal life expectancy for the majority of patients, provided they adhere to lifelong TKI-based treatment. This paradigm, in which CML can be regarded as a chronic disease, has inherent consequences on the prevalence of the disease. Our objective was to study CML prevalence trend in the French population from 1960 to 2060. We used a cohort component-based model to forecast the prevalence of CML using projections of the French population, the estimated incidence rates by age and sex, and various hypotheses on the year-specific relative survival. CML prevalence in France is estimated at 2.5 per 100,000 inhabitants before the 1980s, with a progression up to 6 by 2002. Since 2002 this trend has increased further, with current and predicted prevalence reaching levels around 18 and 24 per 100,000 in 2018 and 2030 respectively. CML prevalence reaches 30 per 100,000 by 2050 when progression slows. Our simulations show that prevalence of CML is driven by both population aging and relative survival improvement. The grey area corresponds to the expected prevalence of CML.","['Delord, Marc', 'Foulon, Stephanie', 'Cayuela, Jean-Michel', 'Rousselot, Philippe', 'Bonastre, Julia']","['Delord M', 'Foulon S', 'Cayuela JM', 'Rousselot P', 'Bonastre J']","[""Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie, Universite Paris 7, Hopital Saint Louis, Paris, France.

For these kinds of applications the toxicity and the cellular uptake of the AuNTs is of outstanding importance. Therefore, this study focuses on the toxicity of ""naked"" AOT-stabilized AuNTs compared to polymer-coated AuNTs. Polymeric coating consisted of non-modified hyperbranched poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI), maltose-modified poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI-Mal) and heparin. The toxicological experiments were carried out with two different cell lines (embryonic kidney carcinoma cell line HEK293T and NK-cell leukemia cell line YTS). This study revealed that the heparin-coating of AuNTs improved biocompatibility by a factor of 50 when compared to naked AuNTs. Of note, the highest nontoxic concentration of the AuNTs coated with PEI and PEI-Mal is drastically decreased. Overall, this is mainly triggered by the different surface charges of polymeric coatings. Therefore, AuNTs coated with heparin were selected to carry out uptake studies. Their promising high biocompatibility and cellular uptake may open future studies in the field of biomedical applications.","['Liebig, Ferenc', 'Moreno, Silvia', 'Thunemann, Andreas F', 'Temme, Achim', 'Appelhans, Dietmar', 'Koetz, Joachim']","['Liebig F', 'Moreno S', 'Thunemann AF', 'Temme A', 'Appelhans D', 'Koetz J']","['Institute for Chemistry, University of Potsdam, 14476 Potsdam, Germany.', 'Leibniz Institute of Polymer Research Dresden, 01069 Dresden, Germany.', 'Bundesanstalt fur Materialforschung und-prufung, 12205 Berlin, (BAM), Unter den Eichen 87, Germany.', 'University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Department of Neurosurgery, Section Experimental Neurosurgery/Tumor Immunology, TU Dresden, 01307 Dresden, Germany; German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Partner Site Dresden, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany; National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT), 01307 Dresden, Germany.', 'Leibniz Institute of Polymer Research Dresden, 01069 Dresden, Germany.', 'Institute for Chemistry, University of Potsdam, 14476 Potsdam, Germany.

To reconcile these divergent roles, we knocked down RUNX1 in human T-ALL cell lines and deleted Runx1 or Cbfb in primary mouse T-cell leukemias. RUNX1 depletion consistently resulted in reduced cell proliferation and increased apoptosis. RUNX1 upregulated variable sets of target genes in each cell line, but consistently included a core set of oncogenic effectors including insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) and NRAS.

The natural history of this disease has been radically modified by tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). However, resistance to several lines of TKI therapies and progression to blast crisis (BC) remain significant concerns. To identify novel signaling pathways induced by BCR-ABL, we performed a transcriptome analysis in a BCR-ABL-expressing UT-7 cell line. More than 2000 genes differentially expressed between BCR-ABL-expressing and parental UT-7 cells were identified and ETS1 was found to be the most upregulated. ETS1 protein expression was also shown to be highly increased in UT-7 cells expressing BCR-ABL either constitutively or under the control of TET-inducible promoters. ETS1 expression is tyrosine-kinase dependent because it was reduced by TKIs. A significant increase of ETS1 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression was observed in blood cells from CML patients at diagnosis compared with healthy controls. Integration of publicly available chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and transcriptomic data with our results allowed us to identify potential ETS1 targets, some of which are involved in the progression of CML. The messenger RNA expression of two of these genes (DNM3 and LIMS1) was found to be associated with the absence of major cytogenetic response after 1 year of imatinib therapy. The present work demonstrates for the first time the involvement of the ETS1 transcriptional program in the experimental UT-7 model and a large cohort of CML patients.","['Desterke, Christophe', 'Voldoire, Maud', 'Bonnet, Marie-Laure', 'Sorel, Nathalie', 'Pagliaro, Sarah', 'Rahban, Hind', 'Bennaceur-Griscelli, Annelise', 'Cayssials, Emilie', 'Chomel, Jean-Claude', 'Turhan, Ali G']","['Desterke C', 'Voldoire M', 'Bonnet ML', 'Sorel N', 'Pagliaro S', 'Rahban H', 'Bennaceur-Griscelli A', 'Cayssials E', 'Chomel JC', 'Turhan AG']","['INSERM U935, F94807 Villejuif, France; Universite Paris Sud, F94270 Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France.', 'INSERM, U935, F86000 Poitiers, France; Centre Hospitalier de la Roche-sur-Yon, Service de Medecine Onco-Hematologie, la Roche-sur-Yon, F85925 France.', 'INSERM, U935, F86000 Poitiers, France.', 'INSERM, U935, F86000 Poitiers, France; Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Poitiers, Service de Cancerologie Biologique, F86000 Poitiers, France.', 'INSERM U935, F94807 Villejuif, France.', 'Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Poitiers, Service de Cancerologie Biologique, F86000 Poitiers, France.', ""INSERM U935, F94807 Villejuif, France; Universite Paris Sud, F94270 Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France; Hopital Paul Brousse, Service d'Hematologie Biologique, F94800 Villejuif, France."", ""INSERM, CIC-P 1402, F86000 Poitiers, France; Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Poitiers, Service d'Oncologie Hematologique et Therapie Cellulaire, F86000, Poitiers, France."", 'INSERM, U935, F86000 Poitiers, France; Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Poitiers, Service de Cancerologie Biologique, F86000 Poitiers, France.', ""INSERM U935, F94807 Villejuif, France; Universite Paris Sud, F94270 Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France; Hopital Paul Brousse, Service d'Hematologie Biologique, F94800 Villejuif, France; Hopital Bicetre, Service d'Hematologie Biologique, F94270 Le Kremlin Bicetre, France.

The current metal-tagged reagent preparation employs thiol-maleimide chemistry to covalently couple maleimide-functionalized metal-chelating polymers (MCPs) with antibodies (Abs), a process that requires partial reduction of the Ab to form reactive thiol groups. However, some classes of Abs (for example, IgM) as well as biomolecules lacking cysteine residues have been challenging to label using this method. This inherent limitation led us to develop a new conjugation strategy for labeling a wide range of biomolecules and affinity reagents. In this report, we present a metal tagging approach using a new class of azide- or transcyclooctene-terminated MCPs with copper(I)-free strain-promoted alkyne-azide cycloaddition or tetrazine-alkene click chemistry reactions, in which biomolecules with -NH2 functional groups are selectively activated with a dibenzocyclooctyne or tetrazine moiety, respectively. This approach enabled us to generate highly sensitive and specific metal-tagged IgGs, IgMs, small peptides, and lectins for applications in immunophenotyping and glycobiology. We also created dual-tagged reagents for simultaneous detection of markers by immunofluorescence, mass cytometry, and imaging mass cytometry using a two-step conjugation process. The Helios mass cytometer was used to test the functionality of reagents on suspension human leukemia cell lines and primary cells. The dual-tagged Abs, metal-tagged lectins, and phalloidin staining reagent were used to visualize target proteins and glycans on adherent cell lines and frozen/FFPE tissue sections using the Hyperion Imaging System. In some instances, reagents produced by click conjugation showed superior sensitivity and specificity compared to those of reagents produced by thiol-maleimide chemistry. In general, the click chemistry-based conjugation with new MCPs could be instrumental in developing a wide range of highly sensitive metal-containing reagents for proteomics and glycomics applications.","['Allo, Bedilu', 'Lou, Xudong', 'Bouzekri, Alexandre', 'Ornatsky, Olga']","['Allo B', 'Lou X', 'Bouzekri A', 'Ornatsky O']","['Fluidigm Canada Inc. , Markham , Ontario L3R 4G5 , Canada.', 'Fluidigm Canada Inc. , Markham , Ontario L3R 4G5 , Canada.', 'Fluidigm Canada Inc. , Markham , Ontario L3R 4G5 , Canada.', 'Fluidigm Canada Inc. , Markham , Ontario L3R 4G5 , Canada.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-6496-0671'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180517,United States,Bioconjug Chem,Bioconjugate chemistry,9010319,"['0 (Alkynes)', '0 (Azides)', '0 (Chelating Agents)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Oligopeptides)']",IM,"['Alkynes/*chemistry', 'Animals', 'Azides/*chemistry', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chelating Agents/*chemistry', 'Click Chemistry/methods', 'Cycloaddition Reaction/*methods', 'Fluorescent Dyes/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/chemistry', 'Immunoglobulin M/chemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lectins/chemistry', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Oligopeptides/chemistry', 'Single-Cell Analysis/*methods']",,,2018/05/08 06:00,2019/04/16 06:00,['2018/05/08 06:00'],"['2018/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/16 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.8b00239 [doi]'],ppublish,Bioconjug Chem. 2018 Jun 20;29(6):2028-2038. doi: 10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.8b00239.

With new target therapies, the survival of adults with ALL has improved in the past few decades. Unfortunately, there are no large ALL patient series in many Latin American countries. Data from the Acute Leukemia Workgroup that includes five Mexico City referral centers were used. Survival was estimated for adult patients with ALL during 2009-2015. In total, 559 adults with ALL were included. The median age was 28 years; 67% were classified into the adolescent and young adult group. Cytogenetic information was available in 54.5% of cases. Of the 305 analyzed cases, most had a normal caryotype (70.5%) and Philadelphia-positive was present in 16.7%. The most commonly used treatment regimen was hyper-CVAD. In approximately 20% of cases, there was considerable delay in the administration of chemotherapy. Primarily refractory cases accounted for 13.1% of patients. At the time of analysis, 26.7% of cases had survived. The 3-year overall survival was 22.1%. The main cause of death was disease progression in 228 (55.6%). Clinical and public health strategies are needed to improve diagnosis, treatment and survivorship care for adult with ALL. This multicentric report represents the largest series in Mexico of adult ALL patients in which a survival analysis and risk identification were obtained.","['Crespo-Solis, Erick', 'Espinosa-Bautista, Karla', 'Alvarado-Ibarra, Martha', 'Rozen-Fuller, Etta', 'Perez-Rocha, Fernando', 'Nava-Gomez, Chantal', 'Ortiz-Zepeda, Maricela', 'Alvarez-Vera, Jose Luis', 'Ramos-Penafiel, Christian Omar', 'Meillon-Garcia, Luis Antonio', 'Rodriguez-Rodriguez, Sergio', 'Pomerantz-Okon, Alan', 'Turrubiates-Hernandez, Francisco Javier', 'Demichelis-Gomez, Roberta']","['Crespo-Solis E', 'Espinosa-Bautista K', 'Alvarado-Ibarra M', 'Rozen-Fuller E', 'Perez-Rocha F', 'Nava-Gomez C', 'Ortiz-Zepeda M', 'Alvarez-Vera JL', 'Ramos-Penafiel CO', 'Meillon-Garcia LA', 'Rodriguez-Rodriguez S', 'Pomerantz-Okon A', 'Turrubiates-Hernandez FJ', 'Demichelis-Gomez R']","['Hospital Regional de Alta Especialidad de Ciudad Victoria, Ciudad Victoria, Tamaulipas, Mexico.', 'Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.', 'Centro Medico Nacional 20 de Noviembre, ISSSTE, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.', 'Hospital General de Mexico, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.', 'Centro Medico Nacional Siglo XXI, IMSS, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.', 'Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.', 'Centro Medico Nacional 20 de Noviembre, ISSSTE, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.', 'Centro Medico Nacional 20 de Noviembre, ISSSTE, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.', 'Hospital General de Mexico, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.', 'Centro Medico Nacional Siglo XXI, IMSS, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.', 'Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.', 'Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.', 'Hospital Regional de Alta Especialidad de Ciudad Victoria, Ciudad Victoria, Tamaulipas, Mexico.', 'Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-7437-1299'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180507,United States,Cancer Med,Cancer medicine,101595310,,IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Male', 'Mexico', 'Survival Analysis']",['NOTNLM'],"['* AYA', '* GTLA', '*Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*survival']",2018/05/08 06:00,2019/10/28 06:00,['2018/05/08 06:00'],"['2018/02/07 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/26 00:00 [revised]', '2018/03/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/28 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cam4.1513 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Med. 2018 Jun;7(6):2423-2433. doi: 10.1002/cam4.1513.

Endemic areas are Japan, West Africa, Central Africa, South America, the Caribbean, Middle East, Australia and the Pacific Islands. In Guinea-Bissau, adult HTLV-1 prevalence is 2-3%, and higher among HIV-infected patients. Materials and methods: Blood samples were collected in a recent HIV/HTLV survey in Bissau, the capital of Guinea-Bissau. Initially, participants were tested for HTLV serologically. The p24 and LTR regions of the proviral genome were then attempted sequenced. Sequences were analysed phylogenetically and compared with reference sequences for HTLV-1. Results: A total of 3% (78/2583) participants were positive on chemiluminesent assay, six additional samples came from another study. Of the 84 seropositive participants we successfully performed sequencing on samples, from 66 participants, 17 were positive for LTR only, one for p24 only and 48 for both. Sequences were in subgroup D of HTLV-1a cosmopolitan, while HTLV-1g was present in one participant. Conclusion: HTLV-1a subgroup D and, to a lesser extent HTLV-1g, is present in Guinea-Bissau and sequences are very similar, especially within households. Presence of HTLV-1g indicates monkey-to-man zoonotic events and at least two circulating HTLV strains in Guinea-Bissau.

The aim of the present study was to assess and compare the photoprotective effects of cyanidin-3- O-glucoside (C3G) alone and encapsulated in chitosan nanoparticles (Nano-C3G) in a UVB-induced acute photodamage mouse model. Nano-C3G was developed from chitosan and sodium tripolyphosphate (TPP) by ionic gelation. The particle size, zeta potential, entrapment efficiency, drug loading, and in vitro release in 6 days were determined. Kunming (KM) mice were treated with Nano-C3G (125, 250, 500 muM) or C3G (500 muM) after part of the dorsal skin area was dehaired and then exposed to 2 J/cm(2) of UVB. The nanocapsules were successfully produced and had a uniform and complete spherical shape without agglomeration. The size, zeta potential, entrapment efficiency, and drug loading of Nano-C3G was 288 nm, +30 mV, 44.90%, and 4.30%, respectively. C3G in the nanocapsules was released quite rapidly, and the release rate slowed down at higher pH. The animal experiment demonstrated that Nano-C3G could effectively reduce the UVB-induced lipid peroxidation, malondialdehyde, and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine contents; downregulate p53, Bcl-2-associated X (Bax), and caspase-3 and -9 expression; and balance the B-cell lymphoma-2/leukemia-2 ratio. Moreover, Nano-C3G (125, 250, 500 muM) improved the visual appearance, skin moisture, histologic appearance, and apoptotic index (based on TUNEL staining) under UVB exposure. In conclusion, these results suggest that Nano-C3G can reduce UVB-induced epidermal damage through the p53-mediated apoptosis signaling pathway. Moreover, Nano-C3G was more efficient than C3G at the same concentration (500 muM).","['Liu, Zhaohan', 'Hu, Yunfeng', 'Li, Xia', 'Mei, Zhouxiong', 'Wu, Shi', 'He, Yong', 'Jiang, Xinwei', 'Sun, Jianxia', 'Xiao, Jianbo', 'Deng, Liehua', 'Bai, Weibin']","['Liu Z', 'Hu Y', 'Li X', 'Mei Z', 'Wu S', 'He Y', 'Jiang X', 'Sun J', 'Xiao J', 'Deng L', 'Bai W']","['Department of Dermatology, The First Affiliated Hospital , Jinan University , Guangzhou , China.', 'Department of Dermatology, The First Affiliated Hospital , Jinan University , Guangzhou , China.', 'Department of Food Science and Engineering, Institute of Food Safety and Nutrition, Guangdong Engineering Technology Center of Food Safety Molecular Rapid Detection , Jinan University , Guangzhou , China.', 'Faculty of Chemical Engineering and Light Industry , Guangdong University of Technology , Guangzhou , China.', 'Department of Dermatology, The First Affiliated Hospital , Jinan University , Guangzhou , China.', 'Department of Dermatology, The First Affiliated Hospital , Jinan University , Guangzhou , China.', 'Department of Food Science and Engineering, Institute of Food Safety and Nutrition, Guangdong Engineering Technology Center of Food Safety Molecular Rapid Detection , Jinan University , Guangzhou , China.', 'Faculty of Chemical Engineering and Light Industry , Guangdong University of Technology , Guangzhou , China.', 'Institute of Chinese Medical Sciences, State Key Laboratory of Quality Research in Chinese Medicine , University of Macau , Taipa , Macau , China.', 'Department of Dermatology, The First Affiliated Hospital , Jinan University , Guangzhou , China.', 'Department of Food Science and Engineering, Institute of Food Safety and Nutrition, Guangdong Engineering Technology Center of Food Safety Molecular Rapid Detection , Jinan University , Guangzhou , China.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1729-2970'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180517,United States,J Agric Food Chem,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,0374755,"['0 (Anthocyanins)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Glucosides)', '0 (Polyphosphates)', '0 (Radiation-Protective Agents)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (cyanidin-3-O-beta-glucopyranoside)', '9012-76-4 (Chitosan)', 'NU43IAG5BC (triphosphoric acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anthocyanins/*administration & dosage', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Chitosan/chemistry', 'DNA Damage/drug effects', 'Epidermis/*radiation effects', 'Female', 'Glucosides/*administration & dosage', 'Mice', '*Nanoparticles/chemistry', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Photosensitivity Disorders/etiology/prevention & control', 'Polyphosphates/chemistry', '*Radiation-Protective Agents', 'Sunburn', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/physiology', 'Ultraviolet Rays/*adverse effects']",['NOTNLM'],"['cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G)', 'mitochondrial apoptosis', 'nanoparticles', 'skin photodamage', 'ultraviolet B (UVB)']",2018/05/08 06:00,2018/06/12 06:00,['2018/05/08 06:00'],"['2018/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/12 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.jafc.8b01002 [doi]'],ppublish,J Agric Food Chem. 2018 May 30;66(21):5359-5367. doi: 10.1021/acs.jafc.8b01002.

We assessed the distribution and trends of the main causes of death among children aged 5-9 years and 10-14 years from 1990 to 2016, for 51 countries in the WHO European Region. Methods: We used data from vital registration systems, cancer registries, and police records from 1980 to 2016 to estimate cause-specific mortality using the Cause of Death Ensemble model. Findings: For children aged 5-9 years, all-cause mortality rates (per 100 000 population) were estimated to be 46.3 (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 45.1-47.5) in 1990 and 19.5 (18.1-20.9) in 2016, reflecting a 58.0% (54.7-61.1) decline. For children aged 10-14 years, all-cause mortality rates (per 100 000 population) were 37.9 (37.3-38.6) in 1990 and 20.1 (18.8-21.3) in 2016, reflecting a 47.1% (43.8-50.4) decline. In 2016, we estimated 10 740 deaths (95% UI 9970-11 542) in children aged 5-9 years and 10 279 deaths (9652-10 897) in those aged 10-14 years in the WHO European Region. Injuries (road injuries, drowning, and other injuries) caused 4163 deaths (3820-4540; 38.7% of total deaths) in children aged 5-9 years and 4468 deaths (4162-4812; 43.5% of total) in those aged 10-14 years in 2016. Neoplasms caused 2161 deaths (1872-2406; 20.1% of total deaths) in children aged 5-9 years and 1943 deaths (1749-2101; 18.9% of total deaths) in those aged 10-14 years in 2016. Notable differences existed in cause-specific mortality rates between the European subregions, from a two-times difference for leukaemia to a 20-times difference for lower respiratory infections between the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and EU15 (the 15 member states that had joined the European Union before May, 2004). Interpretation: Marked progress has been made in reducing the mortality burden in children aged 5-14 years over the past 26 years in the WHO European Region. More deaths could be prevented, especially in CIS countries, through intervention and prevention efforts focusing on the leading causes of death, which are road injuries, drowning, and lower respiratory infections. The findings of our study could be used as a baseline to assess the effect of implementation of programmes and policies on child mortality burden.

NOTCH1 mutation was present in 66% CD34+/CD38+ progenitor cells displaying an increased mutational burden compared to HSCs. Flow cytometric analysis revealed significantly higher NOTCH1 activation in CD34+/CD38- and CD34+/CD38+ cells from CLL patients, regardless NOTCH1 mutation compared to healthy donors.

The B-cell Lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) gene family encodes pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins that are key regulators of the apoptotic process. Overexpression of the pro-survival member BCL-2 is a well-established mechanism contributing to oncogenesis and chemoresistance in several cancers, including lymphoma and leukemia. Thus, BCL-2 has become an attractive target for therapeutic strategy in cancer, as demonstrated by the recent approval of ABT-199 (Venclexta) in relapsed or refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia with 17p deletion. Here, we describe a novel orally bioavailable BCL-2 selective and potent inhibitor called S55746 (also known as BCL201). S55746 occupies the hydrophobic groove of BCL-2. Its selectivity profile demonstrates no significant binding to MCL-1, BFL-1 (BCL2A1/A1) and poor affinity for BCL-XL. Accordingly, S55746 has no cytotoxic activity on BCL-XL-dependent cells, such as platelets. In a panel of hematological cell lines, S55746 induces hallmarks of apoptosis including externalization of phosphatidylserine, caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage. Ex vivo, S55746 induces apoptosis in the low nanomolar range in primary Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia and Mantle Cell Lymphoma patient samples. Finally, S55746 administered by oral route daily in mice demonstrated robust anti-tumor efficacy in two hematological xenograft models with no weight lost and no change in behavior. Taken together, these data demonstrate that S55746 is a novel, well-tolerated BH3-mimetic targeting selectively and potently the BCL-2 protein.","['Casara, Patrick', 'Davidson, James', 'Claperon, Audrey', 'Le Toumelin-Braizat, Gaetane', 'Vogler, Meike', 'Bruno, Alain', 'Chanrion, Maia', 'Lysiak-Auvity, Gaelle', 'Le Diguarher, Thierry', 'Starck, Jerome-Benoit', 'Chen, Ijen', 'Whitehead, Neil', 'Graham, Christopher', 'Matassova, Natalia', 'Dokurno, Pawel', 'Pedder, Christopher', 'Wang, Youzhen', 'Qiu, Shumei', 'Girard, Anne-Marie', 'Schneider, Emilie', 'Grave, Fabienne', 'Studeny, Aurelie', 'Guasconi, Ghislaine', 'Rocchetti, Francesca', 'Maiga, Sophie', 'Henlin, Jean-Michel', 'Colland, Frederic', 'Kraus-Berthier, Laurence', 'Le Gouill, Steven', 'Dyer, Martin J S', 'Hubbard, Roderick', 'Wood, Mike', 'Amiot, Martine', 'Cohen, Gerald M', 'Hickman, John A', 'Morris, Erick', 'Murray, James', 'Geneste, Olivier']","['Casara P', 'Davidson J', 'Claperon A', 'Le Toumelin-Braizat G', 'Vogler M', 'Bruno A', 'Chanrion M', 'Lysiak-Auvity G', 'Le Diguarher T', 'Starck JB', 'Chen I', 'Whitehead N', 'Graham C', 'Matassova N', 'Dokurno P', 'Pedder C', 'Wang Y', 'Qiu S', 'Girard AM', 'Schneider E', 'Grave F', 'Studeny A', 'Guasconi G', 'Rocchetti F', 'Maiga S', 'Henlin JM', 'Colland F', 'Kraus-Berthier L', 'Le Gouill S', 'Dyer MJS', 'Hubbard R', 'Wood M', 'Amiot M', 'Cohen GM', 'Hickman JA', 'Morris E', 'Murray J', 'Geneste O']","['Institut de Recherches Servier Discovery Chemistry Unit, Croissy Sur Seine, France.', 'Vernalis (R&D) Ltd., Cambridge, UK.', 'Institut de Recherches Servier Oncology R&D Unit, Croissy Sur Seine, France.', 'Institut de Recherches Servier Oncology R&D Unit, Croissy Sur Seine, France.', 'Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Pediatrics, Goethe-University Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institut de Recherches Internationales Servier, Oncology R&D Unit, Suresnes, France.', 'Institut de Recherches Servier Oncology R&D Unit, Croissy Sur Seine, France.', 'Institut de Recherches Servier Oncology R&D Unit, Croissy Sur Seine, France.', 'Institut de Recherches Servier Discovery Chemistry Unit, Croissy Sur Seine, France.', 'Institut de Recherches Servier Discovery Chemistry Unit, Croissy Sur Seine, France.', 'Vernalis (R&D) Ltd., Cambridge, UK.', 'Vernalis (R&D) Ltd., Cambridge, UK.', 'Vernalis (R&D) Ltd., Cambridge, UK.', 'Vernalis (R&D) Ltd., Cambridge, UK.', 'Vernalis (R&D) Ltd., Cambridge, UK.', 'Vernalis (R&D) Ltd., Cambridge, UK.', 'Novartis Institute of Biomedical Research, Oncology Drug Discovery, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Novartis Institute of Biomedical Research, Oncology Drug Discovery, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Institut de Recherches Servier Oncology R&D Unit, Croissy Sur Seine, France.', 'Institut de Recherches Servier Oncology R&D Unit, Croissy Sur Seine, France.', 'Institut de Recherches Servier Oncology R&D Unit, Croissy Sur Seine, France.', 'Institut de Recherches Servier Oncology R&D Unit, Croissy Sur Seine, France.', 'Institut de Recherches Servier Oncology R&D Unit, Croissy Sur Seine, France.', 'Institut de Recherches Servier Oncology R&D Unit, Croissy Sur Seine, France.', 'CRCINA, INSERM, CNRS, Universite de Nantes, CHU de Nantes, Nantes, France.', 'Institut de Recherches Servier Discovery Chemistry Unit, Croissy Sur Seine, France.', 'Institut de Recherches Servier Oncology R&D Unit, Croissy Sur Seine, France.', 'Institut de Recherches Internationales Servier, Oncology R&D Unit, Suresnes, France.', 'CRCINA, INSERM, CNRS, Universite de Nantes, CHU de Nantes, Nantes, France.', 'Ernest and Helen Scott Haematological Research Institute, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.', 'Vernalis (R&D) Ltd., Cambridge, UK.', 'Vernalis (R&D) Ltd., Cambridge, UK.', 'CRCINA, INSERM, CNRS, Universite de Nantes, CHU de Nantes, Nantes, France.', 'Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK.', 'Institut de Recherches Servier Oncology R&D Unit, Croissy Sur Seine, France.', 'Novartis Institute of Biomedical Research, Oncology Drug Discovery, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Vernalis (R&D) Ltd., Cambridge, UK.', 'Institut de Recherches Servier Oncology R&D Unit, Croissy Sur Seine, France.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180413,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['BCL-2', 'BH3-mimetics', 'apoptosis', 'hematological malignancies', 'inhibitor']",2018/05/08 06:00,2018/05/08 06:01,['2018/05/08 06:00'],"['2017/09/12 00:00 [received]', '2018/02/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/08 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.24744 [doi]', '24744 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2018 Apr 13;9(28):20075-20088. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.24744. eCollection 2018 Apr 13.,,,['MC_U132670597/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],PMC5929447,,,"['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST P Casara and JA Hickman are former employees of Institut de', 'Recherches Servier.

Aberrant expression of WDR5 has been observed in various types of human cancer, including prostate cancer, breast cancer and leukemia. However, the role of WDR5 expression and its clinical implications in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain largely unknown. The present study investigated the WDR5 expression pattern in HCC. It was demonstrated that the mRNA and protein levels of WDR5 were upregulated in HCC cancer tissues compared with normal adjacent tissues using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. Furthermore, the elevated WDR5 protein level was significantly associated with the histological grade (P=0.038), tumor size (P=0.023), tumor-node-metastasis stage (P=0.035) and reduced long-term survival time. Additionally, it was demonstrated through the shRNA-mediated knockdown of WDR5 in HCC cells in vitro that WDR5 expression promotes cell proliferation using an MTT assay. Taken together, the results suggested that WDR5 overexpression may have an oncogenic effect in HCC, and may be a promising biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of HCC.","['Cui, Zhoujun', 'Li, Hongbo', 'Liang, Feng', 'Mu, Cuiling', 'Mu, Yuhua', 'Zhang, Xuegong', 'Liu, Jundong']","['Cui Z', 'Li H', 'Liang F', 'Mu C', 'Mu Y', 'Zhang X', 'Liu J']","[""Department of General Surgery, People's Hospital of Rizhao, Rizhao, Shandong 276800, P.R.

It has been reported that Solanine has anti-inflammatory and antitumor properties. The present study aimed to investigate the antitumor effect of Solanine in Jurkat cells and demonstrate the molecular mechanism of antitumor activity of Solanine. A Cell Counting Kit-8 assay demonstrated that Solanine inhibited the proliferation of Jurkat cells in a dose-and time-dependent manner. Cell apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry. Flow cytometry revealed that Solanine induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner in Jurkat cells. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that Solanine modulated the mRNA levels of B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax). Additionally, Bcl-2 and Bax expression was measured using western blot analysis. Western blot analysis revealed a significant increase in the expression of Bax and decrease in the expression of Bcl-2. Solanine increased the chemosensitivity of Jurkat cells to Adriamycin. In summary, the present results indicated that the antitumor activity of Solanine was associated with inhibition of cell proliferation, induction of apoptosis and increasing cytotoxicity of Adriamycin. Therefore, Solanine may have potential as a novel agent for the treatment of acute lymphocytic leukemia.","['Yi, Ying-Jie', 'Jia, Xiu-Hong', 'Wang, Jian-Yong', 'Chen, Jie-Ru', 'Wang, Hong', 'Li, You-Jie']","['Yi YJ', 'Jia XH', 'Wang JY', 'Chen JR', 'Wang H', 'Li YJ']","['Department of Pediatrics, The Affiliated Hospital of Binzhou Medical University, Binzhou, Shandong 256603, P.R.

The 53-year-old male reported easily bruising for 5 months. Examination indicated a diagnosis of CMML. Chromosome analysis identified a 48, XY, +8, +21 karyotype, classifying the patient as high-risk, according to a clinical/molecular CPSS (CPSS-Mol) model. Gene sequencing detected a mutation in DNA methyltransferase 3alpha, which is relatively rarely identified in CMML and has recently been reported to have an independent prognostic impact on overall survival time. Partial remission was achieved with decitabine treatment, and hematologic improvement was observed subsequent to 2 cycles of treatment. However, a sudden transformation to AML led to fatality of the patient. This case suggests that decitabine may be an effective therapeutic for high-risk CMML; however, the response may be temporary, and the ultimate outcome may be extremely poor. Therefore, novel treatment strategies of CMML, including combination therapies with decitabine, or targeted drugs, including Janus kinase inhibitors or granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor monoclonal antibodies, require investigation.","['Liu, Huan', 'Cheng, Juan', 'Zhao, Long', 'Xu, Qian', 'Xue, Mingming', 'Zhang, Shuling', 'Liu, Bei']","['Liu H', 'Cheng J', 'Zhao L', 'Xu Q', 'Xue M', 'Zhang S', 'Liu B']","['The First Clinical Medical College, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, Gansu 730000, P.R.

However, the safety of MSCs applied in various types of hematologic malignancy has not been comprehensively explored. In the present study, the effects of human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs) on six representative hematologic malignancy cell lines were explored, including leukemia, multiple myeloma and lymphoma cells. Direct and indirect co-culture models were established, and cell proliferation was assessed by carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester staining. A cytometric bead array cytokine kit was used to quantify cytokines. The expression of interleukin (IL)-6 receptor elements on tumor cells was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and flow cytometry, and the effects of exogenous IL-6 on cell proliferation were determined using a Cell Counting kit-8 assay. The results demonstrated that hUC-MSCs inhibited the proliferation of most of the cell lines examined (THP-1, HL-60, K562 and RPMI-8226), but promoted the proliferation of Raji cells. In addition, hUC-MSCs secreted abundant IL-6, promoted the secretion of IL-10 by RPMI-8226 and Raji cells, and inhibited the secretion of tumor necrosis factor-alpha by THP-1 cells. These data indicate a varied effect of hUC-MSCs on various types of hematologic malignancy, including distinct mechanisms of cell-to-cell contact and cytokines. Researchers applying hUC-MSCs in lymphoma should be aware of a potential tumor growth-promoting effect.","['Li, Qian', 'Pang, Yilin', 'Liu, Tingting', 'Tang, Yongyong', 'Xie, Jing', 'Zhang, Bin', 'Chen, Hu']","['Li Q', 'Pang Y', 'Liu T', 'Tang Y', 'Xie J', 'Zhang B', 'Chen H']","['Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Affiliated Hospital of Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Beijing 100071, P.R.

Blue light, or light with wavelengths of 400-480 nm, transmits high levels of energy. The aim of the present study was to determine the pro-apoptotic effects of blue light (wavelength, 456 nm; radiation power, 0.25 mW/cm(2)) and the underlying mechanisms in a human promyelocytic leukemia cell line (HL60). Blue light reduced the viability and enhanced the mortality of HL60 cells in a time-dependent manner. Exposure to blue light for 24 h caused depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential and the overproduction of reactive oxygen species in HL60 cells. In a nude mouse model, 9-day exposure to blue light markedly suppressed the growth of HL60-xenografted tumors; however, it had no effect on hepatic and renal tissues. In addition, blue light abrogated the expression of B-cell lymphoma (Bcl)-2 and Bcl extra-long, while enhancing the levels of Bcl-2-associated X protein, cytochrome c, and cleaved caspases-3 and -9 in tumor tissues. The results suggested that the pro-apoptotic effects of blue light in human promyelocytic leukemia cells may be associated with the mitochondrial apoptosis signaling pathway.","['Zhuang, Jianjian', 'Liu, Yange', 'Yuan, Qingxia', 'Liu, Junsong', 'Liu, Yan', 'Li, Hongdong', 'Wang, Di']","['Zhuang J', 'Liu Y', 'Yuan Q', 'Liu J', 'Liu Y', 'Li H', 'Wang D']","['State Key Laboratory of Superhard Materials, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin 130012, P.R.

This maturation pathway is characterized by the acquisition of phenotypic markers, CD2, CD57, and NKG2C, and effector functions-a process regulated by Tim-3 and orchestrated by a complex network of transcriptional factors, involving T-bet, Eomes, Zeb2, promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein, and Foxo3. Here, we show that persistent immune activation during chronic viral co-infections (HCMV, hepatitis C virus, and HIV) interferes with the functional phenotype of NK cells by modulating the Tim-3 pathway; a decrease in Tim-3 expression combined with the acquisition of inhibitory receptors skewed NK cells toward an exhausted and cytotoxic phenotype in an inflammatory environment during chronic HIV infection. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying NK cell differentiation could aid the identification of new immunological targets for checkpoint blockade therapies in a manner that is relevant to chronic infection and cancer.","['Kared, Hassen', 'Martelli, Serena', 'Tan, Shu Wen', 'Simoni, Yannick', 'Chong, Meng Li', 'Yap, Siew Hwei', 'Newell, Evan W', 'Pender, Sylvia L F', 'Kamarulzaman, Adeeba', 'Rajasuriar, Reena', 'Larbi, Anis']","['Kared H', 'Martelli S', 'Tan SW', 'Simoni Y', 'Chong ML', 'Yap SH', 'Newell EW', 'Pender SLF', 'Kamarulzaman A', 'Rajasuriar R', 'Larbi A']","['Singapore Immunology Network (SIgN), Aging and Immunity Program, Agency for Science Technology and Research (ASTAR), Singapore, Singapore.', 'Singapore Immunology Network (SIgN), Aging and Immunity Program, Agency for Science Technology and Research (ASTAR), Singapore, Singapore.', 'Academic Unit of Clinical and Experimental Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'Singapore Immunology Network (SIgN), Aging and Immunity Program, Agency for Science Technology and Research (ASTAR), Singapore, Singapore.', 'Singapore Immunology Network (SIgN), Aging and Immunity Program, Agency for Science Technology and Research (ASTAR), Singapore, Singapore.', 'Centre of Excellence for Research in AIDS (CERiA), University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Centre of Excellence for Research in AIDS (CERiA), University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Singapore Immunology Network (SIgN), Aging and Immunity Program, Agency for Science Technology and Research (ASTAR), Singapore, Singapore.', 'Academic Unit of Clinical and Experimental Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'Centre of Excellence for Research in AIDS (CERiA), University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Centre of Excellence for Research in AIDS (CERiA), University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'The Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Singapore Immunology Network (SIgN), Aging and Immunity Program, Agency for Science Technology and Research (ASTAR), Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Microbiology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'School of Biological Sciences, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180420,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,"['0 (CD57 Antigens)', '0 (HAVCR2 protein, human)', '0 (Hepatitis A Virus Cellular Receptor 2)', '0 (KLRC2 protein, human)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily C)']",IM,"['CD57 Antigens/immunology', 'Coinfection/*immunology', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/*immunology', 'HIV Infections/*immunology', 'Hepatitis A Virus Cellular Receptor 2/*immunology', 'Hepatitis C/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily C/immunology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*aging', '*cancer', '*checkpoint blockade', '*chronic infection', '*exhaustion', '*maturation', '*natural killer cells', '*senescence']",2018/05/08 06:00,2018/05/08 06:01,['2018/05/08 06:00'],"['2017/11/27 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/08 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2018.00686 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2018 Apr 20;9:686. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2018.00686. eCollection 2018.,,,,PMC5919961,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We sought to promote patient-focused drug development (PFDD) for AML by developing and piloting an instrument to prioritize the worries of patients with AML. Patients and methods: An innovative community-centered approach was used to engage expert and community stakeholders in the development, pretesting, pilot testing, and dissemination of a novel best-worst scaling instrument. Patient worries were identified through individual interviews (n=15) and group calls. The instrument was developed through rigorous pretesting (n=13) and then piloted among patients and caregivers engaged in this study (n=25). Priorities were assessed using best-worst scores (spanning from +1 to -1) representing the relative number of times that items were endorsed as the most and the least worrying. All findings were presented at a PFDD meeting at the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that was attended by >80 stakeholders. Results: The final instrument included 13 worries spanning issues such as decision making, treatment delivery, physical impacts, and psychosocial effects. Patients and caregivers most prioritized worries about dying from their disease (best minus worst [BW] score=0.73), long-term side effects (BW=0.28), and time in hospital (BW=0.25). Conclusion: Community-centered approaches are valuable in designing and executing PFDD meetings and associated quantitative surveys to document the experience of patients. Expert and community stakeholders welcomed the opportunity to share their experiences with the FDA and strongly endorsed implementing this survey nationally.","['Bridges, John Fp', 'Oakes, Allison H', 'Reinhart, Crystal A', 'Voyard, Ernest', ""O'Donoghue, Bernadette""]","['Bridges JF', 'Oakes AH', 'Reinhart CA', 'Voyard E', ""O'Donoghue B""]","['Department of Health Policy and Management, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Department of Health Policy and Management, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Center for Prevention Research and Development, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign, IL, USA.', 'The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, Rye Brook, NY, USA.', 'The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, Rye Brook, NY, USA.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180427,New Zealand,Patient Prefer Adherence,Patient preference and adherence,101475748,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'best-worst scaling', 'community engagement', 'patient-focused drug development', 'stated-preference']",2018/05/08 06:00,2018/05/08 06:01,['2018/05/08 06:00'],"['2018/05/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/08 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/PPA.S151752 [doi]', 'ppa-12-647 [pii]']",epublish,Patient Prefer Adherence. 2018 Apr 27;12:647-655. doi: 10.2147/PPA.S151752. eCollection 2018.,,,['T32 HS000029/HS/AHRQ HHS/United States'],PMC5927351,,,"[""Disclosure Ernest Voyard and Bernadette O'Donoghue are employees of the LLS.

First, analysis by CE-MS was optimized using a standard mixture of hsa-miR-21-5p (miR-21-5p) and hsa-let-7g-5p (let-7g-5p). For SPE-CE-MS, a commercial silicon carbide (SiC) resin was used to prepare the microcartridges. Under the optimized conditions with standards, the microcartridge lifetime (>25 analyses) and repeatability (2.8% RSD for the migration times; 4.4 and 6.4% RSD for the miR-21-5p and let-7g-5p peak areas, respectively) were good, the method was linear between 25 and 100 nmol.L(-1), and the limit of detection (LOD) was around 10 nmol.L(-1) (50 times lower than by CE-MS). In order to analyze human serum samples, an off-line sample pretreatment based on phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (PCA) extraction was necessary prior to SPE-CE-MS. The potential of the SPE-CE-MS method to screen for B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) was demonstrated by an analysis of serum samples from healthy controls and patients.

In this study, we showed that c-Abl, but not Arg tyrosine kinase, associated with Runx1 both in cultured cells and in vitro. c-Abl-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation in the Runx1 transcription inhibition domain negatively regulated the transcriptional activity of Runx1 and inhibited Runx1-mediated MK maturation. Consistent with these findings, increased numbers of MKs were detected in the spleens and bone marrow of abl gene conditional knockout mice.

A series of 48 compounds were designed and synthesized by structural optimization on compound 1. All the compounds have been evaluated for their BRD4 inhibitory activities. The results showed that compounds 23, 24, 28 and 44 are the most potential ones with the IC50 values of 1.02muM, 1.43muM, 1.55muM and 3.02muM, respectively. According to their co-crystal structures in complex with BRD4_BD1 and the protein thermal shift assays, the binding modes were revealed that the additional indirect hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions make such four compounds more active than 1 against BRD4. Furthermore, compounds 1, 23 and 44 were chosen to evaluate for their antiproliferative activities on the MLL-AF4-expression acute leukemia cell line (MV4-11), other cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231, A549, 22Rv1) and the non-cancer cell lines (HUV-EC-C, MRC5, RPTEC). The results showed that these compounds exhibited good and selective inhibitory activities against MV4-11cells with the IC50 values of 11.67muM, 5.55muM, and 11.54muM, respectively, and could act on the cell proliferation by blocking cell cycle at G1 phase. They could markedly down-regulate the expressions of the c-Myc, Bcl-2 and CDK6 oncogenes in MV4-11 in the qRT-PCR and western blot studies, which further demonstrated that compound 1 and its derivatives could serve as a promising therapeutic strategy for MLL leukemia by targeting BRD4_BD1 protein.","['Feng, Yuxin', 'Xiao, Senhao', 'Chen, Yantao', 'Jiang, Hao', 'Liu, Na', 'Luo, Cheng', 'Chen, Shijie', 'Chen, Hua']","['Feng Y', 'Xiao S', 'Chen Y', 'Jiang H', 'Liu N', 'Luo C', 'Chen S', 'Chen H']","['Key Laboratory of Chemical Biology of Hebei Province, College of Chemistry and Environmental Science, Hebei University, Baoding, 071002, China.', 'Drug Discovery and Design Center, State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of MateriaMedica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, 201203, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China; School of Life Science and Technology, Shanghai Tech University, Shanghai, 200031, China.', 'Drug Discovery and Design Center, State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of MateriaMedica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, 201203, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China.', 'Drug Discovery and Design Center, State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of MateriaMedica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, 201203, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Chemical Biology of Hebei Province, College of Chemistry and Environmental Science, Hebei University, Baoding, 071002, China.', 'Drug Discovery and Design Center, State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of MateriaMedica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, 201203, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China.', 'Drug Discovery and Design Center, State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of MateriaMedica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, 201203, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China.

METHODS: Between June 25, 2014, and June 3, 2015, we carried out a cross-sectional observational study at Moorfields Eye Hospital, London, UK, enrolling 45 children 2-16 years of age with MAC attending our clinics, and their parents. To assess FVA, VR-QoL, and HR-QoL we asked participants to complete three validated tools, the Cardiff Visual Ability Questionnaire for Children (CVAQC), the Impact of Vision Impairment for Children (IVI-C) instrument, and the PedsQL V 4.0. The main outcome measures were the FVA, VR-QoL, and HR-QoL scores, reported by children and parents. RESULTS: In children with MAC, FVA is moderately reduced, with a median CVAQC score of -1.4 (IQR, -2.4 to 0.4; range, -3.0 [higher FVA] to +2.8 [lower FVA]). VR-QoL and HR-QoL are greatly reduced, with an IVI-C median score of 63 (IQR, 52-66; normal VR-QoL, 96), a median self-reported PedsQL score of 77 (IQR, 71-90; normal HR-QoL, 100) and parental score of 79 (IQR, 61-93), and a family impact score of 81 (67-93). Psychosocial well-being scores are lower than physical well-being scores. Parents and children have a different perception of the impact of the condition on the child's HR-QoL. CONCLUSIONS: MAC has a significant impact on a child's FVA and QoL, similar to that described by children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and chronic systemic conditions. Children and families may benefit from psychosocial support.","['Dahlmann-Noor, Annegret', 'Tailor, Vijay', 'Abou-Rayyah, Yassir', 'Adams, Gillian', 'Brookes, John', 'Khaw, Peng T', 'Bunce, Catey', 'Papadopoulos, Maria']","['Dahlmann-Noor A', 'Tailor V', 'Abou-Rayyah Y', 'Adams G', 'Brookes J', 'Khaw PT', 'Bunce C', 'Papadopoulos M']","['National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre at Moorfields Eye Hospital and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, London, United Kingdom; Pediatric Service, Moorfields Eye Hospital, London, United Kingdom.

Ninety-five patients with C3G were tested for MIg of which 36 were positive. Their mean age at diagnosis was 60 years and among patient 50 years and older, 65.1% had a MIg. At presentation, median serum creatinine and proteinuria were 1.9 mg/dL and 3.0 g/24 hours. Hematuria was present in 32 (88.9%) patients. Twelve (34.3%) patients had low C3 levels. C3 nephritic factor was detected in 45.8% patients; pathogenic variants in complement protein genes were rare. Hematologic evaluation revealed monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance in 26 patients, multiple myeloma in five, smoldering multiple myeloma in two, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, lymphoma, or type I cryoglobulin each in one patient. After a median follow-up of 43.6 months, the median serum creatinine and proteinuria were 1.4 mg/dL and 0.8g/24 hours. Nine patients developed ESRD. Sixteen patients received MIg-targeted treatment, 17 patients received non-targeted treatment while three patients were managed conservatively. Of the 16 patients receiving MIg-targeted treatment, ten achieved complete/very good/partial hematologic response. Of these, seven achieved a complete/partial/stable renal response. Five patients receiving targeted treatment did not achieve hematologic response, none had a renal response. Patients receiving targeted treatment were more likely to have multiple myeloma/smoldering multiple myeloma.

Pleomorphic malignant mesothelioma and myelocytoma, which were thought to be induced by ALV subgroup J (ALV-J) infection, were identified in a 432-day-old broiler breeder. The bird showed no clinical signs; however, at necropsy examination there were multiple nodules in the alimentary tract. Microscopical analysis showed that these consisted of pleomorphic cells and myelocyte-like cells. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the pleomorphic cells were atypical and expressed cytokeratin, vimentin, c-kit, calretinin and ALV. The myelocyte-like cells were also positive for ALV. Retroviral type C particles were observed by electron microscopy. ALV-E and ALV-J nucleotide sequences were detected in DNA extracted from formalin-fixed and paraffin wax-embedded small intestinal tissue. Based on these results, the tumours were diagnosed as pleomorphic malignant mesothelioma and myelocytoma and were thought to have been induced by ALV-J infection.

Eligible were patients aged >18 years allotransplanted for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) after prior exposure to ibrutinib who were registered with the EBMT registry. Seventy patients (CLL 48, MCL 22) were included. At the time of alloHCT, 73% of the patients were ibrutinib responsive. All patients except one engrafted, and acute GVHD grade 2-4 (3-4) was observed in 49% (12%) of 68 evaluable patients. The cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD was 54% 1 year after transplant. In the CLL group, 12-month non-relapse mortality, relapse incidence (RI), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were 10, 30, 60, and 72%, respectively, and in the MCL group 5, 19, 76, and 86%, respectively. Pre-transplant ibrutinib failure and poor performance status predicted inferior RI, PFS and OS in the CLL group. In conclusion, ibrutinib does not affect the safety of a subsequent alloHCT.

Deregulated STAT3 and STAT5 signaling promotes cancer cell proliferation and survival in conjunction with other core cancer pathways. Nuclear phosphorylated STAT3 and STAT5 regulate cell-type-specific transcription profiles via binding to promoter elements and exert more complex functions involving interaction with various transcriptional coactivators or corepressors and chromatin remodeling proteins. The JAK-STAT pathway can rapidly reshape the chromatin landscape upon cytokine, hormone, or growth factor stimulation and unphosphorylated STAT proteins also appear to be functional with respect to regulating chromatin accessibility. Notably, cancer genome landscape studies have implicated mutations in various epigenetic modifiers as well as the JAK-STAT pathway as underlying causes of many cancers, particularly acute leukemia and lymphomas. However, it is incompletely understood how mutations within these pathways can interact and synergize to promote cancer. We summarize the current knowledge of oncogenic STAT3 and STAT5 functions downstream of cytokine signaling and provide details on prerequisites for DNA binding and gene transcription. We also discuss key interactions of STAT3 and STAT5 with chromatin remodeling factors such as DNA methyltransferases, histone modifiers, cofactors, corepressors, and other transcription factors.","['Wingelhofer, Bettina', 'Neubauer, Heidi A', 'Valent, Peter', 'Han, Xiaonan', 'Constantinescu, Stefan N', 'Gunning, Patrick T', 'Muller, Mathias', 'Moriggl, Richard']","['Wingelhofer B', 'Neubauer HA', 'Valent P', 'Han X', 'Constantinescu SN', 'Gunning PT', 'Muller M', 'Moriggl R']","['Institute of Animal Breeding and Genetics, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Cancer Research, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Animal Breeding and Genetics, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Cancer Research, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Ludwig Boltzmann-Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', ""Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), Cincinnati, OH, USA."", 'Key Laboratory of Human Disease Comparative Medicine, the Ministry of Health, Institute of Laboratory Animal Sciences (ILAS), Chinese Academy of Medical Science (CAMS) and Peking Union Medical College (PUMC), Beijing, China.', 'Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research Brussels, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Universite Catholique de Louvain and de Duve Institute, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Department of Chemical & Physical Sciences, University of Toronto Mississauga, Mississauga, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Institute of Animal Breeding and Genetics, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Animal Breeding and Genetics, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Vienna, Austria. richard.moriggl@vetmeduni.ac.at.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Cancer Research, Vienna, Austria. richard.moriggl@vetmeduni.ac.at.', 'Medical University Vienna, Vienna, Austria. richard.moriggl@vetmeduni.ac.at.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8599-2699', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0918-9463']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20180327,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)']",IM,"['*Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription, Genetic']",,,2018/05/08 06:00,2019/05/22 06:00,['2018/05/06 06:00'],"['2018/02/08 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/03/07 00:00 [revised]', '2018/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/22 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-018-0117-x [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-018-0117-x [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2018 Aug;32(8):1713-1726. doi: 10.1038/s41375-018-0117-x.

Patient information, treatment, and response were collected. Prognostic factors influencing the complete remission (CR) rate and event-free survival (EFS) were analyzed. The analytic set included 578 salvage treatment attempts among 325 patients. CR rates (mean +/- SE) were 51 +/- 4% for patients with bone marrow R/R B-ALL who underwent a second salvage attempt, 37 +/- 6% for a third attempt, and 31 +/- 6% for the fourth through eighth attempts combined. For patients achieving a CR after their second, third, and fourth through eighth attempts, the 2 year EFS was 41 +/- 6%, 13 +/- 7%, and 27 +/- 13% respectively. Our results showed slight improvement when compared to previous studies. This is the largest and most recent study to date that evaluates the outcome of this patient population.

Although many cellular factors involved in retroelement silencing have been identified, the complete molecular mechanism remains elusive. In this study, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR screen to advance our understanding of retroelement silencing in mESCs. The Moloney murine leukemia virus (MLV)-based retroviral vector MSCV-GFP, which is repressed by the SETDB1/TRIM28 pathway in mESCs, was used as a reporter provirus, and we identified more than 80 genes involved in this process. In particular, ATF7IP and the BAF complex components are linked with the repression of most of the SETDB1 targets. We characterized two factors, MORC2A and RESF1, of which RESF1 is a novel molecule in retroelement silencing. Although both factors are recruited to repress provirus, their roles in repression are different. MORC2A appears to function dependent on repressive epigenetic modifications, while RESF1 regulates repressive epigenetic modifications associated with SETDB1. Our genome-wide CRISPR screen cataloged genes which function at different levels in silencing of SETDB1-target retroelements and provides a useful resource for further molecular studies.","['Fukuda, Kei', 'Okuda, Akihiko', 'Yusa, Kosuke', 'Shinkai, Yoichi']","['Fukuda K', 'Okuda A', 'Yusa K', 'Shinkai Y']","['Cellular Memory Laboratory, Cluster for Pioneering Research, RIKEN, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, Japan.', 'Division of Developmental Biology, Research Center for Genomic Medicine, Saitama Medical University, 1397-1 Yamane Hidaka Saitama 350-1241, Japan.', 'Wellcome Sanger Institute, Hinxton, Cambridge, CB10 1SA, United Kingdom.', 'Cellular Memory Laboratory, Cluster for Pioneering Research, RIKEN, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, Japan.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180504,United States,Genome Res,Genome research,9518021,"['0 (MORC2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Resf1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Retroelements)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (SETDB1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats/genetics', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Silencing', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells/virology', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', 'Retroelements/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",,,2018/05/08 06:00,2018/10/10 06:00,['2018/05/06 06:00'],"['2017/07/07 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/10 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['gr.227280.117 [pii]', '10.1101/gr.227280.117 [doi]']",ppublish,Genome Res. 2018 Jun;28(6):846-858. doi: 10.1101/gr.227280.117.

Hypomethylating agents (HMAs) are active in CMML, but analyses of small series failed to identify mutations predicting response or survival. We analyzed a retrospective multi-center cohort of 174 CMML patients treated with a median of 7cycles of azacitidine (n=68) or decitabine (n=106). Sequencing data before treatment initiation were available for all patients, from Sanger (n=68) or next generation (n=106) sequencing.

Hypomethylating agents (HMA) such as azacitidine (AZA) and decitabine (DEC) reduce DNA hypermethylation by incorporation into DNA and were successfully introduced into the clinic for the treatment of myeloid neoplasias. METHODS: Here, we investigated whether HMA induce comparable biological effects in MLL-positive BCP-ALL. Further, efficacy of HMA and concomitant application of cytostatic drugs (cytarabine and doxorubicin) were evaluated on established SEM and RS4;11 cell lines. In addition, promising approaches were studied on BCP-ALL cell line- and patient-derived xenograft models. RESULTS: In general, DEC effects were stronger compared to AZA on MLL-positive BCP-ALL cells. DEC significantly reduced proliferation by induction of cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase and apoptosis. Most sensitive to HMA were SEM cells which are characterized by a fast cell doubling time. The combination of low-dose HMA and conventional cytostatic agents revealed a heterogeneous response pattern. The strongest antiproliferative effects were observed when ALL cells were simultaneously exposed to HMA and cytostatic drugs. Most potent synergistic effects of HMA were induced with cytarabine. Finally, the therapeutic potential of DEC was evaluated on BCP-ALL xenograft models. DEC significantly delayed leukemic proliferation in xenograft models as demonstrated longitudinally by non-invasive bioluminescence as well as (18)F-FDG-PET/CT imaging. Unexpectedly, in vivo concomitant application of DEC and cytarabine did not enhance the antiproliferative effect compared to DEC monotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Our data reveal that DEC is active in MLL-positive BCP-ALL and warrant clinical evaluation.","['Roolf, C', 'Richter, A', 'Konkolefski, C', 'Knuebel, G', 'Sekora, A', 'Krohn, S', 'Stenzel, J', 'Krause, B J', 'Vollmar, B', 'Murua Escobar, H', 'Junghanss, C']","['Roolf C', 'Richter A', 'Konkolefski C', 'Knuebel G', 'Sekora A', 'Krohn S', 'Stenzel J', 'Krause BJ', 'Vollmar B', 'Murua Escobar H', 'Junghanss C']","['Department of Medicine, Clinic III - Hematology, Oncology, Palliative Medicine, Rostock University Medical Center, Ernst-Heydemann-Str. 6, 18057, Rostock, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, Clinic III - Hematology, Oncology, Palliative Medicine, Rostock University Medical Center, Ernst-Heydemann-Str. 6, 18057, Rostock, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, Clinic III - Hematology, Oncology, Palliative Medicine, Rostock University Medical Center, Ernst-Heydemann-Str. 6, 18057, Rostock, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, Clinic III - Hematology, Oncology, Palliative Medicine, Rostock University Medical Center, Ernst-Heydemann-Str. 6, 18057, Rostock, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, Clinic III - Hematology, Oncology, Palliative Medicine, Rostock University Medical Center, Ernst-Heydemann-Str. 6, 18057, Rostock, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, Clinic III - Hematology, Oncology, Palliative Medicine, Rostock University Medical Center, Ernst-Heydemann-Str. 6, 18057, Rostock, Germany.', 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, Rostock University Medical Center, University of Rostock, Gertrudenplatz 1, 18057, Rostock, Germany.', 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, Rostock University Medical Center, University of Rostock, Gertrudenplatz 1, 18057, Rostock, Germany.', 'Institute of Experimental Surgery, Rostock University Medical Center, University of Rostock, Schillingallee 69a, 18057, Rostock, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, Clinic III - Hematology, Oncology, Palliative Medicine, Rostock University Medical Center, Ernst-Heydemann-Str. 6, 18057, Rostock, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, Clinic III - Hematology, Oncology, Palliative Medicine, Rostock University Medical Center, Ernst-Heydemann-Str. 6, 18057, Rostock, Germany. christian.junghanss@med.uni-rostock.de.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180504,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Decitabine/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*Bioluminescence', '*In vivo imaging', '*PET/CT', '*Patient-derived xenograft model']",2018/05/08 06:00,2019/10/28 06:00,['2018/05/06 06:00'],"['2018/03/02 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13045-018-0607-3 [doi]', '10.1186/s13045-018-0607-3 [pii]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2018 May 4;11(1):62. doi: 10.1186/s13045-018-0607-3.,,,,PMC5936021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current clinical study is focused on the determination of efficacy and tolerability of curcumin and vitamin D3 combination in patients with early-stage chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). To support this work, an LC-MS/MS method has been developed for simultaneous determination of curcumin and its metabolites, curcumin glucuronide (COG) and curcumin sulfate (COS), in human plasma using curcumin-d6 as an internal standard for curcumin and BPAG-d6 as an internal standard for COG and COS. In this method, plasma samples were prepared by methanol protein precipitation, and the analytes were separated on a Waters XTerra((R)) MS C18 column (2.1mmx50mm, 3.5mum) using gradient elution with methanol and 10.0mM ammonium formate (pH 3.0) at a flow rate of 0.250mLmin(-1). Quantitation of curcumin, COG, and COS was carried out by tandem mass spectrometry using negative electrospray ionization in multiple-reaction-monitoring (MRM) mode. The linear calibration range for the method was 2.50-500ngmL(-1) for curcumin, COG, and COS.

Here, our transcriptome and DNA methylome analyses revealed that Hoxb cluster and retinoid signaling genes are predominantly enriched in LT-HSCs, and this coordinate regulation of Hoxb expression is mediated by a retinoid-dependent cis-regulatory element, distal element RARE (DERARE). Deletion of the DERARE reduced Hoxb expression, resulting in changes to many downstream signaling pathways (e.g., non-canonical Wnt signaling) and loss of HSC self-renewal and reconstitution capacity. DNA methyltransferases mediate DNA methylation on the DERARE, leading to reduced Hoxb cluster expression. Acute myeloid leukemia patients with DNMT3A mutations exhibit DERARE hypomethylation, elevated HOXB expression, and adverse outcomes. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated specific DNA methylation at DERARE attenuated HOXB expression and alleviated leukemogenesis. Collectively, these findings demonstrate pivotal roles for retinoid signaling and the DERARE in maintaining HSCs and preventing leukemogenesis by coordinate regulation of Hoxb genes.","['Qian, Pengxu', 'De Kumar, Bony', 'He, Xi C', 'Nolte, Christof', 'Gogol, Madelaine', 'Ahn, Youngwook', 'Chen, Shiyuan', 'Li, Zhenrui', 'Xu, Hanzhang', 'Perry, John M', 'Hu, Deqing', 'Tao, Fang', 'Zhao, Meng', 'Han, Yingli', 'Hall, Kate', 'Peak, Allison', 'Paulson, Ariel', 'Zhao, Chongbei', 'Venkatraman, Aparna', 'Box, Andrew', 'Perera, Anoja', 'Haug, Jeffrey S', 'Parmely, Tari', 'Li, Hua', 'Krumlauf, Robb', 'Li, Linheng']","['Qian P', 'De Kumar B', 'He XC', 'Nolte C', 'Gogol M', 'Ahn Y', 'Chen S', 'Li Z', 'Xu H', 'Perry JM', 'Hu D', 'Tao F', 'Zhao M', 'Han Y', 'Hall K', 'Peak A', 'Paulson A', 'Zhao C', 'Venkatraman A', 'Box A', 'Perera A', 'Haug JS', 'Parmely T', 'Li H', 'Krumlauf R', 'Li L']","['Stowers Institute for Medical Research, Kansas City, MO 64110, USA.', 'Stowers Institute for Medical Research, Kansas City, MO 64110, USA.', 'Stowers Institute for Medical Research, Kansas City, MO 64110, USA.', 'Stowers Institute for Medical Research, Kansas City, MO 64110, USA.', 'Stowers Institute for Medical Research, Kansas City, MO 64110, USA.', 'Stowers Institute for Medical Research, Kansas City, MO 64110, USA.', 'Stowers Institute for Medical Research, Kansas City, MO 64110, USA.', 'Stowers Institute for Medical Research, Kansas City, MO 64110, USA; Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS 66160, USA.', 'Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of the Chinese Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'Stowers Institute for Medical Research, Kansas City, MO 64110, USA.', 'Stowers Institute for Medical Research, Kansas City, MO 64110, USA; Tianjin Medical University School of Basic Medicine, Tian Jin 300070, China.', 'Stowers Institute for Medical Research, Kansas City, MO 64110, USA; Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS 66160, USA.', 'Key Laboratory of Stem Cells and Tissue Engineering, Sun Yat-Sen University, Ministry of Education, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510080, China.', 'Stowers Institute for Medical Research, Kansas City, MO 64110, USA.', 'Stowers Institute for Medical Research, Kansas City, MO 64110, USA.', 'Stowers Institute for Medical Research, Kansas City, MO 64110, USA.', 'Stowers Institute for Medical Research, Kansas City, MO 64110, USA.', 'Stowers Institute for Medical Research, Kansas City, MO 64110, USA.', 'Stowers Institute for Medical Research, Kansas City, MO 64110, USA.', 'Stowers Institute for Medical Research, Kansas City, MO 64110, USA.', 'Stowers Institute for Medical Research, Kansas City, MO 64110, USA.', 'Stowers Institute for Medical Research, Kansas City, MO 64110, USA.', 'Stowers Institute for Medical Research, Kansas City, MO 64110, USA.', 'Stowers Institute for Medical Research, Kansas City, MO 64110, USA.', 'Stowers Institute for Medical Research, Kansas City, MO 64110, USA; Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS 66160, USA.

Case fatality rates (CFR) may fluctuate over time, depending on host pathogen interactions as well as on treatment and quality of patient care. We conducted a systematic review and metaanalysis of current - i.e. 2008-revised EORTC-MSG criteria era - incidence and case fatality rates (CFR) of IA in patients with haematological malignancy. METHODS: A systematic search according to PRISMA guidelines was performed to identify all literature reporting populations with a haematological malignancy and the incidence of IA, defined according to the EORTC/MSG 2008 criteria. Pooled cumulative incidences and CFR within 100 days were estimated using a random effects model for predefined patient populations and stratified by use of prophylaxis. RESULTS: The systematic literature search yielded 1285 publications of which n=49 met the inclusion criteria. Overall, 16.815 patients were involved of which 1056 (6.3%) developed IA. IA risk ranged from 4% (during remission-induction, with prophylaxis) to 11% (during remission-induction, without prophylaxis). Antifungal prophylaxis was associated with a lower rate of IA, especially in the pre-HSCT population. The pooled CFR within 100 days was 29% (95% CI: 20-38%). DISCUSSION: This study confirms that IA is a relevant threat in the treatment of haematological cancer despite the universal use of antifungal prophylaxis. These outcomes inform scientists and other stakeholders about the current burden of IA and may be used to direct, implement and improve antifungal stewardship programs.","['van de Peppel, R J', 'Visser, L G', 'Dekkers, O M', 'de Boer, M G J']","['van de Peppel RJ', 'Visser LG', 'Dekkers OM', 'de Boer MGJ']","['Department of Infectious Diseases, Leiden University Medical Center, The Netherlands.

However, significant success in the treatment of leukemia and lymphoma with T-cells using native receptors or redirected with chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) has not been recapitulated in the treatment of solid tumors. This lack of success is likely related to the paucity of costimulatory and cytokine signaling available in solid tumors, in addition to a range of inhibitory mechanisms. AREAS COVERED: We summarize the latest developments in engineered T-cell immunotherapy, describe the limitations of these approaches in treating solid tumors, and finally highlight several strategies that may be useful in mediating solid tumor responses in the future, while also ensuring safety of engineered cells. EXPERT OPINION: CAR-T therapies require further engineering to achieve their potential against solid tumors. Facilitating cytokine signaling in CAR T-cells appears to be essential in achieving better responses. However, the engineering of T-cells with potentially unchecked proliferation and potency raises the question of whether the simultaneous combination of enhancements will prove safe, necessitating continued advancements in regulating CAR-T activity at the tumor site and methods to safely switch off these engineered cells.","['Shum, Thomas', 'Kruse, Robert L', 'Rooney, Cliona M']","['Shum T', 'Kruse RL', 'Rooney CM']","[""a Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Texas Children's Hospital , Houston Methodist Hospital, and Baylor College of Medicine , Houston , Texas , USA."", 'b Medical Scientist Training Program , Baylor College of Medicine , Houston , Texas , USA.', 'c Interdepartmental Program in Translational Biology and Molecular Medicine , Baylor College of Medicine , Houston , Texas , USA.', ""a Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Texas Children's Hospital , Houston Methodist Hospital, and Baylor College of Medicine , Houston , Texas , USA."", 'b Medical Scientist Training Program , Baylor College of Medicine , Houston , Texas , USA.', 'c Interdepartmental Program in Translational Biology and Molecular Medicine , Baylor College of Medicine , Houston , Texas , USA.', ""a Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Texas Children's Hospital , Houston Methodist Hospital, and Baylor College of Medicine , Houston , Texas , USA."", 'c Interdepartmental Program in Translational Biology and Molecular Medicine , Baylor College of Medicine , Houston , Texas , USA.', 'd Department of Pediatrics , Baylor College of Medicine , Houston , Texas , USA.', ""e Texas Children's Cancer and Hematology Centers , Baylor College of Medicine , Houston , Texas , USA."", 'f Department of Pathology and Immunology , Baylor College of Medicine , Houston , Texas , USA.', 'g Department of Molecular Virology and Microbiology , Baylor College of Medicine , Houston , Texas , USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20180514,England,Expert Opin Biol Ther,Expert opinion on biological therapy,101125414,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Engineering/methods', 'Combined Modality Therapy/*methods', 'Cytokines/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/pathology/*therapy', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Chimeric Antigen/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Cancer', '*T cell', '*chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)', '*cytokine', '*immunotherapy', '*synthetic biology']",2018/05/05 06:00,2019/01/29 06:00,['2018/05/05 06:00'],"['2018/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/29 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/14712598.2018.1473368 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Biol Ther. 2018 Jun;18(6):653-664. doi: 10.1080/14712598.2018.1473368.

METHODS: One hundred and ninety-nine children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia were randomized to receive one of both agents at a dose of 5,000 U/m(2) during induction (eight doses) and 10,000 U/m(2) during the postinduction phase (only high-risk patients; standard- and medium-risk patients received pegaspargase). RESULTS: Median trough serum asparaginase activity levels were comparable between both groups; they ranged from 143 to 182 U/l during induction and were above the target value of 100 U/l. Complete asparagine depletion in serum was achieved in 97.9% of patients, with no significant differences between both groups. On day 33 (end of induction), only two (2%) evaluable patients in each group had measurable asparagine serum levels, and complete asparagine depletion in the cerebrospinal fluid was achieved in 98.8% and 93.6% of the patients with rASNase and Asparaginase medac, respectively. During induction, 2.1% and 5% of patients developed an allergic reaction to rASNase or Asparaginase medac, respectively. Approximately 41% of the patients in both groups had a clinical allergy or enzyme inactivation to the first dose of any asparaginase preparation in postinduction. A comparable proportion of patients in both groups developed anti-asparaginase antibodies (57%) during repeated administration of asparaginase.

Guidelines published by American Society of Clinical Oncology in 2012 recommend dosing chemotherapy using actual body weight. However, the guidelines do not provide guidance for patients with hematologic malignancies. The objective of this study was to evaluate outcomes in obese patients undergoing induction chemotherapy for acute leukemia versus nonobese patients using actual body weight dosing. This single center retrospective chart review from November 2012 to August 2016 evaluated newly diagnosed leukemia patients who received induction chemotherapy dosed on actual body weight. The primary outcome was rate of complete remission following induction chemotherapy between obese patients versus nonobese patients. Secondary outcomes included time to absolute neutrophil count and platelet recovery, incidence of febrile neutropenia, clinical or microbiological infections, early (0-15 days) and in-hospital mortality, and overall survival at six months. Obese patients had similar rates of complete remission versus nonobese patients with acute myeloid leukemia (60% vs. 61.9%; p = 0.86) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (87.5% vs. 92.8%; p = 0.31). Obese patients with acute myeloid leukemia were more likely to receive re-induction chemotherapy following 14-day bone marrow biopsy vs. nonobese patients (53.3% vs. 23.2%; p = 0.019). There were no significant differences in secondary outcomes in either group when comparing obese versus nonobese patients. Obese patients have similar rates of complete remission compared to nonobese patients following induction chemotherapy in acute leukemia. Continued research is needed to determine optimal dosing and long-term outcomes in this patient population.","['Dombrowski, Lauren', 'Mohassel, Leila']","['Dombrowski L', 'Mohassel L']","['1 University of Pittsburgh Medical Center-Altoona, Altoona, PA, USA.', '2 Inova Fairfax Hospital, Falls Church, VA, USA.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180504,England,J Oncol Pharm Pract,Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,9511372,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Body Weight', 'Female', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy/methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Obesity/*epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'body weight dosing', 'obesity', 'remission']",2018/05/05 06:00,2019/07/10 06:00,['2018/05/05 06:00'],"['2018/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/10 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1078155218772329 [doi]'],ppublish,J Oncol Pharm Pract. 2019 Jul;25(5):1058-1065. doi: 10.1177/1078155218772329.

Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n=64) were randomised into control (KN), LPS (KL), probiotic + LPS (KL-Pr), and sequential probiotic + LPS + probiotic (KPR-7L) groups. Microencapsulated L. plantarum IS-10506 (2.86x10(10) cfu/day) was administered via a gastric tube once daily for up to 7 days, and LPS (250 ng/kg body weight) was administered via a gastric tube on the first day of the experiment to all but the KN group. On day 3, 4, 6, and 7, four rats per group were sacrificed, and Lgr5, Bmi1, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and beta-catenin expression in the ileum was assessed by immunohistochemistry. LPS treatment reduced Lgr5 (P</=0.05) and Bmi1 (P=0.000) levels in intestinal epithelial cells, whereas probiotic treatment increased levels of Lgr5 (KPR-7L, P=0.008) and Bmi1 (KL-Pr, P=0.008; and KPR-7L, P=0.000). Lgr5 expression was upregulated in the KL-Pr group on day 3, 4, 6, and 7 (P=0.056). Additionally, ERK levels were elevated in Bmi1- and Lgr5-expressing cells in rats treated with probiotics (KL-Pr and KPR-7L), whereas beta-catenin levels were increased in Lgr5-expressing cells from KPR-7L rats and in Bmi1-expressing cells from KL-Pr and KPR-7L rats on day 3 and 4. These results demonstrated that the probiotic L. plantarum IS-10506 activated intestinal stem cells to counter inflammation and might be useful for maintaining intestinal health, especially when used as a prophylactic agent.","['Athiyyah, A F', 'Darma, A', 'Ranuh, R', 'Riawan, W', 'Endaryanto, A', 'Rantam, F A', 'Surono, I S', 'Sudarmo, S M']","['Athiyyah AF', 'Darma A', 'Ranuh R', 'Riawan W', 'Endaryanto A', 'Rantam FA', 'Surono IS', 'Sudarmo SM']","['1 Department of Child Health Dr. Soetomo Hospital Faculty of Medicine Airlangga University, Jl.

Unlike more common fusion genes generated via simple reciprocal chromosomal translocations, formation of the ETV6-ABL1 fusion gene requires 3 DNA breaks and usually results from an interchromosomal insertion. We report a child with ALL in which a single interchromosomal insertion led to the formation of ETV6-ABL1 and 2 novel fusion genes: AIF1L-ETV6 and ABL1-AIF1L. We demonstrate the prenatal origin of this complex chromosomal rearrangement, which apparently initiated the leukemogenic process, by successful backtracking of the ETV6-ABL1 fusion into the patient's archived neonatal blood. We cloned coding sequences of AIF1L-ETV6 and ABL1-AIF1L in-frame fusion transcripts from the patient's leukemic blasts and we show that the chimeric protein containing the DNA binding domain of ETV6 is expressed from the AIF1L-ETV6 transcript and localized in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of transfected HEK293T cells. Transcriptomic and genomic profiling of the diagnostic bone marrow sample revealed Ph-like gene expression signature and loss of the IKZF1 and CDKN2A/B genes, the typical genetic lesions accompanying ETV6-ABL1-positive ALL. The prenatal origin of the rearrangement confirms that ETV6-ABL1 is not sufficient to cause overt leukemia, even when combined with the 2 novel fusions. We did not find the AIF1L-ETV6 and ABL1-AIF1L fusions in other ETV6-ABL1-positive ALL. Nevertheless, functional studies would be needed to establish the biological role of AIF1L-ETV6 and ABL1-AIF1L and to determine whether they contribute to leukemogenesis and/or to the final leukemia phenotype.","['Lukes, Julius Jr', 'Potuckova, Eliska', 'Sramkova, Lucie', 'Stary, Jan', 'Starkova, Julia', 'Trka, Jan', 'Votava, Felix', 'Zuna, Jan', 'Zaliova, Marketa']","['Lukes J Jr', 'Potuckova E', 'Sramkova L', 'Stary J', 'Starkova J', 'Trka J', 'Votava F', 'Zuna J', 'Zaliova M']","['CLIP - Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'CLIP - Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'CLIP - Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'CLIP - Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'CLIP - Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Pediatrics, 3rd Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'CLIP - Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'CLIP - Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-1487-537X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2269-5849', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1639-7124']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180730,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (AIF1 protein, human)', '0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Microfilament Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins v-abl)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Calcium-Binding Proteins', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/blood/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Microfilament Proteins', 'Oncogene Proteins v-abl/blood/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*genetics/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets/blood/*genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/blood/*genetics', 'Transcriptome/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*ABL1', '*AIF1L', '*ETV6', '*ETV6-ABL1', '*acute lymphoblastic leukemia']",2018/05/05 06:00,2018/10/26 06:00,['2018/05/05 06:00'],"['2018/02/20 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/30 00:00 [revised]', '2018/04/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/26 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.6 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2018 Sep;57(9):471-477. doi: 10.1002/gcc.6.

Thoracic radiography is performed frequently in dogs with suspected hematopoietic neoplasia, and detecting a mediastinal mass often prioritizes lymphoma as the most likely diagnosis. However, we have observed a mediastinal mass in several dogs with acute myeloid leukemia and hypothesized that (1) the frequency of a mediastinal mass was higher and (2) the size of the mass was larger in dogs with acute myeloid leukemia compared to dogs with lymphoid neoplasms. In this analytical study (observational, retrospective, and cross-sectional), the sample population included 238 dogs with hematopoietic neoplasia. These dogs were divided into lymphoid (large cell lymphoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia) and myeloid groups based on standard phenotyping tests. A mediastinal mass was detected during thoracic radiography in 73/218 (33%) and nine of 20 (45%) dogs in the lymphoid and myeloid groups (P = 0.21), respectively. The median size ratio of mediastinal mass to cardiac silhouette was 0.20 and 0.23 in the lymphoid and myeloid groups (P = 0.96), respectively. Additionally, we observed normal thoracic radiographs in 111/218 (51%) dogs in the lymphoid group and nine of 20 (45%) dogs in the myeloid group.

However, prefocusing through sheath flow requires a complex and tedious peripheral system for multi-channel fluid control, hindering the integration of DEP separation systems with other microfluidic functionalities for comprehensive clinical and biological tasks. This paper presented a simplified sheathless cell separation approach that combines gravitational-sedimentation-based sheathless prefocusing and DEP separation methods. Through gravitational sedimentation in a tubing, which was inserted into the inlet of a microfluidic chip with an adjustable steering angle, the cells were focused into a stream at the upstream region of a microchannel prior to separation. Then, a DEP force was applied at the downstream region of the microchannel for the active separation of the cells. Through this combined strategy, the peripheral system for the sheath flow was no longer required, and thus the integration of cell separation system with additional microfluidic functionalities was facilitated. The proposed sheathless scheme focused the mixture of cells with different sizes and dielectric properties into a stream in a wide range of flow rates without changing the design of the microfluidic chip. The DEP method is a label-free approach that can continuously separate cells on the basis of the sizes or dielectric properties of the cells and thus capable of greatly flexible cell separation. The efficiency of the proposed approach was experimentally assessed according to its performance in the separation of human acute monocytic leukemia THP-1 cells from yeast cells with respect to different sizes and THP-1 cells from human acute myelomonocytic leukemia OCI-AML3 cells with respect to different dielectric properties. The experimental results revealed that the separation efficiency of the method can surpass 90% and thus effective in separating cells on the basis of either size or dielectric property.","['Luo, Tao', 'Fan, Lei', 'Zeng, Yixiao', 'Liu, Ya', 'Chen, Shuxun', 'Tan, Qiulin', 'Lam, Raymond H W', 'Sun, Dong']","['Luo T', 'Fan L', 'Zeng Y', 'Liu Y', 'Chen S', 'Tan Q', 'Lam RHW', 'Sun D']","['Department of Mechanical and Biomedical Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China. medsun@cityu.edu.hk.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Lab Chip,Lab on a chip,101128948,,IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Separation/instrumentation/*methods', 'Cell Survival', 'Electrophoresis/*methods', 'Equipment Design', 'Gravitation', 'Humans', 'Microfluidic Analytical Techniques/instrumentation/*methods', 'Particle Size', 'THP-1 Cells']",,,2018/05/05 06:00,2018/11/27 06:00,['2018/05/05 06:00'],"['2018/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/27 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1039/c8lc00173a [doi]'],ppublish,Lab Chip. 2018 May 29;18(11):1521-1532. doi: 10.1039/c8lc00173a.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A total of 154 patients with mediastinal and intra-abdominal lymphadenopathies were included in this retrospective study between February 2010 and March 2015. Malignancy was suspected in the patients as a result of imaging findings and EUS-FNAs were performed to confirm the diagnoses. EUS and EUS-FNA data, as well as hospital medical records, were reviewed. The accuracy of EUS-FNA was 90.8% for diagnosing malignancy and 85.6% for diagnosing benign lymphadenopathy. In combination with flow cytometry (FCM), the accuracy of EUS-FNA to determine lymphoma was 94.2%. Among the malignant lymphadenopathy cases, 80 were caused by metastasis, 19 by lymphoma and 1 by myeloid leukemia. In the 53 benign cases, EUS-FNA revealed a nonspecific inflammatory condition in 27 patients, tuberculosis in 21 patients and Castleman's disease in 5 patients. The factors revealed to be associated with malignant lymphadenopathy included the sex and age of patients, as well as the location and size of the enlarged lymph node. In particular, celiac axis lymphadenopathy was associated with malignancy (23.0% of cases of malignancy, vs. 3.8% of benign lymphadenopathy). EUS-FNA results additionally suggested that the malignant lymph nodes observed in celiac axis were more likely to result from lymphoma (42.1%; 8/19 cases) than metastasis (18.8%; 15/80 cases; P=0.039). By contrast, malignant lymph nodes observed in the mediastinum were more likely to be caused by metastasis (47.5%; 38/80 cases) than lymphoma (10.5%; 2/19 cases; P=0.004). The results of the present study suggested that EUS-FNA is accurate for differentiating between malignancy and benign lymphadenopathy. Therefore, EUS-FNA in combination with FCM analysis, as a minimally invasive and highly sensitive tool, should be routinely performed for the identification of lymphoma. Additionally, examining the enlarged celiac axis lymph nodes of elderly males, who exhibit an increased risk of malignancy, may be beneficial.","['Wang, Jinlin', 'Chen, Qian', 'Wu, Xiaoli', 'Wang, Yun', 'Hou, Wei', 'Cheng, Bin']","['Wang J', 'Chen Q', 'Wu X', 'Wang Y', 'Hou W', 'Cheng B']","['Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei 430030, P.R.

As a result, it is necessary to identify the molecules that impact T-cell development and control lymphoid-lineage malignancy. The present study utilized Jurkat T lymphoblastic cells as a well-established approach for the investigation into the function of the non-canonical alternative splice variant of Helios for the in vitro study of T-cell differentiation and leukemogenesis. In the present study, the Jurkat T-cell lines with stable overexpression of the wild-type (Helios-1) or the non-canonical short isoform (Helios-Delta326-1431), were established. RNA microarray, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and flow cytometry were used to assess changes in the gene expression profiles and to monitor the cell surface markers during T-cell differentiation. Multiple genes associated with T-cell differentiation and leukemogenesis were identified as being either activated or suppressed. In addition, the results indicated that the stable overexpression of the Helios isoforms stimulated the differentiation pathway of the T-lineage lymphoblastic cells. Therefore, these results suggest that full-length Helios-1 has a tumor suppressor-like and immunomodulatory role, in contrast to the oncogenic function of the non-canonical short isoform Helios-Delta326-1431.","['Li, Yinghui', 'Liu, Yanhua', 'Liu, Can', 'Liu, Fengyong', 'Dou, Daolei', 'Zheng, Wenjie', 'Liu, Wei', 'Liu, Feifei']","['Li Y', 'Liu Y', 'Liu C', 'Liu F', 'Dou D', 'Zheng W', 'Liu W', 'Liu F']","['Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, P.R.

The effects of DADS and Src inhibitors on the invasion and migration ability of HHDN was detected using Transwell migration and invasion chamber experiments. The experiments were divided into three groups: A control group (HL-60 cells), an empty vector group and a high expression group (HHDN cells). Western blot assays revealed that the expression of DJ-1 in HHDN was inhibited in a time-dependent manner following treatment with DADS for 24, 48 and 72 h. Following DADS treatment, the expression of phosphorylated Src (p-Src) and phosphorylated Fak (p-Fak) were significantly decreased in all groups compared with the untreated groups, however the expression level of Src, Fak and integrin did not change significantly. Western blot analysis results revealed that following treatment with DADS and Src inhibitor, the expression levels of p-Src and p-Fak significantly decreased in all three groups compared with untreated groups, whereas the expression levels of Src, Fak and integrin did not change significantly. The expression of DJ-1 in HHND was inhibited in time-dependent manner following treatment with DADS and Src inhibitor for 24, 48 and 72 h. Transwell migration and invasion assay results revealed that DADS and Src inhibitors may suppress migration and invasion in leukemic cells, and a combination of the two treatments may result in more efficient suppression.

The association of clinical characteristics of Chinese ET patients and additional sex combs like 1 (ASXL1) mutations in these patients has remained to be elucidated. In the present study, 72 newly diagnosed Chinese ET patients were enrolled to determine ASXL1 mutations. Mutations in ASXL1, Janus kinase (JAK)2, calreticulin (CALR) and myeloproliferative leukemia (MPL) genes were detected using Sanger sequencing, and data were statistically analyzed. The frequencies of ASXL1, JAK2 V617F, CALR and MPL W515 mutations in ET patients were 19.4% (14/72), 29.2% (21/72), 31.9% (23/72) and 0% (0/72), respectively. Of note, 28 ET patients (38.9%) were negative for JAK2, CALR and MPL mutations; these patients were classified as triple-negative (TN). The frequency of ASXL1 mutations in patients with JAK2 V617F, CALR and TN mutations was 23.8% (5/21), 21.7% (5/23) and 14.3% (4/28), respectively. ASXL1-mutant patients exhibited significant propensities for thrombotic events compared with the ASXL1 wild-type (wt) cohort (42.9 vs. 12.1%; P=0.021). In addition, JAK2 V617F-mutant patients had a higher mean age compared with CALR-mutant (64.76 vs. 52.96 years; P=0.008) or TN patients (64.76 vs. 51.14 years; P=0.002). Furthermore, more white blood cells in the peripheral blood (PB) were observed in JAK2 V617F-mutant patients compared with those in TN patients (12.40 vs. 8.20x10(9)/l; P=0.02). In addition, CALR-mutant patients exhibited more platelets (PLT) in PB than JAK2 V617F-mutant patients (787.91 vs. 562.17x10(9)/l; P=0.047). TN patients had a significantly lower incidence of clinical symptoms, including dizziness, palpitation and chest congestion compared with CALR- or JAK2 V617F-mutant patients (14.1 vs. 39.1%; P=0.043 and 14.1 vs. 38.1%; P=0.050). No significant difference in progression-free survival was observed between ASXL1-mutant and ASXL1-wt patients (P=0.590). In conclusion, ASXL1-mutant ET patients are prone to experiencing thrombotic events. There was no significant difference in the occurrence of thrombotic events among CARL-mutant, JAK2 V617F-mutant and TN patients. Furthermore, ASXL1-mutant/TN patients exhibited a higher number of PLT than ASXL1/JAK2 V617F-double mutant patients. Therefore, ASXL1 mutations may be a risk factor for the occurrence of thrombotic events in ET patients.","['Nie, Yan-Bo', 'Sun, Meng', 'He, Colin K', 'Ju, Man-Kai', 'Zhou, Fu-Ling', 'Wu, San-Yun', 'Zhou, Yi', 'Liu, Li', 'Shen, Hui', 'Huang, Ting-Ting', 'Liu, Pan', 'Xu, Ying', 'Shao, Liang', 'Zuo, Xue-Lan']","['Nie YB', 'Sun M', 'He CK', 'Ju MK', 'Zhou FL', 'Wu SY', 'Zhou Y', 'Liu L', 'Shen H', 'Huang TT', 'Liu P', 'Xu Y', 'Shao L', 'Zuo XL']","['Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei 430071, P.R.

Here we provide evidence that ATP, as an extracellular nucleotide secreted in a pannexin-1-dependent manner from BM cells, triggers activation of the ComC and initiates the mobilization process. This process is augmented in a P2X7 receptor-dependent manner, and P2X7-KO mice are poor mobilizers. Furthermore, after its release into the extracellular space, ATP is processed by ectonucleotidases: CD39 converts ATP to AMP, and CD73 converts AMP to adenosine. We observed that CD73-deficient mice mobilize more HSPCs than do wild-type mice due to a decrease in adenosine concentration in the extracellular space, indicating a negative role for adenosine in the mobilization process. This finding has been confirmed by injecting mice with adenosine along with pro-mobilizing agents. In sum, we demonstrate for the first time that purinergic signaling involving ATP and its metabolite adenosine regulate the mobilization of HSPCs. Although ATP triggers and promotes this process, adenosine has an inhibitory effect. Thus, administration of ATP together with G-CSF or AMD3100 or inhibition of CD73 by small molecule antagonists may provide the basis for more efficient mobilization strategies.","['Adamiak, Mateusz', 'Bujko, Kamila', 'Cymer, Monika', 'Plonka, Monika', 'Glaser, Talita', 'Kucia, Magda', 'Ratajczak, Janina', 'Ulrich, Henning', 'Abdel-Latif, Ahmed', 'Ratajczak, Mariusz Z']","['Adamiak M', 'Bujko K', 'Cymer M', 'Plonka M', 'Glaser T', 'Kucia M', 'Ratajczak J', 'Ulrich H', 'Abdel-Latif A', 'Ratajczak MZ']","['Stem Cell Institute at James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, USA.', 'Department of Regenerative Medicine and Center for Preclinical Studies and Technology, Warsaw Medical University, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Stem Cell Institute at James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, USA.', 'Department of Regenerative Medicine and Center for Preclinical Studies and Technology, Warsaw Medical University, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Stem Cell Institute at James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Institute of Chemistry, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Stem Cell Institute at James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, USA.', 'Department of Regenerative Medicine and Center for Preclinical Studies and Technology, Warsaw Medical University, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Stem Cell Institute at James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Institute of Chemistry, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Gill Heart Institute, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, USA.', 'Stem Cell Institute at James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, USA. mzrata01@louisville.edu.', 'Department of Regenerative Medicine and Center for Preclinical Studies and Technology, Warsaw Medical University, Warsaw, Poland. mzrata01@louisville.edu.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20180330,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,,,,,2018/05/05 06:00,2018/05/05 06:01,['2018/05/05 06:00'],"['2018/03/12 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/05 06:01 [medline]', '2018/05/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-018-0122-0 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-018-0122-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2018 Sep;32(9):1920-1931. doi: 10.1038/s41375-018-0122-0.

We introduce a novel method based on the analyses of coexpression networks and Bayesian networks, and we use this new method to classify two types of hematological malignancies; namely, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Our classifier has an accuracy of 93%, a precision of 98%, and a recall of 90% on the training dataset (n = 366); which outperforms the results reported by other scholars on the same dataset. Although our training dataset consists of microarray data, our model has a remarkable performance on the RNA-Seq test dataset (n = 74, accuracy = 89%, precision = 88%, recall = 98%), which confirms that eigengenes are robust with respect to expression profiling technology. These signatures are useful in classification and correctly predicting the diagnosis. They might also provide valuable information about the underlying biology of diseases. Our network analysis approach is generalizable and can be useful for classifying other diseases based on gene expression profiles.

However, the nature of the stromal cells and molecular pathways involved remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that leukemic B lymphocytes induce the activation of retinoid acid synthesis and signaling in the microenvironment. Inhibition of RA-signaling in stromal cells causes deregulation of genes associated with adhesion, tissue organization and chemokine secretion including the B-cell chemokine CXCL13. Notably, reducing retinoic acid precursors from the diet or inhibiting RA-signaling through retinoid-antagonist therapy prolong survival by preventing dissemination of leukemia cells into lymphoid tissues. Furthermore, mouse and human leukemia cells could be distinguished from normal B-cells by their increased expression of Rargamma2 and RXRalpha, respectively. These findings establish a role for retinoids in murine CLL pathogenesis, and provide new therapeutic strategies to target the microenvironment and to control disease progression.","['Farinello,

In this study, we have identified four novel mutations, which are highly correlated with chemotherapy resistance and poor prognosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, within the P10 subunit of procaspase-8. These newly discovered mutations cause premature termination of translation, resulting in truncated procaspase-8 protein, which is incapable of forming dimer to initiate apoptosis signaling pathway. Further biochemical analysis reveals that the segment of P10 subunit of procaspase-8 consisting of three amino acid residues from L491 to F493 is crucial for the formation of procaspase-8 interdimer, and the aberration of this segment disrupts the dimerization and consequently precludes the activation of caspase-8 and downstream apoptotic signaling pathway. Therefore, the patients with AML who bear these types of P10 mutations were more likely to develop chemotherapy resistance due to impaired apoptotic signaling in cellular system, leading to significantly reduced overall survival (OS) as compared with patients carrying no such types of P10 mutations. Taken together, these newly identified P10 mutations in procaspase-8 could be used as novel biomarkers for predicting response and survival of chemotherapy-treated AML patients, as well as potential therapeutic targets for medical intervention in the future.","['Li, Ming', 'Wu, Xiao-Mo', 'Gao, Ju', 'Yang, Fen', 'Zhang, Cui-Lin', 'Ke, Kun', 'Wang, Ying-Chao', 'Zheng, You-Shi', 'Yao, Jian-Feng', 'Guan, Ying-Ying', 'Chen, Xuan', 'Chen, Juan', 'Liu, Xiao-Long', 'Yang, Xiao-Yu']","['Li M', 'Wu XM', 'Gao J', 'Yang F', 'Zhang CL', 'Ke K', 'Wang YC', 'Zheng YS', 'Yao JF', 'Guan YY', 'Chen X', 'Chen J', 'Liu XL', 'Yang XY']","[""The School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, 350108, People's Republic of China."", 'Department of Biomedicine, University of Basel, Basel, 4056, Switzerland.', ""The United Innovation of Mengchao Hepatobiliary Technology Key Laboratory of Fujian Province, Mengchao Hepatobiliary Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, 350002, People's Republic of China."", ""The First People's Hospital of Huaihua, Huaihua, 418000, People's Republic of China."", ""The United Innovation of Mengchao Hepatobiliary Technology Key Laboratory of Fujian Province, Mengchao Hepatobiliary Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, 350002, People's Republic of China."", ""The United Innovation of Mengchao Hepatobiliary Technology Key Laboratory of Fujian Province, Mengchao Hepatobiliary Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, 350002, People's Republic of China."", ""The United Innovation of Mengchao Hepatobiliary Technology Key Laboratory of Fujian Province, Mengchao Hepatobiliary Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, 350002, People's Republic of China."", ""The United Innovation of Mengchao Hepatobiliary Technology Key Laboratory of Fujian Province, Mengchao Hepatobiliary Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, 350002, People's Republic of China."", ""The School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, 350108, People's Republic of China."", ""The School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, 350108, People's Republic of China."", ""The School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, 350108, People's Republic of China."", ""The School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, 350108, People's Republic of China."", ""The United Innovation of Mengchao Hepatobiliary Technology Key Laboratory of Fujian Province, Mengchao Hepatobiliary Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, 350002, People's Republic of China. xiaoloong.liu@gmail.com."", ""The School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, 350108, People's Republic of China. yangxiaoyu683@163.com."", ""Fuzhou Maternity and Child Healthcare Hospital, Fuzhou, 350005, People's Republic of China. yangxiaoyu683@163.com.""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180501,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (BID protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Caspase 8/*genetics/metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Protein Multimerization', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/genetics/metabolism']",,,2018/05/05 06:00,2019/11/26 06:00,['2018/05/05 06:00'],"['2017/11/02 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/03/16 00:00 [revised]', '2018/05/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41419-018-0511-3 [doi]', '10.1038/s41419-018-0511-3 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2018 May 1;9(5):516. doi: 10.1038/s41419-018-0511-3.,,,,PMC5938697,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We describe a series of 79 patients (53 families) diagnosed since 2011, made up of all patients in France and Belgium, with a follow up of 2249 patients/years. Median age at first clinical symptoms was 18.6 years (range, 0-61 years). Severe infectious diseases (mycobacteria, fungus, and human papilloma virus) and hematologic malignancies were the most common first manifestations. The probability of remaining symptom-free was 8% at 40 years old. Among the 53 probands, 24 had missense mutations including 4 recurrent alleles, 21 had nonsense or frameshift mutations, 4 had a whole-gene deletion, 2 had splice defects, and 2 patients had complex mutations. There were significantly more cases of leukemia in patients with missense mutations (n=14 of 34) than in patients with nonsense or frameshift mutations (n=2 of 28). We also identify new features of the disease: acute lymphoblastic leukemia, juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, fatal progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy related to the JC virus, and immune/inflammatory diseases. A revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) score allowed a distinction to be made between a stable disease and hematologic transformation. Chemotherapy is of limited efficacy, and has a high toxicity with severe infectious complications. As the mortality rate is high in our cohort (up to 35% at the age of 40), hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains the best choice of treatment to avoid severe infectious and/or hematologic complications. The timing of HSCT remains difficult to determine, but the earlier it is performed, the better the outcome.","['Donadieu, Jean', 'Lamant, Marie', 'Fieschi, Claire', 'de Fontbrune, Flore Sicre', 'Caye, Aurelie', 'Ouachee, Marie', 'Beaupain, Blandine', 'Bustamante, Jacinta', 'Poirel, Helene A', 'Isidor, Bertrand', 'Van Den Neste, Eric', 'Neel, Antoine', 'Nimubona, Stanislas', 'Toutain, Fabienne', 'Barlogis, Vincent', 'Schleinitz, Nicolas', 'Leblanc, Thierry', 'Rohrlich, Pierre', 'Suarez, Felipe', 'Ranta, Dana', 'Chahla, Wadih Abou', 'Bruno, Benedicte', 'Terriou, Louis', 'Francois, Sylvie', 'Lioure, Bruno', 'Ahle, Guido', 'Bachelerie, Francoise', 'Preudhomme, Claude', 'Delabesse, Eric', 'Cave, Helene', 'Bellanne-Chantelot, Christine', 'Pasquet, Marlene']","['Donadieu J', 'Lamant M', 'Fieschi C', 'de Fontbrune FS', 'Caye A', 'Ouachee M', 'Beaupain B', 'Bustamante J', 'Poirel HA', 'Isidor B', 'Van Den Neste E', 'Neel A', 'Nimubona S', 'Toutain F', 'Barlogis V', 'Schleinitz N', 'Leblanc T', 'Rohrlich P', 'Suarez F', 'Ranta D', 'Chahla WA', 'Bruno B', 'Terriou L', 'Francois S', 'Lioure B', 'Ahle G', 'Bachelerie F', 'Preudhomme C', 'Delabesse E', 'Cave H', 'Bellanne-Chantelot C', 'Pasquet M']","['Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Registre National des Neutropenies Chroniques, AP-HP Trousseau Hospital, Paris, France.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Immunology, CHU Toulouse, France.', 'Department of Clinical Immunology Assistance Publique -

The objective of this study was to investigate the safety and efficacy of decitabine combined with the CXCR4 antagonist plerixafor in newly diagnosed older patients with acute myeloid leukemia and to evaluate the effects of plerixafor on leukemia stem cells. Patients were treated with monthly cycles of decitabine 20 mg/m(2) days 1-10 and escalating doses of plerixafor (320-810 mcg/kg) days 1-5. Sixty-nine patients were treated, with an overall response rate of 43%. Adverse karyotype did not predict response (P=0.31). Prior hypomethylating agent treatment was the strongest independent predictor of adverse overall survival (hazard ratio 3.1; 95%CI: 1.3-7.3; P=0.008) and response (14% in previously treated patients, 46% in treatment naive; P=0.002). As expected, the most common toxicities were myelosuppression and infection. Plerixafor induced mobilization of leukemia stem and progenitor cells, but did not cause clinically significant hyperleukocytosis. Reduction in leukemia stem cells appeared to correlate with duration of response. Plerixafor can be safely added to decitabine in poor-prognosis, elderly acute myeloid leukemia patients. The maximum tolerated dose of the combination was 810 mcg/kg. While mobilization of leukemia stem cells was observed in some patients, the clinical benefit of adding plerixafor was uncertain.

In this phase 1 study, pinometostat was evaluated for safety and efficacy in adult patients with advanced acute leukemias, particularly those involving mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene rearrangements (MLL-r) resulting from 11q23 translocations. Fifty-one patients were enrolled into 6 dose-escalation cohorts (n = 26) and 2 expansion cohorts (n = 25) at pinometostat doses of 54 and 90 mg/m(2) per day by continuous intravenous infusion in 28-day cycles. Because a maximum tolerated dose was not established in the dose-escalation phase, the expansion doses were selected based on safety and clinical response data combined with pharmacodynamic evidence of reduction in H3K79 methylation during dose escalation. Across all dose levels, plasma pinometostat concentrations increased in an approximately dose-proportional fashion, reaching an apparent steady-state by 4-8 hours after infusion, and rapidly decreased following treatment cessation. The most common adverse events, of any cause, were fatigue (39%), nausea (39%), constipation (35%), and febrile neutropenia (35%). Overall, 2 patients, both with t(11;19), experienced complete remission at 54 mg/m(2) per day by continuous intravenous infusion, demonstrating proof of concept for delivering clinically meaningful responses through targeting DOT1L using the single agent pinometostat in MLL-r leukemia patients. Administration of pinometostat was generally safe, with the maximum tolerated dose not being reached, although efficacy as a single agent was modest.

BCR-ABL1 is the hallmark of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in which treatment-free remission (TFR) is limited, with clinical and economic consequences. Thus, there is an urgent need for novel therapeutics that synergize with current treatment approaches. Several inhibitors targeting the N-terminal domain of HSP90 are under investigation, but side effects such as induction of the heat shock response (HSR) and toxicity have so far precluded their US Food and Drug Administration approval. We have developed a novel inhibitor (aminoxyrone [AX]) of HSP90 function by targeting HSP90 dimerization via the C-terminal domain. This was achieved by structure-based molecular design, chemical synthesis, and functional preclinical in vitro and in vivo validation using CML cell lines and patient-derived CML cells. AX is a promising potential candidate that induces apoptosis in the leukemic stem cell fraction (CD34(+)CD38(-)) as well as the leukemic bulk (CD34(+)CD38(+)) of primary CML and in tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-resistant cells. Furthermore, BCR-ABL1 oncoprotein and related pro-oncogenic cellular responses are downregulated, and targeting the HSP90 C terminus by AX does not induce the HSR in vitro and in vivo. We also probed the potential of AX in other therapy-refractory leukemias. Therefore, AX is the first peptidomimetic C-terminal HSP90 inhibitor with the potential to increase TFR in TKI-sensitive and refractory CML patients and also offers a novel therapeutic option for patients with other types of therapy-refractory leukemia because of its low toxicity profile and lack of HSR.","['Bhatia, Sanil', 'Diedrich, Daniela', 'Frieg, Benedikt', 'Ahlert, Heinz', 'Stein, Stefan', 'Bopp, Bertan', 'Lang, Franziska', 'Zang, Tao', 'Kroger, Tobias', 'Ernst, Thomas', 'Kogler, Gesine', 'Krieg, Andreas', 'Ludeke, Steffen', 'Kunkel, Hana', 'Rodrigues Moita, Ana J', 'Kassack, Matthias U', 'Marquardt, Viktoria', 'Opitz, Friederike V', 'Oldenburg, Marina', 'Remke, Marc', 'Babor, Florian', 'Grez, Manuel', 'Hochhaus, Andreas', 'Borkhardt, Arndt', 'Groth, Georg', 'Nagel-Steger, Luitgard', 'Jose, Joachim', 'Kurz, Thomas', 'Gohlke, Holger', 'Hansen, Finn K', 'Hauer, Julia']","['Bhatia S', 'Diedrich D', 'Frieg B', 'Ahlert H', 'Stein S', 'Bopp B', 'Lang F', 'Zang T', 'Kroger T', 'Ernst T', 'Kogler G', 'Krieg A', 'Ludeke S', 'Kunkel H', 'Rodrigues Moita AJ', 'Kassack MU', 'Marquardt V', 'Opitz FV', 'Oldenburg M', 'Remke M', 'Babor F', 'Grez M', 'Hochhaus A', 'Borkhardt A', 'Groth G', 'Nagel-Steger L', 'Jose J', 'Kurz T', 'Gohlke H', 'Hansen FK', 'Hauer J']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Medical Faculty, and.', 'Institute for Pharmaceutical and Medicinal Chemistry, Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Institute for Pharmaceutical and Medicinal Chemistry, Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'John von Neumann Institute for Computing, Julich Supercomputing Centre, Institute for Complex Systems-Structural Biochemistry (ICS-6), Forschungszentrum Julich GmbH, Julich, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Medical Faculty, and.', 'Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, Georg-Speyer-Haus, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute for Pharmaceutical and Medicinal Chemistry, PharmaCampus, Westphalian Wilhelms University, Munster, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Medical Faculty, and.', 'Institute for Physical Biology, Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Institute of Complex Systems, Structural Biochemistry (ICS-6), Forschungszentrum Julich GmbH, Julich, Germany.', 'Institute for Pharmaceutical and Medicinal Chemistry, Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Hematology/Oncology, Internal Medicine II, Jena University Hospital, Jena, Germany.', 'Institute for Transplantation Diagnostics and Cell Therapeutics and.', 'Department of Surgery (A), Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, Georg-Speyer-Haus, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute for Pharmaceutical and Medicinal Chemistry, Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Institute for Pharmaceutical and Medicinal Chemistry, Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Medical Faculty, and.', 'Institute for Pharmaceutical and Medicinal Chemistry, Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Institute of Neuropathology, Medical Faculty, Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Division of Pediatric Neuro-Oncogenomics, German Cancer Consortium, partner site University Hospital Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Medical Faculty, and.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Medical Faculty, and.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Medical Faculty, and.', 'Institute of Neuropathology, Medical Faculty, Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Division of Pediatric Neuro-Oncogenomics, German Cancer Consortium, partner site University Hospital Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Medical Faculty, and.', 'Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, Georg-Speyer-Haus, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Hematology/Oncology, Internal Medicine II, Jena University Hospital, Jena, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Medical Faculty, and.', 'Institute for Biochemical Plant Physiology, Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany;

Although previous studies have evaluated NPM1 in a binary fashion, little is known about the significance of its mutant allele burden at diagnosis, nor has the effect of comutations (other than FLT3) been extensively evaluated. We retrospectively used targeted sequencing data from 109 patients with de novo AML with mutated NPM1 to evaluate the potential significance of NPM1 variant allele frequency (VAF), comutations, and clinical parameters with regard to patient outcomes. We observed that high NPM1 VAF (uppermost quartile) correlated with shortened overall survival (median, 12.1 months vs not reached; P < .0001) as well as event-free survival (median, 7.5 vs 65.44 months; P < .0001) compared with the other NPM1-mutated cases. In both univariate and multivariable analyses, high NPM1 VAF had a particularly adverse prognostic effect in the subset of patients treated with stem-cell transplantation in first remission (P = .0004) and in patients with mutated DNMT3A (P < .0001). Our findings indicate that the prognostic effect of NPM1 mutation in de novo AML may be influenced by the relative abundance of the mutated allele.","['Patel, Sanjay S', 'Kuo, Frank C', 'Gibson, Christopher J', 'Steensma, David P', 'Soiffer, Robert J', 'Alyea, Edwin P 3rd', 'Chen, Yi-Bin A', 'Fathi, Amir T', 'Graubert, Timothy A', 'Brunner, Andrew M', 'Wadleigh, Martha', 'Stone, Richard M', 'DeAngelo, Daniel J', 'Nardi, Valentina', 'Hasserjian, Robert P', 'Weinberg, Olga K']","['Patel SS', 'Kuo FC', 'Gibson CJ', 'Steensma DP', 'Soiffer RJ', 'Alyea EP 3rd', 'Chen YA', 'Fathi AT', 'Graubert TA', 'Brunner AM', 'Wadleigh M', 'Stone RM', 'DeAngelo DJ', 'Nardi V', 'Hasserjian RP', 'Weinberg OK']","[""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA."", ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA."", 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Boston, MA.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Boston, MA.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Boston, MA.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA; and.', 'Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA; and.', ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA."", ""Department of Pathology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA.""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20180503,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNMT3A protein, human)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA Methyltransferase 3A)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/genetics', 'DNA Methyltransferase 3A', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Gene Frequency', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Mutation Accumulation', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Survival Analysis', 'Young Adult']",,,2018/05/05 06:00,2019/07/11 06:00,['2018/05/05 06:00'],"['2018/01/19 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/11 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)32140-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2018-01-828467 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2018 Jun 21;131(25):2816-2825. doi: 10.1182/blood-2018-01-828467.

Here, we show that mutations associated with AML result both in loss of miR-142-3p function and in decreased miR-142-5p expression. Mir142 loss altered the hematopoietic differentiation of multipotent hematopoietic progenitors, enhancing their myeloid potential while suppressing their lymphoid potential. During hematopoietic maturation, loss of Mir142 increased ASH1L protein expression and consequently resulted in the aberrant maintenance of Hoxa gene expression in myeloid-committed hematopoietic progenitors. Mir142 loss also enhanced the disease-initiating activity of IDH2-mutant hematopoietic cells in mice. Together these data suggest a novel model in which miR-142, through repression of ASH1L activity, plays a key role in suppressing HOXA9/A10 expression during normal myeloid differentiation. AML-associated loss-of-function mutations of MIR142 disrupt this negative signaling pathway, resulting in sustained HOXA9/A10 expression in myeloid progenitors/myeloblasts and ultimately contributing to leukemic transformation.Significance: These findings provide mechanistic insights into the role of miRNAs in leukemogenesis and hematopoietic stem cell function.

In line with previous studies, our data show that ibrutinib significantly suppressed Reh cell viability in a time- and dose-dependent manner. We further evaluated the role of ibrutinib on Reh cell colony formation and apoptosis. Ibrutinib inhibited clonogenic capacity and induced Reh cell apoptosis, suggesting an anti-tumor effects of ibrutinib in the progression of ALL. Further study showed that ibrutinib treatment increased ERS-related protein expression, including Bip, ATF4 and CHOP, suggesting the induction of ER-stress in Reh cells. More importantly, once ER-stress was suppressed by tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), an ER-stress inhibitor, the upregulation of Bip, ATF4, CHOP, cleaved-caspase3 and cleaved-PARP after ibrutinib treatment was partially reversed, suggesting that induction of ALL cell apoptosis by ibrutinib was partially attributed to activation of ER stress. In summary, we showed novel data that ER-stress induced cell apoptosis plays a key role in the therapeutic effects of ibrutinib on ALL cell malignancies.","['Li, Zhaohui', 'Wu, Jia', 'Sheng, Lei']","['Li Z', 'Wu J', 'Sheng L']",,,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Germany,Pharmazie,Die Pharmazie,9800766,"['0 (ATF4 protein, human)', '0 (Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '145891-90-3 (Activating Transcription Factor 4)', '147336-12-7 (Transcription Factor CHOP)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', '516-35-8 (Taurochenodeoxycholic Acid)', '60EUX8MN5X (ursodoxicoltaurine)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (PARP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Activating Transcription Factor 4/metabolism', 'Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress/*drug effects', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Piperidines', 'Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Pyrazoles/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Taurochenodeoxycholic Acid/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factor CHOP/metabolism']",,,2018/05/05 06:00,2019/01/18 06:00,['2018/05/05 06:00'],"['2018/05/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1691/ph.2018.8306 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmazie. 2018 May 1;73(5):294-299. doi: 10.1691/ph.2018.8306.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was aimed to study the pathogenesis of coagulopathy in patients with APL. METHODS: Multiple procoagulant and profibrinolytic parameters in plasma and peripheral leukocytes from 24 patients with newly diagnosed APL accompanied by coagulopathy before and after arsenic trioxide (ATO) treatment were evaluated. RESULTS: Prior to the treatment, the patients had elevated D-dimer and decreased fibrinogen levels. Plasma urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) and plasmin-a2 antiplasmin complexes (PAP) levels, plasmin (Pn) activity, and cell surface levels of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) were significantly higher; plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) levels and plasminogen (Pg) activity were significantly decreased; plasma plasminogen activator (PA) activity, uPA and tPA levels; and cell surface levels of uPAR and annexin II were not significantly different from levels in the control group. During ATO treatment, both patients' plasma PA activity and uPAR on leukocytes gradually increased, annexin II on leukocytes increased initially and decreased afterwards, and tPA and uPA on leukocytes remained consistently higher in the patients than in the controls. Other parameters gradually tended toward normal values. CONCLUSIONS: In APL, activated coagulation system activated fibrinolytic system, and increased uPAR levels could contribute to the hyperfibrinolysis. Annexin II might not be involved in the coagulopathy.","['Wang, Ping', 'Zhang, Yingmei', 'Yang, Huiyuan', 'Hou, Wenyi', 'Jin, Bo', 'Hou, Jinxiao', 'Li, Haitao', 'Zhao, Hongli', 'Zhou, Jin']","['Wang P', 'Zhang Y', 'Yang H', 'Hou W', 'Jin B', 'Hou J', 'Li H', 'Zhao H', 'Zhou J']","[""a Center for Hematology and Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital , Harbin Medical University , Harbin , People's Republic of China."", ""b Department of Neonatology, The First Affiliated Hospital , Harbin Medical University , Harbin , People's Republic of China."", ""a Center for Hematology and Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital , Harbin Medical University , Harbin , People's Republic of China."", ""a Center for Hematology and Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital , Harbin Medical University , Harbin , People's Republic of China."", ""a Center for Hematology and Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital , Harbin Medical University , Harbin , People's Republic of China."", ""a Center for Hematology and Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital , Harbin Medical University , Harbin , People's Republic of China."", ""a Center for Hematology and Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital , Harbin Medical University , Harbin , People's Republic of China."", ""a Center for Hematology and Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital , Harbin Medical University , Harbin , People's Republic of China."", ""a Center for Hematology and Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital , Harbin Medical University , Harbin , People's Republic of China."", ""c Department of Hematology, The Fourth Affiliated Hospital , Harbin Medical University , Harbin , People's Republic of China."", ""a Center for Hematology and Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital , Harbin Medical University , Harbin , People's Republic of China.""]",,['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20180504,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oxides)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*administration & dosage', 'Blood Coagulation Disorders/*blood', 'Blood Proteins/*metabolism', 'Female', '*Fibrinolysis', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/blood/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*blood', 'Oxides/*administration & dosage']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'arsenic trioxide', 'fibrinolysis']",2018/05/05 06:00,2018/11/02 06:00,['2018/05/05 06:00'],"['2018/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/02 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10245332.2018.1470069 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2018 Dec;23(10):756-764. doi: 10.1080/10245332.2018.1470069.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of arrested pneumatization of the sphenoid sinus in paediatric patients with haemotologic diseases like sickle cell anaemia, thalassemia and leukemia. Materials and Methods: One hundred and eight paediatric patients (43 girls, 65 boys; age range: 4-18 years; median age: 13 years) with haemotologic diseases who underwent at least one magnetic resonance imaging of the head and neck between 2010 and 2017 in a single institution were included. Magnetic resonance imaging studies were retrospectively reviewed. Well-defined and fat-containing non-expansile lesions located at the sphenoid sinus region were diagnosed as arrested pneumatization of the sphenoid sinus. Medical diagnoses, lesion sizes, age and sex of the patients were recorded. Results: Five (4.6%) of 108 patients demonstrated arrested pneumatization of the sphenoid sinus (3 girls, 2 boys; age range: 9-18 years; median age: 14 years). One (1.2%) of 83 patients with acute leukemia, 2 (15%) of 13 patients with sickle cell anaemia and 2 of 12 (17%) patients with thalassemia demonstrated arrested pneumatization of the sphenoid sinus. No statistical correlation was found between arrested pneumatization of the sphenoid sinus and possible risk factors like patient age and sex. Conclusions: Patients with haemoglobinopathies like sickle cell anaemia and thalassemia involving red-blood-cells had higher prevalence of arrested pneumatization of the sphenoid sinus than patients with leukemia which involves the white-blood-cells. This supported the suggestion that regional blood-flow disorders induce arrested pneumatization of the sphenoid sinus.

The fundamental concept of molecularly targeted therapy is to target a protein that is specifically deregulated or overexpressed in cancer cells. However, drug resistance and tumor heterogeneity are major obstacles in the development of specific inhibitors. Additionally, many driver oncogenes exert their oncogenic property via abnormal expression without having genetic mutations. Interestingly, recent accumulating evidence has demonstrated that many critical cancer genes are driven by a unique class of enhancers termed super-enhancers. Genes associated with super-enhancers are relatively more susceptible to the inhibition of general transcriptional machinery compared with genes that are regulated by typical enhancers. Cancer cells are more sensitive to treatment with small-molecule inhibitors of CDK7 or BRD4 than non-transformed cells. These findings proposed a novel strategy to identify functionally important genes as well as novel therapeutic modalities in cancer. This approach would be particularly useful for genetically complicated cancers, such as adult T-cell leukemia (ATL), whereby a large mutational burden is present, but the functional consequences of each mutation have not been well-studied. In this review, we discuss recent findings on super-enhancers, underlying mechanisms, and the efficacy of small-molecule transcriptional inhibitors in ATL.","['Wong, Regina Wan Ju', 'Ishida, Takashi', 'Sanda, Takaomi']","['Wong RWJ', 'Ishida T', 'Sanda T']","['Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117599, Singapore. csirwwj@nus.edu.sg.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Iwate Medical University, Morioka 020-8505, Iwate, Japan. itakashi@iwate-med.ac.jp.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117599, Singapore. takaomi_sanda@nus.edu.sg.', 'Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117599, Singapore. takaomi_sanda@nus.edu.sg.', '14 Medical Drive, Centre for Translational Medicine, #12-01, Singapore 117599, Singapore. takaomi_sanda@nus.edu.sg.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-1060-0777', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1621-4954']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180502,Switzerland,Molecules,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",100964009,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BRD4 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK4 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects']",['NOTNLM'],"['BRD4', 'CDK7', 'CDK9', 'adult T-cell leukemia', 'super-enhancer', 'transcription factor']",2018/05/05 06:00,2018/09/19 06:00,['2018/05/05 06:00'],"['2018/03/17 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/27 00:00 [revised]', '2018/04/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/19 06:00 [medline]']","['molecules23051057 [pii]', '10.3390/molecules23051057 [doi]']",epublish,Molecules. 2018 May 2;23(5). pii: molecules23051057. doi: 10.3390/molecules23051057.,,,,PMC6099935,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EBV-associated malignancies have increased by 14.6% over the last 20 years, and account for approximately 1.5% of all cancers worldwide and 1.8% of all cancer deaths. However, the potential involvement/contribution of lytic proteins to the pathophysiology of EBV-associated cancers is not well understood. We have previously demonstrated that the EBV-deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase (dUTPase) modulates innate and adaptive immune responses by engaging the Toll-Like Receptor 2 (TLR2), which leads to the modulation of downstream genes involved in oncogenesis, chronic inflammation, and in effector T-cell function. Furthermore, examination of serum samples from diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients revealed the presence of increased levels of anti-dUTPase antibodies in both cohorts compared to controls with the highest levels (3.67-fold increase) observed in DLBCL female cases and the lowest (2.12-fold increase) in DLBCL males. Using computer-generated algorithms, dUTPase amino acid sequence alignments, and functional studies of BLLF3 mutants, we identified a putative amino acid motif involved with TLR2 interaction. These findings suggest that the EBV-dUTPase: TLR2 interaction is a potential molecular target that could be used for developing novel therapeutics (small molecules/vaccines).","['Williams, Marshall', 'Ariza, Maria Eugenia']","['Williams M', 'Ariza ME']","['Department of Cancer Biology and Genetics, The Ohio State University College of Medicine, Columbus, OH 43210, USA. williams.70@osu.edu.', 'Institute for Behavioral Medicine Research, The Ohio State University College of Medicine, Columbus, OH 43210, USA. williams.70@osu.edu.', 'Department of Cancer Biology and Genetics, The Ohio State University College of Medicine, Columbus, OH 43210, USA. maria.ariza@osumc.edu.', 'Institute for Behavioral Medicine Research, The Ohio State University College of Medicine, Columbus, OH 43210, USA. maria.ariza@osumc.edu.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180501,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)', 'Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)', 'deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase (dUTPase)', 'diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL)']",2018/05/05 06:00,2018/05/05 06:01,['2018/05/05 06:00'],"['2018/03/14 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/20 00:00 [revised]', '2018/04/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/05 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers10050129 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers10050129 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2018 May 1;10(5). pii: cancers10050129. doi: 10.3390/cancers10050129.,,,,PMC5977102,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This multiple resistance represents a real obstacle in the effective chemotherapy of neoplastic diseases. Therefore, identifying cytotoxic substances that are also effective in P-gp overexpressing cells may be useful for the rational design of substances for the treatment of malignancies with developed MDR. Here, we showed that triorganotin derivatives-tributyltin-chloride (TBT-Cl), tributyltin-bromide (TBT-Br), tributyltin-iodide (TBT-I) and tributyltin-isothiocyanate (TBT-NCS) or triphenyltin-chloride (TPT-Cl) and triphenyltin-isothiocyanate (TPT-NCS)-could induce the death of L1210 mice leukemia cells at a submicromolar concentration independently of P-gp overexpression. The median lethal concentration obtained for triorganotin derivatives did not exceed 0.5 microM in the induction of cell death of either P-gp negative or P-gp positive L1210 cells. Apoptosis related to regulatory pathway of Bcl-2 family proteins seems to be the predominant mode of cell death in either P-gp negative or P-gp positive L1210 cells. TBT-Cl and TBT-Br were more efficient with L1210 cells overexpressing P-gp than with their counterpart P-gp negative cells. In contrast, TBT-I and TPT-NCS induced a more pronounced cell death effect on P-gp negative cells than on P-gp positive cells. Triorganotin derivatives did not affect P-gp efflux in native cells measured by calcein retention within the cells. Taken together, we assumed that triorganotin derivatives represent substances suitable for suppressing the viability of P-gp positive malignant cells.","['Bohacova, Viera', 'Seres, Mario', 'Pavlikova, Lucia', 'Kontar, Szilvia', 'Cagala, Martin', 'Bobal, Pavel', 'Otevrel, Jan', 'Brtko, Julius', 'Sulova, Zdena', 'Breier, Albert']","['Bohacova V', 'Seres M', 'Pavlikova L', 'Kontar S', 'Cagala M', 'Bobal P', 'Otevrel J', 'Brtko J', 'Sulova Z', 'Breier A']","['Institute of Molecular Physiology and Genetics, Centre of Bioscience, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Dubravska Cesta 9, 84005 Bratislava, Slovakia. viera.bohacova@savba.sk.', 'Institute of Molecular Physiology and Genetics, Centre of Bioscience, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Dubravska Cesta 9, 84005 Bratislava, Slovakia. mario.seres@savba.sk.', 'Institute of Molecular Physiology and Genetics, Centre of Bioscience, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Dubravska Cesta 9, 84005 Bratislava, Slovakia. lucia.pavlikova@savba.sk.', 'Institute of Molecular Physiology and Genetics, Centre of Bioscience, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Dubravska Cesta 9, 84005 Bratislava, Slovakia. szilvia.kontar@savba.sk.', 'Institute of Molecular Physiology and Genetics, Centre of Bioscience, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Dubravska Cesta 9, 84005 Bratislava, Slovakia. martin.cagala@savba.sk.', 'Department of Chemical Drugs, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Veterinary and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Brno, Palackeho 1946/1, 61242 Brno, Czech Republic. bobalp@vfu.cz.', 'Department of Chemical Drugs, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Veterinary and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Brno, Palackeho 1946/1, 61242 Brno, Czech Republic. otevrelj@vfu.cz.', 'Institute of Experimental Endocrinology, Biomedical Research Center SAS, Dubravska Cesta 9, 84505 Bratislava, Slovakia. julius.brtko@savba.sk.', 'Institute of Molecular Physiology and Genetics, Centre of Bioscience, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Dubravska Cesta 9, 84005 Bratislava, Slovakia. zdena.sulova@savba.sk.', 'Institute of Biochemistry and Microbiology, Faculty of Chemical and Food Technology, Slovak University of Technology, Radlinskeho 9, 81237 Bratislava, Slovakia. albert.breier@stuba.sk.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-8275-4177'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180501,Switzerland,Molecules,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",100964009,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (Cytotoxins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cytotoxins/chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*L1210 cells', '*P-glycoprotein', '*apoptosis', '*calcein cell retention', '*multidrug resistance', '*triorganotin derivatives']",2018/05/05 06:00,2018/09/19 06:00,['2018/05/05 06:00'],"['2018/04/12 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/25 00:00 [revised]', '2018/04/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/19 06:00 [medline]']","['molecules23051053 [pii]', '10.3390/molecules23051053 [doi]']",epublish,Molecules. 2018 May 1;23(5). pii: molecules23051053. doi: 10.3390/molecules23051053.,,,,PMC6100532,,,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,

High concentrations of SUMO-bound proteins were proposed to condense into liquid-like droplets and such phase transition may occur within NBs. Many stress pathways modulate NB formation and recent findings have directly implicated PML in oxidative stress response in vivo. PML may also undergo SUMO-dependent ubiquitination/degradation.

Knowledge accumulated during the last 10 years justifies moving TFR strategies from research to clinical practice. METHODS: Twenty experts from the French Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Study Group (France Intergroupe des Leucemies Myeloides Chroniques), including 17 hematologists, 2 molecular biologists, and 1 cytogeneticist, critically reviewed published data with the goal of developing evidence-based recommendations for TKI discontinuation in clinical practice. RESULTS: Clinically relevant questions were addressed, including the selection of candidate patients (with known prognostic factors for outcomes taken into account), detailed monitoring procedures during the treatment-free phase, a definition of relapse requiring therapy resumption, and monitoring after treatment reintroduction. CONCLUSIONS: This work presents consensus statements with the aim of guiding physicians and biologists by means of pragmatic recommendations for safe TKI discontinuation in daily practice.

It is approved at a dose of 100 mg orally daily for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase (CML-CP). This dose schedule is associated with myelosuppression and pleural effusions. Anecdotal data suggest that lower doses may be as effective and less toxic. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of a lower dose of dasatinib (50 mg daily) in patients with newly diagnosed CML-CP. METHODS: Seventy-five patients with newly diagnosed CML-CP received dasatinib 50 mg daily. The eligibility and response criteria were standards used in previous protocols. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 9 months, 60 patients were evaluable for a response at 3 months. The rates of patients achieving BCR-ABL1 transcript levels </= 10% and </= 1% at 3 months by the International Standard were 93% and 72%, respectively. The rates of complete cytogenetic response by conventional cytogenetics or fluorescence in situ hybridization at 6 and 12 months were 86% and 88%, respectively. At 12 months, 79%, 71%, and 46% of the patients had achieved a major molecular response, a molecular response with a 4.0-log reduction, and a molecular response with a 4.5-log reduction, respectively. Nine patients had a dose interruption for </=14 days. Only 1 patient developed a pleural effusion requiring a dose reduction to 20 mg. All patients remained alive and with no transformation so far. CONCLUSION: Dasatinib 50 mg daily is active and well tolerated in patients with newly diagnosed CML-CP. It should be further explored as a new potential standard-of-care option for chronic myeloid leukemia. Cancer 2018;124:2740-2747.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to study the clinical, histopathological and immunohistochemical features of myeloid leukemia cutis. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of clinical and pathological features of 10 patients with myeloid leukemia cutis. RESULTS: One patient developed skin lesions before the onset of leukemia, seven patients developed skin infiltration within 4-72 months after the onset of leukemia, and two patients developed skin lesions and systemic leukemia simultaneously. Of these patients, five presented with generalized papules or nodules, and five with localized masses. The biopsy of skin lesions showed a large number of tumor cells within the dermis and subcutaneous fat layer. Immunohistochemical analysis showed strong reactivity to myeloperoxidase (MPO), CD15, CD43 and CD45 (LCA) in most cases. NPM1 (nucleophosmin I) and FLT3-ITD (Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3-internal tandem duplication) mutations were identified in one case. Five patients with acute myelogenous leukemia and one patient with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia died within two months to one year after the onset of skin lesions. STUDY LIMITATIONS: This was a retrospective and small sample study. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with myelogenous leukemia, skin infiltration usually occurs after, but occasionally before, the appearance of hemogram and myelogram abnormalities, and the presence of skin infiltration is often associated with a poor prognosis and short survival time. myeloid leukemia cutis often presents as generalized or localized nodules or masses with characteristic pathological and histochemical findings.","['Li, Li', 'Wang, Yanan', 'Lian, Christine Guo', 'Hu, Nina', 'Jin, Hongzhong', 'Liu, Yuehua']","['Li L', 'Wang Y', 'Lian CG', 'Hu N', 'Jin H', 'Liu Y']","['Department of Dermatology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Dermatology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', ""Department of Pathology, Brigham & Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA."", ""Department of Pathology, Brigham & Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA."", 'Department of Dermatology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Dermatology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Spain,An Bras Dermatol,Anais brasileiros de dermatologia,0067662,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biopsy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Leukemic Infiltration/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sex Factors', 'Skin/*pathology', 'Time Factors']",,,2018/05/04 06:00,2018/05/31 06:00,['2018/05/04 06:00'],"['2016/08/01 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/31 06:00 [medline]']","['S0365-0596(20)30400-1 [pii]', '10.1590/abd1806-4841.20186327 [doi]']",ppublish,An Bras Dermatol. 2018 Mar;93(2):216-221. doi: 10.1590/abd1806-4841.20186327.,,,,PMC5916393,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With a myriad of novel agents to evaluate, there is a lack of predictive biomarkers to precisely assign targeted therapies to individual patients. Primary AML cells often survive poorly in vitro, thus confounding conventional cytotoxicity assays. The purpose of this work was to assess the potential of two same-day functional predictive assays in AML cell lines to predict long-term response to chemotherapy. (i) Ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) is a downstream substrate of PI3K/akt/mTOR/ kinase and MAPK kinase pathways and its dephosphorylation is also triggered by DNA double strand breaks. Phospho-rpS6 is reliably measurable by flow cytometry and thus has the potential to function as a biomarker of responsiveness to several therapeutic agents. (ii) A cell's propensity for apoptosis can be interrogated via a functional assay termed ""Dynamic BH3 Profiling"" in which mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization in drug-treated cells can be driven by pro-apoptotic BH3 domain peptides such as PUMA-BH3. The extent to which a particular cell is primed for apoptosis by the drug can be determined by measuring the amount of cytochrome C released on addition of BH3 peptide. We demonstrate that phospho-rpS6 expression and PUMA-BH3 peptide-induced cytochrome C release after 4 hours both predict long term chemoresponsiveness to tyrosine kinase inhibitors and DNA double strand break inducers in AML cell lines. We also describe changes in expression levels of the prosurvival BCL-2 family member Mcl-1 and the pro-apoptotic protein BIM after short term drug culture.","['Grundy, Martin', 'Jones, Thomas', 'Elmi, Liban', 'Hall, Michael', 'Graham, Adam', 'Russell, Nigel', 'Pallis, Monica']","['Grundy M', 'Jones T', 'Elmi L', 'Hall M', 'Graham A', 'Russell N', 'Pallis M']","['Clinical Haematology, Nottingham University Hospitals, Nottingham, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, Division of Cancer and Stem Cells, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, Division of Cancer and Stem Cells, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, Division of Cancer and Stem Cells, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, Division of Cancer and Stem Cells, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, United Kingdom.', 'Clinical Haematology, Nottingham University Hospitals, Nottingham, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, Division of Cancer and Stem Cells, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, United Kingdom.', 'Clinical Haematology, Nottingham University Hospitals, Nottingham, United Kingdom.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-0719-2469'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180503,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BBC3 protein, human)', '0 (Bax protein (53-86))', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Ribosomal Protein S6)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/pharmacology', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded/drug effects', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mitochondrial Membranes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Peptide Fragments/pharmacology', 'Permeability/drug effects', 'Phosphorylation', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/pharmacology', 'Ribosomal Protein S6/*metabolism', 'Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects']",,,2018/05/04 06:00,2018/08/09 06:00,['2018/05/04 06:00'],"['2018/01/29 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0196805 [doi]', 'PONE-D-18-03070 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2018 May 3;13(5):e0196805. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0196805. eCollection 2018.,,,,PMC5933738,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The HTLV-1 Tax regulatory protein plays indispensable roles in regulating viral gene expression and activating cellular signaling pathways that drive the proliferation and clonal expansion of T cells bearing HTLV-1 proviral integrations. Tax is a potent activator of NF-kappaB, a key signaling pathway that is essential for the survival and proliferation of HTLV-1-infected T cells. However, constitutive NF-kappaB activation by Tax also triggers a senescence response, suggesting the possibility that only T cells capable of overcoming NF-kappaB-induced senescence can selectively undergo clonal expansion after HTLV-1 infection. Tax expression is often silenced in the majority of ATLL due to genetic alterations in the tax gene or DNA hypermethylation of the 5'-LTR. Despite the loss of Tax, NF-kappaB activation remains persistently activated in ATLL due to somatic mutations in genes in the T/B-cell receptor (T/BCR) and NF-kappaB signaling pathways. In this review, we focus on the key events driving Tax-dependent and -independent mechanisms of NF-kappaB activation during the multistep process leading to ATLL.","['Harhaj, Edward William', 'Giam, Chou-Zen']","['Harhaj EW', 'Giam CZ']","['Department of Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Uniformed Services University, Bethesda, MD, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",20180514,England,FEBS J,The FEBS journal,101229646,['0 (NF-kappa B)'],IM,"['Adult', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HTLV-I Infections/metabolism/pathology/*virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/metabolism/pathology/*virology', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction']",['NOTNLM'],"['*HTLV-1', '*NF-kappaB', '*Senescence', '*leukemia', '*tax']",2018/05/04 06:00,2019/06/08 06:00,['2018/05/04 06:00'],"['2018/02/21 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/12 00:00 [revised]', '2018/04/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/08 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/febs.14492 [doi]'],ppublish,FEBS J. 2018 Sep;285(18):3324-3336. doi: 10.1111/febs.14492.

Some enriched processes include divalent inorganic cation homeostasis, negative regulation of stem cell proliferation, and gamma-glutamyl transferase activity.","['Hooper, Marcus J', 'Ash, John D']","['Hooper MJ', 'Ash JD']","['Department of Ophthalmology, College of Medicine, University of Florida Health Science Center, Gainesville, FL, USA.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, College of Medicine, University of Florida Health Science Center, Gainesville, FL, USA. jash@ufl.edu.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (Cations)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '9009-81-8 (Rhodopsin)', 'EC 2.3.2.2 (gamma-Glutamyltransferase)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions"", 'Animals', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cations/metabolism', 'Cell Self Renewal', 'Datasets as Topic', 'Ependymoglial Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Photoreceptor Cells, Vertebrate/cytology/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/metabolism', 'Retinal Degeneration/metabolism/pathology', 'Rhodopsin/deficiency/genetics', 'Single-Cell Analysis', 'Tissue Array Analysis', 'Up-Regulation', 'gamma-Glutamyltransferase/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Gene expression', '*Glia', '*Leukemia inhibitory factor', '*Muller cell', '*Neuroprotection', '*Photoreceptor degeneration', '*Retinal degeneration', '*Stress']",2018/05/04 06:00,2019/05/07 06:00,['2018/05/04 06:00'],"['2018/05/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-3-319-75402-4_59 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 2018;1074:479-484. doi: 10.1007/978-3-319-75402-4_59.,,,"['R01 EY016459/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 EY007132/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Neurokinin-1 receptor has been identified in different solid tumors but not frequently in hematopoietic malignant cells. We investigated the presence of the Neurokinin-1 receptor in acute myeloid leukemia cell lines (KG-1 and HL-60), demonstrating that acute myeloid leukemia cell lines overexpress the truncated Neurokinin-1 receptor isoform compared with lymphocytes from healthy donors. Using the MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tet razolium) method, we demonstrated that substance P induced cell proliferation in both acute myeloid leukemia cell lines. We also observed that four different Neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists (L-733,060, L-732,138, CP 96-345 and aprepitant) elicited inhibition of acute myeloid leukemia cell growth lines in a concentration-dependent manner, while growth inhibition was only marginal in lymphocytes; the specific antitumor action of Neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists occurs via the Neurokinin-1 receptor, and leukemia cell death is due to apoptosis. Finally, administration of high doses of daily intraperitoneal fosaprepitant to NOD scid gamma mice previously xenografted with the HL60 cell line increased the median survival from 4 days (control group) to 7 days (treated group) (p = 0.059). Taken together, these findings suggest that Neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists suppress leukemic cell growth and may be considered to be potential antitumor drugs for the treatment of human acute myeloid leukemia.","['Molinos-Quintana, A', 'Trujillo-Hacha, P', 'Piruat, J I', 'Bejarano-Garcia, J A', 'Garcia-Guerrero, E', 'Perez-Simon, J A', 'Munoz, Miguel']","['Molinos-Quintana A', 'Trujillo-Hacha P', 'Piruat JI', 'Bejarano-Garcia JA', 'Garcia-Guerrero E', 'Perez-Simon JA', 'Munoz M']","['Department of Hematology, Pediatric Hematology, Instituto de Biomedicina (IBIS / CISC / CIBERONC), University Hospital Virgen del Rocio, Seville, Spain.', 'University Hospital Virgen del Rocio, Sevilla, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Instituto de Biomedicina de Sevilla (IBIS / CISC / CIBERONC CB16/12/00480), Hospital Universitario Virgen del Rocio, Universidad de Sevilla, Seville, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Instituto de Biomedicina de Sevilla (IBIS / CISC / CIBERONC CB16/12/00480), Hospital Universitario Virgen del Rocio, Universidad de Sevilla, Seville, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Instituto de Biomedicina de Sevilla (IBIS / CISC / CIBERONC CB16/12/00480), Hospital Universitario Virgen del Rocio, Universidad de Sevilla, Seville, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Instituto de Biomedicina de Sevilla (IBIS / CISC / CIBERONC CB16/12/00480), Hospital Universitario Virgen del Rocio, Universidad de Sevilla, Seville, Spain.', 'Research Laboratory on Neuropeptides (IBIS), University Hospital Virgen del Rocio, Av.

METHODS: Mutations in 19 genes as well as leukemia- and patient-related characteristics were analyzed for a group of 47 de novo AML samples with respect to three engraftment outcomes: engraftment ability, engraftment intensity (percentage of hCD45(+) cells) and engraftment latency. Leukemia-related characteristics were additionally analyzed in an extended group of 68 samples that included the 47 de novo samples, and additional 21 samples from refractory and relapsed cases. Engraftment outcomes were compared with overall and event-free survival of the patients. RESULTS: For the 47 de novo samples, no single mutation influenced engraftment, whereas the NPM1 (mut) /DNMT3A (mut) co-mutation was associated with higher engraftment ability. NPM1 (mut) /FLT3-ITD (neg) had lower engraftment intensity. Among leukemia-related characteristics, a complex karyotype was associated with higher engraftment intensity. Among patient-related characteristics, higher cytogenetic risk was associated with higher engraftment intensity, and failure to achieve clinical remission was associated with shorter engraftment latency. In the extended group of 68 samples, white blood count was associated with higher engraftment ability, and the presence of a complex karyotype was associated with higher engraftment intensity. Association with patient overall survival was seen only for engraftment intensity. CONCLUSIONS: The engraftment of AML was influenced by mutation-interactions and other AML characteristics, rather than by single mutated genes, and engraftment intensity best reflected clinical penetrance of AML.","['Culen, Martin', 'Kosarova, Zdenka', 'Jeziskova, Ivana', 'Folta, Adam', 'Chovancova, Jana', 'Loja, Tomas', 'Tom, Nikola', 'Bystry, Vojtech', 'Janeckova, Veronika', 'Dvorakova, Dana', 'Mayer, Jiri', 'Racil, Zdenek']","['Culen M', 'Kosarova Z', 'Jeziskova I', 'Folta A', 'Chovancova J', 'Loja T', 'Tom N', 'Bystry V', 'Janeckova V', 'Dvorakova D', 'Mayer J', 'Racil Z']","['Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, 625 00, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno, Brno, 625 00, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, 625 00, Czech Republic.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, 625 00, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno, Brno, 625 00, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno, Brno, 625 00, Czech Republic.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, 625 00, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno, Brno, 625 00, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, 625 00, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno, Brno, 625 00, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, 625 00, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, 625 00, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno, Brno, 625 00, Czech Republic.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, 625 00, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno, Brno, 625 00, Czech Republic.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, 625 00, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno, Brno, 625 00, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, 625 00, Czech Republic.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, 625 00, Czech Republic. racil.zdenek@fnbrno.cz.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno, Brno, 625 00, Czech Republic. racil.zdenek@fnbrno.cz.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, 625 00, Czech Republic. racil.zdenek@fnbrno.cz.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8710-5352'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180502,Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Heterografts/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*genetics/*pathology', 'Leukocytes', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'Engraftment', 'Mutations', 'NOD SCID gamma', 'Sequencing']",2018/05/04 06:00,2018/06/29 06:00,['2018/05/04 06:00'],"['2018/03/08 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/29 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00432-018-2652-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s00432-018-2652-2 [pii]']",ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2018 Jul;144(7):1239-1251. doi: 10.1007/s00432-018-2652-2.

Unusual variations in color, shape and size of blood cells indicate abnormal condition. We used a total of 117 images from Leishman stained peripheral blood smears acquired at a magnification of 100X. In this paper we present a robust image processing algorithm for detection of nuclei and classification of white blood cells based on features of the nuclei. We used novel image enhancement method to manage illumination variations and TissueQuant method to manage color variations for the detection of nuclei. Dice similarity coefficient of 0.95 was obtained for nucleus detection. We also compared the proposed method with a state-of-the-art method and the proposed method was found to be better. Shape and texture features of the detected nuclei were used for classifying white blood cells. We considered classification of WBCs using two approaches such as 5-class and cell-by-cell approaches using neural network and hybrid-classifier respectively. We compared the results of both the approaches for classification of white blood cells. Cell-by-cell approach offered 1.4% higher sensitivity in comparison with the 5-class approach. We obtained an accuracy of 100% for lymphocyte and basophil detection. Hence, we conclude that lymphocytes and basophils can be accurately detected even when the analysis is limited to the features of nuclei whereas, accurate detection of other types of WBCs will require analysis of the cytoplasm too.","['Hegde, Roopa B', 'Prasad, Keerthana', 'Hebbar, Harishchandra', 'Singh, Brij Mohan Kumar']","['Hegde RB', 'Prasad K', 'Hebbar H', 'Singh BMK']","['School of Information Sciences, MAHE, Manipal, 576104, India.', 'School of Information Sciences, MAHE, Manipal, 576104, India. keerthana.prasad@manipal.edu.', 'School of Information Sciences, MAHE, Manipal, 576104, India.', 'Department of Pathology, Kasturba Medical College, MAHE, Manipal, Karnataka, 574106, India.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180502,United States,J Med Syst,Journal of medical systems,7806056,,IM,"['*Algorithms', 'Cell Nucleus/*classification', 'Hematologic Tests/*methods', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted/*methods', 'Leukocytes/*cytology', '*Neural Networks, Computer']",['NOTNLM'],"['Computer aided detection', 'Nuclei detection', 'Peripheral blood smear images', 'WBC classification']",2018/05/04 06:00,2018/10/16 06:00,['2018/05/04 06:00'],"['2018/02/03 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s10916-018-0962-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s10916-018-0962-1 [pii]']",epublish,J Med Syst. 2018 May 2;42(6):110. doi: 10.1007/s10916-018-0962-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Supporting this strategy, we have reported that chitosan nanoparticles synthesized with a controlled size had selective cytotoxicity in leukemia cells through the mechanism related to reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Herein, we found that the cellular uptake of chitosan nanoparticles was enhanced in a time dependent manner and inhibited the cellular proliferation of leukemia cells in a dose dependent manner with elevation of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) showing a stronger effect on apoptosis, associated with the upregulation of caspase activity and the depletion of reduced glutathione. Propidium iodide and calcein staining demonstrated the central role of the chitosan nanoparticles in triggering elevated ROS, inducing cell death and intracellular oxidative activity. The enhanced free radical scavenging activity of the chitosan nanoparticles further iterates its antioxidant activity. In vitro quantitative phase imaging studies at the single cell level further demonstrated the inhibition of cellular proliferation with significant changes in cellular behavior and this supported our hypothesis. Hemocompatibility tests demonstrated that chitosan nanoparticles could be used safely for in vivo applications. Our findings suggest that chitosan nanoparticles may be a promising redox active candidate for therapeutic applications.","['Sarangapani, Sreelatha', 'Patil, Ajeetkumar', 'Ngeow, Yoke Keng', 'Elsa Mohan, Rosmin', 'Asundi, Anand', 'Lang, Matthew J']","['Sarangapani S', 'Patil A', 'Ngeow YK', 'Elsa Mohan R', 'Asundi A', 'Lang MJ']","['Biosystems & Micromechanics (Biosym) IRG, Singapore MIT Alliance for Research & Technology (SMART), Singapore. sree09latha@gmail.com matt.lang@vanderbilt.edu.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Integr Biol (Camb),Integrative biology : quantitative biosciences from nano to macro,101478378,"['0 (Free Radical Scavengers)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '9012-76-4 (Chitosan)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Biological Transport, Active', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Chitosan/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Free Radical Scavengers/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Materials Testing', 'Nanoparticles/*administration & dosage/*chemistry', 'Nanotechnology', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",,,2018/05/04 06:00,2019/03/15 06:00,['2018/05/04 06:00'],"['2018/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/15 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1039/c8ib00038g [doi]'],ppublish,Integr Biol (Camb). 2018 May 21;10(5):313-324. doi: 10.1039/c8ib00038g.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IFN + AZT combination therapy has shown clinical benefit in ATL, although its mechanism of action remains unclear. We have previously shown that an IFN-responsive FAS promoter polymorphism in a STAT1 binding site (rs1800682) is associated to ATL susceptibility and survival. Recently, CD4 T stem cell memory (TSCM) Fas(hi) cells have been identified as the hierarchical cellular apex of ATL, but a possible link between FAS, apoptosis, proliferation and IFN response in ATL has not been studied. In this study, we found significant ex vivo antiproliferative, antiviral and immunomodulatory effects of IFN-alpha treatment in short-term culture of primary mononuclear cells from ATL patients (n = 25). Bayesian Network analysis allowed us to integrate ex vivo IFN-alpha response with clinical, genetic and immunological data from ATL patients, thereby revealing a central role for FAS -670 polymorphism and apoptosis in the coordinated mechanism of action of IFN-alpha. FAS genotype-dependence of IFN-induced apoptosis was experimentally validated in an independent cohort of healthy controls (n = 20). The same FAS -670 polymorphism also determined CD4 TSCM levels in a genome-wide twin study (p = 7 x 10(-11), n = 460), confirming a genetic link between apoptosis and TSCM levels. Transcriptomic analysis and cell type deconvolution confirmed the FAS genotype/TSCM link and IFN-alpha-induced downregulation of CD4 TSCM-specific genes in ATL patient cells. In conclusion, ex vivo IFN-alpha treatment exerts a pleiotropic effect on primary ATL cells, with a genetic IFN/STAT1/Fas axis determining apoptosis vs. proliferation and underscoring the CD4 TSCM model of ATL leukemogenesis.","['Khouri, Ricardo', 'Silva-Santos, Gilvaneia', 'Dierckx, Tim', 'Menezes, Soraya Maria', 'Decanine, Daniele', 'Theys, Kristof', 'Silva, Aline Clara', 'Farre, Lourdes', 'Bittencourt, Achilea', 'Mangino, Massimo', 'Roederer, Mario', 'Vandamme, Anne-Mieke', 'Van Weyenbergh, Johan']","['Khouri R', 'Silva-Santos G', 'Dierckx T', 'Menezes SM', 'Decanine D', 'Theys K', 'Silva AC', 'Farre L', 'Bittencourt A', 'Mangino M', 'Roederer M', 'Vandamme AM', 'Van Weyenbergh J']","['KU Leuven - University of Leuven, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Rega Institute for Medical Research, Clinical and Epidemiological Virology, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Instituto Goncalo Moniz (IGM) - Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz (FIOCRUZ), Salvador-Bahia, Brazil.', 'Instituto Goncalo Moniz (IGM) - Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz (FIOCRUZ), Salvador-Bahia, Brazil.', 'KU Leuven - University of Leuven, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Rega Institute for Medical Research, Clinical and Epidemiological Virology, Leuven, Belgium.', 'KU Leuven - University of Leuven, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Rega Institute for Medical Research, Clinical and Epidemiological Virology, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Instituto Goncalo Moniz (IGM) - Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz (FIOCRUZ), Salvador-Bahia, Brazil.', 'KU Leuven - University of Leuven, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Rega Institute for Medical Research, Clinical and Epidemiological Virology, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Instituto Goncalo Moniz (IGM) - Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz (FIOCRUZ), Salvador-Bahia, Brazil.', 'Instituto Goncalo Moniz (IGM) - Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz (FIOCRUZ), Salvador-Bahia, Brazil.', 'Department of Pathology, Complexo Hospitalar Universitario Prof Edgard Santos, Universidade Federal da Bahia (UFBA), Salvador-Bahia, Brazil.', ""Department of Twin Research & Genetic Epidemiology, King's College, London, UK."", 'Immunotechnology Section, Vaccine Research Center, NIAID, NIH, Bethesda-MD, USA.', 'KU Leuven - University of Leuven, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Rega Institute for Medical Research, Clinical and Epidemiological Virology, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Center for Global Health and Tropical Medicine, Unidade de Microbiologia, Instituto de Highne e Medicina Tropical, Universidade, Nova de Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal.', 'KU Leuven - University of Leuven, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Rega Institute for Medical Research, Clinical and Epidemiological Virology, Leuven, Belgium.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180213,United States,Oncoimmunology,Oncoimmunology,101570526,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*CD95', '*HTLV-1', '*genetics', '*interferon', '*leukemia', '*lymphoma', '*oncogenesis', '*retrovirus', '*signaling', '*stem cell', '*twins']",2018/05/04 06:00,2018/05/04 06:01,['2018/05/04 06:00'],"['2017/01/17 00:00 [received]', '2018/01/04 00:00 [revised]', '2018/01/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/04 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1080/2162402X.2018.1426423 [doi]', '1426423 [pii]']",epublish,Oncoimmunology. 2018 Feb 13;7(5):e1426423. doi: 10.1080/2162402X.2018.1426423. eCollection 2018.,,,,PMC5927537,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We performed a phase I clinical trial to assess the safety and efficacy of in situ delivery of allogeneic NK cells combined with cetuximab in liver metastasis of gastrointestinal origin. The conditioning chemotherapy was administrated before the allogeneic NK cells injection via hepatic artery. Three escalating doses were tested (3.10(6), 8.10(6) and 12.10(6) NK cells/kg) following by a high-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2). Cetuximab was administered intravenously every week for 7 weeks. Nine patients with liver metastases of colorectal or pancreatic cancers were included, three per dose level. Hepatic artery injection was successfully performed in all patients with no report of dose-limiting toxicity. Two patients had febrile aplasia requiring a short-term antibiotherapy. Grade 3/4 anemia and thrombopenia were also observed related to the chemotherapy. Objective clinical responses were documented in 3 patients and among them 2 occurred in patients injected with cell products harboring two KIR ligand mismatches and one in a patient with one KIR ligand mismatch. Immune monitoring revealed that most patients presented an increase but transient of IL-15 and IL-7 cytokines levels one week after chemotherapy. Furthermore, a high expansion of FoxP3(+)regulatory T cells and PD-1(+) T cells was observed in all patients, related to IL-2 administration. Our results demonstrated that combining allogeneic NK cells transfer via intra-hepatic artery, cetuximab and a high-dose IL-2 is feasible, well tolerated and may result in clinical responses.","['Adotevi, O', 'Godet, Y', 'Galaine, J', 'Lakkis, Z', 'Idirene, I', 'Certoux, J M', 'Jary, M', 'Loyon, R', 'Laheurte, C', 'Kim, S', 'Dormoy, A', 'Pouthier, F', 'Barisien, C', 'Fein, F', 'Tiberghien, P', 'Pivot, X', 'Valmary-Degano, S', 'Ferrand, C', 'Morel, P', 'Delabrousse, E', 'Borg, C']","['Adotevi O', 'Godet Y', 'Galaine J', 'Lakkis Z', 'Idirene I', 'Certoux JM', 'Jary M', 'Loyon R', 'Laheurte C', 'Kim S', 'Dormoy A', 'Pouthier F', 'Barisien C', 'Fein F', 'Tiberghien P', 'Pivot X', 'Valmary-Degano S', 'Ferrand C', 'Morel P', 'Delabrousse E', 'Borg C']","['University Bourgogne Franche-Comte, INSERM, EFS BFC, UMR1098, Interactions Hote-Greffon-Tumeur/Ingenierie Cellulaire et Genique, F-25000 Besancon, France.', 'University Hospital of Besancon, Department of Medical Oncology, F-25000 Besancon, France.', 'University Bourgogne Franche-Comte, INSERM, EFS BFC, UMR1098, Interactions Hote-Greffon-Tumeur/Ingenierie Cellulaire et Genique, F-25000 Besancon, France.', 'University Bourgogne Franche-Comte, INSERM, EFS BFC, UMR1098, Interactions Hote-Greffon-Tumeur/Ingenierie Cellulaire et Genique, F-25000 Besancon, France.', 'University Hospital of Besancon, Department of Gastrointestinal and liver surgery, F-25000 Besancon, France.', 'University Bourgogne Franche-Comte, INSERM, EFS BFC, UMR1098, Interactions Hote-Greffon-Tumeur/Ingenierie Cellulaire et Genique, F-25000 Besancon, France.', 'University Bourgogne Franche-Comte, INSERM, EFS BFC, UMR1098, Interactions Hote-Greffon-Tumeur/Ingenierie Cellulaire et Genique, F-25000 Besancon, France.', 'University Bourgogne Franche-Comte, INSERM, EFS BFC, UMR1098, Interactions Hote-Greffon-Tumeur/Ingenierie Cellulaire et Genique, F-25000 Besancon, France.', 'University Hospital of Besancon, Department of Medical Oncology, F-25000 Besancon, France.', 'University Bourgogne Franche-Comte, INSERM, EFS BFC, UMR1098, Interactions Hote-Greffon-Tumeur/Ingenierie Cellulaire et Genique, F-25000 Besancon, France.', 'University Bourgogne Franche-Comte, INSERM, EFS BFC, UMR1098, Interactions Hote-Greffon-Tumeur/Ingenierie Cellulaire et Genique, F-25000 Besancon, France.', 'Etablissement Francais du Sang Bourgogne Franche-Comte, plateforme de BioMonitoring, F-25000 Besancon, France.', 'INSERM CIC-1431, University Hospital of Besancon, Clinical Investigation Center in Biotherapy, F-25000, Besancon, France.', 'University Hospital of Besancon, Department of Medical Oncology, F-25000 Besancon, France.', 'Etablissement Francais du Sang Bourgogne Franche-Comte, F-25000 Besancon, France.', 'Etablissement Francais du Sang Bourgogne Franche-Comte, F-25000 Besancon, France.', 'Etablissement Francais du Sang Bourgogne Franche-Comte, F-25000 Besancon, France.', 'University Hospital of Besancon, Department of Gastroenterology, F-25000 Besancon, France.', 'University Bourgogne Franche-Comte, INSERM, EFS BFC, UMR1098, Interactions Hote-Greffon-Tumeur/Ingenierie Cellulaire et Genique, F-25000 Besancon, France.', 'University Bourgogne Franche-Comte, INSERM, EFS BFC, UMR1098, Interactions Hote-Greffon-Tumeur/Ingenierie Cellulaire et Genique, F-25000 Besancon, France.', 'University Hospital of Besancon, Department of Medical Oncology, F-25000 Besancon, France.', 'University Bourgogne Franche-Comte, INSERM, EFS BFC, UMR1098, Interactions Hote-Greffon-Tumeur/Ingenierie Cellulaire et Genique, F-25000 Besancon, France.', 'University Hospital of Besancon, Department of Pathology, F-25000 Besancon, France.', 'University Bourgogne Franche-Comte, INSERM, EFS BFC, UMR1098, Interactions Hote-Greffon-Tumeur/Ingenierie Cellulaire et Genique, F-25000 Besancon, France.', 'Etablissement Francais du Sang Bourgogne Franche-Comte, F-25000 Besancon, France.', 'University Hospital of Besancon, Department of Radiology, F-25000, Besancon, France.', 'University Bourgogne Franche-Comte, INSERM, EFS BFC, UMR1098, Interactions Hote-Greffon-Tumeur/Ingenierie Cellulaire et Genique, F-25000 Besancon, France.', 'University Hospital of Besancon, Department of Medical Oncology, F-25000 Besancon, France.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180319,United States,Oncoimmunology,Oncoimmunology,101570526,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*NK cell', '*adoptive cell transfer', '*cetuximab', '*intrahepatic infusion']",2018/05/04 06:00,2018/05/04 06:01,['2018/05/04 06:00'],"['2017/09/29 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/16 00:00 [revised]', '2018/01/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/04 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1080/2162402X.2018.1424673 [doi]', '1424673 [pii]']",epublish,Oncoimmunology. 2018 Mar 19;7(5):e1424673. doi: 10.1080/2162402X.2018.1424673. eCollection 2018.,,,,PMC5927529,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In these situations, some cases of AML-M5 tend to be misdiagnosed as AML-M0. Therefore, we evaluated the significance of weak or faint alpha-NB staining in AML-M5 diagnosed by flow cytometry (FCM). Nineteen AML cases in which leukemic cells were negative for naphthol AS-D chloroacetate esterase staining were studied. For FCM, we defined leukemic cells as having a monocytic nature when more than 10% of the leukemic cells were positive for at least one of the following antigens: CD4, CD11c, CD14, and CD64. The monocytic nature determined by FCM was consistent with positive or weak positivity on alpha-NB staining. Five of 6 cases in which leukemic cells exhibited faint positivity for alpha-NB staining could be diagnosed as AML-M5 by FCM, while negative alpha-NB staining was consistent with a diagnosis of AML-M0. These results suggest that AML-M5 should be taken into consideration even when leukemic cells are faintly positive for alpha-NB staining.","['Zushi, Yuriko', 'Sasaki, Miho', 'Mori, Ayano', 'Saitoh, Toshiharu', 'Goka, Takae', 'Aoyama, Yumi', 'Goto, Yuta', 'Tsunemine, Hiroko', 'Kodaka, Taiichi', 'Takahashi, Takayuki']","['Zushi Y', 'Sasaki M', 'Mori A', 'Saitoh T', 'Goka T', 'Aoyama Y', 'Goto Y', 'Tsunemine H', 'Kodaka T', 'Takahashi T']","['Cell Therapy.', 'Cell Therapy.', 'Cell Therapy.', 'Cell Therapy.', 'Laboratory Medicine.', 'Hematology, Shinko Hospital, Kobe, Japan.', 'Hematology, Shinko Hospital, Kobe, Japan.', 'Hematology, Shinko Hospital, Kobe, Japan.', 'Hematology, Shinko Hospital, Kobe, Japan.', 'Hematology, Shinko Hospital, Kobe, Japan.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180329,Italy,Hematol Rep,Hematology reports,101556723,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML-M0', 'AML-M5', 'flow cytometry', 'surface monocytic antigen', 'alpha-naphthyl butyrate esterase staining']",2018/05/04 06:00,2018/05/04 06:01,['2018/05/04 06:00'],"['2017/10/05 00:00 [received]', '2018/02/07 00:00 [revised]', '2018/02/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/04 06:01 [medline]']",['10.4081/hr.2018.7435 [doi]'],epublish,Hematol Rep. 2018 Mar 29;10(1):7435. doi: 10.4081/hr.2018.7435. eCollection 2018 Mar 2.,,,,PMC5907644,,,['Conflict of interest: The authors declare no potential conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,

We performed targeted deep sequencing in 39 patients with high-risk MDS and secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML) at diagnosis and follow-up (response and/or relapse), with the aim to define their mutational status, to establish if specific mutations are biomarkers of response to 5-azacytidine (AZA) and/or may have impact on survival. Overall, 95% of patients harbored at least one mutation. TP53, DNMT3A and SRSF2 were the most frequently altered genes. Mutations in TP53 correlated with higher risk features and shorter overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) in univariate analysis. Patients with SRSF2 mutations were associated with better OS and PFS. Response rate was 55%; but we could not correlate the presence of TET2 and TP53 mutations with AZA response. Patients with sAML presented more variations than patients with high-risk MDS, and usually at relapse the number of mutations increased, supporting the idea that in advanced stages of the disease there is a greater genomic complexity. These results confirm that mutation analysis can add prognostic value to high-risk MDS and sAML patients, not only at diagnosis but also at follow-up.","['Cabezon, Marta', 'Bargay, Joan', 'Xicoy, Blanca', 'Garcia, Olga', 'Borras, Josep', 'Tormo, Mar', 'Marce, Silvia', 'Pedro, Carme', 'Valcarcel, David', 'Jimenez, Maria-Jose', 'Guardia, Ramon', 'Palomo, Laura', 'Brunet, Salut', 'Vall-Llovera, Ferran', 'Garcia, Antoni', 'Feliu, Evarist', 'Zamora, Lurdes']","['Cabezon M', 'Bargay J', 'Xicoy B', 'Garcia O', 'Borras J', 'Tormo M', 'Marce S', 'Pedro C', 'Valcarcel D', 'Jimenez MJ', 'Guardia R', 'Palomo L', 'Brunet S', 'Vall-Llovera F', 'Garcia A', 'Feliu E', 'Zamora L']","['Hematology Service, ICO Badalona-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.', 'Departament de Medicina, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.', 'Hematology Service, Hospital Son Llatzer, Mallorca, Spain.', 'Hematology Service, ICO Badalona-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, Campus Germans Trias i Pujol, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.', 'Hematology Service, Hospital Son Llatzer, Mallorca, Spain.', 'Hematology Service, Hospital Clinic de Valencia, Valencia, Spain.', 'Hematology Service, ICO Badalona-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.', 'Hematology Service, Hospital del Mar, Barcelona, Spain.', ""Hematology Service, Hospital Vall d'Hebron, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Hematology Service, ICO Badalona-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.', 'Hematology Service, ICO Girona-Hospital Josep Trueta, Girona, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, Campus Germans Trias i Pujol, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.', 'Hematology Service, Hospital de Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematology Service, Hospital Mutua de Terrassa, Terrassa, Spain.', 'Hematology Service, Hospital Arnau de Vilanova, Lleida, Spain.', 'Hematology Service, ICO Badalona-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.', 'Hematology Service, ICO Badalona-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180410,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['5-azacytidine', 'myelodysplastic syndromes', 'prognostic factors', 'secondary acute myeloid leukemia', 'targeted deep sequencing']",2018/05/04 06:00,2018/05/04 06:01,['2018/05/04 06:00'],"['2017/12/06 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/04 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.25046 [doi]', '25046 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2018 Apr 10;9(27):19342-19355. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.25046. eCollection 2018 Apr 10.,,,,PMC5922401,,,"['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors have no potential conflicts of interest to', 'disclose.']",,,['CETLAM Group'],,,,,,,,

We investigated DSB, apoptosis and PFG in the backtracked UCB cells of leukemic patients. RNA from UCB of three patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, patient with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia and Down syndrome, and four healthy children was screened for common PFG by RT-qPCR. Presence of PFG was validated by sequencing. Endogenous gammaH2AX and 53BP1 DNA repair foci, cell populations, and apoptosis were analyzed in UCB CD34+/- cells with imaging and standard flow cytometry. We found MLL2-AF4 and BCR-ABL (p190) fusion genes in UCB of two out from four pediatric patients, apparently not detected at diagnosis, while UCB cells of TEL-AML1+ ALL patient were tested negative for this PFG and no PFG were detected in UCB cells of healthy children. No significant difference in DNA damage and apoptosis between UCB CD34+/- cells from healthy children and leukemic patients was observed, while Down syndrome trisomy increased DNA damage and resulted in distribution of cell populations resembling transient abnormal myelopoiesis.

This study aimed to analyze the possible role of chosen micro RNAs as markers of prognosis in patients with CLL. We assessed the expression of miR-21, miR-34a, miR-181a, miR-199a/b and miR-221 in previously separated leukemic cells with the use of qRQ-PCR technique at the moment of diagnosis. The results were then analyzed in regards to presence of prognostic factors, clinical data and the end points like progression free survival (PFS), time to progression (TP) and overall survival time (OS). We detected significant correlations between expression of the analyzed micro RNAs and CLL prognostic markers particularly as far as miR-221 and miR-181a were concerned. The subsequent analysis revealed that high expression of miR-34a and miR-181a as well as low miR-21 expression indicated longer TTP, while miR-221 was predictor of OS.

New therapies are needed to target oncogene-driven leukemia stem cells, which account for relapse and resistance. Chromosome translocation t(8;21), which produces RUNX1-ETO (R-E) fusion oncoprotein, is found in ~13% AML. R-E dominance negatively inhibits global gene expression regulated by RUNX1, a master transcription factor for hematopoiesis, causing increased self-renewal and blocked cell differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells, and eventually leukemia initiation. Methods: Connectivity-Map followed by biological activity testing were used to identify candidate compounds that can inhibit R-E-mediated gene transcription. Molecular mechanistic studies were also performed. Results: Glucocorticoid drugs, such as betamethasone and dexamethasone, were found to exhibit potent and selective in vitro and in vivo activities against R-E leukemia, as well as strong synergy when combined with chemotherapeutics. Microarray analysis showed that treatment with glucocorticoids significantly inhibited R-E's activity and reactivated that of RUNX1. Such gene expression changes caused differentiation and apoptosis of R-E leukemia cells. Our studies also show a possible molecular mechanism for the targeted therapy. Upon treatment with a glucocorticoid drug, more glucocorticoid receptor (GR) was translocated into the nucleus and bound to DNA, including promoters of RUNX1 target genes. GR was found to associate with RUNX1, but not R-E. This interaction increased binding of RUNX1 to DNA and reduced that of R-E, shifting to a RUNX1 dominance. Conclusion: Glucocorticoid drugs represent a targeted therapy for AML with chromosome translocation t(8:21). Given their high activity, favorable human pharmacokinetics as well as synergy with chemotherapeutics, glucocorticoids could be clinically useful to treat R-E AML.","['Lu, Lianghao', 'Wen, Yefei', 'Yao, Yuan', 'Chen, Fengju', 'Wang, Guohui', 'Wu, Fangrui', 'Wu, Jingyu', 'Narayanan, Padmini', 'Redell, Michele', 'Mo, Qianxing', 'Song, Yongcheng']","['Lu L', 'Wen Y', 'Yao Y', 'Chen F', 'Wang G', 'Wu F', 'Wu J', 'Narayanan P', 'Redell M', 'Mo Q', 'Song Y']","['Department of Pharmacology and Chemical Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, 1 Baylor Plaza, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Chemical Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, 1 Baylor Plaza, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Chemical Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, 1 Baylor Plaza, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Dan L.

We now show that FGFR1 activation is associated with upregulation of MYC and pharmacological suppression of FGFR1 activation leads to downregulation of MYC and suppression of MYC target genes. Luciferase reporter assays demonstrate that FGFR1 can directly regulate MYC expression and this effect is enhanced in the presence of chimeric FGFR1 kinases. In SCLL cells, a truncated form of FGFR1 is generated by granzyme B cleavage of the chimeric kinases, producing a nucleus-restricted derivative that can bind MYC regulatory regions. Mutation of the granzyme B cleavage site prevents relocation to the nucleus but does not suppress MYC activation, suggesting additional mechanisms of MYC activation in the presence of cytoplasm-restricted chimeric kinases. We show that one of these mechanisms involves activating cytoplasmic STAT5, which upregulates MYC independent of the truncated FGFR1 kinase. Targeting MYC function using shRNA knockdown and 10054-F8 in SCLL cells leads to inhibition of cell proliferation and synergizes with the BGJ398 FGFR1 inhibitor, suggesting a combination therapy that could be used in the treatment of SCLL.","['Hu, Tianxiang', 'Wu, Qing', 'Chong, Yating', 'Qin, Haiyan', 'Poole, Candace J', 'van Riggelen, Jan', 'Ren, Mingqiang', 'Cowell, John K']","['Hu T', 'Wu Q', 'Chong Y', 'Qin H', 'Poole CJ', 'van Riggelen J', 'Ren M', 'Cowell JK']","['Georgia Cancer Center, Augusta University, Augusta, GA, 30912, USA.', 'Georgia Cancer Center, Augusta University, Augusta, GA, 30912, USA.', 'Georgia Cancer Center, Augusta University, Augusta, GA, 30912, USA.', 'Georgia Cancer Center, Augusta University, Augusta, GA, 30912, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Augusta University, Augusta, GA, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Augusta University, Augusta, GA, USA.', 'Consortium for Health and Military Performance (CHAMP), Department of Military and Emergency Medicine, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, 4301 Jones Bridge Road, Bethesda, MD, 20814, USA. mingqiang.ren.ctr@usuhs.edu.', 'Georgia Cancer Center, Augusta University, Augusta, GA, 30912, USA. jcowell@augusta.edu.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20180402,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', 'A4055ME1VK (infigratinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FGFR1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects/genetics', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects/genetics', 'Genes, myc/*genetics', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Mutation/drug effects/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Phenylurea Compounds/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1/*genetics', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/genetics', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects/genetics']",,,2018/05/04 06:00,2019/06/14 06:00,['2018/05/04 06:00'],"['2017/11/07 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/03/07 00:00 [revised]', '2018/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-018-0124-y [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-018-0124-y [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2018 Nov;32(11):2363-2373. doi: 10.1038/s41375-018-0124-y.

Patients with these high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities, as well as those who are elderly and transplant ineligible, have not experienced the same degree of improved survival outcomes that other patients have seen with recent advances in the treatment of multiple myeloma. To date, no treatment regimen has demonstrated sustained and consistent survival benefits in elderly, transplant-ineligible patients with high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities and newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. Thus, there is an unmet need to identify effective treatment options for these patients and achieve outcomes parity with standard-risk patients. In this review, we assessed clinical trials of both doublet and triplet regimens for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma that included elderly, transplant-ineligible patients with high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities and that provided outcomes data stratified by cytogenetic risk status. We concluded that regimens containing an IMiD agent as the foundation of therapy, combined with agents that have synergistic mechanisms of action-including novel therapies-may in future investigations help overcome the poor prognosis of high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities in this vulnerable patient population.","['Avet-Loiseau, Herve', 'Facon, Thierry']","['Avet-Loiseau H', 'Facon T']","['Unite de Genomique du Myelome, CHU Rangueil, Toulouse, France. avet-loiseau.h@chu-toulouse.fr.', 'Service des Maladies du Sang, Hopital Claude Huriez, Lille, France.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20180328,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cytogenetics', 'Humans', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality']",,,2018/05/04 06:00,2019/04/02 06:00,['2018/05/04 06:00'],"['2017/12/12 00:00 [received]', '2018/02/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/02/12 00:00 [revised]', '2018/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/02 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-018-0098-9 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-018-0098-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2018 Jun;32(6):1267-1276. doi: 10.1038/s41375-018-0098-9.

These mutations are often subclonal and their biological impact remains unclear. Using a retroviral acute myeloid mouse leukemia model, we demonstrate that FLT3 (ITD) , FLT3 (N676K) , and NRAS (G12D) accelerate KMT2A-MLLT3 leukemia onset. Further, also subclonal FLT3 (N676K) mutations accelerate disease, possibly by providing stimulatory factors. Herein, we show that one such factor, MIF, promotes survival of mouse KMT2A-MLLT3 leukemia initiating cells. We identify acquired de novo mutations in Braf, Cbl, Kras, and Ptpn11 in KMT2A-MLLT3 leukemia cells that favored clonal expansion.

We sought to identify distinctive features of AML cells for universal MRD monitoring. METHODS: We compared genome-wide gene expression of AML cells from 157 patients with that of normal myeloblasts. Markers encoded by aberrantly expressed genes, including some previously associated with leukemia stem cells, were studied by flow cytometry in 240 patients with AML and in nonleukemic myeloblasts from 63 bone marrow samples. RESULTS: Twenty-two (CD9, CD18, CD25, CD32, CD44, CD47, CD52, CD54, CD59, CD64, CD68, CD86, CD93, CD96, CD97, CD99, CD123, CD200, CD300a/c, CD366, CD371, and CX3CR1) markers were aberrantly expressed in AML. Leukemia-associated profiles defined by these markers extended to immature CD34+CD38- AML cells; expression remained stable during treatment. The markers yielded MRD measurements matching those of standard methods in 208 samples from 52 patients undergoing chemotherapy and revealed otherwise undetectable MRD. They allowed MRD monitoring in 129 consecutive patients, yielding prognostically significant results. Using a machine-learning algorithm to reduce high-dimensional data sets to 2-dimensional data, the markers allowed a clear visualization of MRD and could detect 1 leukemic cell among more than 100,000 normal cells. CONCLUSION: The markers uncovered in this study allow universal and sensitive monitoring of MRD in AML. In combination with contemporary analytical tools, the markers improve the discrimination between leukemic and normal cells, thus facilitating data interpretation and, hence, the reliability of MRD results.

This observation has potentially important consequences for treating life-threatening human viral infections. Here, we investigated the role of neutrophils in this effect. Neutrophils are innate immunity effector cells with well-established microbe-killing activities that are rapidly mobilized upon infection. They are also emerging as orchestrators of innate and adaptive immunities. However, their immunomodulatory activity during antiviral mAb immunotherapies has never been studied. Our data reveal that neutrophils have an essential role in immunotherapy-induced immune protection of infected mice. Unexpectedly, neutrophils have a limited effect in controlling viral propagation upon passive immunotherapy administration, which is mostly mediated by NK cells. Instead, neutrophils operate as essential inducers of a potent host humoral antiviral response. Thus, neutrophils play an unexpected key role in protective immunity induction by antiviral mAbs. Our work opens approaches to improve antiviral immunotherapies, as it suggests that preserving neutrophil functions and counts might be required for achieving mAb-induced protective immunity.","['Naranjo-Gomez, Mar', 'Lambour, Jennifer', 'Piechaczyk, Marc', 'Pelegrin, Mireia']","['Naranjo-Gomez M', 'Lambour J', 'Piechaczyk M', 'Pelegrin M']",,,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180503,United States,JCI Insight,JCI insight,101676073,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Immunity, Humoral', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Immunotherapy', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', '*Leukemia Virus, Murine', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Neutrophils/*immunology', 'Retroviridae Infections/*immunology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*immunology', '*Virus Replication']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Adaptive immunity', '*Immunotherapy', '*Infectious disease', '*Neutrophils', '*Therapeutics']",2018/05/04 06:00,2019/12/24 06:00,['2018/05/04 06:00'],"['2017/09/06 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/24 06:00 [medline]']","['97339 [pii]', '10.1172/jci.insight.97339 [doi]']",epublish,JCI Insight. 2018 May 3;3(9). pii: 97339. doi: 10.1172/jci.insight.97339.,,,,PMC6012508,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It requires strict adherence by patients and lifelong medication, which can lower the viral load below detection limits and prevent HIV-associated immunodeficiency but cannot cure patients. The bispecific T cell-engaging (BiTE) antibody technology has demonstrated long-term relapse-free outcomes in patients with relapsed and refractory acute lymphocytic leukemia. Here, we generated BiTE antibody constructs that target the HIV-1 envelope protein gp120 (HIV gp120) using either the scFv B12 or VRC01, the first two extracellular domains (1 + 2) of human CD4 alone or joined to the single chain variable fragment (scFv) of the antibody 17b fused to an anti-human CD3epsilon scFv. These engineered human BiTE antibody constructs showed engagement of T cells for redirected lysis of HIV gp120-transfected CHO cells. Furthermore, they substantially inhibited HIV-1 replication in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as well as in macrophages cocultured with autologous CD8(+) T cells, the most potent being the human CD4(1 + 2) BiTE [termed CD(1 + 2) h BiTE] antibody construct and the CD4(1 + 2)L17b BiTE antibody construct. The CD4(1 + 2) h BiTE antibody construct promoted HIV infection of human CD4(-)/CD8(+) T cells. In contrast, the neutralizing B12 and the VRC01 BiTE antibody constructs, as well as the CD4(1 + 2)L17b BiTE antibody construct, did not. Thus, BiTE antibody constructs targeting HIV gp120 are very promising for constraining HIV and warrant further development as novel antiviral therapy with curative potential.IMPORTANCE HIV is a chronic infection well controlled with the current cART. However, we lack a cure for HIV, and the HIV pandemic goes on. Here, we showed in vitro and ex vivo that a BiTE antibody construct targeting HIV gp120 resulted in substantially reduced HIV replication. In addition, these BiTE antibody constructs display efficient killing of gp120-expressing cells and inhibited replication in ex vivo HIV-infected PBMCs or macrophages. We believe that BiTE antibody constructs recognizing HIV gp120 could be a very valuable strategy for a cure of HIV in combination with cART and compounds which reverse latency.","['Brozy, Johannes', 'Schlaepfer, Erika', 'Mueller, Christina K S', 'Rochat, Mary-Aude', 'Rampini, Silvana K', 'Myburgh, Renier', 'Raum, Tobias', 'Kufer, Peter', 'Baeuerle, Patrick A', 'Muenz, Markus', 'Speck, Roberto F']","['Brozy J', 'Schlaepfer E', 'Mueller CKS', 'Rochat MA', 'Rampini SK', 'Myburgh R', 'Raum T', 'Kufer P', 'Baeuerle PA', 'Muenz M', 'Speck RF']","['Amgen Research Munich GmbH, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases and Hospital Epidemiology, University Hospital of Zurich, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases and Hospital Epidemiology, University Hospital of Zurich, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases and Hospital Epidemiology, University Hospital of Zurich, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Clinic and Policlinic for Internal Medicine, University Hospital of Zurich, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases and Hospital Epidemiology, University Hospital of Zurich, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Amgen Research Munich GmbH, Munich, Germany.', 'Amgen Research Munich GmbH, Munich, Germany.', 'Amgen Research Munich GmbH, Munich, Germany.', 'Amgen Research Munich GmbH, Munich, Germany mmuenz@amgen.com Roberto.speck@usz.ch.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases and Hospital Epidemiology, University Hospital of Zurich, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland mmuenz@amgen.com Roberto.speck@usz.ch.']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8453-1137'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180629,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (HIV Antibodies)', '0 (HIV Envelope Protein gp120)', '0 (gp120 protein, Human immunodeficiency virus 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Bispecific/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Antiviral Agents/*therapeutic use', 'CHO Cells', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'HIV Antibodies/immunology', 'HIV Envelope Protein gp120/*immunology', 'HIV Infections/*drug therapy/immunology/virology', 'HIV-1/drug effects/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/immunology/virology', 'Protein Binding', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Virus Replication/drug effects/immunology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*CD8+ T cells', '*HIV', '*bispecific T-cell-engaging antibodies', '*broadly neutralizing antibodies', '*macrophages']",2018/05/04 06:00,2018/07/25 06:00,['2018/05/04 06:00'],"['2018/03/23 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/25 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.00491-18 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00491-18 [doi]']",epublish,J Virol. 2018 Jun 29;92(14). pii: JVI.00491-18. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00491-18.

Herein, we report a large cohort of children with ALAL and propose a treatment strategy. A retrospective multinational study (International Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster Study of Leukemias of Ambiguous Lineage [iBFM-AMBI2012]) of 233 cases of pediatric ALAL patients is presented. Survival statistics were used to compare the prognosis of subsets and types of treatment. Five-year event-free survival (EFS) of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)-type primary therapy (80% +/- 4%) was superior to that of children who received acute myeloid leukemia (AML)-type or combined-type treatment (36% +/- 7.2% and 50% +/- 12%, respectively). When ALL- or AML-specific gene fusions were excluded, 5-year EFS of CD19(+) leukemia was 83% +/- 5.3% on ALL-type primary treatment compared with 0% +/- 0% and 28% +/- 14% on AML-type and combined-type primary treatment, respectively. Superiority of ALL-type treatment was documented in single-population mixed phenotype ALAL (using World Health Organization and/or European Group for Immunophenotyping of Leukemia definitions) and bilineal ALAL. Treatment with ALL-type protocols is recommended for the majority of pediatric patients with ALAL, including cases with CD19(+) ALAL. AML-type treatment is preferred in a minority of ALAL cases with CD19(-) and no other lymphoid features. No overall benefit of transplantation was documented, and it could be introduced in some patients with a poor response to treatment. As no clear indicator was found for a change in treatment type, this is to be considered only in cases with >/=5% blasts after remission induction.

Therapies that overcome differentiation arrest have emerged as a powerful strategy for treating AML, but targeting leukemia differentiation remains challenging, mainly because of an incomplete mechanistic understanding of the process. Here, we unveil a new role for cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) in blocking myeloid differentiation in AML. We show that among several interphase CDK, only CDK2 undergoes ubiquitin-dependent proteasome degradation, which is accompanied by AML cell differentiation. By using the yeast 2-hybrid system and functional analyses, KLHL6 was identified as a specific E3 ubiquitin ligase regulating the degradation of CDK2. Importantly, inhibiting CDK2, but not other cyclin-dependent kinases CDK1/4/6, effectively induced granulocytic differentiation in AML cell lines and 5 major subtypes of primary patient-derived AML samples. Mechanistically, CDK2 depletion led to the reactivation of differentiation pathway translation, and the differentiation blockade function of CDK2 may be achieved directly by maintaining the activity of PRDX2. Finally, CDK2 depletion arrested tumor growth of AML cells in nude mice and extended survival in both AML cell line and PDX-AML cells derived xenograft mouse models. Thus, our work not only provides experimental evidence for validating CDK2 as a potential therapeutic target for differentiation, but also uncovers the biological function of the CDK2-PRDX2 axis in blocking AML differentiation.","['Ying, Meidan', 'Shao, Xuejing', 'Jing, Hui', 'Liu, Yujia', 'Qi, Xiaotian', 'Cao, Ji', 'Chen, Yingqian', 'Xiang, Senfeng', 'Song, Hua', 'Hu, Ronggui', 'Wei, Guoqing', 'Yang, Bo', 'He, Qiaojun']","['Ying M', 'Shao X', 'Jing H', 'Liu Y', 'Qi X', 'Cao J', 'Chen Y', 'Xiang S', 'Song H', 'Hu R', 'Wei G', 'Yang B', 'He Q']","['Zhejiang Province Key Laboratory of Anti-Cancer Drug Research, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Zhejiang Province Key Laboratory of Anti-Cancer Drug Research, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Zhejiang Province Key Laboratory of Anti-Cancer Drug Research, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Zhejiang Province Key Laboratory of Anti-Cancer Drug Research, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Zhejiang Province Key Laboratory of Anti-Cancer Drug Research, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Zhejiang Province Key Laboratory of Anti-Cancer Drug Research, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Zhejiang Province Key Laboratory of Anti-Cancer Drug Research, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Zhejiang Province Key Laboratory of Anti-Cancer Drug Research, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', ""Department of Hematology-Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China."", 'Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) Key Laboratory of Systems Biology, CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Innovation Center for Cell Signaling Network, Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China; and.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Zhejiang Province Key Laboratory of Anti-Cancer Drug Research, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Zhejiang Province Key Laboratory of Anti-Cancer Drug Research, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180502,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (KLHL6 protein, human)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', 'EC 1.11.1.15 (PRDX2 protein, human)', 'EC 1.11.1.15 (Peroxiredoxins)', 'EC 1.11.1.15 (Prdx2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cdk2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Granulocytes/cytology/metabolism/pathology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice, Nude', 'Peroxiredoxins/*metabolism', 'Proteolysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Ubiquitin/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitination']",,,2018/05/04 06:00,2019/07/10 06:00,['2018/05/04 06:00'],"['2017/10/25 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/10 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)32164-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2017-10-813139 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2018 Jun 14;131(24):2698-2711. doi: 10.1182/blood-2017-10-813139.

The median overall survival for adult patients is 9-13 months. Pediatric patients are exceedingly rare with an unclear clinical course. Currently, no standardized therapy has been established, although an acute lymphoblastic leukemia type of treatment appears to be more effective in those patients who are able to tolerate aggressive chemotherapy. SL-401 is a targeted therapy directed to CD123, a protein ubiquitously expressed at high level on the surface of BPDCN blasts. In adult phase 2 trials, it has demonstrated efficacy with 90% overall response rate. No pediatric patients with BPDCN using SL-401 have been reported. CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we report the first pediatric experience of three children with BPDCN treated with SL-401 at our institution. All patients tolerated SL-401 without significant toxicities. One patient with multiply relapsed and refractory disease had no response. The other two cases had significant and rapid clinical improvement after the two courses of treatment. However, the response was transient, and growth of soft tissue mass was observed in-between cycles in both patients with large tumor burden. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of SL-401 in pediatric patients with BPDCN. Sl-401 was well tolerated and can produce a promising response. Further testing this agent in children is warranted.","['Sun, Weili', 'Liu, Huaying', 'Kim, Young', 'Karras, Nicole', 'Pawlowska, Anna', 'Toomey, Debbie', 'Kyono, Wade', 'Gaynon, Paul', 'Rosenthal, Joseph', 'Stein, Anthony']","['Sun W', 'Liu H', 'Kim Y', 'Karras N', 'Pawlowska A', 'Toomey D', 'Kyono W', 'Gaynon P', 'Rosenthal J', 'Stein A']","['Department of Pediatrics, City of Hope National Medical Center, 1500 E.

Radiation risks of CLL significantly increased with increasing bone marrow radiation doses. Current analysis aimed to clarify whether the increased risks were due to radiation or to genetic mutations in the Ukrainian population. METHODS: A detailed characterization of the genomic landscape was performed in a unique sample of 16 UR-CLL patients and age- and sex-matched unexposed general population Ukrainian-CLL (UN-CLL) and Western-CLL (W-CLL) patients (n = 28 and 100, respectively). RESULTS: Mutations in telomere-maintenance pathway genes POT1 and ATM were more frequent in UR-CLL compared to UN-CLL and W-CLL (both p < 0.05). No significant enrichment in copy-number abnormalities at del13q14, del11q, del17p or trisomy12 was identified in UR-CLL compared to other groups. Type of work performed in the Chornobyl zone, age at exposure and at diagnosis, calendar time, and Rai stage were significant predictors of total genetic lesions (all p < 0.05). Tumor telomere length was significantly longer in UR-CLL than in UN-CLL (p = 0.009) and was associated with the POT1 mutation and survival. CONCLUSIONS: No significant enrichment in copy-number abnormalities at CLL-associated genes was identified in UR-CLL compared to other groups. The novel associations between radiation exposure, telomere maintenance and CLL prognosis identified in this unique case series provide suggestive, though limited data and merit further investigation.","['Ojha, Juhi', 'Dyagil, Iryna', 'Finch, Stuart C', 'Reiss, Robert F', 'de Smith, Adam J', 'Gonseth, Semira', 'Zhou, Mi', 'Hansen, Helen M', 'Sherborne, Amy L', 'Nakamura, Jean', 'Bracci, Paige M', 'Gudzenko, Nataliya', 'Hatch, Maureen', 'Babkina, Nataliya', 'Little, Mark P', 'Chumak, Vadim V', 'Walsh, Kyle M', 'Bazyka, Dimitry', 'Wiemels, Joseph L', 'Zablotska, Lydia B']","['Ojha J', 'Dyagil I', 'Finch SC', 'Reiss RF', 'de Smith AJ', 'Gonseth S', 'Zhou M', 'Hansen HM', 'Sherborne AL', 'Nakamura J', 'Bracci PM', 'Gudzenko N', 'Hatch M', 'Babkina N', 'Little MP', 'Chumak VV', 'Walsh KM', 'Bazyka D', 'Wiemels JL', 'Zablotska LB']","['School of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'National Research Center for Radiation Medicine, Kyiv, Ukraine.', 'Rutgers-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, New Brunswick, NJ, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, and Department of Medicine, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.', 'School of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.', 'School of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'School of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'School of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'School of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'School of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'National Research Center for Radiation Medicine, Kyiv, Ukraine.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'National Research Center for Radiation Medicine, Kyiv, Ukraine.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'National Research Center for Radiation Medicine, Kyiv, Ukraine.', 'School of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'National Research Center for Radiation Medicine, Kyiv, Ukraine.', 'School of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'School of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.

However, 6-MP also has dose-limiting toxicities, particularly life-threatening myelosuppression, due to genetic polymorphisms in enzymes that metabolize 6-MP. Promising biomarkers for predicting 6-MP-induced leukopenia is still unclear in Chinese population. Here, we evaluated the associations of NUDT15, TPMT and ITPA genotypes with 6-MP intolerance in our cohort of childhood ALL patients. METHODS: A total of 105 Chinese pediatric patients with a confirmed diagnosis of ALL were enrolled. We identified the NUDT15 coding variant rs116855232 (c.415C > T), a newly discovered 6-MP toxicity-related locus in Asians, and polymorphisms in TPMT rs1142345 and ITPA rs11273540. Associations between genotypes and 6-MP dose sensitivity, leukopenia, hepatotoxicity, and therapy interruption were evaluated. RESULTS: The minor allele frequencies (MAFs) of NUDT15 rs116855232, TPMT rs1142345 and ITPA rs11273540 were 15.7, 2.9, and 18.1%, respectively. NUDT15 and TPMT genetic variants were strongly associated with 6-MP dose intensity. Patients with NUDT15 homogenous genotype (TT) were highly sensitive to 6-MP (dose intensity of 60.27%) compared to these with heterozygous genotype (TC) or wild type (CC), who tolerated an average dose intensity of 83.83 and 94.24%, respectively. The NUDT15 variant was a predictor for leukopenia (OR: 3.62, 95% CI 1.377-9.501, P = 0.009) and early-onset leukopenia (OR: 9.63, 95% CI 2.764-33.514, P = 3.75 x 10(- 4)). No differences were found between 6-MP dose intensity and ITPA polymorphisms. CONCLUSION: NUDT15 variant is an optimal predictor for 6-MP intolerance in Chinese pediatric ALL patients and may have greatly clinical implications for individualized therapy.","['Zhou, Hong', 'Li, Lei', 'Yang, Peng', 'Yang, Lin', 'Zheng, Jin E', 'Zhou, Ying', 'Han, Yong']","['Zhou H', 'Li L', 'Yang P', 'Yang L', 'Zheng JE', 'Zhou Y', 'Han Y']","['Department of Pharmacy, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong, University of Science and Technology, No. 1277, Jie Fang Road, Wuhan, 430022, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong, University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China.', 'Department of Geriatrics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Fujian Cancer Hospital & Fujian Medical University Cancer Hospital, Fuzhou, 350014, China.', 'Center for Stem Cell Research and Application, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong, University of Science and Technology, No. 1277, Jie Fang Road, Wuhan, 430022, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong, University of Science and Technology, No. 1277, Jie Fang Road, Wuhan, 430022, China. whxhhanyong@163.com.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180502,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.67 (TPMT protein, human)', 'EC 2.6.1.- (NUDT15 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Pyrophosphatases)', 'EC 3.6.1.9 (ITPA protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects', 'Asians/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/*adverse effects', 'Methyltransferases/genetics', 'Pharmacogenomic Variants/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Pyrophosphatases/*genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['6-mercaptopurine', 'Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)', 'NUDT15', 'Tolerance']",2018/05/04 06:00,2019/02/14 06:00,['2018/05/04 06:00'],"['2017/01/24 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-018-4398-2 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-018-4398-2 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2018 May 2;18(1):516. doi: 10.1186/s12885-018-4398-2.,,,"['2015ZHYX014/Independent innovation research fund (Translational medicine branch)', 'project, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei provience,', 'P.

However, a reliable method for optimal selection of a TKI from the viewpoint of drug sensitivity of CML cells has not been established. We have developed a FRET-based drug sensitivity test in which a CrkL-derived fluorescent biosensor efficiently quantifies the kinase activity of BCR-ABL of living cells and sensitively evaluates the inhibitory activity of a TKI against BCR-ABL. Here, we validated the utility of the FRET-based drug sensitivity test carried out at diagnosis for predicting the molecular efficacy. Sixty-two patients with newly diagnosed chronic phase CML were enrolled in this study and treated with dasatinib. Bone marrow cells at diagnosis were subjected to FRET analysis. The DeltaFRET value was calculated by subtraction of FRET efficiency in the presence of dasatinib from that in the absence of dasatinib. Treatment response was evaluated every 3 months by the BCR-ABL1 International Scale. Based on the DeltaFRET value and molecular response, a threshold of the DeltaFRET value in the top 10% of FRET efficiency was set to 0.31. Patients with DeltaFRET value >/=0.31 had significantly superior molecular responses (MMR at 6 and 9 months and both MR4 and MR4.5 at 6, 9, and 12 months) compared with the responses in patients with DeltaFRET value <0.31. These results suggest that the FRET-based drug sensitivity test at diagnosis can predict early and deep molecular responses.

We sought to evaluate the risk factors for relapse in a de novo CBF AML cohort. PATIENTS/MATERIALS/METHODS: A retrospective review of patients from four Australian tertiary centres from 2001 to 2012, comprising 40 t(8;21) and 30 inv(16) AMLs. RESULTS: Multivariate analysis identified age (P = .032) and white cell count (WCC)>40 (P = .025) as significant predictors for inferior OS and relapse, respectively. Relapse risk was higher in the inv(16) group vs the t(8;21) group (57% vs 18%, HR 4.31, 95% CI: 1.78-10.42, P = .001). Induction therapy had no bearing on OS or relapse-free survival (RFS); however, consolidation treatment with >3 cycles of intermediate-/high-dose cytarabine improved OS (P = .035) and RFS (P = .063).

The serendipitous onset of B-ALL in a patient affected by the germinal Notch mutation-dependent Alagille syndrome allowed us to establish a B-ALL cell line (VR-ALL) bearing a genetic loss of function in components of Notch signaling. VR-ALL is a common-type B-ALL cell line, grows in conventional culture medium supplemented with 10% serum, and gives rise, once injected into immunodeficient NOG mice, to a mouse xenograft model of B-ALL. Exome sequencing revealed deleterious mutations in some components of Notch signaling, including Jagged1, Notch1, and Notch2. In addition, VR-ALL is sensitive both in vitro and in vivo to gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) as well as conventional anti-leukemic drugs. For all these reasons, VR-ALL may help to gain more insights into the role of Notch signaling in B-ALL.","['Kamga, Paul Takam', 'Dal Collo, Giada', 'Bassi, Giulio', 'Midolo, Martina', 'Delledonne, Massimo', 'Chilosi, Marco', 'Bonifacio, Massimiliano', 'Krampera, Mauro']","['Kamga PT', 'Dal Collo G', 'Bassi G', 'Midolo M', 'Delledonne M', 'Chilosi M', 'Bonifacio M', 'Krampera M']","['Stem Cell Research Laboratory, Section of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Stem Cell Research Laboratory, Section of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Stem Cell Research Laboratory, Section of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Stem Cell Research Laboratory, Section of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Department of Biotechnology, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Personal Genomics S.R.L., Verona, Italy.', 'Section of Pathology, Department of Diagnostics and Public Health, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Stem Cell Research Laboratory, Section of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Stem Cell Research Laboratory, Section of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180406,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*ALGS', '*Alagille syndrome', '*B-ALL', '*B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*Notch signaling']",2018/05/03 06:00,2018/05/03 06:01,['2018/05/03 06:00'],"['2018/01/02 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/03 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.24836 [doi]', '24836 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2018 Apr 6;9(26):18341-18350. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.24836. eCollection 2018 Apr 6.,,,,PMC5915076,,,"['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare no competing financial interests.', 'Conflict-of-interest disclosure.']",,,,,,,,,,,

However, chemoresistance, toxic side-effects and poor patient survival rates retard the efficacy of its performance. The current study deals with the chemosensitization of AML cells using heteronemin, a marine natural product towards cytarabine chemotherapy. Heteronemin could effectively sensitize HL-60 cells towards sub-toxic concentration of cytarabine resulting in synergistic toxicity as demonstrated by MTT assay and [(3)H] thymidine incorporation studies, while being safe towards healthy blood cells. Flow cytometry for Annexin-V/PI and immunoblotting for caspase cleavage proved that the combination induces enhancement in apoptosis. Heteronemin being a farnesyl transferase inhibitor (FTI) suppressed cytarabine-induced, farnesyl transferase-mediated activation of Ras, as assessed by Ras pull-down assay. Upon pre-treating cells with a commercial FTI, L-744,832, the synergism was completely lost in the combination, confirming the farnesyl transferase inhibitory activity of heteronemin as assessed by thymidine incorporation assay. Heteronemin effectively down-regulated cytarabine-induced activation of MAPK, AP-1, NF-kappaB and c-myc, the down-stream targets of Ras signaling, which again validated the role of Ras in regulating the synergism. Hence we believe that the efficacy of cytarabine chemotherapy can be improved to a significant extent by combining sub-toxic concentrations of cytarabine and heteronemin.","['Saikia, Minakshi', 'Retnakumari, Archana P', 'Anwar, Shabna', 'Anto, Nikhil P', 'Mittal, Rashmi', 'Shah, Shabna', 'Pillai, Kavya S', 'Balachandran, Vinod S', 'Peter, Vidya', 'Thomas, Reeba', 'Anto, Ruby John']","['Saikia M', 'Retnakumari AP', 'Anwar S', 'Anto NP', 'Mittal R', 'Shah S', 'Pillai KS', 'Balachandran VS', 'Peter V', 'Thomas R', 'Anto RJ']","['Division of Cancer Research, Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India.', 'Research Scholar, University of Kerala, India.', 'Division of Cancer Research, Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India.', 'Division of Cancer Research, Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India.', 'Research Scholar, University of Kerala, India.', 'Division of Cancer Research, Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Maharishi Markandeshwar University, Haryana, India.', 'Division of Cancer Research, Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India.', 'Research Scholar, University of Kerala, India.', 'Division of Cancer Research, Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India.', 'Research Scholar, University of Kerala, India.', 'Division of Cancer Research, Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India.', 'Division of Cancer Research, Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India.', 'Division of Cancer Research, Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India.', 'Division of Cancer Research, Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180406,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Ras', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'chemosensitization', 'farnesyl transferase', 'heteronemin']",2018/05/03 06:00,2018/05/03 06:01,['2018/05/03 06:00'],"['2017/11/27 00:00 [received]', '2018/02/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/03 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.24771 [doi]', '24771 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2018 Apr 6;9(26):18115-18127. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.24771. eCollection 2018 Apr 6.,,,,PMC5915061,,,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,

We previously reported that caspase-8 played an important role in compound K-induced apoptosis via activation of caspase-3 directly or indirectly through Bid cleavage, cytochrome c release, and caspase-9 activation in HL-60 human leukemia cells. The mechanisms leading to apoptosis in A549 and SK-MES-1 human lung cancer cells and the role of ER stress have not yet been understood. Methods: The apoptotic effects of compound K were analyzed using flow cytometry, and the changes in protein levels were determined using Western blot analysis. The intracellular calcium levels were monitored by staining with Fura-2/AM and Fluo-3/AM. Results: Compound K-induced ER stress was confirmed through increased phosphorylation of eIF2alpha and protein levels of GRP78/BiP, XBP-1S, and IRE1alpha in human lung cancer cells. Moreover, compound-K led to the accumulation of intracellular calcium and an increase in m-calpain activities that were both significantly inhibited by pretreatment either with BAPTA-AM (an intracellular Ca(2+) chelator) or dantrolene (an RyR channel antagonist). These results were correlated with the outcome that compound K induced ER stress-related apoptosis through caspase-12, as z-ATAD-fmk (a specific inhibitor of caspase-12) partially ameliorated this effect. Interestingly, 4-PBA (ER stress inhibitor) dramatically improved the compound K-induced apoptosis. Conclusion: Cell survival and intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis during ER stress in human lung cancer cells are important factors in the induction of the compound K-induced apoptotic pathway.","['Shin, Dong-Hyun', 'Leem, Dong-Gyu', 'Shin, Ji-Sun', 'Kim, Joo-Il', 'Kim, Kyung-Tack', 'Choi, Sang Yoon', 'Lee, Myung-Hee', 'Choi, Jung-Hye', 'Lee, Kyung-Tae']","['Shin DH', 'Leem DG', 'Shin JS', 'Kim JI', 'Kim KT', 'Choi SY', 'Lee MH', 'Choi JH', 'Lee KT']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Biochemistry, College of Pharmacy, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Biochemistry, College of Pharmacy, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Life and Nanopharmaceutical Science, College of Pharmacy, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Biochemistry, College of Pharmacy, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Biochemistry, College of Pharmacy, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Traditional Food Research Center, Korea Food Research Institute, Seongnam, Republic of Korea.', 'Traditional Food Research Center, Korea Food Research Institute, Seongnam, Republic of Korea.', 'Traditional Food Research Center, Korea Food Research Institute, Seongnam, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Life and Nanopharmaceutical Science, College of Pharmacy, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Oriental Pharmaceutical Science, College of Pharmacy, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Biochemistry, College of Pharmacy, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Life and Nanopharmaceutical Science, College of Pharmacy, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170204,Korea (South),J Ginseng Res,Journal of ginseng research,100890690,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['ER stress', 'apoptosis', 'calcium', 'compound K', 'lung cancer cells']",2018/05/03 06:00,2018/05/03 06:01,['2018/05/03 06:00'],"['2016/10/29 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/03 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.jgr.2017.01.015 [doi]', 'S1226-8453(16)30252-4 [pii]']",ppublish,J Ginseng Res. 2018 Apr;42(2):165-174. doi: 10.1016/j.jgr.2017.01.015.

Study objectives were to determine adherence to the protocol, use of selected resources, and patient outcomes. Methods: This retrospective cohort study compared outcomes of interest before and after implementation of gm screening. Adults undergoing matched related allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation or induction chemotherapy for acute leukemia were eligible. Patients could be enrolled more than once and were evaluated as episodes. Adherence to the gm protocol was assessed in post-implementation episodes. Use of broad-spectrum antifungals (bsafs), consultations (infectious diseases, respirology), and diagnostic procedures (computed tomography imaging, bronchoalveolar lavage) were compared between phases, as were the patient outcomes of all-cause mortality and clinical success (alive and not taking a bsaf). Results: Of 182 episodes consecutively screened, 70 per phase were enrolled. Clinical characteristics and duration of assessment were similar for the phases. Full or partial adherence to the protocol was observed in 61 post-implementation episodes (87%), with full adherence in 40 episodes (57%). More episodes in the pre-implementation phase than in the post-implementation phase involved receipt of bsafs, consultations, and diagnostics (27% vs. 7%, p = 0.02; 46% vs. 26%, p = 0.014; and 46% vs. 31%, p = 0.083 respectively). Although mortality was similar in the two phases, clinical success at the final assessment was observed in fewer pre-implementation than post-implementation episodes (79% vs. 98%, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Implementation of a gm screening protocol was feasible and associated with significantly fewer episodes involving receipt of bsafs and consultations, and with significantly more episodes showing clinical success.","['Harricharan, S', 'Biederman, K', 'Bombassaro, A M', 'Lazo-Langner, A', 'Elsayed, S', 'Fulford, A', 'Delport, J A', 'Xenocostas, A']","['Harricharan S', 'Biederman K', 'Bombassaro AM', 'Lazo-Langner A', 'Elsayed S', 'Fulford A', 'Delport JA', 'Xenocostas A']","['Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health, Toronto, ON.', 'Pharmacy Services, London Health Sciences Centre, London, ON.', 'Pharmacy Services, London Health Sciences Centre, London, ON.', 'Department of Medicine, Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, Western University, London, ON.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, Western University, London, ON.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, Western University, London, ON.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, Western University, London, ON.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, Western University, London, ON.', 'Arthur Labatt Family School of Nursing, Western University, London, ON.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, Western University, London, ON.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, Western University, London, ON.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, Western University, London, ON.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180430,Switzerland,Curr Oncol,"Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",9502503,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Mannans)', '11078-30-1 (galactomannan)', 'X2RN3Q8DNE (Galactose)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antifungal Agents/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Galactose/analogs & derivatives', 'Guideline Adherence/statistics & numerical data', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Leukemia/immunology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Mannans/*blood', 'Mass Screening/methods', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/*diagnosis/drug therapy/immunology', 'Neutropenia/etiology/immunology', 'Opportunistic Infections/*diagnosis/drug therapy/immunology', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Adherence', '*antifungals', '*consultations', '*diagnostics', '*galactomannan', '*hematology', '*mortality', '*screening']",2018/05/03 06:00,2019/02/26 06:00,['2018/05/03 06:00'],"['2018/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.3747/co.25.3848 [doi]', 'conc-25-e139 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Oncol. 2018 Apr;25(2):e139-e145. doi: 10.3747/co.25.3848.

However, it remains unknown whether amino acid levels affect the activities of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). By using a genetically encoded fluorescent sensor of the intracellular levels of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), we could monitor the dynamics of BCAA metabolism in HSCs. A mitochondrial-targeted 2C-type Ser/Thr protein phosphatase (PPM1K) promotes the catabolism of BCAAs to maintain MEIS1 and p21 levels by decreasing the ubiquitination-mediated degradation controlled by the E3 ubiquitin ligase CDC20. PPM1K deficiency led to a notable decrease in MEIS1/p21 signaling to reduce the glycolysis and quiescence of HSCs, followed by a severe impairment in repopulation activities. Moreover, the deletion of Ppm1k dramatically extended survival in a murine leukemia model. These findings will enhance the current understanding of nutrient signaling in metabolism and function of stem cells.","['Liu, Xiaoye', 'Zhang, Feifei', 'Zhang, Yaping', 'Li, Xie', 'Chen, Chiqi', 'Zhou, Meiyi', 'Yu, Zhuo', 'Liu, Yunxia', 'Zhao, Yuzheng', 'Hao, Xiaoxin', 'Tang, Yabin', 'Zhu, Liang', 'Liu, Ligen', 'Xie, Li', 'Gu, Hao', 'Shao, Hongfang', 'Xia, Fangzhen', 'Yin, Chunrong', 'Tao, Minfang', 'Xie, Jingjing', 'Zhang, Cheng Cheng', 'Yang, Yi', 'Sun, Haipeng', 'Chen, Guo-Qiang', 'Zheng, Junke']","['Liu X', 'Zhang F', 'Zhang Y', 'Li X', 'Chen C', 'Zhou M', 'Yu Z', 'Liu Y', 'Zhao Y', 'Hao X', 'Tang Y', 'Zhu L', 'Liu L', 'Xie L', 'Gu H', 'Shao H', 'Xia F', 'Yin C', 'Tao M', 'Xie J', 'Zhang CC', 'Yang Y', 'Sun H', 'Chen GQ', 'Zheng J']","['Department of Pathophysiology, Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of Chinese Ministry of Education, Hongqiao International Institute of Medicine, Shanghai Tongren Hospital/Faculty of Basic Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China;

However, little is known about the impact of genetic variability within a tumor, intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH), on disease progression or outcome. Current approaches using bulk tumor specimens can suggest the presence of ITH, but only single-cell genetic methods have the resolution to describe the underlying clonal structures themselves. Current techniques tend to be labor and resource intensive and challenging to characterize with respect to sources of biological and technical variability. We have developed a platform using a microfluidic self-digitization chip to partition cells in stationary volumes for cell imaging and allele-specific PCR. Genotyping data from only confirmed single-cell volumes is obtained and subject to a variety of relevant quality control assessments such as allele dropout, false positive, and false negative rates. We demonstrate single-cell genotyping of the NPM1 type A mutation, an important prognostic indicator in acute myeloid leukemia, on single cells of the cell line OCI-AML3, describing a more complex zygosity distribution than would be predicted via bulk analysis.","['Thompson, Alison M', 'Smith, Jordan L', 'Monroe, Luke D', 'Kreutz, Jason E', 'Schneider, Thomas', 'Fujimoto, Bryant S', 'Chiu, Daniel T', 'Radich, Jerald P', 'Paguirigan, Amy L']","['Thompson AM', 'Smith JL', 'Monroe LD', 'Kreutz JE', 'Schneider T', 'Fujimoto BS', 'Chiu DT', 'Radich JP', 'Paguirigan AL']","['Division of Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, United States of America.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, United States of America.', 'Division of Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, United States of America.', 'Division of Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, United States of America.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, United States of America.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, United States of America.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, United States of America.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, United States of America.', 'Division of Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, United States of America.', 'Division of Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, United States of America.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-5395-5893', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8397-9407']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20180502,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['*Genotyping Techniques', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', '*Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis']",,,2018/05/03 06:00,2018/08/01 06:00,['2018/05/03 06:00'],"['2018/01/09 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0196801 [doi]', 'PONE-D-18-00863 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2018 May 2;13(5):e0196801. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0196801. eCollection 2018.,,,"['U10 CA180861/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K01 ES026842/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 EB021878/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA175215/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 EB018831/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States']",PMC5931502,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a first step toward the work, the interactions between GRP78 and 15 known ligands were modeled by docking simulation. The docked complex, GRP78-13, superior to other compounds with respect to its experimental activity and energy descriptors, was deduced into a structure-based pharmacophore. This hypothesis was applied as a screening filter to Asinex and Chemdiv databases. Finally, 23 hits were tested in vitro. Among these, VH1019 and VH1011 induced a concentration-dependent strong broad antiproliferative effect in glioma (U87-MG), breast cancer (MCF-7), and prostate cancer (DU-145) cell lines as compared to nontumorigenic control, neonatal foreskin fibroblast (HFF-1). These compounds showed preferential growth inhibition of cancer cells over normal cells.

The heparin effect on EC adhesion molecule (ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin) expression was also assessed. In HMEC-1, dalteparin inhibited IL1beta-induced NB4 adhesion by 80%, enoxaparin by 52%, and UFH by 44%. Similar results were obtained in HUVEC. This was associated with a significant decrease of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 expression. In conclusion, we show that LMWH significantly counteract APL cell adhesion to the vessel wall, by modulating EC adhesion molecule expression.

Upon interacting with a partner macromolecule, a subset of IDPs can fold and bind to form a well-defined three-dimensional conformation. For example, disordered BH3-only proteins bind promiscuously to a large number of homologous BCL-2 family proteins, where they fold to a helical structure in a groove on the BCL-2-like protein surface. As two protein chains are involved in the folding reaction, and the structure is only formed in the presence of the partner macromolecule, this raises the question of where the folding information is encoded. Here, we examine these coupled folding and binding reactions to determine which component determines the folding and binding pathway. Using Phi value analysis to compare transition state interactions between the disordered BH3-only proteins PUMA and BID and the folded BCL-2-like proteins A1 and MCL-1, we found that, even though the BH3-only protein is disordered in isolation and requires a stabilizing partner to fold, its folding and binding pathway is encoded in the IDP itself; the reaction is not templated by the folded partner. We suggest that, by encoding both its transition state and level of residual structure, an IDP can evolve a specific kinetic profile, which could be a crucial functional advantage of disorder.","['Crabtree, Michael D', 'Mendonca, Carolina A T F', 'Bubb, Quenton R', 'Clarke, Jane']","['Crabtree MD', 'Mendonca CATF', 'Bubb QR', 'Clarke J']","['From the Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1EW, United Kingdom.', 'From the Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1EW, United Kingdom.', 'From the Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1EW, United Kingdom.', 'From the Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1EW, United Kingdom jc162@cam.ac.uk.']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-1466-4011', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7927-0120', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9518-0731']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180501,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (Bid protein, mouse)', '0 (Intrinsically Disordered Proteins)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (PUMA protein, mouse)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Intrinsically Disordered Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Conformation', '*Protein Folding', 'Signal Transduction', 'Thermodynamics', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family', '*IDP', '*apoptosis', '*biophysics', '*coupled folding and binding', '*kinetics', '*protein folding', '*protein-protein interaction', '*thermodynamics', '*phi value']",2018/05/03 06:00,2019/01/23 06:00,['2018/05/03 06:00'],"['2018/03/08 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/24 00:00 [revised]', '2018/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/23 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)39957-9 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.RA118.002791 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2018 Jun 22;293(25):9718-9723. doi: 10.1074/jbc.RA118.002791.

However, treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) using CAR-T cells remains limited to date. Leukemogenesis always relates with the abnormalities of cytogenetics, and nearly one third of AML patients have activating mutations in Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) which reminded poor prognosis. Considering the FLT3 expressed in AML patients' blast cells, it may be a new candidate target for CAR-T therapy to treat FLT3(+) AML, especially patients harboring FLT3-ITD mutation. METHODS: The FLT3L CAR-T using FLT3 ligand as recognizing domain was constructed. The specific cytotoxicity against FLT3(+) leukemia cell lines, primary AML cells, and normal hematopoietic progenitor stem cells (HPSCs) in vitro were evaluated. In addition, FLT3(+) AML mouse model was used to assess the effect of FLT3L CAR-T therapy in vivo. RESULTS: FLT3L CAR-T cells could specifically kill FLT3(+) leukemia cell lines and AML patients' bone marrow mononuclear cells in vitro (with or without FLT3 mutation) and have more potent cytotoxicity to FLT3-ITD cells. In a human FLT3(+) AML xenograft mouse model, FLT3L CAR-T cells could significantly prolong the survival of mice. Furthermore, it was found that FLT3L CAR-T cells could activate the FLT3/ERK signaling pathway of FLT3(+) leukemia cells with wild-type FLT3; meanwhile, it had no inhibitory effects on the colony formation of CD34(+) stem cells derived from normal human umbilical cord blood. CONCLUSIONS: The ligand-based FLT3L CAR-T cells could be a promising strategy for FLT3(+) AML treatment, especially those carried FLT3 mutation.","['Wang, Ying', 'Xu, Yingxi', 'Li, Saisai', 'Liu, Jia', 'Xing, Yanyan', 'Xing, Haiyan', 'Tian, Zheng', 'Tang, Kejing', 'Rao, Qing', 'Wang, Min', 'Wang, Jianxiang']","['Wang Y', 'Xu Y', 'Li S', 'Liu J', 'Xing Y', 'Xing H', 'Tian Z', 'Tang K', 'Rao Q', 'Wang M', 'Wang J']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, Tianjin, 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, Tianjin, 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, Tianjin, 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, Tianjin, 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, Tianjin, 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, Tianjin, 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, Tianjin, 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, Tianjin, 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, Tianjin, 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, Tianjin, 300020, China. wangjxm@ihcams.ac.cn.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, Tianjin, 300020, China. wangjx@ihcams.ac.cn.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180502,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Chimeric Antigen', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Chimeric antigen receptor', '*FLT3', '*FLT3-ITD', '*Immunotherapy']",2018/05/03 06:00,2019/10/28 06:00,['2018/05/03 06:00'],"['2018/02/09 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13045-018-0603-7 [doi]', '10.1186/s13045-018-0603-7 [pii]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2018 May 2;11(1):60. doi: 10.1186/s13045-018-0603-7.,,,,PMC5930553,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
29716616,NLM,MEDLINE,20180926,20181114,1743-422X (Electronic) 1743-422X (Linking),15,1,2018 May 2,Stability of the HTLV-1 glycoprotein 46 (gp46) gene in an endemic region of the Brazilian Amazon and the presence of a significant mutation (N93D) in symptomatic patients.,80,10.1186/s12985-018-0984-9 [doi],"BACKGROUND: The human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) affects 2-5 million people worldwide, and is associated with a number of degenerative and infectious diseases. The Envelope glycoproteins (gp) are highly conserved among the different HTLV-1 isolates, although nucleotide substitutions in the region that codifies these proteins may influence both the infectivity and the replication of the virus. The gp46 gene has functional domains which have been associated with the inhibition of the formation of the syncytium, cell-cell transmission, and the production of antibodies. The present study investigated the genetic stability of the gp46 gene of HTLV-1 in an endemic region of Brazilian Amazonia. METHODS: Index case (IC - a sample of a given family group) carriers of HTLV-1 were investigated in the metropolitan region of Belem (Para, Brazil) between January 2010 (registered retrospectively) and December 2015. The sequences that codify the gp46 were amplified by PCR, purified and sequenced (MF084788-MF084825). The gene was characterized using bioinformatics and Bayesian Inference. RESULTS: The 40 patients analyzed had a mean age of 45.2 years and 70% presented some type of symptom, with a predominance of pain and sensitivity, dysautonomia, and motor disorders. All patients presented the aA (Transcontinental Cosmopolitan) genotype, with an extremely low mutation rate, which is characteristic of the codifying region (aA - 1.83 x 10-(4) mutations per site per year). The gp46 gene had a nucleotide diversity of between 0.00% and 2.0%. Amino acid mutations were present in 66.6% of the samples of individuals with signs/symptoms or diseases associated with HTLV-1 (p = 0.0091). Of the three most frequent mutations, the previously undescribed N93D mutant was invariably associated with symptomatic cases. CONCLUSIONS: The aA HTLV-1 subtype is predominant in the metropolitan region of Belem and presented a high degree of genetic stability in the codifying region. The rare N93D amino acid mutation may be associated with the clinical manifestations of this viral infection. IMPORTANCE: Little is known of the phylogeny of HTLV-1 in the endemic region of Brazilian Amazonia, and few complete gene sequences are available for the gp46 glycoprotein from the local population. The nucleotide sequences of the viral gp46 gene recorded in the present study confirmed the genetic stability of the region, and pointed to a homogeneous viral group, with local geographic characteristics. Further research will be necessary to more fully understand the molecular diversity of this protein, given the potential of this codifying region as a model for an effective HTLV-1 vaccine. The identification of a rare mutation (N93D), present only in symptomatic patients, should also be investigated further as a potential clinical marker.

However, efforts to manage leukemia-treatment symptoms have not kept pace with new therapies. Symptom toxicity during treatment can result in complications, treatment delays, and therapy dose reductions. Compromise in therapy can negatively influence the quality of life and, even more notably, jeopardize chances for long-term survival. This study examined biologic mechanisms that influence fatigue caused by increased reactive oxidative species (ROS) or actual failure of the antioxidant defense system due to genetic variation by investigating reactive nitrosative species, a ""downstream"" consequence of ROS. The specific aims of this study were to characterize the trajectory of nitrosative stress during acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatment and evaluate the influence of nitrosative stress on fatigue. A repeated measures design was used to evaluate the fatigue experienced by 186 children and adolescents, 3-18 years of age, with a diagnosis of leukemia during the most intense phase of treatment. An established biomarker of nitrosative stress, protein 3-nitrotyrosine (3NT) residues in the cerebral spinal fluid, was evaluated at diagnosis, postinduction, and consolidation phases of treatment. Higher fatigue was associated with higher 3NT levels at the beginning of treatment. Two distinct groups of children experienced either consistently high or consistently low 3NT levels across the treatment trajectory, from diagnosis to 12 months postinduction. Findings from this study support continued exploration into the phenotypic biochemical mechanisms that influence a reactive response to childhood cancer treatment.","['Hockenberry, Marilyn J', 'Moore, Ida M Ki', 'Scheurer, Michael E', 'Hooke, Mary C', 'Taylor, Olga A', 'Koerner, Kari M', 'Gundy, Patricia M', 'Pan, Wei']","['Hockenberry MJ', 'Moore IMK', 'Scheurer ME', 'Hooke MC', 'Taylor OA', 'Koerner KM', 'Gundy PM', 'Pan W']","['1 School of Nursing, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA.', '2 Biobehavioral Health Science Division, College of Nursing, The University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.', ""3 Department of Pediatrics, Texas Children's Cancer and Hematology Centers, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA."", '4 Population Sciences Biorepository, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.', '5 School of Nursing, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', ""3 Department of Pediatrics, Texas Children's Cancer and Hematology Centers, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA."", '6 College of Nursing, The University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.', '6 College of Nursing, The University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.', '1 School of Nursing, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180501,United States,Biol Res Nurs,Biological research for nursing,9815758,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '3604-79-3 (3-nitrotyrosine)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antioxidants/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Fatigue/*chemically induced', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Nitrosative Stress/*drug effects', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Quality of Life', 'Tyrosine/*analogs & derivatives/blood']",['NOTNLM'],"['*fatigue', '*leukemia', '*nitrosative stress']",2018/05/03 06:00,2019/01/08 06:00,['2018/05/03 06:00'],"['2018/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/08 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/03 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1099800418772907 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Res Nurs. 2018 Jul;20(4):403-409. doi: 10.1177/1099800418772907.

Recently, the dysregulation of miR-20b-5p expression has been observed in many B-cell lymphomas and T-cell leukemias. In this research study, we examined the putative prognostic value of miR-20b-5p in CLL. Therefore, total RNA was isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) collected from 88 CLL patients; next, total RNA was polyadenylated and first-strand cDNA was synthesized, using an oligo-dT-adapter primer. miR-20b-5p expression was quantified using an in-house-developed real-time quantitative PCR assay. Kaplan-Meier OS analysis and bootstrap univariate Cox regression showed that high miR-20b-5p expression predicts better OS for CLL patients (p<0.001). Interestingly, miR-20b-5p overexpression retains its favorable prognostic role in CLL patients of intermediate risk or stratified according to established prognostic factors [CD38 expression and mutational status of the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable (IGHV) region].

Healthcare professionals have a supporting role to reduce the burden on parents who feel responsible for conveying information to their child and other family members. OBJECTIVE: To examine parents' and healthcare professionals' perceptions of roles in receiving and communicating information when a child is diagnosed with and treated for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We used the principles of a grounded theory approach. This was a single site study, recruiting from a principal children's cancer treatment centre in the United Kingdom. The sample included parents of children receiving and completed treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (n=28), and healthcare professionals (n=34). METHODS: Methods included individual interviews, face-to-face and telephone, focus groups, and an online forum. FINDINGS: Communication 'touch points' are many over the course of a child's cancer journey. We describe often 'mismatched' communication encounters where those seeking information and those providing information have different goals. Healthcare professionals in the encounter have expertise at the outset while parents have less expertise, but this expertise grows over time and this can increase the perceptions of this 'mismatch' and create different challenges. CONCLUSIONS: Considered in the context of middle range transition theory, we might suggest that parental foreground (seeking information directly) and background (passive actors) roles are the result of differing levels of uncertainty, and depend on the situation and preferences and child and family needs that may present differently over time in different contexts. Our work contributes to the emerging consensus that communication is more than a core set of skills that healthcare professionals just need to learn: clear specifications of mutual roles, responsibilities and a shared understanding of goals is also essential.","['Gibson, Faith', 'Kumpunen, Stephanie', 'Bryan, Gemma', 'Forbat, Liz']","['Gibson F', 'Kumpunen S', 'Bryan G', 'Forbat L']","[""Centre for Outcomes and Experience Research in Children's Health, Illness and Disability (ORCHID), Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust and School of Health Science, University of Surrey, Guilford, Surrey, UK.

Activation of MHC Class II in human B cells or ""primed"" murine B cells leads to tyrosine phosphorylation, calcium mobilization, AKT, ERK, JNK activation. In addition, crosslinking MHC class II with monoclonal Abs kill malignant human B cells. Several humanized anti-HLA-DR/MHC class II monoclonal Abs entered clinical trials for lymphoma/leukemia and MHC class II-expressing melanomas. Mechanistically, MHC class II is associated with a wealth of transmembrane proteins including the B cell-specific signaling proteins CD79a/b, CD19 and a group of four-transmembrane proteins including tetraspanins and the apoptotic protein MPYS/STING. Furthermore, MHC class II signals are compartmentalized in the tetraspanin-enriched microdomains. In this review, we discuss our current understanding of MHC class II signaling in B cells focusing on its physiological significance and the therapeutic potential.","['Katikaneni, Divya Sai', 'Jin, Lei']","['Katikaneni DS', 'Jin L']","['Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32610, United States.', 'Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32610, United States.

To effectively treat AML, new molecular targets and therapeutic approaches must be identified. In silico analysis of several available databases of AML patients showed that the expression of Spastic Paraplegia 6 Protein (SPG6) significantly inversely correlates with the overall survival of AML patients. To determine whether SPG6 supports AML development, we employed an shRNA-encoding lentivirus system to inhibit SPG6 expression in human AML cells including NB4 and MV4-11cells. Knockdown expression of SPG6 resulted in decreased cell growth and elevated apoptosis of these leukemia cells. Notably, the SPG6 deficiency resulted in higher BMPR2 expression indicating that BMPR2 signaling contributes to AML pathogenesis. Furthermore, SPG6 deficiency promoted phosphorylation of Smad1/5/9 and decreased transcription of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl. Our study suggests that SPG6 contributes to AML pathogenesis, and suggests that inhibition of SPG6 may be novel strategy for treating human AML.","['Chen, Jinliang', 'Li, Chunling', 'Zhan, Renhui', 'Yin, Yancun']","['Chen J', 'Li C', 'Zhan R', 'Yin Y']","['Taishan Scholar Immunology Program, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Binzhou Medical University, Yantai, China.

The aim of our study was to analyze and compare the outcomes of real-world r/r CLL/SLL patients treated with these two BCRi in outside clinical trials. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A comparative case matched 1:2 analysis was performed on idelalisib combined with rituximab and ibrutinib efficacy in 102 patients with r/r CLL/SLL from two observational studies of the Polish Adult Leukemia Group (PALG). RESULTS: Both therapies produced similar overall response rates (idelalisib plus rituximab 76.4% and ibrutinib 72.1%). Median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in both groups were not reached. Furthermore, no significant difference was observed between both BCRi regimens in regard to PFS (HR=0.75, 95% CI=0.30-1.86, p=0.55) and OS (HR=0.65, 95%CI=0.26-1.68, p=0.39). CONCLUSION: In summary, the results of this retrospective analysis suggest that idelalisib combined with rituximab and ibrutinib therapies have comparable activity in r/r CLL/SLL in daily clinical practice.","['Pula, Bartosz', 'Budziszewska, Bozena Katarzyna', 'Rybka, Justyna', 'Gil, Lidia', 'Subocz, Edyta', 'Dlugosz-Danecka, Monika', 'Zawirska, Daria', 'Waszczuk-Gajda, Anna', 'Iskierka-Jazdzewska, Elzbieta', 'Kopacz, Agnieszka', 'Szymczyk, Agnieszka', 'Czyz, Jaroslaw', 'Lech-Maranda, Ewa', 'Warzocha, Krzysztof', 'Jamroziak, Krzysztof']","['Pula B', 'Budziszewska BK', 'Rybka J', 'Gil L', 'Subocz E', 'Dlugosz-Danecka M', 'Zawirska D', 'Waszczuk-Gajda A', 'Iskierka-Jazdzewska E', 'Kopacz A', 'Szymczyk A', 'Czyz J', 'Lech-Maranda E', 'Warzocha K', 'Jamroziak K']","['Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland bartosz.pula@gmail.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Blood Neoplasms and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Karol Marcinkowski University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Military Institute of Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Jagiellonian University, Krakow, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Jagiellonian University, Krakow, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Internal Medicine, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Medical University of Lodz, Copernicus Memorial Hospital, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Specialist District Hospital, Rzeszow, Poland.', 'Department of Hematooncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Michal Kopernik University, Bydgoszcz, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Centre of Postgraduate Medical Education, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Quinazolinones)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)', 'YG57I8T5M0 (idelalisib)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*drug therapy', 'Piperidines', 'Poland', 'Purines/therapeutic use', 'Pyrazoles/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Quinazolinones/therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Rituximab/therapeutic use']",['NOTNLM'],"['*B-cell receptor inhibitors', '*Idelalisib', '*chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*ibrutinib', '*rituximab']",2018/05/02 06:00,2018/05/09 06:00,['2018/05/02 06:00'],"['2018/03/18 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/05 00:00 [revised]', '2018/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/09 06:00 [medline]']","['38/5/3025 [pii]', '10.21873/anticanres.12557 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2018 May;38(5):3025-3030. doi: 10.21873/anticanres.12557.,"['Copyright(c) 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the expression of ZBTB7A in colorectal carcinoma (CRC) has seldom been documented. In this study, we investigated the differential expression of ZBTB7A in CRC cell lines and tissues. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Expression levels of ZBTB7A mRNA and protein were examined in CRC cell lines. ZBTB7A protein expression was also evaluated in tissue samples of normal colonic mucosa, high-grade dysplasia, and CRC using immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS: All CRC cell lines exhibited significantly higher ZBTB7A mRNA expression levels than did normal colonic epithelial cells. The ZBTB7A protein expression levels were clearly higher in the CRC cell lines than in the normal colonic epithelial cells. Consistent with the cell line data, immunostaining revealed that there were significant differences in ZBTB7A protein expression between tissue samples of CRC and normal colonic mucosa (p=0.048) and high-grade dysplasia (p=0.015). In addition, metastatic CRC exhibited significantly higher ZBTB7A protein expression levels than primary CRC (p=0.027). CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that ZBTB7A expression is up-regulated in CRC cell lines and tissues. Our data suggest that ZBTB7A is involved in the development and progression of CRC.","['Joo, Jin Woo', 'Kim, Hyun-Soo', 'Do, Sung-Im', 'Sung, Ji-Youn']","['Joo JW', 'Kim HS', 'Do SI', 'Sung JY']","['Department of Pathology, Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Pathology, Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea hyunsookim@yuhs.ac.', 'Department of Pathology, Kangbuk Samsung Hospital, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Pathology, Kyung Hee University School of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (ZBTB7A protein, human)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis', 'Up-Regulation']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Colon', '*colorectal carcinoma', '*leukemia/lymphoma-related factor', '*poxvirus and zinc finger and Kruppel erythroid myeloid ontogenic factor', '*zinc finger and BTB domain-containing 7A']",2018/05/02 06:00,2018/05/16 06:00,['2018/05/02 06:00'],"['2018/02/17 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/07 00:00 [revised]', '2018/03/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/16 06:00 [medline]']","['38/5/2787 [pii]', '10.21873/anticanres.12522 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2018 May;38(5):2787-2792. doi: 10.21873/anticanres.12522.,"['Copyright(c) 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Herein we investigated the effects of combination of FKB and daunorubicin (DNR) on human leukemic cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cell viability and death were assessed by the MTS assay and flow cytometry. NK-kappaB was detected by western blotting. RESULTS: FKB alone and in combination with DNR reduced the viable cell numbers of four leukemic cell lines. FKB itself induced apoptosis of an acute myeloid cell line, HL-60. Because the additive effect of DNR and FKB was most obvious in HL-60 cells, subsequent experiments were performed with HL-60 cells. Combined treatment of the two compounds increased NF-kappaB activation at 12 h. CONCLUSION: A combination treatment of DNR and FKB may improve the anticancer effects of DNR in DNR-resistant acute myeloid leukemia.","['Lee, Jae Jin', 'Koh, Kyung-Nam', 'Park, Chan-Jeoung', 'Jang, Seongsoo', 'Im, Ho Joon', 'Kim, Nayoung']","['Lee JJ', 'Koh KN', 'Park CJ', 'Jang S', 'Im HJ', 'Kim N']","['Asan Institute for Life Sciences and Department of Convergence Medicine, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea naykim@amc.seoul.kr hojim@amc.seoul.kr.', 'Asan Institute for Life Sciences and Department of Convergence Medicine, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea naykim@amc.seoul.kr hojim@amc.seoul.kr.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (flavokawain B)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus/drug effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Daunorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Flavonoids/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Stimulation, Chemical']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Flavokawain B', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*daunorubicin']",2018/05/02 06:00,2018/05/23 06:00,['2018/05/02 06:00'],"['2018/02/27 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/21 00:00 [revised]', '2018/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/23 06:00 [medline]']","['38/5/2771 [pii]', '10.21873/anticanres.12520 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2018 May;38(5):2771-2778. doi: 10.21873/anticanres.12520.,"['Copyright(c) 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency approval for patients with 17p deleted relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia [del(17p) CLL] was based on results from 107 patients. An additional 51 patients were enrolled in a safety expansion cohort. Extended analysis of all enrolled patients, including the effect of minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity on outcome, is now reported. Patients and Methods Overall, 158 patients with relapsed/refractory or previously untreated (n = 5) del(17p) CLL received venetoclax 400 mg per day after an initial dose ramp up. Responses were based on 2008 International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia criteria, with monthly physical exams and blood counts. Computed tomography scan was mandatory at week 36, after which assessment made was by clinical evaluation. Marrow biopsy was performed when complete remission was suspected. MRD was assessed by flow cytometry. Results Patients had a median of two prior therapies (range, zero to 10 therapies), 71% had TP53 mutation, and 48% had nodes that were >/= 5 cm. Median time on venetoclax was 23.1 months (range, 0 to 44.2 months) and median time on study was 26.6 months (range, 0 to 44.2 months). For all patients, investigator-assessed objective response rate was 77% (122 of 158 patients; 20% complete remission) and estimated progression-free survival at 24 months was 54% (95% CI, 45% to 62%). For 16 patients who received prior kinase inhibitors, objective response rate was 63% (10 of 16 patients) and 24-month progression-free survival estimate was 50% (95% CI, 25% to 71%). By intent-to-treat analysis, 48 (30%) of 158 patients achieved MRD below the cutoff of 10(-4) in blood. Common grade 3 and 4 adverse events were hematologic and managed with supportive care and/or dose adjustments. Conclusion Venetoclax achieves durable responses and was well tolerated in patients with del(17p) CLL. A high rate of blood MRD < 10(-4) was achieved in this high-risk population.","['Stilgenbauer, Stephan', 'Eichhorst, Barbara', 'Schetelig, Johannes', 'Hillmen, Peter', 'Seymour, John F', 'Coutre, Steven', 'Jurczak, Wojciech', 'Mulligan, Stephen P', 'Schuh, Anna', 'Assouline, Sarit', 'Wendtner, Clemens-Martin', 'Roberts, Andrew W', 'Davids, Matthew S', 'Bloehdorn, Johannes', 'Munir, Talha', 'Bottcher, Sebastian', 'Zhou, Lang', 'Salem, Ahmed Hamed', 'Desai, Monali', 'Chyla, Brenda', 'Arzt, Jennifer', 'Kim, Su Young', 'Verdugo, Maria', 'Gordon, Gary', 'Hallek, Michael', 'Wierda, William G']","['Stilgenbauer S', 'Eichhorst B', 'Schetelig J', 'Hillmen P', 'Seymour JF', 'Coutre S', 'Jurczak W', 'Mulligan SP', 'Schuh A', 'Assouline S', 'Wendtner CM', 'Roberts AW', 'Davids MS', 'Bloehdorn J', 'Munir T', 'Bottcher S', 'Zhou L', 'Salem AH', 'Desai M', 'Chyla B', 'Arzt J', 'Kim SY', 'Verdugo M', 'Gordon G', 'Hallek M', 'Wierda WG']","[""Stephan Stilgenbauer and Johannes Bloehdorn, Ulm University, Ulm; Stephan Stilgenbauer, Klinik fur Innere Medizin I, Universitatsklinikum des Saarlandes, Homburg; Barbara Eichhorst and Michael Hallek, Universitatsklinikum Koln, Koln; Johannes Schetelig, University Hospital, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden; Clemens-Martin Wendtner, Klinikum Schwabing, Munich; Sebastian Bottcher, University Hospital of Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany; Peter Hillmen and Talha Munir, St James's University Hospital, Leeds; Anna Schuh, University of Oxford; Anna Schuh, Oxford Cancer and Haematology Centre, Churchill Hospital, Oxford, United Kingdom; John F.

The most commonly used substances are vinblastine and vincristine, other compounds are vinorelbine and vinflunine. All of them are very effective drugs but their use is limited by severe side-effects including neurotoxicity and bone marrow depression. Therefore, it is very important to develop novel vinca alkaloids with similar efficacy but lower toxicity. METHODS: Here, we analyzed two new compounds, 4-chlorochablastine and 4-chlorochacristine, with regard to their biological activity. These novel compounds were applied to a leukemia cell line at clinically relevant concentrations. For comparison, the established vinca alkaloids vinblastine, vincristine, vinorelbine, and vinflunine were also tested. RESULTS: Both novel substances decreased cellular proliferation. Apoptosis was found to be increased using two different methods reflecting early and late apoptosis. Cell cycle analysis revealed a clear decrease in G1-cells and an increase in G2/M-cells indicating an arrest in mitosis. In general, 4- chlorochablastine and 4-chlorochacristine caused these effects at concentrations higher than those needed for vinblastine, vincristine, and vinorelbine, but the potency was approximately in the range of vinflunine. CONCLUSION: Taken together, the results show first indications that these novel vinca alkaloids might be effective and that they warrant further analysis.","['Montag, Gracia', 'Stopper, Helga', 'Ngo, Quoc Anh', 'Hintzsche, Henning']","['Montag G', 'Stopper H', 'Ngo QA', 'Hintzsche H']","['Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Wurzburg, Versbacher Str. 9, 97078 Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Wurzburg, Versbacher Str. 9, 97078 Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Chemistry, Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology, 18 Hoang Quoc Viet, CauGiay, Hanoi, Vietnam.', 'Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Wurzburg, Versbacher Str. 9, 97078 Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Bavarian Health and Food Safety Authority, Eggenreuther Weg 43, 91058 Erlangen, Germany.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Curr Cancer Drug Targets,Current cancer drug targets,101094211,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Vinca Alkaloids)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*chemistry/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Cycle', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vinca Alkaloids/*chemistry/*pharmacology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Cytotoxicity', '*HL-60 cells', '*chlorochablastine', '*chlorochacristine', '*vinblastine', '*vinca alkaloids', '*vincristine', '*vinflunine', '*vinorelbine.']",2018/05/02 06:00,2020/07/10 06:00,['2018/05/02 06:00'],"['2017/12/18 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/05 00:00 [revised]', '2018/04/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/10 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/02 06:00 [entrez]']","['CCDT-EPUB-90081 [pii]', '10.2174/1568009618666180430142233 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Cancer Drug Targets. 2019;19(3):222-230. doi: 10.2174/1568009618666180430142233.,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We recruited 76 Japanese patients for this trial. Nilotinib 300 mg, twice daily, was administered for 2 years, and 74 patients were evaluated in the study. The median age was 55.0 years. The median duration of IM treatment was 69.0 months. All patients showed MMR at the time of entry into the study; the median time to MMR on IM therapy was 20.4 months. The proportion of patients who achieved MR(4.5) increased over time. The rates of MR(4.5) in the 74 evaluable patients were 27.0% [90% confidence interval (CI) (18.7-36.8%)] and 44.6% [90% CI (34.7-54.8%)] at 12 and 24 months, respectively. The frequency of ABCG2 421C/A + A/A was an independent predictive biomarker for achieving a 24-month MR(4.5). Switching to NIL led to safer, deeper molecular responses in patients with MMR on long-term IM therapy for future treatment-free remission.","['Noguchi, Shinsuke', 'Nakaseko, Chiaki', 'Nishiwaki, Kaichi', 'Ogasawara, Hitoshi', 'Ohishi, Kohshi', 'Tokuhira, Michihide', 'Noguchi, Masaaki', 'Kimura, Hideo', 'Handa, Hiroshi', 'Mitani, Kinuko', 'Miura, Masatomo', 'Wakita, Hisashi', 'Takahashi, Naoto']","['Noguchi S', 'Nakaseko C', 'Nishiwaki K', 'Ogasawara H', 'Ohishi K', 'Tokuhira M', 'Noguchi M', 'Kimura H', 'Handa H', 'Mitani K', 'Miura M', 'Wakita H', 'Takahashi N']","['Department of Hematology, Nephrology and Rheumatology, Akita University Graduate School of Medicine, 1-1-1 Hondo, Akita, 010-8543, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, International University of Health and Welfare School of Medicine, Narita, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Chiba University Hospital, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, Jikei University Kashiwa Hospital, Kashiwa, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Odate Municipal Hospital, Odate, Japan.', 'Department of Transfusion Service, Mie University Hospital, Tsu, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Saitama Medical Center, Saitama Medical University, Kawagoe, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Juntendo University Urayasu Hospital, Urayasu, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Northern Fukushima Medical Center, Date, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Gunma University Hospital, Maebashi, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Dokkyo Medical University, Mibu-machi, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Akita University Hospital, Akita, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Japanese Red Cross Narita Hospital, Narita, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nephrology and Rheumatology, Akita University Graduate School of Medicine, 1-1-1 Hondo, Akita, 010-8543, Japan. naotot@doc.med.akita-u.ac.jp.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6758-3787'],['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20180430,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (ABCG2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (macrophage MHC receptor 1, human)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Consolidation Chemotherapy', '*Drug Substitution', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/therapeutic use', 'Japan', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Receptors, Immunologic', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['ABCG2', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Deep molecular response', 'Tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",2018/05/02 06:00,2018/09/07 06:00,['2018/05/02 06:00'],"['2018/02/14 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/23 00:00 [revised]', '2018/05/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/07 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/02 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-018-2459-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-018-2459-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2018 Aug;108(2):176-183. doi: 10.1007/s12185-018-2459-6.

Traditional methods operate a number of times for each individual concentration, and innovation is required for the design of more simple and efficient manipulation platforms with necessary higher sensitivity. Here, we have developed a novel diffused total internal reflection (TIR) method to perform drug metabolism and cytotoxicity analysis of trapped myeloid leukemia cells. Molm-13 cells, a type of acute myeloid leukemia cell, were chosen and injected into the device and fittingly captured by cell traps. Differing from previous studies, a series of different concentrations of azelaic acid (AZA) drug could be used from 0 mM to 50 mM through convection and diffusion processes in a single chip, with each concentration region featuring 50 cells, with a total of 549 cell trapping units. Thanks to the high sensitivity of the TIR method, only cells with the same drug concentration could be illuminated in the detection process. By adjusting the incident angle, we could exactly detect and monitor the drug resistance of the cells using different drug concentrations and the experimental resolution of the drug concentration was as small as 5 mM. Images of the membrane integrity and morphology of the cells in the bright field were measured and we also monitored the cell viabilities in the dark field over 2 hours. The effects of AZA on the Molm-13 cells were explored in different concentrations at the single cell level. Compared with the results of the traditional MTT assay method, the experimental results are more simple and accurate. A cell death of 5% at an AZA concentration of 5 mM was observed after 30 minutes, while a concentration of 40 mM corresponded to a 98% cell death. The designed method in this study provides a novel toolkit to control and monitor drug resistance at the single cell level more easily with higher sensitivity and we believe it has significant potential application in single cell quality assessment and medicine analysis in clinical practice.","['Liang, L', 'Jin, Y X', 'Zhu, X Q', 'Zhou, F L', 'Yang, Y']","['Liang L', 'Jin YX', 'Zhu XQ', 'Zhou FL', 'Yang Y']","['School of Physics & technology, Key Laboratory of Artificial Micro/Nano Structure of Ministry of Education, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430072, China. yangyiys@whu.edu.cn.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Lab Chip,Lab on a chip,101128948,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Dicarboxylic Acids)', 'F2VW3D43YT (azelaic acid)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dicarboxylic Acids/pharmacology', 'Drug Monitoring/*instrumentation', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', '*Lab-On-A-Chip Devices', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Microfluidic Analytical Techniques/instrumentation', 'Optics and Photonics/*instrumentation', 'Single-Cell Analysis/*instrumentation']",,,2018/05/02 06:00,2018/10/20 06:00,['2018/05/02 06:00'],"['2018/05/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/20 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/02 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1039/c8lc00088c [doi]'],ppublish,Lab Chip. 2018 May 15;18(10):1422-1429. doi: 10.1039/c8lc00088c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Materials and methods: We performed a search for publications addressing spermatogonial stem cell transplantation in the treatment of male infertility. The search engines PubMed and Google Scholar were used from 1990 to 2017. Search terms were relevant for spermatogonial stem cell therapies. Titles of publications were screened for relevance; abstracts were read, if related and full papers were reviewed for directly pertinent original research. Results: In all, 58 papers were found to be relevant to this review, and were included in appropriate subheadings. This review discusses the various techniques that SSCs are being investigated to treat forms of male infertility. Conclusions: Evidence does not yet support clinical application of SSCs in humans. However, significant progress in the in vitro and in vivo development of SSCs, including differentiation into functional germ cells, gives reason for cautious optimism for future research.","['Forbes, Connor M', 'Flannigan, Ryan', 'Schlegel, Peter N']","['Forbes CM', 'Flannigan R', 'Schlegel PN']","['Department of Urology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', 'Department of Urology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Urology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20171227,United States,Arab J Urol,Arab journal of urology,101562480,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['ART, assisted reproductive technologies', 'Allograft', 'BMP4, bone morphogenetic protein 4', 'Bcl6b, B-Cell CLL/Lymphoma 6B', 'CD(24)(34), cluster of differentiation (24)(34)', 'FGF2, Fibroblast growth factor 2', 'FISH, fluorescence in situ hybridisation', 'Fertility preservation', 'GDNF, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor', 'ICSI, intracytoplasmic sperm injection', 'ID4, inhibitor of differentiation 4', 'KS, Klinefelter syndrome', 'Male infertility', 'Non-obstructive azoospermia', 'Onco-fertility', 'PGC, primordial germ cells', 'PLZF, promyelocytic leukaemia zinc finger', 'PRISMA, Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses', 'RA(R), retinoic acid (receptor)', 'SPG, spermatogonia', 'SSC, spermatogonial stem cell', 'Stem cell therapy', 'Stra8, stimulated by RA 8', 'ZBTB, zinc finger and broad complex/Tramtrack/bric-a-brac', 'c-Kit, KIT Proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase']",2018/05/02 06:00,2018/05/02 06:01,['2018/05/02 06:00'],"['2017/11/09 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/25 00:00 [revised]', '2017/11/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/02 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.aju.2017.11.015 [doi]', 'S2090-598X(17)30149-3 [pii]']",epublish,Arab J Urol. 2017 Dec 27;16(1):171-180. doi: 10.1016/j.aju.2017.11.015. eCollection 2018 Mar.,,,,PMC5922182,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It participates in blood cell formation, forms mesoderm in early embryogenesis, and regulates hematopoiesis in adult organisms. TAL1 is essential in maintaining the multipotency of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and keeping them in quiescence (stage G0). TAL1 forms complexes with various transcription factors, regulating hematopoiesis (E2A/HEB, GATA1-3, LMO1-2, Ldb1, ETO2, RUNX1, ERG, FLI1). In these complexes, TAL1 regulates normal myeloid differentiation, controls the proliferation of erythroid progenitors, and determines the choice of the direction of HSC differentiation. The transcription factors TAL1, E2A, GATA1 (or GATA2), LMO2, and Ldb1 are the major components of the SCL complex. In addition to normal hematopoiesis, this complex may also be involved in the process of blood cell malignant transformation. Upregulation of C-KIT expression is one of the main roles played by the SCL complex. Today, TAL1 and its partners are considered promising therapeutic targets in the treatment of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Vagapova, E R', 'Spirin, P V', 'Lebedev, T D', 'Prassolov, V S']","['Vagapova ER', 'Spirin PV', 'Lebedev TD', 'Prassolov VS']","['The Engelhardt Institute of Molecular Biology, Russian Academy of Sciences, Vavilova Str. 32, Moscow,119991, Russia.', 'The Engelhardt Institute of Molecular Biology, Russian Academy of Sciences, Vavilova Str. 32, Moscow,119991, Russia.', 'The Engelhardt Institute of Molecular Biology, Russian Academy of Sciences, Vavilova Str. 32, Moscow,119991, Russia.', 'The Engelhardt Institute of Molecular Biology, Russian Academy of Sciences, Vavilova Str. 32, Moscow,119991, Russia.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Russia (Federation),Acta Naturae,Acta naturae,101525823,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'hematopoiesis', 'receptor tyrosine kinase C-KIT']",2018/05/02 06:00,2018/05/02 06:01,['2018/05/02 06:00'],"['2018/05/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/02 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Acta Naturae. 2018 Jan-Mar;10(1):15-23.,,,,PMC5916730,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inotuzumab ozogamicin is a humanized CD22 monoclonal antibody linked to the cytotoxic agent calicheamicin. CD22 is expressed on leukemic blasts in >90% of ALL patients, and inotuzumab ozogamicin has shown excellent clinical activity even among heavily pretreated relapsed/refractory (R/R) B-ALL patients and elderly B-ALL patients. Clinical trials have shown superior survival with the drug over chemotherapy-based approaches in the first- or second-line salvage therapy for relapsed B-ALL as monotherapy. Currently, new trials are evaluating inotuzumab ozogamicin in the frontline setting in combination-based approaches.

The current systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the association between SIRT3 expression and prognosis in various cancers. Methods: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library were comprehensively retrieved by the end of September 29, 2017. All the relevant studies were checked and included in the meta-analysis if they met the inclusion criteria. Results: A total of 17 studies involving 2,865 patients were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. The results indicated that SIRT3 expression was not significantly associated with overall survival (OS) (hazard ratio [HR]=0.87, 95% CI=0.59-1.29, P=0.50) and disease-free survival (HR=0.87, 95% CI=0.57-1.31, P=0.50) in total various cancers. However, significant relationship between SIRT3 expression and OS in specific cancers was detected, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (HR=0.48, 95% CI=0.26-0.89, P=0.019), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (HR=0.56, 95% CI=0.42-0.74, P<0.001), pancreatic carcinoma (PC) (HR=0.55, 95% CI=0.30-1.00, P=0.049), renal cell carcinoma (RCC) (HR=0.13, 95% CI=0.02-0.98, P=0.048), breast cancer (BC) (HR=2.53, 95% CI=1.83-3.67, P<0.001), colon cancer (CC) (HR=1.87, 95% CI=1.12-3.26, P=0.022) and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (HR=2.20, 95% CI=1.38-3.50, P=0.001). Moreover, SIRT3 expression was obviously associated with tumor size (odds ratio [OR]=1.41, 95% CI=1.02-1.94, P=0.04), tumor differentiation (OR=1.52, 95% CI=1.08-2.16, P=0.02) and clinical stage (OR=2.07, 95% CI=1.23-3.46, P=0.01) in HCC. Conclusion: SIRT3 was distinctly related to the OS in specific cancers. SIRT3 was an unfavorable prognostic factor in BC, CC and NSCLC; however, it was also a favorable prognostic factor in CLL, HCC, PC and RCC, especially in HCC.","['Zhou, Yongping', 'Cheng, Sijin', 'Chen, Sinuo', 'Zhao, Yongzhao']","['Zhou Y', 'Cheng S', 'Chen S', 'Zhao Y']","[""Department of Hepatobiliary, Wuxi Second Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, Wuxi, People's Republic of China."", 'Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', ""Department of Hepatobiliary, Wuxi Second Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, Wuxi, People's Republic of China."", 'Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180413,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['SIRT3', 'cancer', 'clinicopathological', 'meta-analysis', 'overall survival', 'prognostic']",2018/05/02 06:00,2018/05/02 06:01,['2018/05/02 06:00'],"['2018/05/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/02 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S157836 [doi]', 'ott-11-2157 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2018 Apr 13;11:2157-2167. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S157836. eCollection 2018.,,,,PMC5907887,,,['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,

We used synthetic chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) to overcome immunological tolerance and mediate tumor rejection in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Remission was induced in a subset of subjects, but most did not respond. Comprehensive assessment of patient-derived CAR T cells to identify mechanisms of therapeutic success and failure has not been explored. We performed genomic, phenotypic and functional evaluations to identify determinants of response. Transcriptomic profiling revealed that CAR T cells from complete-responding patients with CLL were enriched in memory-related genes, including IL-6/STAT3 signatures, whereas T cells from nonresponders upregulated programs involved in effector differentiation, glycolysis, exhaustion and apoptosis. Sustained remission was associated with an elevated frequency of CD27(+)CD45RO(-)CD8(+) T cells before CAR T cell generation, and these lymphocytes possessed memory-like characteristics. Highly functional CAR T cells from patients produced STAT3-related cytokines, and serum IL-6 correlated with CAR T cell expansion. IL-6/STAT3 blockade diminished CAR T cell proliferation. Furthermore, a mechanistically relevant population of CD27(+)PD-1(-)CD8(+) CAR T cells expressing high levels of the IL-6 receptor predicts therapeutic response and is responsible for tumor control. These findings uncover new features of CAR T cell biology and underscore the potential of using pretreatment biomarkers of response to advance immunotherapies.","['Fraietta, Joseph A', 'Lacey, Simon

Leishmaniasis manifests in 3 different forms: Visceral (also known as Kala Azar), which is the most serious type; cutaneous, which is the most common type; and mucocutaneous. The symptoms of this infection range from a silent infection to fever, enlargement of the liver and spleen, weight loss, and pancytopenia. CASE REPORT In this case report, we discuss a 73-year-old man known to have chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), presenting with unremitting fever and who to our surprise was found to have Kala Azar. CONCLUSIONS Early diagnosis and treatment are very important in treating visceral leishmaniasis. While the conventional treatment in immunocompromised patients is liposomal amphotericin B, our patient responded to corticosteroids.","['Nicolas, Gregory', 'Koury, Elliott', 'Osman, Dani', 'Saliba, Christian', 'Nehme, Lea', 'Mitri, Stephanie', 'El Sayegh, Julien-Sami Atef', 'Rached, Linda', 'Khoury, George']","['Nicolas G', 'Koury E', 'Osman D', 'Saliba C', 'Nehme L', 'Mitri S', 'El Sayegh JA', 'Rached L', 'Khoury G']","['Department of General Surgery, Lebanese American University Medical Center-Rizk Hospital (LAUMCRH), Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, Lebanese American University Medical Center-Rizk Hospital (LAUMCRH), Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of General Surgery, Lebanese American University Medical Center-Rizk Hospital (LAUMCRH), Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of General Surgery, Lebanese American University Medical Center-Rizk Hospital (LAUMCRH), Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Lebanese American University Medical Center-Rizk Hospital (LAUMCRH), Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Lebanese American University Medical Center-Rizk Hospital (LAUMCRH), Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of General Surgery, Lebanese American University Medical Center-Rizk Hospital (LAUMCRH), Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of General Surgery, Lebanese American University Medical Center-Rizk Hospital (LAUMCRH), Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of General Surgery, Lebanese American University Medical Center-Rizk Hospital (LAUMCRH), Beirut, Lebanon.']",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20180501,United States,Am J Case Rep,The American journal of case reports,101489566,"['0 (Antiprotozoal Agents)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (liposomal amphotericin B)', '5GMR90S4KN (Methylprednisolone Hemisuccinate)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Amphotericin B/therapeutic use', 'Antiprotozoal Agents/therapeutic use', 'Fever/parasitology', 'Glucocorticoids/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Leishmaniasis, Visceral/*diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*complications', 'Male', 'Methylprednisolone Hemisuccinate/therapeutic use']",,,2018/05/02 06:00,2018/10/12 06:00,['2018/05/02 06:00'],"['2018/05/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/12 06:00 [medline]']","['907584 [pii]', '10.12659/AJCR.907584 [doi]']",epublish,Am J Case Rep. 2018 May 1;19:512-516. doi: 10.12659/AJCR.907584.,,,,PMC5952821,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Complete loss of its function is lethal during early embryonic development. Patients who are compound heterozygous for BRCA1 truncating mutations and missense alleles that retain some DNA repair capacity may survive, albeit with very high risk of early onset breast or ovarian cancer and features of Fanconi anemia. However, a mechanism enabling survival of patients homozygous for BRCA1 truncating mutations has not been described. We studied two unrelated families in which four children presented with multiple congenital anomalies and severe chromosomal fragility. One child developed T cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), and a second child developed neuroblastoma. Each of the four children was homozygous for a nonsense mutation in BRCA1 exon 11. Homozygosity for the nonsense mutations was viable thanks to the presence of a naturally occurring alternative splice donor in BRCA1 exon 11 that lies 5' of the mutations. The mutations did not affect the alternative splice site, but transcription from it produced an in-frame BRCA1 message with deletion of 3,309 bp. The translated BRCA1 protein was only 40% of normal length, but with intact N- and C-terminal sequences. These patients extend the range of BRCA1-related phenotypes and illustrate how naturally occurring alternative splicing can enable survival, albeit with severe consequences, of otherwise lethal genotypes of an essential gene.","['Seo, Aaron', 'Steinberg-Shemer, Orna', 'Unal, Sule', 'Casadei, Silvia', 'Walsh, Tom', 'Gumruk, Fatma', 'Shalev, Stavit', 'Shimamura, Akiko', 'Akarsu, Nurten Ayse', 'Tamary, Hannah', 'King, Mary-Claire']","['Seo A', 'Steinberg-Shemer O', 'Unal S', 'Casadei S', 'Walsh T', 'Gumruk F', 'Shalev S', 'Shimamura A', 'Akarsu NA', 'Tamary H', 'King MC']","['Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195.', 'Department of Genome Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195.', ""Hematology Unit, Schneider Children's Medical Center, Petach Tikva 49202, Israel."", 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv 69978, Israel.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hacettepe University, Ankara 06100, Turkey.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195.', 'Department of Genome Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195.', 'Department of Genome Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Hacettepe University, Ankara 06100, Turkey.', 'Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa 3525433, Israel.', ""Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115."", 'Department of Medical Genetics, Hacettepe University, Ankara 06100, Turkey.', ""Hematology Unit, Schneider Children's Medical Center, Petach Tikva 49202, Israel."", 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv 69978, Israel.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195; mcking@uw.edu.', 'Department of Genome Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180430,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (BRCA1 Protein)', '0 (BRCA1 protein, human)', '0 (Codon, Nonsense)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Alternative Splicing', 'BRCA1 Protein/*genetics', 'Breast Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Codon, Nonsense', 'Female', '*Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Pedigree']",['NOTNLM'],"['*BRCA1', '*DNA repair', '*RNA splicing', '*chromosomal fragility']",2018/05/02 06:00,2018/09/05 06:00,['2018/05/02 06:00'],"['2018/05/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/05 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/02 06:00 [entrez]']","['1801796115 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1801796115 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2018 May 15;115(20):5241-5246. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1801796115.

CLL patients have more plasma IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, than healthy controls. In vitro human CLL cells produce IL-10 in response to BCR cross-linking. We used the transgenic Emu-T cell leukemia oncogene-1 (TCL1) mouse CLL model to study the role of IL-10 in CLL associated immunosuppression. Emu-TCL mice spontaneously develop CLL because of a B cell-specific expression of the oncogene, TCL1. Emu-TCL1 mouse CLL cells constitutively produce IL-10, which is further enhanced by BCR cross-linking, CLL-derived IL-10 did not directly affect survival of murine or human CLL cells in vitro. We tested the hypothesis that the CLL-derived IL-10 has a critical role in CLL disease in part by suppressing the host immune response to the CLL cells. In IL-10R(-/-) mice, wherein the host immune cells are unresponsive to IL-10-mediated suppressive effects, there was a significant reduction in CLL cell growth compared with wild type mice. IL-10 reduced the generation of effector CD4 and CD8 T cells. We also found that activation of BCR signaling regulated the production of IL-10 by both murine and human CLL cells. We identified the transcription factor, Sp1, as a novel regulator of IL-10 production by CLL cells and that it is regulated by BCR signaling via the Syk/MAPK pathway. Our results suggest that incorporation of IL-10 blocking agents may enhance current therapeutic regimens for CLL by potentiating host antitumor immune response.","['Alhakeem, Sara S', 'McKenna, Mary K', 'Oben, Karine Z', 'Noothi, Sunil K', 'Rivas, Jacqueline R', 'Hildebrandt, Gerhard C', 'Fleischman, Roger A', 'Rangnekar, Vivek M', 'Muthusamy, Natarajan', 'Bondada, Subbarao']","['Alhakeem SS', 'McKenna MK', 'Oben KZ', 'Noothi SK', 'Rivas JR', 'Hildebrandt GC', 'Fleischman RA', 'Rangnekar VM', 'Muthusamy N', 'Bondada S']","['Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular Genetics, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40536.', 'Markey Cancer Center, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40536.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular Genetics, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40536.', 'Markey Cancer Center, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40536.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular Genetics, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40536.', 'Markey Cancer Center, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40536.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular Genetics, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40536.', 'Markey Cancer Center, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40536.', 'Department of Radiation Medicine, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40536.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular Genetics, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40536.', 'Markey Cancer Center, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40536.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular Genetics, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40536.', 'Markey Cancer Center, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40536.', 'Division of Hematology, Blood, and Marrow Transplantation, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40536.', 'Markey Cancer Center, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40536.', 'Division of Hematology, Blood, and Marrow Transplantation, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40536.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular Genetics, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40536.', 'Markey Cancer Center, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40536.', 'Department of Radiation Medicine, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40536.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210; and.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular Genetics, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40536; bondada@email.uky.edu.', 'Markey Cancer Center, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40536.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-2357-1733', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0195-7253', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3949-1604', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7811-6888']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20180430,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (IL10 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Proliferation/physiology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-10/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/immunology', 'Signal Transduction/immunology']",,,2018/05/02 06:00,2019/04/09 06:00,['2018/05/02 06:00'],"['2018/02/20 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/09 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/02 06:00 [entrez]']","['jimmunol.1800241 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1800241 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2018 Jun 15;200(12):4180-4189. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1800241.

This study aimed to characterize the pharmacokinetics of the posaconazole solid tablet formulation in adult subjects and to investigate the potential impact of demographic and clinical factors on posaconazole exposure through a population pharmacokinetic approach. Nonlinear mixed-effects modeling was performed using data from several studies conducted in healthy volunteers and patients. The influence of demographic and clinical factors on pharmacokinetic parameters was evaluated using a stepwise forward inclusion/backward exclusion procedure. The final pharmacokinetic model was used to simulate posaconazole exposure in patients at high risk for invasive fungal diseases treated with the proposed posaconazole dose of 300 mg twice daily on day 1, followed by 300 mg daily for 27 days. A one-compartment pharmacokinetic model with sequential zero-order and first-order absorption and a first-order disposition from the central compartment adequately described the pharmacokinetic profile of the posaconazole solid tablet formulation. Significant covariates included disease state (acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplasia versus allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation), body weight, and formulation on bioavailability; food status on first-order absorption rate; and dosing regimen (a single dose versus multiple doses) on clearance. Except for body weight, the impact of these covariates on posaconazole exposure was considered clinically irrelevant. This population pharmacokinetic analysis confirmed that the proposed dose of the posaconazole solid tablet formulation provides adequate target therapeutic exposure (>0.5 mg/liter) to a broad range of patients at high risk for invasive fungal disease.","['van Iersel, Marlou L P S', 'Rossenu, Stefaan', 'de Greef, Rik', 'Waskin, Hetty']","['van Iersel MLPS', 'Rossenu S', 'de Greef R', 'Waskin H']","['Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, New Jersey, USA.', 'Nederlandse Voedsel-en Warenautoriteit, Wageningen, Netherlands.', 'Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, New Jersey, USA.', 'Janssen, Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson and Johnson, Beerse, Belgium.', 'Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, New Jersey, USA.', 'Certara Netherlands B.V., Oss, Netherlands.', 'Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, New Jersey, USA Hetty.Waskin@merck.com.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180626,United States,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,0315061,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Tablets)', '0 (Triazoles)', '6TK1G07BHZ (posaconazole)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Antifungal Agents/*administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Tablets/*administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Triazoles/*administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*antifungal agents', '*pharmacokinetics', '*posaconazole']",2018/05/02 06:00,2019/09/03 06:00,['2018/05/02 06:00'],"['2017/12/04 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/03 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/02 06:00 [entrez]']","['AAC.02465-17 [pii]', '10.1128/AAC.02465-17 [doi]']",epublish,Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2018 Jun 26;62(7). pii: AAC.02465-17. doi: 10.1128/AAC.02465-17.

Less toxic and more effective drugs for leukemia patients are therefore expected. In the present study, the efficacy of a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, Voxtalisib, on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell line HL60 and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cell line K562, as well as their Adriamycin (ADR)-selected multi drug resistance (MDR) counterparts HL60/ADR and K562/A02, was investigated. Voxtalisib exhibited potent anti-proliferative activity on these four cell lines dose-dependently, with IC50 values as 2.23muM for HL60, 4.79muM for HL60/ADR, 4.20muM for K562 and 3.90muM for K562/A02 cells. Voxtalisib arrested cell cycle progression at G1 phase in all cell lines by upregulating p27, downregulating cyclin D1 and p-pRb. When combined with ADR, Voxtalisib reversed the ADR-resistance of HL60/ADR and K562/A02 cells, possibly by reducing MDR1 and MRP1 expression. In conclusion, Voxtalisib showed anti-leukemia activity on AML and CML cell lines as well as their multidrug resistant ones, suggesting Voxtalisib might become a promising drug candidate for therapy of AML and CML in the future.","['Zhang, Lei', 'Wang, Zhengming', 'Khishignyam, Tungalagtamir', 'Chen, Ting', 'Zhou, Chang', 'Zhang, Zhe', 'Jin, Meihua', 'Wang, Ran', 'Qiu, Yuling', 'Kong, Dexin']","['Zhang L', 'Wang Z', 'Khishignyam T', 'Chen T', 'Zhou C', 'Zhang Z', 'Jin M', 'Wang R', 'Qiu Y', 'Kong D']","['Tianjin Key Laboratory on Technologies Enabling Development of Clinical Therapeutics and Diagnostics, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, 300070, China.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory on Technologies Enabling Development of Clinical Therapeutics and Diagnostics, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, 300070, China.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory on Technologies Enabling Development of Clinical Therapeutics and Diagnostics, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, 300070, China.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory on Technologies Enabling Development of Clinical Therapeutics and Diagnostics, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, 300070, China.', 'Department of pharmacy, Tianjin Haihe Hospital, Tianjin, 300350, China.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory on Technologies Enabling Development of Clinical Therapeutics and Diagnostics, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, 300070, China.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory on Technologies Enabling Development of Clinical Therapeutics and Diagnostics, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, 300070, China.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory on Technologies Enabling Development of Clinical Therapeutics and Diagnostics, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, 300070, China.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory on Technologies Enabling Development of Clinical Therapeutics and Diagnostics, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, 300070, China.

On the other hand, herbal derivatives have obtained a great research interest in the field of therapeutic applications because of their more favorable specifications including less toxicity, cost-effective and more physiologically compatible than the chemical drugs. For this purpose, we evaluated methanolic extract prepared from Centaurea albonitens Turrill alone and in combination with Vincristine (VCR) for its potential cytotoxic effects in NALM-6, REH, NB4 and KMM-1 cell lines by using the various approaches. Centaurea genus is one of the current medicinal plants, which has used in traditional medicine, However, there are rare studies to examine its anticancer properties against hematologic malignant cells. In this study, we demonstrated Centaurea albonitens extract (CAE) induces cytotoxicity through G0/G1 phase arrest followed by apoptosis in a dose- and time- dependent manner, although with varying efficiency. Interestingly, normal cells didn't exhibit significant cytotoxicity after CAE treatment. Moreover, we found that low dose of CAE enhances anti-cancer effects of VCR in pre-B ALL cell lines (NALM-6 and REH). Further investigations validated synergistic anticancer activities of VCR and CAE through inducing apoptosis without significant cell cycle arrest. Taken together, our results demonstrated for the first time that the methanolic extract of Centaurea albonitens can be considered as a potential anticancer agent and/or an enhancer of chemotherapeutic sensitivity of VCR.","['Bahmani, Forouzan', 'Esmaeili, Somayeh', 'Bashash, Davood', 'Dehghan-Nayeri, Nasrin', 'Mashati, Pargol', 'Gharehbaghian, Ahmad']","['Bahmani F', 'Esmaeili S', 'Bashash D', 'Dehghan-Nayeri N', 'Mashati P', 'Gharehbaghian A']","['Department of Laboratory Hematology and Blood Bank, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.

To do this, alignment free GRid-INdependent Descriptors (GRINDs), which were derived from molecular interaction fields (MIFs), were correlated to the cytotoxicity values by partial least squares (PLS) and support vector regression (SVR). Genetic algorithm (GA), as a powerful linear tool, was used to select the best and interpretative subset of variables for the predictive model building. The selected variables with the capability to screen the effective structural features, showed direct and inverse contribution to the cytotoxicity. In silico modeling can reduce the amount of cellular testing necessary by predicting the toxicological functions of the chemical structures. Acceptable predictions of both internal and external validation sets made it possible to develop the predictive models for a large set of 269 diverse ILs containing 9 cationic cores and 44 types of anions. The constructed 3D-QSTR models use simple and interpretable descriptors to provide an in-depth and mechanistic interpretation of structural characteristics. This helps provide a clear understanding of the cytotoxicity effects of the understudy ILs. The effects of the nature of the cations, anions, and substituents on the cytotoxicities were evaluated and discussed.","['Farahani, Saeedeh Rahimi', 'Sohrabi, Mahmoud Reza', 'Ghasemi, Jahan B']","['Farahani SR', 'Sohrabi MR', 'Ghasemi JB']","['Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry, Azad University, North Tehran Branch, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry, Azad University, North Tehran Branch, Tehran, Iran.', 'College of Sciences, Faculty of Chemistry, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran.

Cameroonian medicinal plants investigated in this work are traditionally used to treat cancer or ailments with relevance to cancer or cancer-like symptoms. AIM OF THE STUDY: In this study, 21 methanol extracts from 18 Cameroonian medicinal plants were tested in leukemia CCRF-CEM cells, and the best extracts were further tested on a panel of human cancer cell lines, including various multi-drug-resistant (MDR) phenotypes. Mechanistic studies were performed with the three best extracts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Resazurin reduction assay was used to evaluate cytotoxicity and ferroptotic effects of methanol extracts from different plants. Flow cytometry was used to analyze cell cycle, apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) of extracts from Curcuma longa rhizomes (CLR), Lycopersicon esculentum leaves (LEL), and Psidium guajava bark (PGB). RESULTS: In a pre-screening of all extracts, 13 out of 21 (61.9%) had IC50 values below 80microg/mL. Six of these active extracts displayed IC50 values below 30microg/mL: Cola pachycarpa leaves (CPL), Curcuma longa rhizomes (CLR), Lycopersicon esculentum leaves, Persea americana bark (PAB), Physalis peruviana twigs (PPT) and Psidium guajava bark (PGB). The best extracts displayed IC50 values from 6.25microg/mL (against HCT116 p53(-/-)) to 10.29microg/mL (towards breast adenocarcinoma MDA-MB-231-BCRP cells) for CLR, from 9.64microg/mL (against breast adenocarcinoma MDA-MB-231 cells) to 57.74microg/mL (against HepG2 cells) for LEL and from 1.29microg/mL (towards CEM/ADR5000 cells) to 62.64microg/mL (towards MDA-MB-231 cells) for PGB. CLR and PGB induced apoptosis in CCRF-CEM cells via caspases activation, MMP depletion and increase ROS production whilst LEL induced apoptosis mediated by caspases activation and increase ROS production. CONCLUSION: The best botanicals tested were CLR and LEL, which are worth to be explored in more detail to fight cancers including MDR phenotypes.","['Mbaveng, Armelle T', 'Manekeng, Hermione T', 'Nguenang, Gaelle S', 'Dzotam, Joachim K', 'Kuete, Victor', 'Efferth, Thomas']","['Mbaveng AT', 'Manekeng HT', 'Nguenang GS', 'Dzotam JK', 'Kuete V', 'Efferth T']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Institute of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, University of Mainz, Staudinger Weg 5, 55128 Mainz, Germany; Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Dschang, Dschang, Cameroon.

STUDY DESIGN: We analyzed all PICCs and conventional tunneled catheters placed in patients aged <18 years and admitted to our institute for leukemia treatment between February 2008 and April 2014. Cases of symptomatic CAT were confirmed by ultrasound and treated with low-molecular-weight heparin. RESULTS: During the study period, 157 PICCs and 138 conventional tunneled catheters were placed in 192 patients with leukemia. CAT incidence was 1.5% (n = 2) in the conventional tunneled catheter group and 10.2% (n = 16) in the PICC group. The OR for CAT occurrence after PICC vs conventional tunneled catheter placement was 5.6 (95% CI, 1.2-26.5). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the use of PICCs in children with leukemia increases the risk of CAT in comparison with the use of conventional tunneled catheters. Further randomized controlled studies are needed to characterize this risk and to better define indications.","['Noailly Charny, Pierre-Amael', 'Bleyzac, Nathalie', 'Ohannessian, Robin', 'Aubert, Edouard', 'Bertrand, Yves', 'Renard, Cecile']","['Noailly Charny PA', 'Bleyzac N', 'Ohannessian R', 'Aubert E', 'Bertrand Y', 'Renard C']","['Institute of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon, France; University of Lyon Claude Bernard, Lyon, France.

CD47-SIRPalpha triggers a cascade of events that inhibit phagocytosis. Preclinical research supports several models of antibody-mediated blockade of CD47-SIRPalpha resulting in cell death signaling, phagocytosis of cells bearing stress signals, and priming of tumor-specific T cell responses. Four different antibody molecules designed to target the CD47-SIRPalpha interaction in malignancy are currently being studied in clinical trials: Hu5F9-G4, CC-90002, TTI-621, and ALX-148. Hu5F9-G4, a humanized anti-CD47 blocking antibody is currently being studied in four different Phase I trials. These studies may lay the groundwork for therapeutic bispecific antibodies. Bispecific antibody (CD20-CD47SL) fusion of anti-CD20 (Rituximab) and anti-CD47 also demonstrated a synergistic effect against lymphoma in preclinical models.

In this review, the risks and timing of infections associated with these agents are described, taking into account disease and treatment status. Treatment with ibrutinib as monotherapy or in combination with chemo-immunotherapies is not associated with additional risk for infection. In contrast, the use of idelalisib is associated with a 2-fold risk for severe infection and opportunistic infections. Venetoclax does not appear to be associated with additional infection risk. The evolving spectrum of pathogens responsible infections in CLL patients, especially those with relapsed and refractory disease are described, and prevention strategies (prophylaxis, monitoring and vaccination) are proposed.","['Teh, Benjamin W', 'Tam, Constantine S', 'Handunnetti, Sasanka', 'Worth, Leon J', 'Slavin, Monica A']","['Teh BW', 'Tam CS', 'Handunnetti S', 'Worth LJ', 'Slavin MA']","['Department of Infectious Diseases, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Victoria, Australia; National Centre for Infections in Cancer, Victoria, Australia; Sir Peter MacCallum Department of Oncology, University of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.

Although the action of the initial MPL ligand thrombopoietin (TPO) on human megakaryocytic regeneration from irradiated human hematopoietic stem cells has been examined, there are few reports on the action of RP. In the present study, freshly prepared nonirradiated and 2-Gy X-irradiated human CD34 positive (CD34(+)) cells from placental umbilical cord blood were cultured with a combination of RP and various cytokines. As a result, the effect of RP on cell proliferation of nonirradiated CD34(+) cells was found to be comparable to that of TPO. However, the stimulating activity of RP on megakaryocytic progenitor-derived colony formation was markedly lower compared with TPO. Regarding the action of RP with various cytokines, the present results showed that a combination of RP with interleukin-3 (IL-3) or IL-3 plus stem cell factor (SCF) showed a high regenerative effect on cell proliferation, megakaryopoiesis, thrombopoiesis, and megakaryocyte colony formation from X-irradiated CD34(+) cells. The present study showed that human recombinant RP has potential effects on human megakaryocytic regeneration from X-irradiated human CD34(+) cells and synergistically acts with IL-3 and IL-3 plus SCF, just as observed with TPO.","['Monzen, Satoru', 'Kimura, Shunta', 'Yamaguchi, Masaru', 'Kashiwakura, Ikuo']","['Monzen S', 'Kimura S', 'Yamaguchi M', 'Kashiwakura I']","['Department of Radiation Science, Hirosaki University Graduate School of Health Sciences , Aomori, Japan .', 'Department of Radiation Science, Hirosaki University Graduate School of Health Sciences , Aomori, Japan .', 'Department of Radiation Science, Hirosaki University Graduate School of Health Sciences , Aomori, Japan .', 'Department of Radiation Science, Hirosaki University Graduate School of Health Sciences , Aomori, Japan .']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180430,United States,J Interferon Cytokine Res,Journal of interferon & cytokine research : the official journal of the International Society for Interferon and Cytokine Research,9507088,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Protective Agents)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)', 'GN5XU2DXKV (romiplostim)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/*drug effects/immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/immunology', 'Humans', 'Megakaryocytes/*drug effects/immunology', 'Protective Agents/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Fc', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Thrombopoietin/*pharmacology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*hematopoietic stem cells', '*megakaryopoiesis', '*radiomitigative effects', '*romiplostim']",2018/05/01 06:00,2019/10/24 06:00,['2018/05/01 06:00'],"['2018/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/24 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/jir.2017.0104 [doi]'],ppublish,J Interferon Cytokine Res. 2018 May;38(5):206-212. doi: 10.1089/jir.2017.0104.

This paper proposes and discusses a key similarity: both thunderstorms and HVPL generate a high enough electrical field in the environment to ionize nearby air and air-borne particles. I argue that the repeatedly demonstrated acute asthma response to pollen-laden air during thunderstorms is largely due to ionization of air-borne allergens, which adhere more readily and in greater quantity in the lungs than non-ionized particles. If these bind to mucous or phagocytic cells, it would enhance immune response. A rapid temperature drop and high ozone also seem to be drivers of thunderstorm asthma. This causal nexus provides strong support for the parallel situation of prolonged exposure to ionized particles near HVPL and an increased rate of childhood leukemia. Here, it is proposed that upwind carcinogens are ionized when passing HVPL and then residential and business areas. Published evidence for most steps are presented, but have not previously been published as a coherent whole, nor has it been suggested that the inhaled ionized micro-particle explanation for acute asthma may also explain development of childhood leukemia over time. The demonstrated series of events leading to increased deposition and retention of ionized particles in airways provides support for explaining both adverse health outcomes: acute thunderstorm asthma and increased risk of childhood leukemia near HVPL. Further support for this explanation of both outcomes is provided by effects of on-going proximity to highways.","['Redmayne, Mary']",['Redmayne M'],"['a Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine , Monash University , Melbourne , Australia.', 'b School of Geography, Environment, and Earth Sciences , Victoria University of Wellington , Wellington , New Zealand.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180430,England,Electromagn Biol Med,Electromagnetic biology and medicine,101133002,,IM,"['Air', 'Asthma/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Child', '*Electric Power Supplies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Pollen/*chemistry/immunology', '*Rain', 'Risk']",['NOTNLM'],"['ELF', 'Thunderstorm asthma', 'childhood leukemia', 'ionized particles', 'lightning', 'pollen', 'power lines']",2018/05/01 06:00,2018/10/03 06:00,['2018/05/01 06:00'],"['2018/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/03 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/15368378.2018.1466309 [doi]'],ppublish,Electromagn Biol Med. 2018;37(2):57-65. doi: 10.1080/15368378.2018.1466309.

We developed a self-inactivating (SIN) lentiviral vector carrying a codon-optimized human IL2RG cDNA driven by the EF1alpha short promoter (EFS-IL2RG), and we tested its efficacy and safety in vivo by transplanting transduced Il2rg-deficient Lin(-) HSPCs in an Il2rg(-/-)/Rag2(-/-) mouse model. The study showed restoration of T, B, and NK cell counts in bone marrow and peripheral blood and normalization of thymus and spleen cellularity and architecture. High-definition insertion site analysis defined the EFS-IL2RG genomic integration profile, and it showed no sign of vector-induced clonal selection or skewing in primarily and secondarily transplanted animals.

This persistent monocytosis should be distinguished from the reactive monocytosis which is sometimes observed in a context of infections or solid tumors. In 2015, Selimoglu-Buet et al. observed an increased percentage of classical monocytes (CD14(+)/CD16(-) >94%) in the peripheral blood (PB) of CMML patients. In this study, using multiparametric flow cytometry (MFC), we assessed the monocytic distribution in PB samples and in bone marrow aspirates from 63 patients with monocytosis or CMML suspicion, and in seven follow-up blood samples from CMML patients treated with hypomethylating agents (HMA). A control group of 12 healthy age-matched donors was evaluated in parallel in order to validate the analysis template. The CMML diagnosis was established in 15 cases in correlation with other clinical manifestations and biological tests. The MFC test for the evaluation of the repartition of monocyte subsets, as previously described by Selimoglu-Buet et al. showed a specificity of 97% in blood and 100% in marrow samples. Additional information regarding the expression of intermediate MO2 monocytes percentage improved the specificity to 100% in blood samples allowing the screening of abnormal monocytosis. The indicative thresholds of CMML monocytosis were different in PB compared to BM samples (classical monocytes >95% for PB and >93% for BM). A decrease of monocyte levels in PB and BM, along with a normalization of monocytes distribution, was observed after treatment in 4/7 CMML patients with favorable evolution. No significant changes were observed in 3/7 patients who did not respond to HMA therapy and also presented unfavorable molecular prognostic factors at diagnosis (ASXL1, TET2, and IDH2 mutations). Considering its simplicity and robustness, the monocyte subsets evaluation by MFC provides relevant information for CMML diagnosis.","['Picot, Tiphanie', 'Aanei, Carmen Mariana', 'Flandrin Gresta, Pascale', 'Noyel, Pauline', 'Tondeur, Sylvie', 'Tavernier Tardy, Emmanuelle', 'Guyotat, Denis', 'Campos Catafal, Lydia']","['Picot T', 'Aanei CM', 'Flandrin Gresta P', 'Noyel P', 'Tondeur S', 'Tavernier Tardy E', 'Guyotat D', 'Campos Catafal L']","[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, CHU de Saint-Etienne, Saint-Etienne, France."", ""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, CHU de Saint-Etienne, Saint-Etienne, France."", ""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, CHU de Saint-Etienne, Saint-Etienne, France."", ""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, CHU de Saint-Etienne, Saint-Etienne, France."", ""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, CHU de Saint-Etienne, Saint-Etienne, France."", ""Departement d'Hematologie et Therapie Cellulaire, Institut de Cancerologie Lucien Neuwirth, Saint-Etienne, France."", ""Departement d'Hematologie et Therapie Cellulaire, Institut de Cancerologie Lucien Neuwirth, Saint-Etienne, France."", ""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, CHU de Saint-Etienne, Saint-Etienne, France.""]",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180412,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic myelomonocytic leukemia', 'flow cytometry', 'karyotype', 'monocytic subpopulations', 'next-generation sequencing', 'peripheral blood monocytosis']",2018/05/01 06:00,2018/05/01 06:01,['2018/05/01 06:00'],"['2018/01/15 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/01 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2018.00109 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2018 Apr 12;8:109. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2018.00109. eCollection 2018.,,,,PMC5906716,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking of proteins play a key role in the development of leukemia and drug resistance. KPT-330 (Selinexor), an inhibitor of chromosome region maintenance 1 (CRM1, nuclear receptor exportin 1, XPO1), demonstrated activities against a few hematological malignancies. We examined the anti-leukemic efficacy of KPT-330 in IM-resistant CML. Cell viability was examined by MTS assay. Apoptosis and cell cycle were assessed by flow cytometry. CRM1 mRNA was detected by PCR. Expression of CRM1 protein and its cargo proteins were determined by western blot or immunofluorescent staining. Furthermore, we engrafted nude mice subcutaneously with IM-resistant CML K562G. Mice were treated with IM, KPT-330 alone or in combination. Expression of CRM1 in CML were markedly higher than control. KPT-330 inhibited proliferation, induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of K562 and K562G. IC50 of IM on K562G was reduced by KPT-330. Mechanistically, KPT-330 inhibited CRM1 and increased the nuclear/cytoplasm ratio of BCR-ABL and P27. p-AKT was downregulated while p-STAT1 and caspase-3 were upregulated. Furthermore, KPT-330 showed anti-leukemic effect in primary IM-resistant CML with T315I mutation in CRM1-dependent manner.

Approximately 60% of patients treated with second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors achieve a deep molecular response, the prerequisite for a trial of treatment-free remission. Those patients unlikely to achieve deep molecular response may benefit from more intensive therapy up front. To identify biomarkers predicting deep molecular response we performed transcriptional profiling on CD34(+) progenitor cells from newly diagnosed chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia patients treated with nilotinib on a prospective clinical trial. Using unsupervised and targeted analytical strategies, we show that gene expression profiles are similar in patients with and without subsequent deep molecular response. This result is in contrast to the distinct expression signature of CD34(+) chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia patients failing to achieve a cytogenetic response on imatinib and suggests that deep molecular response to second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors is governed by the biology of more primitive chronic myeloid leukemia cells or extrinsic factors.","['Patel, Ami B', 'Lange, Thoralf', 'Pomicter, Anthony D', 'Conley, Christopher J', 'Harrington, Christina A', 'Reynolds, Kimberly R', 'Kelley, Todd W', ""O'Hare, Thomas"", 'Deininger, Michael W']","['Patel AB', 'Lange T', 'Pomicter AD', 'Conley CJ', 'Harrington CA', 'Reynolds KR', 'Kelley TW', ""O'Hare T"", 'Deininger MW']","['Division of Hematology and Hematologic Malignancies, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'University of Leipzig, Division of Haematology and Oncology, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'Integrated Genomics Laboratory, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Hematologic Malignancies, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Hematologic Malignancies, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180403,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL1', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'deep molecular response', 'treatment-free remission']",2018/05/01 06:00,2018/05/01 06:01,['2018/05/01 06:00'],"['2018/01/20 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/01 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.24954 [doi]', '24954 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2018 Apr 3;9(25):17889-17894. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.24954. eCollection 2018 Apr 3.,,,"['P30 CA042014/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA178397/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC5915162,,,"['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST MWD is a consultant/advisory board member of Novartis,', 'Pfizer, Galena Biopharma, ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Blueprint Medicines, and Incyte.', 'No conflicts of interest were disclosed by other authors.']",,,,,,,,,,,

Since selective BCL-2 inhibition is a promising treatment strategy in hematologic malignancies, we tested the therapeutic impact of ABT-199 on MDS patient samples bearing an adverse mutational profile. By gene expression, we found that the level of pro-apoptotic BIM significantly decreased during MDS disease progression in line with an acquired resistance to cell death. Supporting the potential for ABT-199 treatment in MDS, high-risk MDS patient samples specifically underwent cell death in response to ABT-199 even when harbouring mutations in ASXL1, RUNX1, TP53 or EZH2. ABT-199 effectively targeted the stem- and progenitor compartment in advanced MDS harbouring mutations in ASXL1, RUNX1, TP53 or EZH2 and even proved effective in patients harbouring more than one of the defined high-risk mutations. Moreover, we utilized the protein abundance of BCL-2 family members in primary patient samples using flow cytometry as a biomarker to predict ABT-199 treatment response. Our data demonstrate that ABT-199 effectively induces apoptosis in progenitors of high-risk MDS/sAML despite the presence of adverse genetic mutations supporting the notion that pro-apoptotic intervention will hold broad therapeutic potential in high-risk MDS patients with poor prognosis.","['Reidel, Veronika', 'Kauschinger, Johanna', 'Hauch, Richard T', 'Muller-Thomas, Catharina', 'Nadarajah, Niroshan', 'Burgkart, Rainer', 'Schmidt, Burkhard', 'Hempel, Dirk', 'Jacob, Anne', 'Slotta-Huspenina, Julia', 'Hockendorf, Ulrike', 'Peschel, Christian', 'Kern, Wolfgang', 'Haferlach, Torsten', 'Gotze, Katharina S', 'Jilg, Stefanie', 'Jost, Philipp J']","['Reidel V', 'Kauschinger J', 'Hauch RT', 'Muller-Thomas C', 'Nadarajah N', 'Burgkart R', 'Schmidt B', 'Hempel D', 'Jacob A', 'Slotta-Huspenina J', 'Hockendorf U', 'Peschel C', 'Kern W', 'Haferlach T', 'Gotze KS', 'Jilg S', 'Jost PJ']","['Medizinische Klinik fur Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik fur Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik fur Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik fur Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Munich Leukemia Laboratory (MLL), Munich, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Orthopadie und Sportorthopadie, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Gemeinschaftspraxis Hamato-Onkologie Pasing, Munich, Germany.', 'Onkologisches Zentrum Donauworth, Donauworth, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik fur Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Institut fur Pathologie, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik fur Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik fur Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Deutsche Konsortium fur translationale Krebsforschung (DKTK) of the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Munich Leukemia Laboratory (MLL), Munich, Germany.', 'Munich Leukemia Laboratory (MLL), Munich, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik fur Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Deutsche Konsortium fur translationale Krebsforschung (DKTK) of the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik fur Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik fur Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Deutsche Konsortium fur translationale Krebsforschung (DKTK) of the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180403,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['ABT-199', 'Autophagy', 'BCL-2 family', 'apoptosis', 'myelodysplastic syndromes', 'myeloid malignancy']",2018/05/01 06:00,2018/05/01 06:01,['2018/05/01 06:00'],"['2017/11/14 00:00 [received]', '2018/02/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/01 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.24775 [doi]', '24775 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2018 Apr 3;9(25):17270-17281. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.24775. eCollection 2018 Apr 3.,,,,PMC5915115,,,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST None.'],,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We used pharmacological inhibitor and cell viability assays to examine the relation between NF-kappaB and LIN28B. Western blot and qRT-PCR was employed to determine their protein and mRNA levels. Luciferase reporter was constructed and applied to explore the transcriptional regulation of LIN28B. We manipulated LIN28B level in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells and investigated LSC-like properties with colony forming and serial replating assays. RESULTS: This study revealed the relationship between NF-kappaB and LIN28B in AML cells through drug inhibition and overexpression experiments. Notably, inhibition of NF-kappaB by pharmacological inhibitors reduced LIN28B expression and decreased cell proliferation. We demonstrated that NF-kappaB binds to the -819 to -811 region of LIN28B promoter, and transcriptionally regulates LIN28B expression. LIN28B protein was significantly elevated in NFkappaB1 transfected cells compared to vector control. Importantly, ectopic expression of LIN28B partially rescued the self-renewal capacity impaired by pharmacological inhibition of NF-kappaB activity. CONCLUSION: These results uncover a regulatory signaling, NF-kappaB/LIN28B, which plays a pivotal role in leukemia stem cell-like properties and it could serve as a promising intervening target for effective treatment of AML disease.","['Zhou, Jianbiao', 'Chooi, Jing-Yuan', 'Ching, Ying Qing', 'Quah, Jessie Yiying', 'Toh, Sabrina Hui-Min', 'Ng, Yvonne', 'Tan, Tuan Zea', 'Chng, Wee-Joo']","['Zhou J', 'Chooi JY', 'Ching YQ', 'Quah JY', 'Toh SH', 'Ng Y', 'Tan TZ', 'Chng WJ']","['Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117599, Singapore.', 'Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore 119074, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117599, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117599, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117599, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117599, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117599, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117599, Singapore.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,World J Stem Cells,World journal of stem cells,101535826,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'LIN28B', 'Leukemia stem cell', 'Nuclear factor kappa B']",2018/05/01 06:00,2018/05/01 06:01,['2018/05/01 06:00'],"['2018/03/06 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/21 00:00 [revised]', '2018/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/01 06:01 [medline]']",['10.4252/wjsc.v10.i4.34 [doi]'],ppublish,World J Stem Cells. 2018 Apr 26;10(4):34-42. doi: 10.4252/wjsc.v10.i4.34.,,,,PMC5919888,,,"['Conflict-of-interest statement: No potential conflicts of interest relevant to', 'this article were reported.']",,,,,,,,,,,

Untargeted metabolomics of small molecules in archived newborn dried blood spots (DBS) offers an avenue for discovering early-life exposures that contribute to disease risks. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to develop a quantitative method for untargeted analysis of archived newborn DBS for use in an epidemiological study (California Childhood Leukemia Study, CCLS). Methods: Using experimental DBS from the blood of an adult volunteer, we optimized extraction of small molecules and integrated measurement of potassium as a proxy for blood hematocrit. We then applied this extraction method to 4.7-mm punches from 106 control DBS samples from the CCLS. Sample extracts were analyzed with liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) and an untargeted workflow was used to screen for metabolites that discriminate population characteristics such as sex, ethnicity, and birth weight. Results: Thousands of small molecules were measured in extracts of archived DBS. Normalizing for potassium levels removed variability related to varying hematocrit across DBS punches. Of the roughly 1,000 prevalent small molecules that were tested, multivariate linear regression detected significant associations with ethnicity (3 metabolites) and birth weight (15 metabolites) after adjusting for multiple testing. Conclusions: This untargeted workflow can be used for analysis of small molecules in archived DBS to discover novel biomarkers, to provide insights into the initiation and progression of diseases, and to provide guidance for disease prevention.","['Petrick, Lauren', 'Edmands, William', 'Schiffman, Courtney', 'Grigoryan, Hasmik', 'Perttula, Kelsi', 'Yano, Yukiko', 'Dudoit, Sandrine', 'Whitehead, Todd', 'Metayer, Catherine', 'Rappaport, Stephen']","['Petrick L', 'Edmands W', 'Schiffman C', 'Grigoryan H', 'Perttula K', 'Yano Y', 'Dudoit S', 'Whitehead T', 'Metayer C', 'Rappaport S']","['Division of Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.', 'Division of Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.', 'Division of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.', 'Division of Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.', 'Division of Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.', 'Division of Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.', 'Division of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.', 'Department of Statistics, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.', 'Division of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.', 'Center for Integrative Research on Childhood Leukemia and the Environment, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.', 'Division of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.', 'Center for Integrative Research on Childhood Leukemia and the Environment, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.', 'Division of Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.', 'Center for Integrative Research on Childhood Leukemia and the Environment, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170203,United States,Metabolomics,Metabolomics : Official journal of the Metabolomic Society,101274889,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['LC-HRMS', 'dried blood spots', 'hematocrit', 'metabolome', 'small molecules']",2018/05/01 06:00,2018/05/01 06:01,['2018/05/01 06:00'],"['2018/05/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/01 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11306-016-1153-z [doi]'],ppublish,Metabolomics. 2017 Mar;13(3). doi: 10.1007/s11306-016-1153-z.

Issues include patient heterogeneity and noise. Many experiments do not have a large enough sample size to achieve the statistical power necessary to identify significantly impacted pathways. Meta-analysis based on combining p-values from individual experiments has been used to improve power. However, all classical meta-analysis approaches work under the assumption that the p-values produced by experiment-level statistical tests follow a uniform distribution under the null hypothesis. Here we show that this assumption does not hold for three mainstream pathway analysis methods, and significant bias is likely to affect many, if not all such meta-analysis studies. We introduce DANUBE, a novel and unbiased approach to combine statistics computed from individual studies. Our framework uses control samples to construct empirical null distributions, from which empirical p-values of individual studies are calculated and combined using either a Central Limit Theorem approach or the additive method. We assess the performance of DANUBE using four different pathway analysis methods. DANUBE is compared with five meta-analysis approaches, as well as with a pathway analysis approach that employs multiple datasets (MetaPath). The 25 approaches have been tested on 16 different datasets related to two human diseases, Alzheimer's disease (7 datasets) and acute myeloid leukemia (9 datasets). We demonstrate that DANUBE overcomes bias in order to consistently identify relevant pathways. We also show how the framework improves results in more general cases, compared to classical meta-analysis performed with common experiment-level statistical tests such as Wilcoxon and t-test.","['Nguyen, Tin', 'Mitrea, Cristina', 'Tagett, Rebecca', 'Draghici, Sorin']","['Nguyen T', 'Mitrea C', 'Tagett R', 'Draghici S']","['Department of Computer Science, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI 48202.', 'Department of Computer Science, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI 48202.', 'Department of Computer Science, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI 48202.', 'Department of Computer Science and the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI 48202.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160331,United States,Proc IEEE Inst Electr Electron Eng,Proceedings of the IEEE.

Bortezomib and immunomodulatory agents (IMiDs) in MM have improved the outcome. However, they seem to boost pro-inflammatory stage increasing the incidence of engraftment syndrome (ES). Favorable factors in PBSCT such as G-CSF could increase inflammatory stage during transplant. Corticosteroids have shown an excellent response of ES and some authors propose them as prophylaxis for ES. The aim was to analyze the impact of G-CSF avoidance and corticosteroids' prophylaxis in 170 patients diagnosed of MM treated with bortezomib/IMiDs that underwent PBSCT. We established three groups: Group-I [(G-CSF_administration), 60 patients (35%)], group-II [(nonG-CSF), 60 patients (35%)] and group-III [(nonG-CSF plus corticosteroid's prophylaxis), 50 patients (30%)]. A decreased ES incidence among groups was observed: 62, 42, and 22% (P < 0.0001). The incidence of symptoms mimicking a capillary leak syndrome associated with ES dropped: 43, 32, and 0% (P = 0.03). The G-CSF avoidance and corticosteroids had impact over admission 24, 21, and 20 days (P = 0.001). The most important variables related to ES were HCT-CI >2 (p < 0.0001; HR 8.5) and risk groups (p < 0.0001; HR 7.2). Hence, G-CSF avoidance and corticosteroid's prophylaxis decrease morbidity in patients undergoing PBSCT with MM treated with bortezomib/IMiDs.","['Gutierrez-Garcia, Gonzalo', 'Rovira, Montserrat',

Over the last decade, concepts related to treatment response have been challenged by several factors; for example, the dissociation between early clinical response and survival outcome in older patients, the recognition that epigenetic and newer differentiating-agent therapies may produce delayed responses and also hematologic improvement/transfusion independence without a morphologic response, and evidence that remissions without minimal (or measurable) residual disease (MRD) may result in outcomes superior to those of morphologic remissions with persistent MRD. The evolving role of MRD status as a potential surrogate for predicting long-term survival has enhanced the clinical need to standardize and incorporate emerging technologies that enable deeper responses beyond those recognized by the IWG, and to pre-emptively identify patients at risk of early relapse. The potential for therapeutic interventions to erase MRD and alter the natural history represents an important and open research question. Reviewed here are some of the implications and challenges associated with establishing and incorporating new treatment response criteria, initially into clinical research, and eventually into real-world practice.","['Bloomfield, Clara Derber', 'Estey, Elihu', 'Pleyer, Lisa', 'Schuh, Andre C', 'Stein, Eytan M', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'Wei, Andrew']","['Bloomfield CD', 'Estey E', 'Pleyer L', 'Schuh AC', 'Stein EM', 'Tallman MS', 'Wei A']","['The Ohio State University, Columbus, United States.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, United States.', 'Paracelsus Medical University, Salzburg, Austria; Salzburg Cancer Research Institute, Center for Clinical Cancer and Immunology Trials, Salzburg, Austria; Cancer Cluster Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, Canada.', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, United States; Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, United States.', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, United States; Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, United States.', 'The Alfred Hospital and Monash University, Melbourne, Australia.

Cyclophilin A was independently retrotransposed into the TRIM5 loci in different species, leading to the generation of antiviral TRIM5-cyclophilin A (TRIMCyp) proteins. Previously, we found that assam macaques express a TRIMCyp chimera (amTRIMCyp), along with a TRIM5alpha allelic protein (amTRIM5alpha). Herein, we investigated the antiviral activity of amTRIMCyp and amTRIM5alpha individually, as well as their interaction and joint effects. amTRIMCyp showed a divergent restriction pattern from amTRIM5alpha. Although both proteins potently restricted the replication of HIV-1, only amTRIM5alpha inhibited N-MLV. Remarkably, cellular anti-HIV-1 activity increased when amTRIMCyp and amTRIM5alpha were coexpressed, indicating a synergistic block of HIV-1 replication. Consistently, PMBCs from heterozygous amTRIM5alpha/TRIMCyp showed stronger resistance to HIV-1 infection than those from amTRIM5alpha/TRIM5alpha homozygotes. The anti-HIV-1 synergistic effect was dependent on the amTRIMCyp-amTRIM5alpha interaction. In contrast, amTRIMCyp completely abrogated the anti-N-MLV activity mediated by amTRIM5alpha, showing a dominant-negative effect, indicating that the generation of amTRIMCyp was involved in the trade-off between divergent restriction activities. Our results provide a new paradigm to study functional trade-offs mediated by allelic proteins, a theoretical basis for utilizing animal models with various TRIM5 alleles, as well as novel HIV-1 gene therapy strategies.","['Mu, Dan', 'Zhu, Jia-Wu', 'Liu, Feng-Liang', 'Zheng, Hong-Yi', 'Zheng, Yong-Tang']","['Mu D', 'Zhu JW', 'Liu FL', 'Zheng HY', 'Zheng YT']","['Key Laboratory of Animal Models and Human Disease Mechanisms of the Chinese Academy of Sciences/Key Laboratory of Bioactive Peptides of Yunnan Province, Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, 650223, China.', 'Kunming College of Life Science, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, 650204, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Animal Models and Human Disease Mechanisms of the Chinese Academy of Sciences/Key Laboratory of Bioactive Peptides of Yunnan Province, Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, 650223, China.', 'Kunming College of Life Science, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, 650204, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Animal Models and Human Disease Mechanisms of the Chinese Academy of Sciences/Key Laboratory of Bioactive Peptides of Yunnan Province, Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, 650223, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Animal Models and Human Disease Mechanisms of the Chinese Academy of Sciences/Key Laboratory of Bioactive Peptides of Yunnan Province, Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, 650223, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Animal Models and Human Disease Mechanisms of the Chinese Academy of Sciences/Key Laboratory of Bioactive Peptides of Yunnan Province, Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, 650223, China. zhengyt@mail.kiz.ac.cn.', 'Kunming College of Life Science, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, 650204, China. zhengyt@mail.kiz.ac.cn.', 'Kunming Primate Research Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, 650223, China. zhengyt@mail.kiz.ac.cn.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180426,China,Sci China Life Sci,Science China.

However, whether this fusion gene can be used as a reliable marker for minimal residual disease (MRD) following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) remains unknown. In this study, clinical data were collected from 28 consecutive B-ALL patients who received allo-HSCT. Their MRD was evaluated by E2A-PBX1 and leukemia-associated immunophenotype (LAIP). The median follow-up was 374 days (55-2342 days). Of the enrolled patients, seven (25%) patients died of leukemia relapse. A total of nine (32.1%) patients experienced relapse at a median of 164 days (75-559 days) after transplantation. The median expression level in the first positive sample was 0.14% (0.0071-902.4%). The duration from E2A-PBX1-positive results to hematological relapse was 74 days (30-469 days). E2A-PBX1 expression generally became positive prior to flow cytometry. Patients with positive E2A-PBX1 gene expression pre-transplantation were more likely to have positive E2A-PBX1 expression after transplantation. Taken all together, E2A-PBX1 expression determined by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) could be used to evaluate MRD status after allo-HSCT. Patients with positive E2A-PBX1 expression after transplant will have a poor prognosis.","['Hong, Yan', 'Zhao, Xiaosu', 'Qin, Yazhen', 'Zhou, Songhai', 'Chang, Yingjun', 'Wang, Yu', 'Zhang, Xiaohui', 'Xu, Lanping', 'Huang, Xiaojun']","['Hong Y', 'Zhao X', 'Qin Y', 'Zhou S', 'Chang Y', 'Wang Y', 'Zhang X', 'Xu L', 'Huang X']","[""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China. zhao.xiaosu@outlook.com."", 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Peking University, Beijing, China. zhao.xiaosu@outlook.com.', ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Peking University, Beijing, China.', ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Peking University, Beijing, China.', ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Peking University, Beijing, China.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180428,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '146150-85-8 (E2A-Pbx1 fusion protein)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Homeodomain Proteins/analysis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/analysis/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'E2A-PBX1 fusion gene', 'Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'Minimal residual disease']",2018/05/01 06:00,2018/08/29 06:00,['2018/04/30 06:00'],"['2018/01/07 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/29 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-018-3338-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-018-3338-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2018 Sep;97(9):1547-1554. doi: 10.1007/s00277-018-3338-1.

C-KIT mutations are often found as single point mutations. However, the rate of double mutations has recently increased in AML patients. In this study, we detected six cases (18.8%) harboring double C-KIT exon17 mutations in 75 patients with CBF-AML. The clone composition and dynamic evolution were analyzed by sequencing and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). Results revealed that these double mutations can be occurred in either the same or different clones. Different clones of double mutations may result in different sensitivity to the treatment of CBF-AML. The clones with N822 mutation responded better to treatment as compared to those with D816 mutation. Moreover, D816 clone was readily transformed into a predominant clone at relapse. Meanwhile, the predominant clones in the same patient may change during the progression of disease. The emerging mutation can originate from a small quantity of clones at diagnosis or newly acquired during the course of disease.

Studies indicate a close relationship between bone metabolism and hematopoietic stem cells within the osteo-hematopoietic niche. However, it remains unclear how the disturbed interaction within the osteo-hematopoietic niche affects bone homeostasis in MDS and AML patients. METHODS: We utilized data of a large German statutory health insurance of approximately 2 million persons living in the German federal state of Saxony. Applying case definitions based on diagnosis, procedures and prescriptions we identified prevalent and incident cases with MDS, AML and osteoporosis (OSP) in persons aged >/=60 years. We applied time-to-event analyses to determine the relationship of MDS and AML with OSP with a specific focus on temporality. RESULTS: Among all individuals aged >/=60 years (n=891,095), 2.62% (n=23,326), 0.14% (n=1219) and 0.10% (n=893) were identified with incident OSP, MDS and AML, respectively. The risk of incident OSP was significantly increased in patients with prevalent MDS (sex and age-adjusted model: HR=1.87, 95%CI: 1.51-2.23). Conversely, patients with prevalent OSP had an increased risk to be diagnosed with incident MDS in the adjusted model (HR=1.42, 1.19-1.65). For AML no significant associations were observed (adjusted models: inc. OSP with pre. AML; HR=1.06, 0.65-1.47; inc. AML with pre. OSP; HR=0.82, 0.41-1.23). DISCUSSION: Our results could indicate a clinically relevant relationship between MDS and OSP in elderly patients, most likely resulting from a disturbed microenvironment within the osteo-hematopoietic niche. An alternative, non-causal explanation that MDS is caused by the medication prescribed for OSP can be partially ruled out, as the association between the two diseases remains if incident OSP cases are considered in patients with pre-existing MDS. These results need to be confirmed within other prospective studies and may allow then for comprehensive strategies for the prevention, early detection and clinical care of patients with MDS and OSP.","['Datzmann, Thomas', 'Trautmann, Freya', 'Tesch, Falko', 'Mies, Anna', 'Hofbauer, Lorenz C', 'Platzbecker, Uwe', 'Schmitt, Jochen']","['Datzmann T', 'Trautmann F', 'Tesch F', 'Mies A', 'Hofbauer LC', 'Platzbecker U', 'Schmitt J']","['TU Dresden, Medizinische Fakultat Carl Gustav Carus, Center for Evidence-Based Healthcare, Dresden, Germany; National Center for Tumor Diseases, Dresden, Germany.

The aim of this systematic review was to review data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of auricular acupressure therapy for preventing constipation in leukemia patients undergoing chemotherapy. METHODS: Databases that were searched from their inception until August 2017 included: MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, as well as four Chinese databases [Chinese BioMedical Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wan-Fang Data, and the Chinese WeiPu Database]. In this systematic review, only RCTs that were related to the effects of auricular acupressure therapy on preventing constipation in leukemia patients undergoing chemotherapy were included. Study selection, data extraction, and validation were performed independently by two reviewers. Quantitative analyses of RCTs were performed using RevMan 5.3 software, and cochrane criteria for risk-of-bias were used to assess the methodological quality of the trials. RESULTS: A total of 5 RCTs met the inclusion criteria, and most were of low methodological quality. Participants in the AA plus routine care group showed significantly greater improvements in the Bristol Stool Form (BSF) [MD=0.55, 95% CI (0.39, 0.71), p<0.01] with low heterogeneity (Chi(2)=5.01, p=0.29, I(2)=20%). Moreover, when compared with routine care alone, meta-analysis of three RCTs indicated favorable statistically significant effects of AA plus routine care on the Constipation Assessment Scale (CAS) [MD=-1.51, 95% CI (-1.89, -1.14), p<0.01] with low heterogeneity (Chi(2)=1.63, p=0.44, I(2)=0%). Furthermore, when compared with routine care alone, meta-analysis of two RCTs demonstrated statistically significant effects of AA plus routine care on the Patient Assessment of Constipation-Quality Of Life (PAC-QOL) [MD=-1.28, 95% CI (-1.44, -1.13), p<0.01], with low heterogeneity (Chi(2)=0.19, p=0.67, I(2)=0%). CONCLUSION: Taken together, as a potential safety therapy, only weak evidence supported the hypothesis that AA effectively prevented constipation in leukemia patients undergoing chemotherapy.","['Jing, Xueming', 'Liu, Jiao', 'Wang, Chuanlin', 'Ji, Ming', 'Chen, Xing', 'Mei, Yihan', 'Zhu, Qi Rong']","['Jing X', 'Liu J', 'Wang C', 'Ji M', 'Chen X', 'Mei Y', 'Zhu QR']","['Department of hepatology, The Affiliated Hospital of North Sichuan Medical College, Nanchong, China.', 'Department of infectious diseases, The Affiliated Hospital of North Sichuan Medical College, Nanchong, China.', 'Department of infectious diseases, The Affiliated Hospital of North Sichuan Medical College, Nanchong, China.', 'Department of infectious diseases, The Affiliated Hospital of North Sichuan Medical College, Nanchong, China.', 'Department of infectious diseases, The Affiliated Hospital of North Sichuan Medical College, Nanchong, China.', 'Department of Medicine, The Capital University of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Department of hepatology, The Affiliated Hospital of North Sichuan Medical College, Nanchong, China.

We previously predicted that endosulfan might be associated with leukemia, but the role of endosulfan in leukemia cells has been unexplored. The aim of this study is to elucidate molecular mechanism of endosulfan-induced DNA damage response in human leukemia cells. We performed endosulfan exposure experiments in K562cells with varying concentrations of endosulfan for 48h and found that endosulfan lowered cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. We observed the dramatic DNA damage using comet assay and the increase of micronucleus in 75muM endosulfan-exposed cells. Endosulfan at 75muM caused the expression alterations of ATM and DNA repair genes such as FANCD2, and BRCA1/2at different exposure time points (12, 24, 48h), which was reversed by ATM inhibitor KU-55933. Endosulfan significantly increased the mRNA expression levels of p53 and GADD45A, and decreased PCNA and XRCC2 at 48h after exposure. Flow cytometric analysis showed that endosulfan at 50 and 75muM induced cell cycle G1 arrest, a response attributed to down-regulation of CDK6 and up-regulation of p21. We also observed that endosulfan at 50 and 75muM induced a considerable percentage of cells to undergo apoptosis, as detected by Annexin-V binding assays. Endosulfan resulted in the activation of caspase-3, and elevated the expression levels of PUMA and the ratio of BAX/Bcl-2. These findings suggest that endosulfan caused DNA damage response throughATM-p53 signaling pathway, implicating the potential correlation between endosulfan and leukemia.","['Xu, Dan', 'Liang, Dong', 'Guo, Yubing', 'Sun, Yeqing']","['Xu D', 'Liang D', 'Guo Y', 'Sun Y']","['Institute of Environmental Systems Biology, Dalian Maritime University, Linghai Road 1, Dalian, 116026, PR China.

Retrospective analysis of these samples has the potential to identify markers that may be associated with prognosis and response to treatment. To draw valid biological conclusions from this type of analysis, it is essential to ensure that any observed changes are directly related to the pathology of the disease rather than the preservation process itself. Therefore, we have investigated 15 cell surface markers that are relevant to chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) on matched fresh and thawed samples to determine the effect of cryopreservation on their detection. We found that the number of CLL cells positive for the markers CD22, CD40, CD49d, CD54, CD69, and CXCR3 was decreased significantly after cryopreservation. In addition, the mean fluorescence intensity of 10 of the 15 markers changed significantly after cryopreservation.

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a neuronal growth factor that has been shown previously to interact with CXCR4 in neuronal cells. Here, we studied the in vitro effect of BDNF on CXCR4 expression and chemotaxis toward stromal derived factor-1 (SDF-1) in freshly isolated CLL cells. We also explored the correlations between serum BDNF levels in CLL patients and disease characteristics and clinical course. Incubation of CLL cells with recombinant BDNF (50 ng/mL) resulted in a downregulation of CXCR4 surface expression and atenuated chemotaxis toward SDF-1. Higher serum BDNF levels were associated with a mutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable (IGHV) gene, an early clinical stage, and a stable clinical course.

While substantial tumor regression was observed in leukaemia and lymphoma, CAR therapy of solid tumors needs further improvement. A major obstacle to the efficiency of engineered T cells is posed by triggering of inhibitory receptors, for example programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), leading to an impaired antitumor activity. To boost CAR-T-cell function, we co-electroporated T cells with both, mRNA encoding a CAR specific for chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan 4 (CSPG4) and small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to downregulate PD-1 (siPD-1) and CTLA-4 (siCTLA-4). Flow cytometry revealed that activation-induced upregulation of both PD-1 and CTLA-4 was suppressed when compared to CAR-T cells electroporated with negative control siRNA. The siRNA transfection showed no influence on CAR expression of engineered T cells. Functionality assays were performed using PD-L1- and CD80-transfected melanoma cells endogenously expressing CSPG4. CAR-T cells transfected with siPD-1 alone showed improvement in cytokine secretion. Additionally, CAR-T cells transfected with either siPD-1 alone or together with siCTLA-4 exhibited a significantly increased cytotoxicity. No or only little effects were observed when CAR-T cells were co-transfected with siCTLA-4 only. Taken together, it is feasible to optimize CAR-T cells by co-transfection of CAR-encoding mRNA and siRNAs to downregulate inhibitory receptors. Our in vitro data indicate an improvement of the functionality of these CAR-T cells, suggesting that this strategy could represent a novel method to enhance CAR-T-cell immunotherapy of cancer.","['Simon, Bianca', 'Harrer, Dennis C', 'Schuler-Thurner, Beatrice', 'Schaft, Niels', 'Schuler, Gerold', 'Dorrie, Jan', 'Uslu, Ugur']","['Simon B', 'Harrer DC', 'Schuler-Thurner B', 'Schaft N', 'Schuler G', 'Dorrie J', 'Uslu U']","['Department of Dermatology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg (FAU), Universitatsklinikum Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Division of Genetics, Department of Biology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg (FAU), Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg (FAU), Universitatsklinikum Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg (FAU), Universitatsklinikum Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg (FAU), Universitatsklinikum Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg (FAU), Universitatsklinikum Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg (FAU), Universitatsklinikum Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg (FAU), Universitatsklinikum Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany.']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-8109-7892'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Denmark,Exp Dermatol,Experimental dermatology,9301549,"['0 (CTLA-4 Antigen)', '0 (CTLA4 protein, human)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (PDCD1 protein, human)', '0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)']",IM,"['CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CTLA-4 Antigen/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Down-Regulation', 'Electroporation', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Melanoma/genetics/immunology/*therapy', 'Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Skin Neoplasms/genetics/immunology/*therapy', 'Transfection']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Adoptive T-cell therapy', '*RNA electroporation', '*checkpoint blockade', '*chimeric antigen receptor', '*siRNA']",2018/04/29 06:00,2019/05/29 06:00,['2018/04/29 06:00'],"['2018/04/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/29 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/29 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/exd.13678 [doi]'],ppublish,Exp Dermatol. 2018 Jul;27(7):769-778. doi: 10.1111/exd.13678.,['(c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

And each pair of probes contained a thiolated capture probe (C1 or C2) immobilized on one of electrode surfaces in the dual-channel electrochemical biosensor and a biotinylated reporter probe (R1 or R2). The two groups of 2'-F RNA modified probes were separately complementary with the corresponding strand (Sa or Sb) from target dsDNA in order to prevent renaturation of target dsDNA. Through flanking target dsDNA, two ""sandwitch"" complexes (C1/Sa/R1 and C2/Sb/R2) were separately shaped by capture probes (C1 and C2) and free reporter probes (R1 and R2) in hybridization solution on the surfaces of different electrodes after the thermal denaturation. The biotin-modified enzyme which produced the measurable electrochemical current signal was localized to the surface by affinity binding between biotin with streptavidin. Under the optimal condition, the biosensor was able to detect 84 fM target dsDNA and showed a good specificity in PBS hybridization solution. Otherwise, the investigations of the specificity and sensitivity of the biosensor were carried out further in the mixed hybridization solution containing different kinds of mismatch sequences as interference background. It can be seen that under a certain interference background, the method still exhibited excellent selectivity and specificity for the discrimination between the fully-complementary and the mismatch sequences.

Studies of hematopoietic cells have been significantly advanced by flow cytometry methods, enabling the quantitation of each cell type in normal and perturbed situations, in addition to the isolation of these cells for molecular and functional studies. Less is known, however, about the specific niches for distinct developing hematopoietic lineages, or the changes occurring in the niche size and function in these distinct anatomical sites in the bone marrow under stress situations and ageing. Significant advances in imaging technology during the last decade have permitted studies of HSC niches in mice.

Its cellular counterpart was subsequently isolated as c-MYB which has three functional domains - DNA binding domain, transactivation domain and negative regulatory domain. c-MYB is essential for survival, and deletion of both alleles of the gene results in embryonic death. It is highly expressed in hematopoietic cells, thymus and neural tissue, and required for T and B lymphocyte development and erythroid maturation. Additionally, aberrant MYB expression has been found in numerous solid cancer cells and human leukemia. Recent studies have also implicated c-MYB in the regulation of expression of fetal hemoglobin which is highly beneficial to the beta-hemoglobinopathies (beta thalassemia and sickle cell disease). These findings suggest that MYB could be a potential therapeutic target in leukemia, and possibly also a target for therapeutic increase of fetal hemoglobin in the beta-hemoglobinopathies.","['Wang, Xunde', 'Angelis, Nikolaos', 'Thein, Swee Lay']","['Wang X', 'Angelis N', 'Thein SL']","['National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute/NIH, Sickle Cell Branch, Bethesda, USA.', 'National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute/NIH, Sickle Cell Branch, Bethesda, USA.', 'National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute/NIH, Sickle Cell Branch, Bethesda, USA.

A novel class of sulfonylurea derivatives was synthesized from corresponding sulfonyl chlorides and amines. Compounds with different pendant moieties in the sulfonylurea derivatives show significant interactions with human carbonic anhydrase II (CAII). In vitro evaluation of the sulfonylurea derivatives revealed that three compounds possess admirable inhibitory activity against CAII. Compounds containing methyl (G2), isopropyl (G4) and o-tosyl (G5) groups displayed IC50 (109-137mum) for CAII. Fluorescence binding and cytotoxicity studies revealed that these compounds are showing good binding affinity (18-34muM) to CAII and non- toxic to human cells. Further, molecular docking studies of G2, G4 and G5 with CAII showed that these compounds fit nicely in the active site of CAII. Molecular dynamics simulation studies of these compounds complexed with CAII showed that essential interactions were maintained up to 50ns of simulation. These results indicate the promising nature of the sulfonylurea scaffold towards CAII inhibition and opens scope of hit to-lead optimization for discovery of effective drugs against CAII-associated disorders.","['Idrees, Danish', 'Hadianawala, Murtuza', 'Mahapatra, Amarjyoti Das', 'Datta, Bhaskar', 'Roy, Sonam', 'Ahamad, Shahzaib', 'Khan, Parvez', 'Imtaiyaz Hassan, Md']","['Idrees D', 'Hadianawala M', 'Mahapatra AD', 'Datta B', 'Roy S', 'Ahamad S', 'Khan P', 'Imtaiyaz Hassan M']","['Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Basic Sciences, Jamia Millia Islamia, Jamia Nagar, New Delhi 110025, India.', 'Department of Chemistry, Indian Institute of Technology, Palaj, Gandhinagar, Gujarat 382355, India.', 'Department of Chemistry, Indian Institute of Technology, Palaj, Gandhinagar, Gujarat 382355, India.', 'Department of Chemistry, Indian Institute of Technology, Palaj, Gandhinagar, Gujarat 382355, India.

This study aims to detect the biological role of SFRP2 in advanced chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). In this study we examined bone marrow samples from 45 CML patients and 10 healthy donors. K562 and KCL22cells were cultured and treated with demethylation drug and histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi). KCL22 and K562cells were transfected with lentiviral vector (LV)-SFRP2, LV-control. The cells were then subjected to proliferation and apoptosis assays, real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Methylation-specific PCR (MSP), Western blotting, co-immunoprecipitation (CoIP) and Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), We found that SFRP2 was down-regulated in the accelerated and blast phase of CML, whereas, the levels of WNT1, WNT3 and WNT5A were up-regulated in the accelerated and blast phase of CML. Overexpression SFRP2 inhibited proliferation, promoted apoptosis and activated the WNT pathway. CoIP-MS results showed that SFRP2 interacted with WNT1 and WNT5A. ChIP-seq result indicated that the promoter of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 were able to interact with SFRP2. In conclusion, our findings demonstrated the SFRP2 act as a potential therapeutic target for advanced CML.

The ambiguity regarding prognosis is due in large part to the relatively outdated criteria used to determine response to therapy. Whereas risk assessment has evolved to adopt cytogenetic and molecular profiling, response criteria are still largely determined by bone marrow morphologic assessment and peripheral cell count recovery. Minimal residual disease refers to the detection of a persistent population of leukemic cells below the threshold for morphologic CR determination. MRD assessment represents standard of care for ALL and PML, but concerns over prognostic capability and standardization have limited its use in AML. However, recent advancements in MRD assessment and research supporting the use of MRD assessment in AML require the reconsideration and review of this clinical tool in this disease entity. This review article will first compare and contrast the major modalities used to assess MRD in AML, such as RQ-PCR and flow cytometry, as well as touching upon newer technologies such as next-generation sequencing and digital droplet PCR. The majority of the article will discuss the evidence supporting the use of MRD assessment to prognosticate disease at various time points during treatment, and review the limited number of studies that have incorporated MRD assessment into novel treatment algorithms for AML. The article concludes by discussing the current major limitations to the implementation of MRD assessment in this disease. The manuscript is bookended by a clinical vignette that highlights the need for further research and refinement of this clinical tool.","['Coltoff, A', 'Houldsworth, J', 'Keyzner, A', 'Renteria, A S', 'Mascarenhas, John']","['Coltoff A', 'Houldsworth J', 'Keyzner A', 'Renteria AS', 'Mascarenhas J']","['Department of Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.', 'Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.', 'Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.', 'Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA. john.mascarenhas@mssm.edu.', 'Adult Leukemia Program, Myeloproliferative Disorders Clinical Research Program, Tisch Cancer Institute, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, One Gustave L Levy Place, Box 1079, New York, NY, 10029, USA. john.mascarenhas@mssm.edu.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8400-0483'],['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20180427,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (MLL-PTD fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Disease Management', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*blood/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Prognosis', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein/genetics', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Flow cytometry', 'Leukemia', 'Minimal residual disease', 'RQ-PCR']",2018/04/29 06:00,2018/06/13 06:00,['2018/04/29 06:00'],"['2018/03/16 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/13 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-018-3330-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-018-3330-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2018 Jul;97(7):1155-1167. doi: 10.1007/s00277-018-3330-9.

METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study of adult CML patients (citizen) in a single but representative centre in southern Sarawak. RESULTS: Total 79 patients (Malay 39%, Chinese 30.4%, Iban 17.7%, Bidayuh 12.7%) were identified from the databases. Median age at diagnosis was younger, 40, compared to developed countries due to population structure. M:F ratio was higher, 2.6:1 compared to other countries 1.3-1.7:1. Majority presented at chronic phase (89.5%), low/intermediate risk score (80%) and started imatinib (96%) as first line tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), which 40% of them switched to other TKI due to intolerance (17%) and failure (including disease progression)/not achieving major molecular response (83%). Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assessment after three months of TKI treatment had higher positive predictive value to predict Imatinib failure, 75%, than qPCR assessment after six months of TKI treatment, 58%. Presenting phase, symptoms, signs and laboratory data were like most countries. Estimated prevalence and incidence of CML in southern Sarawak was 69.2/1,000,000 population at the Year 2016 (similar to most developing countries) and 8.0/1,000,000 population per year at the Year 2011-2016 (similar to most countries), respectively. The incidence increased with age and was lowest among Iban, 12.8 and highest among Chinese, 19.5, which was 4x higher than Chinese in China. The prevalence of different BCR-ABL1 transcript type was like other Asia countries CONCLUSION: Significant epidemiological differences on M:F ratio and ethnic groups compared to other countries warrant further study.","['Kuan, J W', 'Melaine Michael, S']","['Kuan JW', 'Melaine Michael S']","['Universiti Malaysia Sarawak, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Department of Medicine, Kota Samarahan, Sarawak, Malaysia. kuanjewwin@gmail.com.', 'University of Aberdeen, United Kingdom.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Malaysia,Med J Malaysia,The Medical journal of Malaysia,0361547,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Malaysia/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prevalence', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors', 'Young Adult']",,,2018/04/29 06:00,2019/10/29 06:00,['2018/04/29 06:00'],"['2018/04/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/29 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Med J Malaysia. 2018 Apr;73(2):78-85.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies have shown that CH increases in frequency with aging and is often driven by somatic mutations in genes that are recurrently mutated in hematologic malignancies. When CH is associated with a mutation in a leukemia-associated gene at a variant allele frequency of 0.02 or greater, it is termed ""clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential"" (CHIP). CHIP has a 0.5% to 1% risk per year of progression to hematologic neoplasia, and increases both all-cause mortality and the risk of myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke due to a proinflammatory interaction between clonally derived leukocytes and vascular endothelium. CH frequently emerges in the context of immune-mediated marrow failure syndromes such as aplastic anemia, whereas CH emerging after cytotoxic cancer therapy is strongly associated with subsequent development of a therapy-related myeloid neoplasm, especially if a TP53 mutation is present. However, risk factors for developing CH other than aging, marrow failure, and cytotoxic radiotherapy or chemotherapy are poorly defined. In this review, we discuss the epidemiology, molecular mechanisms, and clinical consequences of this common and clinically important biological state. Clin Cancer Res; 24(19); 4633-42.

Here we present the review of the state-of-the-art knowledge on the role of miRNAs in T-ALL pathogenesis, with detailed overview of the studies reporting on miRNAs with oncogenic and tumor suppressor potential. We discuss whether miRNAs might be considered candidate biomarkers of prognosis in T-ALL and leukemia subtype-specific markers.

Based on retrospective assessments, several potential risk factors for hemorrhagic morbidity and mortality have emerged. Several studies have shown elevated white blood cell (WBC) count at presentation to be a robust predictor of bleeding events. Other clinical and laboratory parameters have been evaluated with variable association with hemorrhagic morbidity or mortality. These include ECOG performance status, age, morphological subtype, platelet count, peripheral blood blast count, ethnicity, body mass index, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, lactate dehydrogenase, d-dimers, creatinine and fibrinogen levels. Unfortunately, most of those assessments were based on a small patient sample and the results have been at times contradictory in terms of which parameters are independent predictors. More recently, two large retrospective studies have reported on the issue. They included data from several international trials of chemotherapy for APL, one on adults and the other focused on the pediatric population. Importantly, both analyses found that WBC count at presentation is the main predictor of early hemorrhagic death and early thrombo-hemorrhagic death, respectively. Much remains to be done if the rate of induction mortality in APL is going to be reduced significantly. One approach would be to incorporate the known risk factors for early hemorrhagic death into a risk stratification system and devise personalized transfusion interventions to meet an individual patient's risk, which could be evaluated in future randomized trials.","['Mantha, Simon', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'Devlin, Sean M', 'Soff, Gerald A']","['Mantha S', 'Tallman MS', 'Devlin SM', 'Soff GA']","['Department of Medicine, Hematology Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.

While in solid tumors it occurs often as a consequence of chemotherapy treatment, it is frequently observed at diagnosis in patients with hematological malignancies being aggravated to a potentially life-threatening level during chemotherapy. Other associated conditions (infections, drugs, consumption coagulopathy etc.) can add to influence the degree of thrombocytopenia and the inherent risk of bleeding and they should be recognized and corrected to improve platelet count. Platelet transfusion remains the cornerstone of treatment, but its use should always be weighted taking into consideration the actual risk of bleeding to avoid inappropriate use and wasting of resources. While in hematological malignancies a threshold level of 10,000 platelets/muL is widely accepted as the minimal level prompting prophylactic platelet transfusion, this limit is less frequently observed in patients with solid tumors and platelet transfusions are usually administered for a few days, possibly at a higher platelet level.

In the absence of treatment it is rapidly fatal and even after initiation of therapy the major cause of early mortality is related to hemorrhagic complications. The coagulopathy can be exacerbated with the start of treatment. In the absence of early hemorrhage related deaths the probability of cure exceeds 90% in low and intermediate risk patients and 80% even in high risk patients, highlighting the importance of understanding the pathophysiology of this complication and instituting prompt and appropriate management strategies. The coagulopathy in APL is complex and results from a combination of thrombocytopenia, disseminated intravascular coagulation and hyperfibronlysis. Recently the effect of all-trans retinioc acid (ATRA) induced ETosis on exacerbating coagulopathy in the first few days after starting therapy with this agent raises the potential for potentially novel strategies to reduce the risk of hemorrhage. Currently management is mainly related to rapid initiation of therapy with ATRA along with appropriate and adequate replacement of blood products to correct the coagulopathy. There is limited role for the use of low dose anti-coagulants and anti-fibrinolytic agents in the initial management of this disease. There is limited data on the use of rFVIIa or the use of global tests of hemostasis in the management of this condition.","['David, Sachin', 'Mathews, Vikram']","['David S', 'Mathews V']","['Department of Haematology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.', 'Department of Haematology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.

METHODS: Hospitalization data reported on adult cancer patients at US medical centers between 1995 and 2012 were analyzed. Cancer diagnosis, presence of VTE, comorbidities, and infectious complications were based on ICD-9-CM codes. RESULTS: Nearly six million hospitalizations of 3,146,388 individual patients with cancer were reported with VTE observed in 8.4%. A single hospitalization was randomly selected for each patient with VTE diagnosed in 166,537 (5.3%) of evaluated admissions. In-hospital mortality was observed in 5.5% of patients without a VTE diagnosis and in 15.0% of those with VTE including 19.4% with a pulmonary embolism. While rates of VTE increased from 3.5% in 1995 to 6.5% in 2012, no significant reported changes in VTE imaging, length of stay (LOS) or intensive care unit (ICU) admissions were observed and mortality decreased by one-third. VTE was reported in 5.2%, 5.8% and 5.4% of patients with solid tumors, lymphoma, and leukemia, respectively. Rates of VTE were greatest among patients with pancreatic, gastric or other abdominal malignancies as well as those with ovarian, lung and esophageal cancers. The risk of VTE increased progressively from 2.3% in those with no comorbidities to over 11% in those with >/=3 major comorbidities. The strongest risk factors for VTE were infectious complications including sepsis, invasive candidiasis, pneumonia and IV line infections. Average costs per hospitalization adjusted to 2015 dollars for patients without and with VTE were $19,994 and $37,352, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: VTE among hospitalized patients with cancer has increased significantly with a major impact on hospital mortality and costs. Patients with major medical comorbidities and infectious complications are at particularly high risk.","['Lyman, Gary H', 'Culakova, Eva', 'Poniewierski, Marek S', 'Kuderer, Nicole M']","['Lyman GH', 'Culakova E', 'Poniewierski MS', 'Kuderer NM']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, United States; University of Washington, Seattle, WA, United States.

Therefore, it is of great interest to identify telomerase expression and activity regulators. Retinoids are well-known inducers of granulocytic maturation associated with hTERT repression in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) blasts. In a maturation-resistant APL cell line, we have previously identified a new pathway of retinoid-induced hTERT transcriptional repression independent of differentiation. Furthermore, we reported the isolation of a cell variant resistant to this repression. Those cell lines could serve as unique tools to identify new telomerase regulators. METHODS: Using a microarray approach we identified the long non-coding RNA, H19 as a potential candidate playing a role in telomerase regulation. Expression of H19, hTERT, and hTR were examined by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Telomerase activity was quantified by quantitative telomeric repeats amplification protocol (qTRAP). In vitro and in vivo assays were performed to investigate H19 function on telomerase expression and activity. RESULTS: We showed both in retinoid-treated cell lines and in APL patient cells an inverse relationship between the expression of H19 and the expression and activity of hTERT. Exploring the mechanistic link between H19 and hTERT regulation, we showed that H19 is able to impede telomerase function by disruption of the hTERT-hTR interaction. CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies a new way of telomerase regulation through H19's involvement and thereby reveals a new function for this long non-coding RNA that can be targeted for therapeutic purpose.","['El Hajj, Joelle', 'Nguyen, Eric', 'Liu, Qingyuan', 'Bouyer, Claire', 'Adriaenssens, Eric', 'Hilal, George', 'Segal-Bendirdjian, Evelyne']","['El Hajj J', 'Nguyen E', 'Liu Q', 'Bouyer C', 'Adriaenssens E', 'Hilal G', 'Segal-Bendirdjian E']","['INSERM UMR-S 1007, Cellular Homeostasis and Cancer, Paris, France.', 'Paris-Descartes University, Paris Sorbonne Cite, Paris, France.', 'Paris-Sud University, Paris-Saclay University, Orsay, France.', 'Cancer and Metabolism Laboratory, Faculty of Medicine, Saint-Joseph University, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'INSERM UMR-S 1007, Cellular Homeostasis and Cancer, Paris, France.', 'Paris-Descartes University, Paris Sorbonne Cite, Paris, France.', 'INSERM UMR-S 1007, Cellular Homeostasis and Cancer, Paris, France.', 'Paris-Descartes University, Paris Sorbonne Cite, Paris, France.', ""Present address: Bristol-Myers Squibb (China) Investment Co.

METHODS: Cost analysis was performed by using retrospective data between 2006 and 2010 from patient-file databases of two specialized hospitals (145 patients). Uncertainty was assessed by using bootstrapping and multivariate sensitivity analyses. Linear regression analysis was used to analyze whether patients' characteristics are related to health care costs. In addition, one-way analysis of variance (Welch test) and paired-sample t test were conducted to compare mean costs of treatment between the two hospitals and mean expenses for drugs and in-hospital stay. RESULTS: The average annual cost for a patient's drug treatment is 2047 EUR. The cost of hospitalization was significantly lower (t = 5.026; significance two-tailed = 0.000) and equal to 541 EUR per person, resulting in total expenditures of 2589 EUR. Mean total costs in the bootstrap analysis were equal to 2584 EUR (median 2576 EUR, 97.5th percentile 3223 EUR; 2.5th percentile 1987 EUR). The regression analysis did not reveal a relation between patients' characteristics and health care costs, although hospital choice was an influential parameter (beta = -0.260; significance = 0.002). Significant difference in mean costs of two analyzed hospitals was also confirmed by one-way analysis of variance (Welch statistics 19.222, P = 0.000). CONCLUSIONS: Drug treatment comprises the largest portion of total costs, but differences between hospitals exist. Because many patients in Ukraine pay out of pocket for in-hospital drugs, these costs are a high economic burden for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.","['Mandrik, Olena', 'Corro Ramos, Isaac', ""Zalis'ka, Olga"", 'Gaisenko, Andriy', 'Severens, Johan L']","['Mandrik O', 'Corro Ramos I', ""Zalis'ka O"", 'Gaisenko A', 'Severens JL']","['Danylo Halytsky Lviv National Medical University, Lviv, Ukraine; Institute of Health Policy & Management, Erasmus University Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.

These data indicate the potential application of genomics to improve the diagnosis and treatment of these rare diseases. RECENT FINDINGS: Next generation sequencing technologies have provided an important window into the genetic underpinnings of lymphomas. A growing body of evidence indicates that although some genetic alterations are specific to certain diseases, others are shared across different lymphomas. Many such genetic events have already demonstrated clinical utility, such as BRAF V600E that confers sensitivity to vemurafenib in patients with hairy cell leukemia. SUMMARY: The rareness of many lymphoma subtypes makes the conduct of clinical trials and recruitment of significant numbers of patients impractical. However, a knowledge of the shared genetic origins of these rare lymphomas has the potential to inform 'basket' clinical trials in which multiple lymphoma subtypes are included. These trials would include patients based on the presence of alterations in targetable driver genes. Such approaches would be greatly strengthened by a systematic assessment of significant patient numbers from each subtype using next generation sequencing.","['Shingleton, Jennifer R', 'Dave, Sandeep S']","['Shingleton JR', 'Dave SS']","['Cancer Genetics and Genomics Program, Duke Cancer Institute, Center for Genomic and Computational Biology, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,"['207SMY3FQT (Vemurafenib)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BRAF protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', '*High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', '*Lymphoma/classification/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', '*Mutation, Missense', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf/genetics/metabolism', 'Rare Diseases/classification/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Vemurafenib/*therapeutic use']",,,2018/04/28 06:00,2019/03/08 06:00,['2018/04/28 06:00'],"['2018/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/08 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000435 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2018 Jul;25(4):307-314. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000435.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The chromosome maintenance complex cohesin and the DNA binding protein CTCF cooperate to drive the formation of self-interacting topological domains. This facilitates transcriptional regulation via enhancer-promoter interactions, controls the distribution and release of torsional strain, and affects the frequency with which particular translocations arise, based on the spatial proximity of translocation partners. Here we discuss recent insights into the mechanisms of three-dimensional genome organization, their relationship to haematopoietic differentiation and malignant transformation. RECENT FINDINGS: Cohesin mutations are frequently found in myeloid malignancies. Significantly, cohesin mutations can drive increased self-renewal of haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, which may facilitate the accumulation of genetic lesions and leukaemic transformation. It is therefore important to elucidate the mechanisms that link cohesin to pathways that regulate the balance between self-renewal and differentiation. Chromosomal translocations are key to lymphoid malignancies, and recent findings link three-dimensional genome organization to the frequency and the genomic position of DNA double strand breaks. SUMMARY: Three-dimensional genome organization can help explain genome function in normal and malignant haematopoiesis.","['Cuartero, Sergi', 'Merkenschlager, Matthias']","['Cuartero S', 'Merkenschlager M']","['Lymphocyte Development Group, Epigenetics Section, MRC London Institute of Medical Sciences, Institute of Clinical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, UK.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,"['0 (CCCTC-Binding Factor)', '0 (CTCF protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (cohesins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CCCTC-Binding Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Nucleus/genetics/metabolism/pathology', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded', 'DNA Replication', '*Genome, Human', '*Hematopoiesis', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', '*Leukemia/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",,,2018/04/28 06:00,2019/03/08 06:00,['2018/04/28 06:00'],"['2018/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/08 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000436 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2018 Jul;25(4):323-328. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000436.,,,"['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we review these recent genomic discoveries, focusing on acquired DNA repair defects in lymphoma. In addition, we highlight recently identified actionable molecular vulnerabilities associated with recurrent mutations in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), which serves as a model entity. RECENT FINDINGS: The results of several large lymphoma genome sequencing projects have recently been reported, including CLL, T-PLL and DLBCL. We align these discoveries with proposed mechanisms of mutation acquisition in B-cell lymphomas. Moreover, novel autochthonous mouse models of CLL have recently been generated and we discuss how these models serve as preclinical tools to drive the development of novel targeted therapeutic interventions. Lastly, we highlight the results of early clinical data on novel compounds targeting defects in the DNA damage response of CLL with a particular focus on deleterious ATM mutations. SUMMARY: Defects in DNA repair pathways are selected events in cancer, including lymphomas. Specifically, ATM deficiency is associated with PARP1- and DNA-PKcs inhibitor sensitivity in vitro and in vivo.","['Knittel, Gero', 'Rehkamper, Tim', 'Nieper, Pascal', 'Schmitt, Anna', 'Flumann, Ruth', 'Reinhardt, H Christian']","['Knittel G', 'Rehkamper T', 'Nieper P', 'Schmitt A', 'Flumann R', 'Reinhardt HC']","['Department I of Internal Medicine, University Hospital of Cologne.', 'Cologne Excellence Cluster on Cellular Stress Response in Aging-Associated Diseases (CECAD).', 'Department I of Internal Medicine, University Hospital of Cologne.', 'Cologne Excellence Cluster on Cellular Stress Response in Aging-Associated Diseases (CECAD).', 'Department I of Internal Medicine, University Hospital of Cologne.', 'Cologne Excellence Cluster on Cellular Stress Response in Aging-Associated Diseases (CECAD).', 'Department I of Internal Medicine, University Hospital of Cologne.', 'Cologne Excellence Cluster on Cellular Stress Response in Aging-Associated Diseases (CECAD).', 'Department I of Internal Medicine, University Hospital of Cologne.', 'Cologne Excellence Cluster on Cellular Stress Response in Aging-Associated Diseases (CECAD).', 'Center of Integrated Oncology (CIO), University Hospital of Cologne.', 'Department I of Internal Medicine, University Hospital of Cologne.', 'Cologne Excellence Cluster on Cellular Stress Response in Aging-Associated Diseases (CECAD).', 'Center of Integrated Oncology (CIO), University Hospital of Cologne.', 'Center of Molecular Medicine, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (PARP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (DNA-Activated Protein Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (PRKDC protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism/pathology', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA-Activated Protein Kinase/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/metabolism/pathology', '*Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics/metabolism/pathology', '*Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1/genetics/metabolism']",,,2018/04/28 06:00,2019/03/08 06:00,['2018/04/28 06:00'],"['2018/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/08 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000433 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2018 Jul;25(4):315-322. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000433.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the presence of target, the capture probes (Cp) immobilized on the chip surface can capture the PML/RARalpha, forming a Cp-PML/RARalpha duplex. After that, the aptamer-based network hydrogel nanostructure is formed on the gold surface via target-triggered self-assembly of X shaped polymers. Subsequently, the SA can be encapsulated into hydrogel by the specific binding of SA aptamer, forming the complex with super molecular weight. Thus, the developed strategy achieves dramatic enhancement of the SPR signal. Using PML/RARalpha ""S"" subtype as model analyte, the developed biosensing method can detect target down to 45.22fM with a wide linear range from 100fM to 10nM. Moreover, the high efficiency biosensing method shows excellent practical ability to identify the clinical PCR products of PML/RARalpha. Thus, this proposed strategy presents a powerful platform for ultrasensitive detection of fusion gene and early diagnosis and monitoring of disease.","['Guo, Bin', 'Wen, Bo', 'Cheng, Wei', 'Zhou, Xiaoyan', 'Duan, Xiaolei', 'Zhao, Min', 'Xia, Qianfeng', 'Ding, Shijia']","['Guo B', 'Wen B', 'Cheng W', 'Zhou X', 'Duan X', 'Zhao M', 'Xia Q', 'Ding S']","['Key Laboratory of Clinical Laboratory Diagnostics (Ministry of Education), College of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China; Department of Clinical Laboratory, The Affiliated Hospital of North Sichuan Medical College, Nanchong 637000, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Clinical Laboratory Diagnostics (Ministry of Education), College of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.', 'The Center for Clinical Molecular Medical Detection, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Clinical Laboratory Diagnostics (Ministry of Education), College of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Clinical Laboratory Diagnostics (Ministry of Education), College of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Clinical Laboratory Diagnostics (Ministry of Education), College of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.', 'Laboratory of Tropical Biomedicine and Biotechnology, Faculty of Tropical Biomedicine and Laboratory Medicine, Hainan medical University, Haikou, Hainan 571101, China.

Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has been used to try to circumvent this risk, but no data exist regarding its safety and prevalence in a health maintenance organization. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence and safety of IVIG in children with ALL in CR1 during maintenance chemotherapy. DESIGN: A multicenter, retrospective cohort study of consecutive children with ALL in CR1 during maintenance chemotherapy from 2008 to 2014. Groups treated with or without IVIG were compared using nonparametric statistics. Multivariate logistic regression involved all variables available before maintenance therapy began. RESULTS: One hundred eighteen patients were included (53% males), aged 9 months to 19 years. Thirty of 31 patients (97%) who had immunoglobulins analyzed before IVIG were hypogammaglobulinemic. Thirty-six patients (30%) received IVIG during maintenance chemotherapy. Patients received an average of 10.5 IVIG doses (range = 1-31). Ninety-seven percent of doses were administered without a transfusion reaction. Other factors associated with IVIG use were prior double-delayed intensification (odds ratio = 5.36, 95% confidence interval = 1.3-27.49, p = 0.026) and episodes of bacteremia or fungemia before maintenance chemotherapy (odds ratio = 3.04, 95% confidence interval = 1.25-7.51, p = 0.015). CONCLUSION: Use of IVIG in children with ALL in CR1 with hypogammaglobulinemia occurred in approximately 30% of patients and was well tolerated. Administration of IVIG significantly correlated with a history of double-delayed intensification and prior bacteremia or fungemia.","['Van Winkle, Patrick', 'Burchette, Raoul', 'Kim, Raymond', 'Raghunathan, Rukmani', 'Qureshi, Naveen']","['Van Winkle P', 'Burchette R', 'Kim R', 'Raghunathan R', 'Qureshi N']","['Pediatric Hospitalist at the Anaheim Medical Center in CA. patrick.j.vanwinkle@kp.org.', 'Statistician for Kaiser Permanente Southern California Research and Evaluation in Pasadena. raoul.j.burchette@kp.org.', 'Research Assistant for Kaiser Permanente Southern California Research and Evaluation in Pasadena. rwhkim@gmail.com.', 'Pediatric Oncologist in the Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology at the Anaheim Medical Center in CA. rukmani.raghunathan@kp.org.', 'Pediatric Oncologist in the Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology at the Anaheim Medical Center in CA. naveen.a.qureshi@kp.org.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",,United States,Perm J,The Permanente journal,9800474,"['0 (Immunoglobulins, Intravenous)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Agammaglobulinemia/*complications/*drug therapy', 'Bacteremia/complications', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fungemia/complications', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins, Intravenous/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Infant', 'Maintenance Chemotherapy/methods', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications', 'Prevalence', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",,,2018/04/28 06:00,2018/12/12 06:00,['2018/04/28 06:00'],"['2018/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [medline]']","['17-141 [pii]', '10.7812/TPP/17-141 [doi]']",ppublish,Perm J. 2018;22:17-141. doi: 10.7812/TPP/17-141.,,,,PMC5922965,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients and Methods One hundred thirty-one previously untreated patients with AML who received intensive induction chemotherapy and attained morphologic complete remission (CR) at day 30 were studied. Pretreatment and CR bone marrow were analyzed using targeted capture DNA sequencing. We analyzed the association between mutation clearance (MC) on the basis of variant allele frequency (VAF) at CR (MC2.5: if the VAF of residual mutations was < 2.5%; MC1.0: if the VAF was < 1%; and complete MC [CMC]: if no detectable residual mutations) and event-free survival, overall survival (OS), and cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR). Results MC1.0 and CMC were associated with significantly better OS (2-year OS: 75% v 61% in MC1.0 v non-MC1.0; P = .0465; 2-year OS: 77% v 60% in CMC v non-CMC; P = .0303) and lower CIR (2-year CIR: 26% v 46% in MC1.0 v non-MC 1.0; P = .0349; 2 year-CIR: 24% v 46% in CMC v non-CMC; P = .03), whereas there was no significant difference in any of the above outcomes by MC2.5. Multivariable analysis adjusting for age, cytogenetic risk, allogeneic stem-cell transplantation, and flow cytometry-based minimal residual disease revealed that patients with CMC had significantly better event-free survival (hazard ratio [HR], 0.43; P = .0083), OS (HR, 0.47; P = .04), and CIR (HR, 0.27; P < .001) than did patients without CMC. These prognostic associations were stronger when preleukemic mutations, such as DNMT3A, TET2, and ASXL1, were removed from the analysis. Conclusion Clearance of somatic mutation at CR, particularly in nonpreleukemic genes, was associated with significantly better survival and less risk of relapse. Somatic mutations in nonpreleukemic genes may function as a molecular minimal residual disease marker in AML.","['Morita, Kiyomi', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Wang, Feng', 'Yan, Yuanqing', 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos', 'Sasaki, Koji', 'Issa, Ghayas C', 'Wang, Sa', 'Jorgensen, Jeffrey', 'Song, Xingzhi', 'Zhang, Jianhua', 'Tippen, Samantha', 'Thornton, Rebecca', 'Coyle, Marcus', 'Little, Latasha', 'Gumbs, Curtis', 'Pemmaraju, Naveen', 'Daver, Naval', 'DiNardo, Courtney D', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Cortes, Jorge E', 'Kadia, Tapan', 'Jabbour, Elias', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Patel, Keyur P', 'Futreal, P Andrew', 'Takahashi, Koichi']","['Morita K', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Wang F', 'Yan Y', 'Bueso-Ramos C', 'Sasaki K', 'Issa GC', 'Wang S', 'Jorgensen J', 'Song X', 'Zhang J', 'Tippen S', 'Thornton R', 'Coyle M', 'Little L', 'Gumbs C', 'Pemmaraju N', 'Daver N', 'DiNardo CD', 'Konopleva M', 'Andreeff M', 'Ravandi F', 'Cortes JE', 'Kadia T', 'Jabbour E', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Patel KP', 'Futreal PA', 'Takahashi K']","['Kiyomi Morita, Hagop M.

Unfortunately, these patient groups are quite sensitive to toxicity from chemotherapy. Northern Labrador tea, or Rhododendron tomentosum Harmaja (a.k.a. Ledum palustre subsp. decumbens) or ""tundra tea,"" is a noteworthy medicinal plant used by indigenous peoples in Alaska, Canada, and Greenland to treat a diversity of ailments. However, laboratory investigations of Northern Labrador tea, and other Labrador tea family members, as botanical sources for anticancer compounds have been limited. Utilizing an AML cell line in both in vitro and in vivo studies, as well as in vitro studies using primary human AML patient samples, this study demonstrated for the first time that Northern Labrador tea extracts can exert anti-AML activity and that this may be attributed to ursolic acid as a constituent component. Therefore, this medicinal herb holds the potential to serve as a source for further drug discovery efforts to isolate novel anti-AML compounds.","['McGill, Colin M', 'Tomco, Patrick L', 'Ondrasik, Regina M', 'Belknap, Kaitlyn C', 'Dwyer, Gaelen K', 'Quinlan, Daniel J', 'Kircher, Thomas A', 'Andam, Cheryl P', 'Brown, Timothy J', 'Claxton, David F', 'Barth, Brian M']","['McGill CM', 'Tomco PL', 'Ondrasik RM', 'Belknap KC', 'Dwyer GK', 'Quinlan DJ', 'Kircher TA', 'Andam CP', 'Brown TJ', 'Claxton DF', 'Barth BM']","['Department of Chemistry, University of Alaska Anchorage, Anchorage, AK, 99508, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Alaska Anchorage, Anchorage, AK, 99508, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Penn State Hershey Cancer Institute, Penn State College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, 17033, USA.', 'Department of Molecular, Cellular and Biomedical Sciences, University of New Hampshire, Durham, NH, 03824, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Alaska Anchorage, Anchorage, AK, 99508, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Alaska Anchorage, Anchorage, AK, 99508, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Alaska Anchorage, Anchorage, AK, 99508, USA.', 'Department of Molecular, Cellular and Biomedical Sciences, University of New Hampshire, Durham, NH, 03824, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Penn State Hershey Cancer Institute, Penn State College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, 17033, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Penn State Hershey Cancer Institute, Penn State College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, 17033, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Penn State Hershey Cancer Institute, Penn State College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, 17033, USA.', 'Department of Molecular, Cellular and Biomedical Sciences, University of New Hampshire, Durham, NH, 03824, USA.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3542-1804'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180427,England,Phytother Res,Phytotherapy research : PTR,8904486,"['0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Triterpenes)', 'P3M2575F3F (ursolic acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Ledum/*chemistry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'Plants, Medicinal/chemistry', 'Triterpenes/*pharmacology']",['NOTNLM'],"['Northern Labrador tea', 'Rhododendron tomentosum', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'ursolic acid']",2018/04/28 06:00,2018/10/18 06:00,['2018/04/28 06:00'],"['2017/09/08 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/14 00:00 [revised]', '2018/03/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/18 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ptr.6091 [doi]'],ppublish,Phytother Res. 2018 Aug;32(8):1636-1641. doi: 10.1002/ptr.6091.

In the present study, we assessed the antileukemia effects of costunolide on the human chronic myeloid leukemia cell line K562 and its combined activity with imatinib. A Cell Counting Kit-8 assay demonstrated that costunolide significantly inhibited K562 cell proliferation and enhanced imatinib-induced anti-proliferative activity. We found that costunolide significantly induced mitochondrial apoptosis in K562 cells by modulating the protein levels of Bcl-2 family members and by inducing caspase activation. Costunolide promoted imatinib-induced apoptosis via the Bcr/Abl-signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 pathway. Costunolide inhibited proliferation by inducing cell cycle arrest in the G2 /M phase by decreasing cyclin B1 and cyclin-dependent kinase 2 expression and increasing p21 expression.

Methods: Multi-locus gene targeting vectors pUC-DS1-CMV-E-cad-2A-Neo-DS2 and pUC-DS1-Bmi-1 shRNA-Zeo-DS2 were constructed, and the E-cad and Bmi-1 targeting vectors were transferred with TALEN plasmids to CNE-2 cells individually or simultaneously. The integration of target genes were detected by PCR, the expressions of E-cad and Bmi-1 were detected by Western blot. The changes of cell proliferation were detected by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. The cell cycle and apoptosis were detected by flow cytometry. The cell migration and invasion were detected by Transwell assay. Results: The E-cad and Bmi-1 shRNA expression elements were successfully integrated into the genome of CNE-2 cells, the protein expression level of E-cad was up-regulated, and the protein expression level of Bmi-1 was down-regulated. The intervention of E-cad and Bmi-1 didn't affect the proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis of CNE-2 cells, but it significantly inhibited the migration and invasion ability of CNE-2 cells. Furthermore, the intervention of E-cad and Bmi-1 together significantly inhibited the migration ability of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells compared with the intervention of E-cad or Bmi-1 alone (all P<0.01). Conclusion: The joint intervention of E-cad and Bmi-1 mediated by TALEN can effectively inhibit the migration and invasion of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells in vitro, which may lay the preliminary experimental basis for gene therapy of human cancer.","['Luo, Tingting', 'Yan, Aifen', 'Liu, Lian', 'Jiang, Hong', 'Feng, Cuilan', 'Liu, Guannan', 'Liu, Fang', 'Tang, Dongsheng', 'Zhou, Tianhong']","['Luo T', 'Yan A', 'Liu L', 'Jiang H', 'Feng C', 'Liu G', 'Liu F', 'Tang D', 'Zhou T']","['Department of Molecular Biology, College of Life Science and Technology, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632; Institute of Molecular Medicine, Foshan Science and Technology University, Foshan Guangdong 528000, China.', 'Institute of Molecular Medicine, Foshan Science and Technology University, Foshan Guangdong 528000, China.', 'Institute of Molecular Medicine, Foshan Science and Technology University, Foshan Guangdong 528000, China.', 'Institute of Molecular Medicine, Foshan Science and Technology University, Foshan Guangdong 528000, China.', 'Institute of Molecular Medicine, Foshan Science and Technology University, Foshan Guangdong 528000, China.', 'Institute of Molecular Medicine, Foshan Science and Technology University, Foshan Guangdong 528000, China.', 'Institute of Molecular Medicine, Foshan Science and Technology University, Foshan Guangdong 528000, China.', 'Institute of Molecular Medicine, Foshan Science and Technology University, Foshan Guangdong 528000, China.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, College of Life Science and Technology, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, China.']",,['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhong Nan Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,Zhong nan da xue xue bao.

Platelet activating factor, known to increase platelet aggregation, has also been implicated as an important mediator of anaphylaxis. Although other inflammatory reactions are associated with an increased risk of thrombosis, anaphylaxis is currently not reported as one of them. Furthermore the role platelets may have in the perianaphylaxis period is not well understood. We here in present a retrospective case series of three patients that had platelet aberrations suggestive of PAF involvement and clinically significant thrombosis in close relationship with anaphylaxis. OBJECTIVE: To investigate platelet response before and after anaphylaxis and indirect observation evidence of platelet activating factors involvement with possible increased risk of thrombosis. METHODS: A retrospective investigation into medical records including medication administrations times, laboratory, and radiology results. Platelet levels pre- and post- anaphylaxis were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: Case 1, a 44 year old man had an anaphylactic reaction shortly after envenomation and subsequently suffered an acute infarction with thrombus in a cerebral artery. Case 2 is a 49 year old man with idiopathic anaphylaxis who developed a deep vein thrombosis after a protracted anaphylaxis event. Case 3 involved an 18 year old female with acute myeloid leukemia was found to have a thrombus in the celiac trunk following anaphylaxis. A paired two-tailed Wilcoxon test on the subjects pre and post anaphylactic platelet levels resulted in a overall P < 0.0001. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: These three cases illustrate the potential role platelets may have in anaphylaxis and possible increased secondary risk for the development of thrombosis. Larger studies are required to determine incidence and risk factors for blood clots following anaphylaxis in order to provide management or screening recommendations.","['Peppers, Brian P', 'Vatsayan, Anant', 'Dalal, Jignesh', 'Bonfield, Tracey', 'Tcheurekdjian, Haig', 'Hostoffer, Robert']","['Peppers BP', 'Vatsayan A', 'Dalal J', 'Bonfield T', 'Tcheurekdjian H', 'Hostoffer R']","['Adult and Pediatric ACGME Osteopathic Recognized Allergy and Immunology Fellowship, University Hospitals, Cleveland Medical Center, Cleveland, Ohio.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Hematology/Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplant Fellowship Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital, Cleveland, Ohio."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Hematology/Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplant Fellowship Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital, Cleveland, Ohio."", 'Department of Immunology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Adult and Pediatric ACGME Osteopathic Recognized Allergy and Immunology Fellowship, University Hospitals, Cleveland Medical Center, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Allergy/Immunology Associates, Inc, Mayfield Heights, Ohio.', 'Adult and Pediatric ACGME Osteopathic Recognized Allergy and Immunology Fellowship, University Hospitals, Cleveland Medical Center, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Allergy/Immunology Associates, Inc, Mayfield Heights, Ohio.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-3369-5983'],['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20180426,England,Immun Inflamm Dis,"Immunity, inflammation and disease",101635460,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anaphylaxis/*blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Platelet Count', 'Thrombosis/*blood']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Anaphylaxis', '*idiopathic anaphylaxis', '*pentamidine allergy', '*platelet', '*platelet activating factor', '*thrombus']",2018/04/28 06:00,2019/05/24 06:00,['2018/04/28 06:00'],"['2017/10/26 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/08 00:00 [revised]', '2018/04/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/24 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/iid3.224 [doi]'],ppublish,Immun Inflamm Dis. 2018 Sep;6(3):377-381. doi: 10.1002/iid3.224.

Although they may be recognized by the association of typical clinical features, variable penetrance and expressivity are common, and clinical diagnosis is often challenging. DNAJC21, which is involved in ribosome biogenesis, was recently linked to bone marrow failure. However, the specific phenotype and natural history remain to be defined. We correlate molecular data, phenotype, and clinical history of 5 unreported affected children and all individuals reported in the literature. All patients present features consistent with IBMFS: bone marrow failure, growth retardation, failure to thrive, developmental delay, recurrent infections, and skin, teeth or hair abnormalities. Additional features present in some individuals include retinal abnormalities, pancreatic insufficiency, liver cirrhosis, skeletal abnormalities, congenital hip dysplasia, joint hypermobility, and cryptorchidism. We suggest that DNAJC21-related diseases constitute a distinct IBMFS, with features overlapping Shwachman-Diamond syndrome and Dyskeratosis congenita, and additional characteristics that are specific to DNAJC21 mutations. The full phenotypic spectrum, natural history, and optimal management will require more reports. Considering the aplastic anemia, the possible increased risk for leukemia, and the multisystemic features, we provide a checklist for clinical evaluation at diagnosis and regular follow-up.","[""D'Amours, G"", 'Lopes, F', 'Gauthier, J', 'Saillour, V', 'Nassif, C', 'Wynn, R', 'Alos, N', 'Leblanc, T', 'Capri, Y', 'Nizard, S', 'Lemyre, E', 'Michaud, J L', 'Pelletier, V-A', 'Pastore, Y D', 'Soucy, J-F']","[""D'Amours G"", 'Lopes F', 'Gauthier J', 'Saillour V', 'Nassif C', 'Wynn R', 'Alos N', 'Leblanc T', 'Capri Y', 'Nizard S', 'Lemyre E', 'Michaud JL', 'Pelletier VA', 'Pastore YD', 'Soucy JF']","['Service de Genetique Medicale, CHU Sainte-Justine, Montreal, Canada.', 'Faculte de Medecine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Centre de Recherche, CHU Sainte-Justine, Montreal, Canada.', 'Life and Health Sciences Research Institute (ICVS), School of Medicine, University of Minho, Braga, Portugal.', ""ICVS/3B's - PT Government Associate Laboratory, Braga/Guimaraes, Portugal."", 'Laboratoire de Diagnostic Moleculaire, CHU Sainte-Justine, Montreal, Canada.', 'Centre de Recherche, CHU Sainte-Justine, Montreal, Canada.', 'Centre Integre de Genomique Clinique Pediatrique, Montreal, Canada.', 'Centre de Recherche, CHU Sainte-Justine, Montreal, Canada.', ""Blood and Marrow Transplant Unit, Royal Manchester Children's Hospital, Manchester, UK."", ""Service d'Endocrinologie, CHU Sainte-Justine, Montreal, Canada."", 'Departement de Pediatrie, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', ""Departement d'Hematologie Pediatrique, CHU Robert-Debre, Paris, France."", 'Service de Genetique Clinique, CHU Robert-Debre, Paris, France.', 'Service de Genetique Medicale, CHU Sainte-Justine, Montreal, Canada.', 'Departement de Pediatrie, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Service de Genetique Medicale, CHU Sainte-Justine, Montreal, Canada.', 'Departement de Pediatrie, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Service de Genetique Medicale, CHU Sainte-Justine, Montreal, Canada.', 'Centre de Recherche, CHU Sainte-Justine, Montreal, Canada.', 'Centre Integre de Genomique Clinique Pediatrique, Montreal, Canada.', 'Departement de Pediatrie, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Departement de Pediatrie, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Departement de Pediatrie, CHU Sainte-Justine, Montreal, Canada.', 'Departement de Pediatrie, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', ""Service d'Hematologie-Oncologie, CHU Sainte-Justine, Montreal, Canada."", 'Service de Genetique Medicale, CHU Sainte-Justine, Montreal, Canada.', 'Laboratoire de Diagnostic Moleculaire, CHU Sainte-Justine, Montreal, Canada.', 'Departement de Pediatrie, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-1068-3154'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180607,Denmark,Clin Genet,Clinical genetics,0253664,"['0 (DNAJC21 protein, human)', '0 (HSP40 Heat-Shock Proteins)', 'Bone Marrow failure syndromes', 'Shwachman syndrome']",IM,"['Abnormalities, Multiple/*genetics/physiopathology', 'Anemia, Aplastic/diagnosis/*genetics/pathology/physiopathology', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/diagnosis/*genetics/physiopathology', 'Bone Marrow Failure Disorders', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dyskeratosis Congenita/genetics/physiopathology', 'Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency/genetics/physiopathology', 'Female', 'Founder Effect', 'Genomic Instability/*genetics', 'HSP40 Heat-Shock Proteins/*genetics', 'Hemoglobinuria, Paroxysmal/diagnosis/*genetics/physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Lipomatosis/genetics/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Mutation', 'Phenotype', 'Ribosomes/genetics', 'Shwachman-Diamond Syndrome', 'Telomere/genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*BMFS3', '*bone marrow failure syndrome', '*founder effect', '*genomic instability', '*genotype-phenotype', '*management', '*natural history', '*ribosome', '*telomere']",2018/04/28 06:00,2019/11/16 06:00,['2018/04/28 06:00'],"['2018/02/20 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/04 00:00 [revised]', '2018/04/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/16 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cge.13370 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Genet. 2018 Aug;94(2):252-258. doi: 10.1111/cge.13370.

The hallmark reciprocal chromosomal translocation t(15;17) involving fusion between the retinoic acid receptor (RARalpha) gene and promyelocytic leukemia (PML) gene is a characteristic feature in APL which consequently results in the emergence of PML-RARalpha chimeric gene. This gene has been substantiated to be responsible for cellular transformation and is a prime target of all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) as well as arsenic-trioxide (ATO) therapy. Since this initial discovery, about 10 diverse translocation partner genes of RARalpha have been reported that result in variant APL forms strongly suggesting that disruption of RARalpha underlies its pathogenesis. The nature of the fusion partner has a significant bearing upon disease characteristics including sensitivity to retinoids and ATO and thereby underpins the need for rapid and accurate diagnosis and also demands a highly specific treatment approach. In this article we laid emphasis on the rearrangement of the RARalpha gene and its different fusion partners resulting in variant forms of APL, their implication in underlying molecular pathogenesis of APL and also the different diagnostic modalities that should be employed for their rapid and accurate diagnosis.","['Baba, S M', 'Pandith, A A', 'Shah, Z A', 'Baba, R A']","['Baba SM', 'Pandith AA', 'Shah ZA', 'Baba RA']","['Department of Immunology and Molecular Medicine, Sher-I-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences, Srinagar, India.', 'Advanced Centre for Human Genetics, Sher-I-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences, Srinagar, India.', 'Department of Immunology and Molecular Medicine, Sher-I-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences, Srinagar, India.', 'Department of Immunology and Molecular Medicine, Sher-I-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences, Srinagar, India.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-2481-1268'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180608,Denmark,Clin Genet,Clinical genetics,0253664,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Gene Rearrangement/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic']",['NOTNLM'],"['*APL', '*ATO', '*ATRA', '*FISH', '*MRD', '*RT-PCR']",2018/04/28 06:00,2020/02/12 06:00,['2018/04/28 06:00'],"['2018/02/26 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/19 00:00 [revised]', '2018/04/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/12 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cge.13372 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Genet. 2019 Jan;95(1):41-52. doi: 10.1111/cge.13372.

In parallel, quantification of minimal residual disease (MRD) proved to be an independent prognostic factor for progression-free and overall survival. The European Research Initiative on CLL (ERIC) in collaboration with American and Australasian partners developed harmonised assays that could be applied reproducibly to compare the efficacy of different treatments. The potential for MRD analysis to identify the most effective treatments prior to reaching survival endpoints was recognised by regulatory agencies and approved as an intermediate endpoint for licensure in randomized studies, in Europe. More recently treatment approaches have evolved, in particular with BCL2-pathway inhibitors, so that MRD analysis may be informative for most patients and clinical trials, potentially becoming a tool for managing CLL patients in clinical practice. In the recent past the importance of the type of MRD assay used, the most appropriate timing and compartment to assess for different treatment types have been learnt as we move towards eradicating residual disease beyond the guideline threshold of one cell in ten thousand. Nowadays, MRD assessment in CLL has quickly become an indispensable tool for clinical research and development that promise to change the way we manage our patients in the future.","['Ghia, Paolo', 'Rawstron, Andy']","['Ghia P', 'Rawstron A']","['Universita Vita-Salute San Raffaele and IRCCS Istituto Scientifico San Raffaele, Milano, Italy. ghia.paolo@hsr.it.', 'Haematological Malignancy Diagnostic Service (HMDS), Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Leeds and Department of Health Sciences, University of York, York, UK.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3750-7342'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180326,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)'],IM,"['High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis', 'Precision Medicine', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use']",,,2018/04/28 06:00,2019/04/02 06:00,['2018/04/28 06:00'],"['2017/06/14 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/08 00:00 [revised]', '2018/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/02 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-018-0109-x [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-018-0109-x [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2018 Jun;32(6):1307-1316. doi: 10.1038/s41375-018-0109-x.

Our results suggest that if there are mutations in KLF1 associated with erythroid malignancies, they are exceedingly rare.","['Gnanapragasam, Merlin Nithya', 'Crispino, John D', 'Ali, Abdullah M', 'Weinberg, Rona', 'Hoffman, Ronald', 'Raza, Azra', 'Bieker, James J']","['Gnanapragasam MN', 'Crispino JD', 'Ali AM', 'Weinberg R', 'Hoffman R', 'Raza A', 'Bieker JJ']","['Department of Cell, Developmental, and Regenerative Biology, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY, 10029, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, 60611, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA.', 'Cellular Therapy Laboratory, New York Blood Center, New York, NY, 10065, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY, 10029, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA.', 'Department of Cell, Developmental, and Regenerative Biology, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY, 10029, USA. james.bieker@mssm.edu.', 'Tisch Cancer Institute, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY, 10029, USA. james.bieker@mssm.edu.', 'Black Familly Stem Cell Institute, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY, 10029, USA. james.bieker@mssm.edu.', 'Mindich Child Health and Development Institute, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY, 10029, USA. james.bieker@mssm.edu.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180426,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (erythroid Kruppel-like factor)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Erythroid Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Erythropoiesis/genetics', 'Genetic Variation', '*Genetics, Population', 'Genomics/methods', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/classification/*metabolism', '*Mutation', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', '*Transcription, Genetic']",,,2018/04/28 06:00,2019/10/17 06:00,['2018/04/28 06:00'],"['2018/02/14 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-018-24962-3 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-018-24962-3 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2018 Apr 26;8(1):6587. doi: 10.1038/s41598-018-24962-3.,,,"['P01 CA108671/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK046865/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA133608/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC5920080,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we investigated the effects of tetrandrine on leukemia in vitro and in vivo. The results showed that tetrandrine effectively induced differentiation and autophagy in leukemia cells. In addition, tetrandrine treatment activated the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inhibited c-MYC protein expression. Further, we found that treatment with the ROS scavengers N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and Tiron as well as overexpression of c-MYC reduced tetrandrine-induced autophagy and differentiation. Moreover, a small molecular c-MYC inhibitor, 10058-F4, enhanced the tetrandrine-induced differentiation of leukemia cells. These results suggest that ROS generation and c-MYC suppression play important roles in tetrandrine-induced autophagy and differentiation, and the results from in vivo experiments were consistent with those from in vitro studies. Therefore, our data suggest that tetrandrine may be a promising agent for the treatment of leukemia.","['Wu, Guixian', 'Liu, Ting', 'Li, Han', 'Li, Yafang', 'Li, Dengju', 'Li, Wenhua']","['Wu G', 'Liu T', 'Li H', 'Li Y', 'Li D', 'Li W']","['Hubei Key Laboratory of Cell Homeostasis, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430072, P.

In particular, advances in next-generation sequencing now make it possible to define the genetic lesions present in each patient, which has led to improved disease classification, risk stratification and identification of new therapeutic targets. Here we discuss recent advances in the genomic classification and targeted treatment of haematological malignancies, focusing on acute myeloid leukaemia. Multiple novel drug classes are now on the horizon, including agents that target overactive signalling pathways, differentiation therapies and immunotherapies.

Chronic antigen stimulation is postulated to promote long-term survival of LGL leukemia cells through constitutive activation of multiple survival pathways, resulting in global dysregulation of apoptosis and resistance to activation-induced cell death. We reported previously that nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) is a central regulator of the survival network for leukemic LGL. However, the mechanisms that trigger constitutive activation of NF-kappaB in LGL leukemia remain undefined. Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is known to induce apoptosis in tumor cells but can also activate NF-kappaB through interaction with TRAIL receptors 1, 2, and 4 (also known as DR4, DR5, and DcR2, respectively). The role of TRAIL has not been studied in LGL leukemia. In this study, we hypothesized that TRAIL interaction with DcR2 contributes to NF-kappaB activation in LGL leukemia. We observed upregulated TRAIL messenger RNA and protein expression in LGL leukemia cells with elevated levels of soluble TRAIL protein in LGL leukemia patient sera. We also found that DcR2 is the predominant TRAIL receptor in LGL leukemia cells. We demonstrated that TRAIL-induced activation of DcR2 led to increased NF-kappaB activation in leukemic LGL. Conversely, interruption of TRAIL-DcR2 signaling led to decreased NF-kappaB activation. Finally, a potential therapeutic application of proteasome inhibitors (bortezomib and ixazomib), which are known to inhibit NF-kappaB, was identified through their ability to decrease proliferation and increase apoptosis in LGL leukemia cell lines and primary patient cells.","['Yang, Jun', 'LeBlanc, Francis R', 'Dighe, Shubha A', 'Hamele, Cait E', 'Olson, Thomas L', 'Feith, David J', 'Loughran, Thomas P Jr']","['Yang J', 'LeBlanc FR', 'Dighe SA', 'Hamele CE', 'Olson TL', 'Feith DJ', 'Loughran TP Jr']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Virginia Cancer Center, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA; and.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Virginia Cancer Center, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA; and.', 'Penn State College of Medicine, Hershey, PA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Virginia Cancer Center, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA; and.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Virginia Cancer Center, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA; and.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Virginia Cancer Center, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA; and.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Virginia Cancer Center, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA; and.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Virginia Cancer Center, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA; and.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-5979-0479', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7906-205X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4981-1691']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180426,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFRSF10D protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Decoy Receptors)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/*immunology/pathology', 'NF-kappa B/*immunology', 'Protein Interaction Maps', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Decoy Receptors/*immunology']",,,2018/04/28 06:00,2019/07/11 06:00,['2018/04/28 06:00'],"['2017/09/27 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/11 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)32139-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2017-09-808816 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2018 Jun 21;131(25):2803-2815. doi: 10.1182/blood-2017-09-808816.

We performed computer simulations of the FLT3-dependent signalling network in order to study the pathways that are involved in AML development and resistance to targeted therapies. RESULTS: Analysis of the simulations revealed the presence of alternative pathways through phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K) and SH2-containing sequence proteins (SHC), that could overcome inhibition of FLT3. Inhibition of cyclin dependent kinase 6 (CDK6), a related molecular target, was also tested in the simulation but was not found to yield sufficient benefits alone. CONCLUSIONS: The PI3K pathway provided a basis for resistance to treatments. Alternative signalling pathways could not, however, restore cancer growth signals (proliferation and loss of apoptosis) to the same levels as prior to treatment, which may explain why FLT3 resistance mutations are the most common resistance mechanism. Finally, sensitivity analysis suggested the existence of optimal doses of FLT3 and CDK6 inhibitors in terms of efficacy and toxicity.","['Buetti-Dinh, Antoine', 'Friedman, Ran']","['Buetti-Dinh A', 'Friedman R']","['Department of Chemistry and Biomedical Sciences, Linnaeus University, Norra vagen 49, Kalmar, SE-391 82, Sweden.', 'Linnaeus University Centre for Biomaterials Chemistry, Linnaeus University, Norra vagen 49, Kalmar, SE-391 82, Sweden.', 'Centre for Ecology and Evolution in Microbial Model Systems, Linnaeus University, Landgangen 3, Kalmar, SE-391 82, Sweden.', 'Institute of Computational Science, Faculty of Informatics, Universita della Svizzera Italiana, Via Giuseppe Buffi 13, Lugano, CH-6900, Switzerland.', 'Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, Quartier Sorge - Batiment Genopode, Lausanne, CH-1015, Switzerland.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biomedical Sciences, Linnaeus University, Norra vagen 49, Kalmar, SE-391 82, Sweden. ran.friedman@lnu.se.', 'Linnaeus University Centre for Biomaterials Chemistry, Linnaeus University, Norra vagen 49, Kalmar, SE-391 82, Sweden. ran.friedman@lnu.se.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-6469-0296'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180424,England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK6 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', '*Computer Simulation', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Mutation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology/*standards', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukaemia', '*Combination therapy', '*Drug resistance', '*Knowledge-based analysis']",2018/04/28 06:00,2018/11/01 06:00,['2018/04/28 06:00'],"['2017/10/16 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12859-018-2145-y [doi]', '10.1186/s12859-018-2145-y [pii]']",epublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2018 Apr 24;19(1):155. doi: 10.1186/s12859-018-2145-y.,,,['CAN 2015/387/Cancerfonden/International'],PMC5921566,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, ATRA-based treatment is not effective in other subtypes of AML. In non-APL AML, ATRA signaling pathway is impaired or downmodulated, and consequently fails to respond to pharmacological doses of ATRA. Therefore, complementary treatment strategies are needed to improve ATRA responsiveness in non-APL AML. In this study, we investigated the combined effect of ATRA and bromodomain inhibitor JQ1, proven to have potent anti-cancer activity mainly through inhibition of c-Myc. We showed that the combination of ATRA with JQ1 synergistically inhibited proliferation of AML cells. The synergistic growth inhibition was resulted from differentiation or apoptosis depending on the kind of AML cells. Concomitantly, the combined treatment of ATRA and JQ1 caused greater depletion of c-Myc and hTERT expression than each agent alone in AML cells. Taken together, these findings support the rationale for the use of the combination of ATRA and JQ1 as a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of AML.","['Kang, Changhee', 'Kim, C-Yoon', 'Kim, Hyuk Soon', 'Park, Se-Pill', 'Chung, Hyung-Min']","['Kang C', 'Kim CY', 'Kim HS', 'Park SP', 'Chung HM']","['Department of Stem Cell Biology, School of Medicine, Konkuk University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Stem Cell Biology, School of Medicine, Konkuk University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Immunology and Physiology, School of Medicine, Konkuk University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Faculty of Biotechnology, College of Applied Life Sciences, Jeju National University, Jeju, Korea.', 'Department of Stem Cell Biology, School of Medicine, Konkuk University, Seoul, Korea.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Korea (South),Int J Stem Cells,International journal of stem cells,101497587,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'All-trans retinoic acid', 'Apoptosis', 'Differentiation', 'JQ1', 'c-Myc']",2018/04/28 06:00,2018/04/28 06:01,['2018/04/28 06:00'],"['2018/03/06 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/23 00:00 [revised]', '2018/03/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/28 06:01 [medline]', '2018/04/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['ijsc18021 [pii]', '10.15283/ijsc18021 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Stem Cells. 2018 May 30;11(1):131-140. doi: 10.15283/ijsc18021.,,,,PMC5984067,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ATO also affects regulatory genes involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis. The aim of present study was to examine the effects of ATO and THAL alone and in combination on U937 and KG-1 cells , with attention to mRNA expression for VEGF isoforms. Growth inhibitory effects was assessed by MTT assay and apoptosis induction was determined by Annexin/PI staining. mRNA expression levels were evaluated by real-time PCR. Our data indicated that ATO (1.618muM and 1muM in KG-1 and U937 cell lines respectively), THAL (80muM and 60muM) and their combination inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in our cell lines. mRNA expression of VEGF (A, B) decreased while C and D isoforms did not show any significant changes.

Cytotoxic agents and radiation impair spermatogenesis and cause oligospermia or azoospermia as well as genetic damage in sperm. To date, the only established option to preserve fertility is cryopreservation of sperm before treatment and artificial reproduction techniques, if men with cancer can ejaculate, but only a quarter of men have banked sperm. Lack of information is the most common reason for failing to bank sperm. However, prepubertal patients who have only spermatogonia and spermatocytes in their testes do not benefit from cryopreservation of their sperm and assisted reproductive techniques. Thus, the only available option is to harvest testicular tissues before treatment for cryopreservation, from which immature germ cells can somehow be maturated. Autotransplantation of germ cells into the testis holds promise for fertility restoration, but contamination by malignant cells may induce relapse. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) with two surface markers could exclude contaminated leukemic cells from murine germ cells, and transplantation of sorted germ cells successfully restored fertility without transmission of leukemia. Human germ cells could be also isolated from human leukemia and lymphoma cell lines by FACS using surface markers. Before autotransplantation can be applied clinically, some issues, including the risk of contamination by malignant cells and in vitro propagation of spermatogonial stem cells, should be resolved.","['Fujita, Kazutoshi', 'Tsujimura, Akira']","['Fujita K', 'Tsujimura A']","['Department of Urology Osaka General Medical Center 3-1-56 Bandai-hiagashi, Sumiyoshi 558-8558 Osaka Japan.', 'Department of Urology Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine 2-2 Yamadaoka 565-0871 Suita Osaka Japan.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20100807,Japan,Reprod Med Biol,Reproductive medicine and biology,101213278,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chemotherapy', 'Infertility', 'Radiation', 'Survivor', 'Transplantation']",2010/08/07 00:00,2010/08/07 00:01,['2018/04/28 06:00'],"['2010/05/31 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/07 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12522-010-0061-6 [doi]', 'RMB20061 [pii]']",epublish,Reprod Med Biol. 2010 Aug 7;9(4):179-184. doi: 10.1007/s12522-010-0061-6. eCollection 2010 Dec.,,,,PMC5904621,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We now show that although the intracellular cytoplasmic tail (CD200C-tail) of CD200 has no consensus sites for adapter molecules which might signal the CD200(+) cell directly, cleavage of the CD200C-tail from the membrane region of CD200 by a consensus gamma-secretase, leads to nuclear translocation and DNA binding (identified by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing, Chip-sequencing) of the CD200C-tail. Subsequently there occurs an altered expression of a limited number of genes, many of which are transcription factors (TFs) known to be associated with regulation of cell proliferation. Altered expression of these TFs was also prominent following transfection of CD200(+) B cell lines and fresh patient CLL cells with a vector construct containing the CD200C-tail. Artificial transfection of non CD200(+) Hek293 cells with this CD200C-tail construct resulted in altered expression of most of these same genes. Introduction of a siRNA for one of these TFs, POTEA, reversed CD200C-tail regulation of altered cell proliferation.","['Chen, Zhiqi', 'Kapus, Andras', 'Khatri, Ismat', 'Kos, Olha', 'Zhu, Fang', 'Gorczynski, Reginald M']","['Chen Z', 'Kapus A', 'Khatri I', 'Kos O', 'Zhu F', 'Gorczynski RM']","[""St. Michael's Hospital Research Institute, Toronto, ON, Canada."", ""St. Michael's Hospital Research Institute, Toronto, ON, Canada."", 'University Health Network, University of Toronto, Canada.', 'University Health Network, University of Toronto, Canada.', 'Institute of Medical Sciences, Toronto, Canada.', 'University Health Network, University of Toronto, Canada; Institute of Medical Sciences, Toronto, Canada; Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Canada.

We previously showed that miR-221 is upregulated in ALV-J-induced tumors. In this study, we analyzed the possible function of miR-221 in ALV-J tumorigenesis. The target validation system showed that CDKN1B is a target of miR-221 and is downregulated in ALV-J infection. As CDKN1B arrests the cell cycle and regulates its progression, we analyzed the proliferation of ALV-J-infected DF-1 cells. ALV-J-infection-induced DF1 cell derepression of G1/S transition and overproliferation required high miR-221 expression followed by CDKN1B downregulation. Cell cycle pathway analysis showed that ALV-J infection induced DF-1 cell overproliferation via the CDKN1B-CDK2/CDK6 pathway. Thus, miR-221 may play an important role in ALV-J-induced aggressive growth of DF-1 cells; these findings have expanded our insights into the mechanism underlying ALV-J infection and tumorigenesis.","['Ren, Chaoqi', 'Yu, Mengmeng', 'Zhang, Yao', 'Fan, Minghui', 'Chang, Fangfang', 'Xing, Lixiao', 'Liu, Yongzhen', 'Wang, Yongqiang', 'Qi, Xiaole', 'Liu, Changjun', 'Zhang, Yanping', 'Cui, Hongyu', 'Li, Kai', 'Gao, Li', 'Pan, Qing', 'Wang, Xiaomei', 'Gao, Yulong']","['Ren C', 'Yu M', 'Zhang Y', 'Fan M', 'Chang F', 'Xing L', 'Liu Y', 'Wang Y', 'Qi X', 'Liu C', 'Zhang Y', 'Cui H', 'Li K', 'Gao L', 'Pan Q', 'Wang X', 'Gao Y']","['Division of Avian Infectious Diseases, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, The Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin 150069, PR China.', 'Division of Avian Infectious Diseases, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, The Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin 150069, PR China.', 'Division of Avian Infectious Diseases, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, The Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin 150069, PR China.', 'Division of Avian Infectious Diseases, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, The Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin 150069, PR China.', 'Division of Avian Infectious Diseases, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, The Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin 150069, PR China.', 'Division of Avian Infectious Diseases, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, The Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin 150069, PR China.', 'Division of Avian Infectious Diseases, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, The Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin 150069, PR China.', 'Division of Avian Infectious Diseases, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, The Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin 150069, PR China.', 'Division of Avian Infectious Diseases, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, The Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin 150069, PR China.', 'Division of Avian Infectious Diseases, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, The Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin 150069, PR China.', 'Division of Avian Infectious Diseases, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, The Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin 150069, PR China.', 'Division of Avian Infectious Diseases, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, The Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin 150069, PR China.', 'Division of Avian Infectious Diseases, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, The Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin 150069, PR China.', 'Division of Avian Infectious Diseases, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, The Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin 150069, PR China.', 'Division of Avian Infectious Diseases, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, The Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin 150069, PR China.', 'Division of Avian Infectious Diseases, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, The Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin 150069, PR China; Jiangsu Co-innovation Center for Prevention and Control of Important Animal Infectious Disease and Zoonoses, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou 225009, PR China.

Ph(+) AML is considered to be high risk for failure to attain remission or for early relapse after standard chemotherapy. Because of the low incidence of the disease, it has been difficult to determine the best treatment, including the effects of tyrosine kinase inhibitors. We retrospectively analyzed 29 patients with Ph(+) AML (median age, 45 years; range, 18 to 80) managed at our center between 2002 and 2016. Two patients were not treated at all, 3 received repeated low-dose cytarabine, and 24 were treated with 3 + 7 standard induction chemotherapy. All 27 treated patients also received interim imatinib 400 mg orally until the day of the next chemotherapy cycle began or as conditioning for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), which was performed in 17 patients. Of the 29 patients with Ph(+) AML, 7 (24.1%) had additional inv(16), 3 of whom had therapy-related AML. In the 7 with inv(16), the median age was younger (31 versus 44 years, P = .083) and the complete remission (CR) rate was relatively higher (85.7% versus 54.5%, P = .214) than in those without inv(16). Among the 27 treated patients, 20 (74.1%) achieved CR after standard chemotherapy with interim imatinib and 2 (7.4%) achieved CR after low-dose cytarabine with interim imatinib. After a median follow-up of 65.5 months (range, 13.4 to 156.6), the 5-year overall survival (OS) among all 27 treated patients was 43.1%. For the 17 patients who underwent HCT the 5-year OS of 17 patients (10 in subgroup without inv(16) and 7 in subgroup with inv(16)) treated with allogeneic HCT was 69.3%. All 7 with inv(16) were still alive at the end of the study. In contrast, all patients not treated with HCT died within a median of 6.25 months (range, .2 to 18.2). Interim imatinib combined with chemotherapy yielded an acceptable remission rate in adult patients with Ph(+) AML. Allogeneic HCT as a postremission therapy provided long-term disease control in two-thirds of those who underwent the transplant. We also demonstrated that inv(16) was related to a favorable outcome in Ph(+) AML, including therapy-related AML.","['Min, Gi June', 'Kim, Hee-Je', 'Yoon, Jae-Ho', 'Kwak, Dae-Hun', 'Park, Sung-Soo', 'Jeon, Young-Woo', 'Lee, Sung-Eun', 'Cho, Byung-Sik', 'Eom, Ki-Seong', 'Kim, Yoo-Jin', 'Lee, Seok', 'Min, Chang-Ki', 'Cho, Seok-Goo', 'Kim, Dong-Wook', 'Lee, Jong Wook', 'Min, Woo-Sung']","['Min GJ', 'Kim HJ', 'Yoon JH', 'Kwak DH', 'Park SS', 'Jeon YW', 'Lee SE', 'Cho BS', 'Eom KS', 'Kim YJ', 'Lee S', 'Min CK', 'Cho SG', 'Kim DW', 'Lee JW', 'Min WS']","[""Department of Hematology, Leukemia Research Institute, Seoul St. Mary's Hematology Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea."", ""Department of Hematology, Leukemia Research Institute, Seoul St. Mary's Hematology Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.

As such, VDAC1 is involved in two important hallmarks of cancer development, namely energy and metabolic reprograming and apoptotic cell death evasion. We previously developed cell-penetrating VDAC1-derived peptides that interact with hexokinase (HK), Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL to prevent the anti-apoptotic activities of these proteins and induce cancer cell death, with a focus on leukemia and glioblastoma. In this study, we demonstrated the sensitivity of a panel of genetically characterized cancer cell lines, differing in origin and carried mutations, to VDAC1-based peptide-induced apoptosis. Noncancerous cell lines were less affected by the peptides. Furthermore, we constructed additional VDAC1-based peptides with the aim of improving targeting, selectivity, and cellular stability, including R-Tf-D-LP4, containing the transferrin receptor internalization sequence (Tf) that allows targeting of the peptide to cancer cells, known to overexpress the transferrin receptor. The mode of action of the VDAC1-based peptides involves HK detachment, interfering with the action of anti-apoptotic proteins, and thus activating multiple routes leading to an impairment of cell energy and metabolism homeostasis and the induction of apoptosis. Finally, in xenograft glioblastoma, lung, and breast cancer mouse models, R-Tf-D-LP4 inhibited tumor growth while inducing massive cancer cell death, including of cancer stem cells. Thus, VDAC1-based peptides offer an innovative new conceptual framework for cancer therapy.","['Shteinfer-Kuzmine, Anna', 'Amsalem, Zohar', 'Arif, Tasleem', 'Zooravlov, Alexandra', 'Shoshan-Barmatz, Varda']","['Shteinfer-Kuzmine A', 'Amsalem Z', 'Arif T', 'Zooravlov A', 'Shoshan-Barmatz V']","['Department of Life Sciences, National Institute for Biotechnology in the Negev, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel.', 'Department of Life Sciences, National Institute for Biotechnology in the Negev, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel.', 'Department of Life Sciences, National Institute for Biotechnology in the Negev, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel.', 'Department of Life Sciences, National Institute for Biotechnology in the Negev, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel.', 'Department of Life Sciences, National Institute for Biotechnology in the Negev, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel.']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-9881-0076', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6756-4340']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180519,United States,Mol Oncol,Molecular oncology,101308230,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 1.6.- (Voltage-Dependent Anion Channel 1)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dogs', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Peptides/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Receptors, Transferrin/metabolism', 'Voltage-Dependent Anion Channel 1/*therapeutic use', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",['NOTNLM'],"['*VDAC1', '*apoptosis', '*cancer', '*metabolism', '*mitochondria', '*peptides']",2018/04/27 06:00,2019/06/01 06:00,['2018/04/27 06:00'],"['2017/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/22 00:00 [revised]', '2018/04/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/01 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1878-0261.12313 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Oncol. 2018 Jun;12(7):1077-1103. doi: 10.1002/1878-0261.12313.

The objectives of the current study were to: 1) compare the use of medical care services by survivors with that of a normative population; 2) evaluate the use of medical and psychosocial care services among distressed and nondistressed survivors; and 3) identify associated sociodemographic and clinical factors. METHODS: Survivors of lymphoma and CLL diagnosed between 1999 and 2012 were selected via the population-based Netherlands Cancer Registry and completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale questionnaire and questions regarding health care. Outcomes were compared with an age-matched and sex-matched normative population. RESULTS: A total of 1444 survivors responded (69%). Survivors of lymphoma and CLL contacted their general practitioner (3.8 vs 2.3; P<.001) and medical specialist (5.7 vs 1.6; P<.001) more often within the last year compared with a normative population. In addition, psychologically distressed survivors had even more medical contacts and received psychosocial care more often compared with nondistressed survivors. In addition to psychological distress, comorbidity, female sex, and older age were found to be associated with a greater use of medical services, whereas younger age was associated with receiving psychosocial care. CONCLUSIONS: Survivors of lymphoma and CLL, especially those who are psychologically distressed, report an increased use of health care services compared with a normative population. Further studies are needed to explore whether the use of widely applicable psychosocial interventions could reduce the frequency of medical contacts. Cancer 2018;124:3016-24.

Cytotoxic CD8 T cells are probably important for effective control of infection. However, the HHV-6-specific CD8 T cell repertoire is largely uncharacterized. Therefore, we undertook a virus-wide analysis of CD8 T cell responses to HHV-6. We used a simple anchor motif-based algorithm (SAMBA) to identify 299 epitope candidates potentially presented by the HLA class I molecule B*08:01. Candidates were found in 77 of 98 unique HHV-6B proteins. From peptide-expanded T cell lines, we obtained CD8 T cell clones against 20 candidates. We tested whether T cell clones recognized HHV-6-infected cells. This was the case for 16 epitopes derived from 12 proteins from all phases of the viral replication cycle. Epitopes were enriched in certain amino acids flanking the peptide. Ex vivo analysis of eight healthy donors with HLA-peptide multimers showed that the strongest responses were directed against an epitope from IE-2, with a median frequency of 0.09% of CD8 T cells. Reconstitution of T cells specific for this and other HHV-6 epitopes was also observed after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. We conclude that HHV-6 induces CD8 T cell responses against multiple antigens of diverse functional classes. Most antigens against which CD8 T cells can be raised are presented by infected cells. Ex vivo multimer staining can directly identify HHV-6-specific T cells. These results will advance development of immune monitoring, adoptive T cell therapy, and vaccines.","['Martin, Larissa K', 'Hollaus, Alexandra', 'Stahuber, Anna', 'Hubener, Christoph', 'Fraccaroli, Alessia', 'Tischer, Johanna', 'Schub, Andrea', 'Moosmann, Andreas']","['Martin LK', 'Hollaus A', 'Stahuber A', 'Hubener C', 'Fraccaroli A', 'Tischer J', 'Schub A', 'Moosmann A']","['DZIF Research Group ""Host Control of Viral Latency and Reactivation"" (HOCOVLAR), Research Unit Gene Vectors, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'DZIF Research Group ""Host Control of Viral Latency and Reactivation"" (HOCOVLAR), Research Unit Gene Vectors, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'DZIF Research Group ""Host Control of Viral Latency and Reactivation"" (HOCOVLAR), Research Unit Gene Vectors, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Internal Medicine III, Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Klinikum der Universitat Munchen (LMU), Grosshadern, Munich, Germany.', 'Internal Medicine III, Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Klinikum der Universitat Munchen (LMU), Grosshadern, Munich, Germany.', 'DZIF Research Group ""Host Control of Viral Latency and Reactivation"" (HOCOVLAR), Research Unit Gene Vectors, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'DZIF Research Group ""Host Control of Viral Latency and Reactivation"" (HOCOVLAR), Research Unit Gene Vectors, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'German Center for Infection Research (DZIF-Deutsches Zentrum fur Infektionsforschung), Munich, Germany.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-6437-1279', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8044-5146']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180426,United States,PLoS Pathog,PLoS pathogens,101238921,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (HLA Antigens)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/immunology/therapy', 'Antigens, Viral/*immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/*immunology', 'HLA Antigens/*immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Herpesvirus 6, Human/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/therapy', 'Roseolovirus Infections/*immunology/virology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,,2018/04/27 06:00,2018/07/25 06:00,['2018/04/27 06:00'],"['2017/11/16 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.ppat.1006991 [doi]', 'PPATHOGENS-D-17-02458 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Pathog. 2018 Apr 26;14(4):e1006991. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1006991. eCollection 2018 Apr.,,,,PMC5919459,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The secretory recombinant plasmid pPIC9-gp85 containing ALV-J gp85 gene was designed and was transfected into the genome of P. pastoris (GS115) cells. The recombinant plasmid was expressed under the induction of methanol. The expressed products in the medium of the cells were purified and identified with endoglycosidase digestion assay and western blot mediated with monoclonal antibody (MAb) JE9. The purified product combining with CpG-ODN adjuvant was inoculated intramuscularly into 7-day-old chickens and three booster inoculations were performed on 21 days post first inoculation (dpfi), 42, and 56 dpfi. The antibody responses and cellular immune responses were detected, and the protective effects were analyzed after challenge with ALV-J. The results showed that the secretory pPIC9-gp85 plasmid was successfully constructed and could be stably expressed in GS115 cells. The expressed products were N-acetylglucosylated and could specifically combine with MAb (JE9). The secreted gp85 protein combining with CpG-ODN adjuvant could induce higher antibody response and spleen lymphocyte proliferation response and IFN-gamma-inducing response, and could protect all the inoculated chickens against the viremia and the immunosuppressive lesions caused by ALV-J challenge. The results of neutralizing test in vitro suggested that the antisera with some ALV-J antibody titers could neutralize ALV-J strain and inhibit the growth of virus in vitro. The result of IFA showed that IgG antibody in the antisera could specifically combine with ALV-J strain in cells. It can be concluded that the secretory recombinant gp85 protein, as a new acetylglucosylated gp85 protein, was successfully prepared and combining with CpG-ODN adjuvant could protect the inoculated chickens against ALV-J infection. This study first reported the methods on preparing the secretory recombinant ALV-J gp85 protein using P. pastoris and evaluated its immunoprotection.","['Jing, Weifang', 'Zhou, Jinrun', 'Wang, Chunyang', 'Qiu, Jianhua', 'Guo, Huijun', 'Li, Hongmei']","['Jing W', 'Zhou J', 'Wang C', 'Qiu J', 'Guo H', 'Li H']","[""Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Animal Biotechnology and Disease Control and Prevention, Shandong Provincial Engineering Technology Research Center of Animal Disease Control and Prevention, College of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University , Tai'an, China ."", ""Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Animal Biotechnology and Disease Control and Prevention, Shandong Provincial Engineering Technology Research Center of Animal Disease Control and Prevention, College of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University , Tai'an, China ."", ""Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Animal Biotechnology and Disease Control and Prevention, Shandong Provincial Engineering Technology Research Center of Animal Disease Control and Prevention, College of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University , Tai'an, China ."", ""Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Animal Biotechnology and Disease Control and Prevention, Shandong Provincial Engineering Technology Research Center of Animal Disease Control and Prevention, College of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University , Tai'an, China ."", ""Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Animal Biotechnology and Disease Control and Prevention, Shandong Provincial Engineering Technology Research Center of Animal Disease Control and Prevention, College of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University , Tai'an, China ."", ""Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Animal Biotechnology and Disease Control and Prevention, Shandong Provincial Engineering Technology Research Center of Animal Disease Control and Prevention, College of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University , Tai'an, China .""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180426,United States,Viral Immunol,Viral immunology,8801552,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (CPG-oligonucleotide)', '0 (Influenza Vaccines)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Vaccines, Synthetic)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Vaccines)', '0 (glycoprotein 85, avian leukosis virus)']",IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood/immunology', 'Antibody Formation/drug effects/immunology', 'Avian Leukosis/blood/immunology/*prevention & control/virology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/*immunology', 'Chickens', 'Influenza Vaccines', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/immunology/therapeutic use', '*Pichia', 'Poultry Diseases/blood/immunology/*prevention & control/virology', 'Recombinant Proteins/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Vaccines, Synthetic/immunology/therapeutic use', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*immunology/isolation & purification', 'Viral Vaccines/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Viremia/blood/immunology/prevention & control/virology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*J subgroup of avian leukosis virus (ALV-J)', '*Pichia pastoris', '*immunoprotection', '*neutralizing antibody', '*secretory protein']",2018/04/27 06:00,2018/10/27 06:00,['2018/04/27 06:00'],"['2018/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/27 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/vim.2017.0170 [doi]'],ppublish,Viral Immunol. 2018 Jul/Aug;31(6):407-416. doi: 10.1089/vim.2017.0170.

However, there are many adverse events due to L-asparaginase, including acute pancreatitis. The pathology of L-asparaginase-associated pancreatitis (AAP) remains unclear. We compared patients who developed AAP (n=29) and random matched controls (n=36) who had been enrolled in the Japan Association of Childhood Leukemia Study of the ALL-02 protocol. AAP and control patients were matched for age, sex, treatment, and protocol risk. We examined correlations between AAP development and clinical symptoms, laboratory data, and concomitant medication. Abdominal pain and nausea were common presenting symptoms for AAP. There was an increased risk of AAP in patients using gastric acid-suppressing agents and antithrombin (AT) supplementation.

However, the precise role of APRIL in ALL remains unknown. To investigate this issue, we silenced and overexpressed APRIL in Nalm-6 ALL cells using short hairpin RNA targeting the APRIL gene and recombinant human APRIL, respectively, and evaluated the effects on cell proliferation, apoptosis, and migration. APRIL mRNA and APRIL and matrix metalloproteinase-2 protein levels were evaluated by semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blott, respectively. We found that APRIL expression was reduced by shRNA-mediated knockdown in Nalm-6 cells; this was associated with a decrease in cell proliferation (P<0.05). APRIL knockdown increased apoptosis (P<0.01) but suppressed cell migration along with matrix metalloproteinase-2 protein level. Overexpressing recombinant human APRIL had the opposite effects in each case (P<0.05).

The regulation of this balance in HSC biology has been intensely investigated in several model systems, and lately the importance of epigenetic modifications as well as the organization and architecture of chromatin has become increasingly recognized. In this review, we will focus on the role of the chromatin organizing protein complex cohesin in regulation of normal and malignant haematopoiesis. RECENT FINDINGS: Several functional studies in both mouse and human systems have implicated cohesin as a critical regulator of self-renewal and differentiation in HSCs. Together with the discovery of recurrent mutations of cohesin genes in myeloid malignancies, this points towards a direct role of perturbed cohesin function in leukemogenesis. SUMMARY: The work reviewed here provides new insights about the role of the cohesin complex and chromatin architecture in normal and malignant HSCs, and indicates how cohesin may be specifically targeted for therapeutic benefit in the future.","['Galeev, Roman', 'Larsson, Jonas']","['Galeev R', 'Larsson J']","['Division of Molecular Medicine and Gene Therapy, Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (cohesins)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/genetics/metabolism', '*Hematopoiesis', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', '*Leukemia/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', '*Mutation', '*Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology']",,,2018/04/27 06:00,2019/03/08 06:00,['2018/04/27 06:00'],"['2018/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/08 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000431 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2018 Jul;25(4):259-265. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000431.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 59 leukemia patients. The polymorphisms of costimulatory molecules, including the CTLA-4 gene (-318 C/T, -1722 T/C, -1661 A/G, +49 A/G), PD-1 gene (1.3 A/G, 1.9 C/T), ICOS gene (1720 C/T), and CD28 gene (17 C/T), were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism methods. RESULTS: Our results showed that the TT genotype and T allele of the CTLA-4 -318 T/C polymorphism, the AA genotype of CTLA-4 +49 A/G polymorphism, and the CT genotype of PD-1 1.9 C/T polymorphism were significantly higher in healthy controls (P < .05). However, the AG genotype of the CTLA-4 +49 A/G, the CC genotype of the PD-1 1.9 C/T, and the CT genotype of the CD28 +17C/T polymorphism were significantly increased in patients with leukemia (P < .05). When the genotype frequency of costimulatory genes was compared between different leukemia groups, we observed that the A allele of the CTLA-4 +49 A/G and the CC genotype and C allele of the CD28 +17 C/T polymorphism were significantly higher in patients with acute leukemia than in those with chronic leukemia (P < .05). Among leukemia patients, the AA genotype of CTLA-4 +49A/G polymorphism was significantly increased in patients with acute myeloid leukemia, whereas the AG genotype was more prevalent in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: We show for the first time that genetic variations of costimulatory molecules CTLA-4, CD28, and PD-1 may be associated with susceptibility of Iranian patients to leukemia.","['Ramzi, Mani', 'Arandi, Nargess', 'Saadi, Mahdiyar Iravani', 'Yaghobi, Ramin', 'Geramizadeh, Bita']","['Ramzi M', 'Arandi N', 'Saadi MI', 'Yaghobi R', 'Geramizadeh B']","['From the Hematology Research Center, Namazi Hospital, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180426,Turkey,Exp Clin Transplant,Experimental and clinical transplantation : official journal of the Middle East Society for Organ Transplantation,101207333,"['0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (CTLA-4 Antigen)', '0 (CTLA4 protein, human)', '0 (ICOS protein, human)', '0 (Inducible T-Cell Co-Stimulator Protein)', '0 (PDCD1 protein, human)', '0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'CD28 Antigens/*genetics', 'CTLA-4 Antigen/*genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', '*Genetic Variation', 'Heterozygote', 'Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Inducible T-Cell Co-Stimulator Protein/*genetics', 'Iran', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/*genetics/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor/*genetics', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Young Adult']",,,2018/04/27 06:00,2021/11/03 06:00,['2018/04/27 06:00'],"['2018/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/03 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.6002/ect.2017.0176 [doi]'],ppublish,Exp Clin Transplant. 2020 Nov;18(6):719-724. doi: 10.6002/ect.2017.0176.

The induction of oxidative stress mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and excessive intracellular calcium influx are the main reasons behind As2O3 toxicity. Since liver is the major organ for xenobiotic metabolism, it is always under stress. Antioxidant vitamins such as L-Ascorbic acid (L-AA) and alpha-Tocopherol (alpha-TOC) have been proposed to have beneficial effects against a variety of pathological conditions and are known by their free radical scavenging properties. The present study evaluates the curative efficacy of L-AA and alpha-TOC against As2O3 toxicity using immortalized human Chang liver cells. Our results suggest that L-AA (100 microM) and alpha-TOC (50 microM) recovered As2O3 (10 microM) cytotoxicity. Furthermore, As2O3 treatment showed an increase in lipid peroxidation and depletion in antioxidant status, mitochondrial trans membrane potential and values of total antioxidant capacity. Cotreatment of antioxidant vitamins with As2O3 resulted in a significant reversal of oxidative stress markers. Our findings substantiate the effect of antioxidant vitamins in protecting the hepatocytes from oxidative stress which may be attributed through Nrf2 (Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2) mediated upregulation of Bcl2 (B-cell lymphoma 2) expression.","['Vineetha, Radhakrishnan Chandraprabha', 'Archana, Viswanathan', 'Binu, Prakash', 'Arathi, Pettamanna', 'Nair, Raveendran Harikumaran']","['Vineetha RC', 'Archana V', 'Binu P', 'Arathi P', 'Nair RH']","['a Physiology Research Laboratory, School of Biosciences, Mahatma Gandhi University , Kottayam , Kerala , India.', 'a Physiology Research Laboratory, School of Biosciences, Mahatma Gandhi University , Kottayam , Kerala , India.', 'a Physiology Research Laboratory, School of Biosciences, Mahatma Gandhi University , Kottayam , Kerala , India.', 'a Physiology Research Laboratory, School of Biosciences, Mahatma Gandhi University , Kottayam , Kerala , India.', 'a Physiology Research Laboratory, School of Biosciences, Mahatma Gandhi University , Kottayam , Kerala , India.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180426,United States,Nutr Cancer,Nutrition and cancer,7905040,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (NF-E2-Related Factor 2)', '0 (NFE2L2 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'H4N855PNZ1 (alpha-Tocopherol)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Arsenic Trioxide/*adverse effects', 'Ascorbic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Catalase/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury/drug therapy/pathology', 'Hepatocytes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lipid Peroxidation/drug effects', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Superoxide Dismutase/metabolism', 'alpha-Tocopherol/*pharmacology']",,,2018/04/27 06:00,2019/02/23 06:00,['2018/04/27 06:00'],"['2018/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/23 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/01635581.2018.1460676 [doi]'],ppublish,Nutr Cancer. 2018 May-Jun;70(4):684-696. doi: 10.1080/01635581.2018.1460676.

The unique biology often renders conventional chemotherapies less effective. Accurately predicting the toxicities of treatment is another unresolved challenge. Treatment planning thus requires a good knowledge of the current trial data and familiarity with clinical tools, including formal fitness and geriatric assessments. Both obstacles - disease biology and patient fitness - might be easier overcome with specific, AML cell-targeted agents rather than traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy. This may be the future of AML therapy, but it is not our current state. AREAS COVERED: Herein, the authors appraise the data supporting a standard induction approach, including an outline of how to predict treatment-related mortality and a review of the most up-to-date methods of geriatric assessment. They also discuss treatment expectations with less-intense therapies and highlight novel agents in development. Finally, they provide a basic approach to choosing treatment intensity. EXPERT OPINION: In an older and/or medically less-fit patient, treatment choice should begin with a thorough disease assessment, a formal evaluation of patient fitness and frailty. There should also be a clear communication with the patient and patient's family about the risks and anticipated benefits of either an intense or nonintense treatment approach.","['Michaelis, Laura C', 'Klepin, Heidi D', 'Walter, Roland B']","['Michaelis LC', 'Klepin HD', 'Walter RB']","['a Associate Professor of Medicine, Department of Hematology and Oncology , Medical College of Wisconsin , Milwaukee , WI , USA.', 'b Associate Professor of Internal Medicine, Section on Hematology and Oncology , Wake Forest School of Medicine , Winston-Salem , NC , USA.', 'c Associate Member, Clinical Research Division , Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center , Seattle , WA , USA.', 'd Associate Professor of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology , University of Washington , Seattle , WA , USA.', 'e Adjunct Associate Professor, Department of Epidemiology , University of Washington , Seattle , WA , USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180426,England,Expert Opin Pharmacother,Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,100897346,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Geriatric Assessment', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Quality of Life']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', '*geriatric assessment', '*older adult', '*resistance', '*therapeutic fitness', '*treatment', '*treatment-related mortality']",2018/04/27 06:00,2018/06/28 06:00,['2018/04/27 06:00'],"['2018/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/28 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/14656566.2018.1465562 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Pharmacother. 2018 Jun;19(8):865-882. doi: 10.1080/14656566.2018.1465562.

A restrictive approach towards utilizing cryopreserved ovarian tissue due to the risk for malignancy reintroduction on transplantation, further minimize the options that currently exist for these patients.

CNKI and PubMed databases were retrieved with ""acupuncture"" ""moxibustion"" and ""endometrial receptivity"" as key words. The retrieving time was from January of 2007 through December of 2016. As a result, 63 relevant papers were collected and 28 papers regarding clinical and experimental researches of acupuncture for endometrial receptivity were included into analysis. It was found that acupuncture and moxibustion could improve endometrial morphology (including the expression of pinopodes, endometrial thickness and the rate of endometrial type A), reduce the endometrial microcirculation (including endometrial pulsatility index, resistance index and hemodynamic index), increase the levels of estrogen and progesterone and the expressions of their receptors, and regulate the expression of molecular biological regulator (such as integrin, leukemia inhibitory factor, vascular endothelial growth factor and HOXA10). As a result, the endometrial receptivity was improved to provide good environment for embryo implantation and improve the pregnancy rate, which had significant advantage in the field of assisted reproductive technology.

A flexible framework allows the use of standard file formats such as Mutation Annotation Format (MAF) or Variant Call Format (VCF), as well as common TXT files. Seshat performs accurate variant annotations using the Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) nomenclature and the stable TP53 genomic reference provided by the Locus Reference Genomic (LRG). In addition, using the 2017 release of the UMD_TP53 database, Seshat provides multiple statistical information for each TP53 variant including database frequency, functional activity, or pathogenicity. The information is delivered in standardized output tables that minimize errors and facilitate comparison of mutational data across studies.

The extensive biological and clinical heterogeneity of MM hinders effective treatment and etiology research. Several molecular classification systems of prognostic impact have been proposed, but they do not predict the response to treatment nor do they correlate to plasma cell development pathways. Here we describe the classification of MM into two distinct subtypes based on the expression levels of a gene module coexpressed with MCL1 (MCL1-M), a regulator of plasma cell survival. The classification system enabled prediction of the prognosis and the response to bortezomib-based therapy. Moreover, the two MM subtypes were associated with two different plasma cell differentiation pathways (enrichment of a preplasmablast signature versus aberrant expression of B cell genes). 1q gain, harboring 63 of the 87 MCL1-M members including MCL1, was found in about 80% of the MM with upregulated MCL1-M expression. Clonal analysis showed that 1q gain tended to occur as an early clonal event. Members of MCL1-M captured both MM cell-intrinsically acting signals and the signals regulating the interaction between MM cells with bone marrow microenvironment. MCL1-M members were co-expressed in mouse germinal center B cells. Together, these findings indicate that MCL1-M may play previously inadequately recognized, initiating role in the pathogenesis of MM. Our findings suggest that MCL1-M signature-based molecular clustering of MM constitutes a solid framework toward understanding the etiology of this disease and establishing personalized care. Article Summary: A pathogenic mechanism-guided molecular classification would facilitate treatment decision and etiology research of multiple myeloma. On the basis of the expression levels of a gene module coexpressed with MCL1, we have established a classification scheme assigning multiple myeloma into two subtypes with distinct prognosis, treatment responses and pathogenic backgrounds.","['Samo, Ayaz Ali', 'Li, Jiuyi', 'Zhou, Min', 'Sun, Yingyu', 'Yang, Yuan', 'Zhang, Yunqiu', 'Li, Jing', 'van Duin, Mark', 'Lu, Xuzhang', 'Fan, Xiaolong']","['Samo AA', 'Li J', 'Zhou M', 'Sun Y', 'Yang Y', 'Zhang Y', 'Li J', 'van Duin M', 'Lu X', 'Fan X']","['School of Life Sciences, Beijing Key Laboratory of Gene Resource and Molecular Development, Laboratory of Neuroscience and Brain Development, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China.', 'School of Life Sciences, Beijing Key Laboratory of Gene Resource and Molecular Development, Laboratory of Neuroscience and Brain Development, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Changzhou No. 3 People's Hospital, Changzhou, China."", 'School of Life Sciences, Beijing Key Laboratory of Gene Resource and Molecular Development, Laboratory of Neuroscience and Brain Development, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China.', 'School of Life Sciences, Beijing Key Laboratory of Gene Resource and Molecular Development, Laboratory of Neuroscience and Brain Development, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China.', 'School of Life Sciences, Beijing Key Laboratory of Gene Resource and Molecular Development, Laboratory of Neuroscience and Brain Development, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China.', 'School of Life Sciences, Yichuang Biotechnology Industry Research Institute, Beijing Yizhuang Biomedical Park, Daxing District, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus MC Cancer Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', ""Department of Hematology, Changzhou No. 2 People's Hospital, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Changzhou, China."", 'School of Life Sciences, Beijing Key Laboratory of Gene Resource and Molecular Development, Laboratory of Neuroscience and Brain Development, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-6612-0465'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (Biomarkers, Pharmacological)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Biomarkers, Pharmacological', 'Bortezomib/administration & dosage', 'Databases, Genetic', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Multiple Myeloma/classification/*drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Plasma Cells/pathology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Proteasome Inhibitors/administration & dosage', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Signal Transduction', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Cytogenetics and Molecular Genetics', '*Gene coexpression module', '*MCL1', '*Multiple Myeloma', '*Plasma Cell Disorders']",2018/04/27 06:00,2018/10/17 06:00,['2018/04/27 06:00'],"['2018/04/04 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/17 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.2 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2018 Aug;57(8):420-429. doi: 10.1002/gcc.2.,"['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prompted by the lack of population-based data on the presentation, characteristics, and necessary workup in children with leukemoid reaction, we searched the database of a tertiary pediatric medical center for all children presented with at least one WBC count of >/= 30,000/muL in 2009-2014. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory parameters were recorded. Children admitted with WBC < 30,000/muL served as controls. Pneumonia was the most common diagnosis in the leukemoid reaction group, with a 5.5-fold higher prevalence of pleuropneumonia than in the control group. The leukemoid group had a longer average hospital stay (7.5 vs. 5.5 days). Patients with WBC >/= 50,000/muL had a sixfold higher rate of leukemia than patients with a lower count. There was a significant association of leukemia with low platelet count, low levels of C-reactive protein, and high levels of uric acid and lactate dehydrogenase. CONCLUSION: Children presented with a leukemoid reaction are at high risk of pneumonia, especially pleuropneumonia, and a long hospital stay. Those with WBC >/= 50,000/muL have a sixfold higher risk of leukemia. For prompt diagnosis, clinicians should be aware of the variables associated with leukemia.

It is classically associated with benign mesenchymal tumors but occasionally has been found in patients with other malignancies. Hypophosphatemia has been associated with acute leukemia but has not previously been reported to be due to inappropriate FGF23 secretion. Here, we describe FGF23-induced severe hypophosphatemia and renal phosphate wasting associated with a mixed-phenotype Philadelphia chromosome-like acute leukemia in a previously healthy 22-year-old man. He was found to have low serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and extremely high FGF23 levels, as well as inappropriate urinary phosphorus excretion. The hypophosphatemia improved with calcitriol and oral phosphate treatment but normalized only during chemotherapy-induced ablation of the blasts.

Since the clinical introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) approximately 15 years ago, patients' concerns have shifted from reduced life expectancy toward long-term toxicities of TKI, depth of remission, and the probability of successful treatment discontinuation. Patients with newly diagnosed CML in chronic phase (at least with a Sokal score not exceeding intermediate) may now expect an almost normal life expectancy. However, even if almost 30% of all newly diagnosed chronic-phase patients might eventually be facing the prospect of a life without CML-specific treatment, based on current knowledge, most, if not all, patients would have to undergo an expected minimum of 5-8 years of TKI treatment and the majority would face a life-long exposure to the side-effects of TKIs. At present, 5 different TKIs are licensed for the treatment of CML, that is, imatinib, which is a first-generation TKI (including its generic derivatives); nilotinib, dasatinib, and bosutinib, which are second-generation TKIs; as well as ponatinib, which is a so-called third-generation TKI and is supposed to be used for patients harboring the T315I-mutation. One of the important, yet unanswered questions is the choice of the best possible TKI upfront for each individual patient. Bosutinib is currently licensed for patients with CML after failure or intolerance of at least 2 other TKIs. It can also be prescribed according to label if after failure of the first TKI therapy, another option does not seem feasible. This review focuses on the existing data on clinical efficacy, tolerability, and side effects of bosutinib treatment in CML patients with the aim to identify patient characteristics and treatment scenarios most suitable for treatment with bosutinib.","['Isfort, Susanne', 'Brummendorf, Tim H']","['Isfort S', 'Brummendorf TH']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Medical Faculty, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Center for Translational and Clinical Research Aachen (CTC-A), Medical Faculty at the RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Medical Faculty, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180410,New Zealand,J Blood Med,Journal of blood medicine,101550884,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['individual comorbidity profile', 'side effect profile', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",2018/04/27 06:00,2018/04/27 06:01,['2018/04/27 06:00'],"['2018/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/27 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/JBM.S129821 [doi]', 'jbm-9-043 [pii]']",epublish,J Blood Med. 2018 Apr 10;9:43-50. doi: 10.2147/JBM.S129821. eCollection 2018.,,,,PMC5905837,,,"['Disclosure SI received Honoraria (Advisory boards, lectures) from BMS, Novartis,', 'Pfizer, Ariad (meanwhile Incyte) and travel grants from Roche, Mundipharma,', 'Amgen, Hexal, Pfizer and Novartis.

In previous studies of acute myeloid leukemia miR-9 overexpression was commonly observed. Here, we show that ectopic expression of miR-9 in vitro and in vivo significantly blocks differentiation of erythroid progenitor cells with an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Consistent with this observation, ROS scavenging enzymes, including superoxide dismutase (Sod2), Catalase (Cat), and glutathine peroxidase (Gpx1), are down-regulated by miR-9. In addition, miR-9 suppresses expression of the erythroid transcriptional regulator FoxO3, and its down-stream targets Btg1 and Cited 2 in erythroid progenitor cells, while expression of a constitutively active form of FoxO3 (FoxO3-3A) reverses miR-9-induced suppression of erythroid differentiation, and inhibits miR-9-induced ROS production. Thus, our findings indicate that aberrant expression of miR-9 blocks erythropoiesis by deregulating FoxO3-mediated pathways, which may contribute to the ineffective erythropoiesis observed in patients with hematological malignancies.","['Zhang, Yunyuan', 'Li, Liping', 'Yu, Chunjie', 'Senyuk, Vitalyi', 'Li, Fuxing', 'Quigley, John G', 'Zhu, Tongyu', 'Qian, Zhijian']","['Zhang Y', 'Li L', 'Yu C', 'Senyuk V', 'Li F', 'Quigley JG', 'Zhu T', 'Qian Z']","['Department of Clinical laboratory, The Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University Medical College, Qingdao, 266003, China.', 'Department of Medicine and Cancer Research Center, University of Illinois Hospital and Health Sciences System, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Medicine and Cancer Research Center, University of Illinois Hospital and Health Sciences System, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Fudan University ZhongShan Hospital, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Medicine and Cancer Research Center, University of Illinois Hospital and Health Sciences System, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Medicine and Cancer Research Center, University of Illinois Hospital and Health Sciences System, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Medicine and Cancer Research Center, University of Illinois Hospital and Health Sciences System, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Tongji Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Medicine and Cancer Research Center, University of Illinois Hospital and Health Sciences System, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Fudan University ZhongShan Hospital, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Medicine and Cancer Research Center, University of Illinois Hospital and Health Sciences System, Chicago, IL, USA. zjqian@uic.edu.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180425,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (FOXO3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Box Protein O3)', '0 (MIRN92 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'EC 1.11.1.- (glutathione peroxidase GPX1)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'EC 1.11.1.9 (Glutathione Peroxidase)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Catalase/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Erythroid Cells/metabolism', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/metabolism', 'Erythropoiesis/*genetics', 'Forkhead Box Protein O3/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation/genetics', 'Glutathione Peroxidase/genetics', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Superoxide Dismutase/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics', 'Transcriptional Activation/genetics', 'Up-Regulation/*genetics']",,,2018/04/27 06:00,2019/10/08 06:00,['2018/04/27 06:00'],"['2017/11/21 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-018-24628-0 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-018-24628-0 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2018 Apr 25;8(1):6519. doi: 10.1038/s41598-018-24628-0.,,,"['R01 HL131444/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA140979/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC5916915,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conventional cell cultures lack the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the bone marrow (BM), the extracellular matrix and stromal components which are crucial for the growth and survival of leukaemia stem cells. To accurately predict the sensitivity of the leukaemia cells in an in vitro assay a culturing system containing the essential components of BM is required. In this study, we developed a porous calcium alginate foam-based scaffold to be used for 3D culture. The new 3D culture was shown to be cell compatible as it supported the proliferation of both normal haematopoietic and leukaemia cells. Our cell differential assay for myeloid markers showed that the porous foam-based 3D culture enhanced myeloid differentiation in both leukaemia and normal haematopoietic cells compared to two-dimensional culture. The foam-based scaffold reduced the sensitivity of the leukaemia cells to the tested antileukaemia agents in K562 and HL60 leukaemia cell line model and also primary myeloid leukaemia cells. This observation supports the application of calcium alginate foams as scaffold components of the 3D cultures for investigation of sensitivity to antileukaemia agents in primary myeloid cells.","['Karimpoor, Mahroo', 'Yebra-Fernandez, Eva', 'Parhizkar, Maryam', 'Orlu, Mine', 'Craig, Duncan', 'Khorashad, Jamshid S', 'Edirisinghe, Mohan']","['Karimpoor M', 'Yebra-Fernandez E', 'Parhizkar M', 'Orlu M', 'Craig D', 'Khorashad JS', 'Edirisinghe M']","['Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London, Torrington Place, London WC1E 7JE, UK.', 'Centre for Haematology, Department of Medicine, Imperial College, Hammersmith Hospital, Du Cane Road, London W12 0NN, UK.', 'School of Pharmacy, University College London, 29-39 Brunswick Square, London WC1N 1AX, UK.', 'Molecular Pathology, North West London Pathology, Hammersmith Hospital, London, W12 0HS, UK.', 'Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London, Torrington Place, London WC1E 7JE, UK.', 'School of Pharmacy, University College London, 29-39 Brunswick Square, London WC1N 1AX, UK.', 'School of Pharmacy, University College London, 29-39 Brunswick Square, London WC1N 1AX, UK.', 'Centre for Haematology, Department of Medicine, Imperial College, Hammersmith Hospital, Du Cane Road, London W12 0NN, UK.', 'Molecular Pathology, North West London Pathology, Hammersmith Hospital, London, W12 0HS, UK.', 'Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London, Torrington Place, London WC1E 7JE, UK m.edirisinghe@ucl.ac.uk.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-6030-7309', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8258-7914']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J R Soc Interface,"Journal of the Royal Society, Interface",101217269,"['0 (Alginates)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['*Alginates', '*Cell Culture Techniques', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia', 'Tumor Microenvironment']",['NOTNLM'],"['*culture, drug resistance', '*leukaemia', '*scaffold', '*three dimensional']",2018/04/27 06:00,2019/09/26 06:00,['2018/04/27 06:00'],"['2017/12/10 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/26 06:00 [medline]']","['rsif.2017.0928 [pii]', '10.1098/rsif.2017.0928 [doi]']",ppublish,J R Soc Interface. 2018 Apr;15(141). pii: rsif.2017.0928. doi: 10.1098/rsif.2017.0928.,['(c) 2018 The Author(s).'],,,PMC5938583,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Par-4 induces apoptosis selectively in various types of cancer cells but not normal cells. We found that chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells from human patients and from Emicro-Tcl1 mice constitutively express Par-4 in greater amounts than normal B-1 or B-2 cells. Interestingly, knockdown of Par-4 in human CLL-derived Mec-1 cells results in a robust increase in p21/WAF1 expression and decreased growth due to delayed G1-to-S cell-cycle transition. Lack of Par-4 also increased the expression of p21 and delayed CLL growth in Emu-Tcl1 mice. Par-4 expression in CLL cells required constitutively active B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling, as inhibition of BCR signaling with US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs caused a decrease in Par-4 messenger RNA and protein, and an increase in apoptosis. In particular, activities of Lyn, a Src family kinase, spleen tyrosine kinase, and Bruton tyrosine kinase are required for Par-4 expression in CLL cells, suggesting a novel regulation of Par-4 through BCR signaling. Together, these results suggest that Par-4 may play a novel progrowth rather than proapoptotic role in CLL and could be targeted to enhance the therapeutic effects of BCR-signaling inhibitors.","['McKenna, Mary K', 'Noothi, Sunil K', 'Alhakeem, Sara S', 'Oben, Karine Z', 'Greene, Joseph T', 'Mani, Rajeswaran', 'Perry, Kathryn L', 'Collard, James P', 'Rivas, Jacqueline R', 'Hildebrandt, Gerhard C', 'Fleischman, Roger A', 'Durbin, Eric B', 'Byrd, John C', 'Wang, Chi', 'Muthusamy, Natarajan', 'Rangnekar, Vivek M', 'Bondada, Subbarao']","['McKenna MK', 'Noothi SK', 'Alhakeem SS', 'Oben KZ', 'Greene JT', 'Mani R', 'Perry KL', 'Collard JP', 'Rivas JR', 'Hildebrandt GC', 'Fleischman RA', 'Durbin EB', 'Byrd JC', 'Wang C', 'Muthusamy N', 'Rangnekar VM', 'Bondada S']","['Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular Genetics.', 'Markey Cancer Center, and.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular Genetics.', 'Markey Cancer Center, and.', 'Department of Radiation Medicine, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular Genetics.', 'Markey Cancer Center, and.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular Genetics.', 'Markey Cancer Center, and.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH; and.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH; and.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular Genetics.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular Genetics.', 'Markey Cancer Center, and.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular Genetics.', 'Markey Cancer Center, and.', 'Markey Cancer Center, and.', 'Division of Hematology and Blood & Marrow Transplantation, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY.', 'Markey Cancer Center, and.', 'Division of Hematology and Blood & Marrow Transplantation, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY.', 'Markey Cancer Center, and.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH; and.', 'Markey Cancer Center, and.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH; and.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular Genetics.', 'Markey Cancer Center, and.', 'Department of Radiation Medicine, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular Genetics.', 'Markey Cancer Center, and.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-2357-1733', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0381-0864', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1644-1164', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0195-7253', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4930-7188', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3949-1604', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5600-7645', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1467-9769']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20180425,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (prostate apoptosis response-4 protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Deletion', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Up-Regulation']",,,2018/04/27 06:00,2019/07/16 06:00,['2018/04/27 06:00'],"['2017/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/16 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)32120-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2017-10-813931 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2018 Jun 28;131(26):2943-2954. doi: 10.1182/blood-2017-10-813931.

Like human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Gag, human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) has a structurally conserved capsid (CA) domain, including a beta-hairpin turn and a centralized coiled-coil-like structure of six alpha helices in the CA amino-terminal domain (NTD), as well as four alpha-helices in the CA carboxy-terminal domain (CTD). CA drives Gag oligomerization, which is critical for both immature Gag lattice formation and particle production. The HIV-1 CA CTD has previously been shown to be a primary determinant for CA-CA interactions, and while both the HTLV-1 CA NTD and CTD have been implicated in Gag-Gag interactions, our recent observations have implicated the HTLV-1 CA NTD as encoding key determinants that dictate particle morphology. Here, we have conducted alanine-scanning mutagenesis in the HTLV-1 CA NTD nucleotide-encoding sequences spanning the loop regions and amino acids at the beginning and ends of alpha-helices due to their structural dissimilarity from the HIV-1 CA NTD structure. We analyzed both Gag subcellular distribution and efficiency of particle production for these mutants. We discovered several important residues (i.e., M17, Q47/F48, and Y61). Modeling implicated that these residues reside at the dimer interface (i.e., M17 and Y61) or at the trimer interface (i.e., Q47/F48). Taken together, these observations highlight the critical role of the HTLV-1 CA NTD in Gag-Gag interactions and particle assembly, which is, to the best of our knowledge, in contrast to HIV-1 and other retroviruses.IMPORTANCE Retrovirus particle assembly and release from infected cells is driven by the Gag structural protein. Gag-Gag interactions, which form an oligomeric lattice structure at a particle budding site, are essential to the biogenesis of an infectious virus particle. The CA domain of Gag is generally thought to possess the key determinants for Gag-Gag interactions, and the present study has discovered several critical amino acid residues in the CA domain of HTLV-1 Gag, an important cancer-causing human retrovirus, which are distinct from that of HIV-1 as well as other retroviruses studied to date. Altogether, our results provide important new insights into a poorly understood aspect of HTLV-1 replication that significantly enhances our understanding of the molecular nature of Gag-Gag interaction determinants crucial for virus particle assembly.","['Martin, Jessica L', 'Mendonca, Luiza M', 'Marusinec, Rachel', 'Zuczek, Jennifer', 'Angert, Isaac', 'Blower, Ruth J', 'Mueller, Joachim D', 'Perilla, Juan R', 'Zhang, Wei', 'Mansky, Louis M']","['Martin JL', 'Mendonca LM', 'Marusinec R', 'Zuczek J', 'Angert I', 'Blower RJ', 'Mueller JD', 'Perilla JR', 'Zhang W', 'Mansky LM']","['Institute for Molecular Virology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', 'Pharmacology Graduate Program, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', 'Institute for Molecular Virology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', 'Division of Basic Sciences, School of Dentistry, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', 'Institute for Molecular Virology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry, University of Delaware, Newark, Delaware, USA.', 'Institute for Molecular Virology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', 'School of Physics & Astronomy, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', 'Institute for Molecular Virology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', 'Division of Basic Sciences, School of Dentistry, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', 'Institute for Molecular Virology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', 'School of Physics & Astronomy, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry, University of Delaware, Newark, Delaware, USA.', 'Institute for Molecular Virology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', 'Division of Basic Sciences, School of Dentistry, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', 'Characterization Facility, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', 'Institute for Molecular Virology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA mansky@umn.edu.', 'Pharmacology Graduate Program, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', 'Division of Basic Sciences, School of Dentistry, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', 'Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2391-1061'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20180629,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Capsid Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (gag Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', '0 (p19 protein, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1)']",IM,"['Capsid/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Capsid Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Gene Products, gag/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'HTLV-I Infections/metabolism/*virology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/physiology', 'Humans', 'Models, Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Protein Domains', 'Virion/*pathogenicity', '*Virus Assembly', 'gag Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Gag', '*deltaretrovirus', '*lentiviruses', '*morphology', '*oligomerization', '*retrovirus', '*virus assembly']",2018/04/27 06:00,2018/07/25 06:00,['2018/04/27 06:00'],"['2018/02/27 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/25 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.00333-18 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00333-18 [doi]']",epublish,J Virol. 2018 Jun 29;92(14). pii: JVI.00333-18. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00333-18.

NK cell function involves interactions of their killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I on target cells, and the avidity of KIR-HLA interactions depends on the combination of KIR and HLA alleles. We hypothesized that KIR and HLA polymorphisms may influence response to TKIs. KIR and HLA allele genotyping was performed by next-generation sequencing for 76 CML cases, and association with clinical outcome was analyzed. Second-generation TKIs as first-line therapy and patients' sex (female) were strongly associated with achievement of complete molecular response (CMR: MR(4.0)) after 2 years (P < 0.001 and P = 0.002, respectively). After adjustment for these two characteristics, several KIR alleles remained associated with achievement of MR(4.0): KIR2DL4*005/011 or *008 (HR = 1.797, P = 0.032); KIR2DS4*003 or *007/010 (HR = 3.348, P < 0.001); KIR3DL1*005 (HR = 2.746, P = 0.003); and KIR3DL2*009 or *010 [HR = 1.980 (1.109-3.524), P = 0.021]. Strong linkage among these alleles exists, implying that they comprise favorable KIR allele haplotypes. Allelic polymorphisms of KIR3DL1 and HLA-B determine their differential avidity into strong/weak or no interaction. Patients carrying noninteracting KIR3DL1 and HLA-B allele pairs achieved better outcomes than those with strongly interacting pairs, and KIR3DL1*005 associated with a positive outcome among patients with weak-interacting pairs. Thus, KIR3DL1*005 and its associated haplotypes associated with superior TKI therapeutic effects. The combinations of these KIR and HLA alleles may correlate with potent NK cell immunity against CML.

Few reports have been found in the literature connecting their phenolic composition and biological activities. In this regard, we have profiled the main phenolic constituents of Myrcia spp. leaves extracts by ESI(-)Q-TOF-MS. The main constituents found were ellagic acid (M. bella), galloyl glucose isomers (M. guianensis) and hexahydroxydiphenic (HHDP) acid derivatives (M. fallax). In addition, quercetin and myricetin derivatives were also found in all Myrcia spp. extracts. The most promising antioxidant activity, measured by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging activity, was found for M. fallax extracts (EC50 8.61 +/- 0.22 microg.mL(-1)), being slightly less active than quercetin and gallic acid (EC50 2.96 +/- 0.17 and 2.03 +/- 0.02 microg.mL(-1), respectively).

Targeted therapies directed against chromatin regulators are emerging as promising approaches in preclinical studies and early clinical trials. Here, we demonstrate an oncogenic role for the protein lysine methyltransferase SETDB2 in leukemia pathogenesis. It is overexpressed in pre-BCR(+) ALL and required for their maintenance in vitro and in vivo. SETDB2 expression is maintained as a direct target gene of the chimeric transcription factor E2A-PBX1 in a subset of ALL and suppresses expression of the cell-cycle inhibitor CDKN2C through histone H3K9 tri-methylation, thus establishing an oncogenic pathway subordinate to E2A-PBX1 that silences a major tumor suppressor in ALL. In contrast, SETDB2 was relatively dispensable for normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell proliferation. SETDB2 knockdown enhances sensitivity to kinase and chromatin inhibitors, providing a mechanistic rationale for targeting SETDB2 therapeutically in ALL.","['Lin, Chiou-Hong', 'Wong, Stephen Hon-Kit', 'Kurzer, Jason H', 'Schneidawind, Corina', 'Wei, Michael C', 'Duque-Afonso, Jesus', 'Jeong, Johan', 'Feng, Xuhui', 'Cleary, Michael L']","['Lin CH', 'Wong SH', 'Kurzer JH', 'Schneidawind C', 'Wei MC', 'Duque-Afonso J', 'Jeong J', 'Feng X', 'Cleary ML']","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.

There are many factors that might play a part, including the different BCR-ABL1 transcript types at baseline. The current study was performed to determine the possible impact of different transcripts on the treatment responses and outcomes of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia who are receiving TKI therapy. The authors performed a systematic literature search by using the terms ""b2a2/b3a2,"" ""e13a2/e14a2,"" or ""transcript type."" e14a2 was the more common transcript type. The majority of the studies demonstrated no significant difference regarding age, sex, leukocyte counts, and hemoglobin levels between patients with the e13a2 and e14a2 transcripts. However, in approximately one-half of the studies, the e14a2 transcript was associated with higher platelet counts. Almost no studies demonstrated a significant association between disease risk scores and transcript types. In the majority of studies, having the e14a2 transcript was associated with earlier, deeper, and higher molecular response rates. Although better event-free survival was observed in patients with the e14a2 transcript in some of the studies, the majority demonstrated that transcript type did not have an impact on progression-free and overall survival. Treatment-free remission currently is a topic of much interest, and to the authors' knowledge there are limited data with conflicting results regarding the possible effects of transcript types on the outcomes of patients after discontinuation of TKIs. Because having the e14a2 transcript appears to be related to a favorable outcome, choosing second-generation TKIs for frontline therapy might be a convenient approach in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia with the e13a2 transcript. The authors believe this finding warrants further investigation.","['Ercaliskan, Abdulkadir', 'Eskazan, A Emre']","['Ercaliskan A', 'Eskazan AE']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Marmara University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Cerrahpasa Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey.']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-9568-0894'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Systematic Review']",20180425,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', '0 (Biomarkers, Pharmacological)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Pharmacological/metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/classification/*genetics/immunology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/classification/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Isoforms/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/immunology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'RNA, Messenger/classification/genetics', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['*BCR-ABL1', '*chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)', '*e13a2', '*e14a2', '*response', '*transcript', '*tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)']",2018/04/26 06:00,2019/09/24 06:00,['2018/04/26 06:00'],"['2017/12/28 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/09 00:00 [revised]', '2018/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/24 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.31408 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2018 Oct 1;124(19):3806-3818. doi: 10.1002/cncr.31408.

However, the long-term treatment efficacy remains uncertain. Here, we report a final analysis of the JALSG Ph+ALL202 study. The outcomes were compared with those of the JALSG ALL93 and ALL97 studies, which were conducted in the pre-imatinib era. Ninety-nine newly diagnosed Ph+ALL patients were enrolled in Ph+ALL202 (median age, 45 years; median follow-up, 4.5 years). CR was achieved in 96/99 (97%) patients. Fifty-nine of these 96 patients (61%) underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) in their first CR (CR1). The 5-year overall and disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 50 and 43%, respectively, which were significantly higher compared to those in the pre-imatinib era (15 and 19%, respectively). Multivariate analysis revealed that imatinib administration, allo-HSCT in CR1, and a white blood cell count < 30 x 10(9)/L were favorable independent prognostic factors for long-term DFS. Improved odds of receiving allo-HSCT and a lower relapse rate leaded to good long-term outcomes. The 3-year DFS tended to be higher in PCR-negative than that in PCR-positive patients (29 vs. 14%) in the non-HSCT patients, and this tendency was also seen in the allo-HSCT patients (59 vs. 50%). The higher rate of CR upon imatinib use may have contributed to these improvements.","['Hatta, Yoshihiro', 'Mizuta, Shuichi', 'Matsuo, Keitaro', 'Ohtake, Shigeki', 'Iwanaga, Masako', 'Sugiura, Isamu', 'Doki, Noriko', 'Kanamori, Heiwa', 'Ueda, Yasunori', 'Yoshida, Chikamasa', 'Dobashi, Nobuaki', 'Maeda, Tomoya', 'Yujiri, Toshiaki', 'Monma, Fumihiko', 'Ito, Yoshikazu', 'Hayakawa, Fumihiko', 'Takeuchi, Jin', 'Kiyoi, Hitoshi', 'Miyazaki, Yasushi', 'Naoe, Tomoki']","['Hatta Y', 'Mizuta S', 'Matsuo K', 'Ohtake S', 'Iwanaga M', 'Sugiura I', 'Doki N', 'Kanamori H', 'Ueda Y', 'Yoshida C', 'Dobashi N', 'Maeda T', 'Yujiri T', 'Monma F', 'Ito Y', 'Hayakawa F', 'Takeuchi J', 'Kiyoi H', 'Miyazaki Y', 'Naoe T']","['Division of Hematology & Rheumatology, Nihon University School of Medicine, 30-1 Oyaguchi, Itabashi-ku, Tokyo, 173-8617, Japan. hatta.yoshihiro@nihon-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Toyohashi Medical Center, Toyohashi, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular Medicine, Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory Science, Kanazawa University Graduate School of Medical Science, Kanazawa, Japan.', 'Department of Frontier Life Science, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Toyohashi Municipal Hospital, Toyohashi, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center, Komagome Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Kanagawa Cancer Center, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Kurashiki Central Hospital, Kurashiki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, National Hospital Organization Minami-Okayama Medical Center, Hayashima, Japan.', 'Division of Clinical Oncology and Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Jikei University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hemato-Oncology, Saitama International Medical Center, Saitama Medical University, Saitama, Japan.', 'Third Department of Internal Medicine, Yamaguchi University School of Medicine, Ube, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, Tsu, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Tokyo Medical University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Dpartment of Hematology, Meirikai Chuo Genral Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Atomic Bomb Disease Institute, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center, Nagoya, Japan.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0457-4015'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180424,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cohort Studies', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/therapeutic use', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/mortality/therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'Imatinib', 'Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia']",2018/04/26 06:00,2018/08/29 06:00,['2018/04/26 06:00'],"['2017/07/26 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/29 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-018-3323-8 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-018-3323-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2018 Sep;97(9):1535-1545. doi: 10.1007/s00277-018-3323-8.

METHODS: A systematic literature review, per Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses, identified six studies reporting the incidence and locations of SNs for 1,114 patients with MB, after CSI, with a median follow-up of approximately 9 years (7.6-15.4 years). The study-specific cumulative incidence (CI) of SNs, second benign neoplasms (SBNs), and second malignant neoplasms (SMNs) were standardized to a 10-year time frame. Meta-analysis was performed using random effects models, with pooled data from selected studies and an institutional cohort of 55 patients. RESULTS: The 10-year CI was 6.1% for all SNs (excluding skin cancer and leukemia), 3.1% for SBNs, and 3.7% for SMNs. Fifty-eight percent of SNs were malignant; high-grade glioma was the most common SMN (15/33; 45%) and meningioma, the most common SBN (16/24; 67%). Forty percent of SNs occurred outside the target central nervous system (CNS) field, with a majority in areas of exit RT dose. Seventy-four percent of extra-CNS tumors (17/23) were malignant, most commonly thyroid carcinoma (7/17; 41%) and bone and soft-tissue tumors (6/17, 35%). CONCLUSIONS: Survivors of MB are at risk of SNs both within and outside the CNS. A significant proportion of SNs occur in areas of exit RT dose. Studies are needed to determine whether the use of proton therapy, which has no exit RT dose, is associated with a lower incidence of SNs.","['Bavle, Abhishek', 'Tewari, Sayani', 'Sisson, Amy', 'Chintagumpala, Murali', 'Anderson, Michael', 'Paulino, Arnold C']","['Bavle A', 'Tewari S', 'Sisson A', 'Chintagumpala M', 'Anderson M', 'Paulino AC']","['Jimmy Everest Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.', 'University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.', 'Jimmy Everest Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.', 'University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.', 'The Texas Medical Center Library, Houston, Texas.', 'Section of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', ""Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, Texas."", 'University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-9927-8106', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0269-3045']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Systematic Review']",20180425,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Cerebellar Neoplasms/*radiotherapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Craniospinal Irradiation/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Medulloblastoma/*radiotherapy', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Proton Therapy/adverse effects']",['NOTNLM'],"['*craniospinal irradiation', '*medulloblastoma', '*photon radiation', '*second neoplasms']",2018/04/26 06:00,2019/05/11 06:00,['2018/04/26 06:00'],"['2018/02/17 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/08 00:00 [revised]', '2018/03/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/11 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.27095 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2018 Aug;65(8):e27095. doi: 10.1002/pbc.27095.

The present study was investigated PP2A mediates JS-K-induced apoptosis by affecting Bcl-2 family protein. JS-K showed diverse inhibitory effects in five HCC cell lines, especially HepG2 cells. JS-K caused a dose- and time-dependent reduction in cell viability and increased in levels of LDH release. Meanwhile, JS-K- induced apoptosis was characterized by mitochondrial membrane potential reduction, Hoechst 33342(+) /PI(+) dual staining, release of cytochrome c (Cyt c), and activation of cleaved caspase-9/3. Moreover, JS-K-treatment could lead to the activation of protein phosphatase 2A-C (PP2A-C), decrease of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family-protein expression including p-Bcl-2 (Ser70), Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1 as well as the increase of pro-apoptosis Bcl-2 family-protein including Bim, Bad, Bax, and Bak. Furthermore, JS-K caused a marked increase of intracellular NO levels while pre-treatment with Carboxy-PTIO (a NO scavenger) reduced the cytotoxicity effects and the apoptosis rate. Meanwhile, pre-treatment with Carboxy-PTIO attenuated the JS-K-induced up-regulation of PP2A, Cyt c, and cleaved-caspase-9/3 activation. The silencing PP2A-C by siRNA could abolish the activation of PP2A-C, down-regulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family-protein (p-Bcl-2, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1), increase of pro-apoptosis Bcl-2 family-protein (Bim, Bad, Bax, and Bak) and apoptotic-related protein (Cyt c, cleaved caspase-9/3) that were caused by JS-K in HepG2 cells. In addition, pre-treatment with OA (a PP2A inhibitor) also attenuated the above effects induced by JS-K. In summary, NO release from JS-K induces apoptosis through PP2A activation, which contributed to the regulation of Bcl-2 family proteins.","['Liu, Ling', 'Huang, Zile', 'Chen, Jingjing', 'Wang, Jiangang', 'Wang, Shuying']","['Liu L', 'Huang Z', 'Chen J', 'Wang J', 'Wang S']","['Department of Pharmacy, Medical College, Henan University of Science and Technology, Luoyang, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Medical College, Henan University of Science and Technology, Luoyang, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Medical College, Henan University of Science and Technology, Luoyang, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Medical College, Henan University of Science and Technology, Luoyang, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Medical College, Henan University of Science and Technology, Luoyang, China.']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-3043-6676'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180425,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Azo Compounds)', '0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (O(2)-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)', '1-((4-ethoxycarbonyl)piperazin-1-yl)diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 2)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Azo Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Phosphatase 2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'bcl-X Protein/biosynthesis/genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*JS-K', '*apoptosis', '*hepatocellular carcinoma', '*nitric oxide', '*protein phosphatase 2A']",2018/04/26 06:00,2019/05/17 06:00,['2018/04/26 06:00'],"['2017/10/09 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/17 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.26845 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2018 Aug;119(8):6633-6643. doi: 10.1002/jcb.26845.

Based on recent studies, ALL is a disease that appears to be associated with significant risk for IFIs. The pharmacokinetic interactions between azoles and vincristine, an antineoplastic agent that is part of modern combination chemotherapies in ALL, results in clinically significant neurotoxicity that makes the use of azoles problematic. However, a number of questions regarding azole-vincristine interactions remain unanswered. In this viewpoint, we call for a renewed interest in antifungal prophylaxis studies in ALL in view of the availability of several non-azole novel antifungal agents that are under preclinical and/or clinical development.

Analytes on the DBS card were extracted using 90% methanol with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) as an internal standard. Analytical separation was performed on a Waters Acquity(&reg;) UPLC BEH AMIDA column of 1.7 &mu;m (2.1 &times; 100 mm) with a mobile phase mixture of 0.2% formic acid in water and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile-methanol, with gradient elution and a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min. Mass detection of 6-MP, 6-MMP, 6-TGMP, and 5-FU showed m/z values of 153.09 > 119.09, 167.17 > 126.03, 380.16 > 168.00, and 129.09 > 42.05, respectively. This DBS method had a run time of 5 min and yielded a linear calibration curve over a range of 25.5(-)1020 ng/mL for 6-MP, 6-MMP, and 6-TGMP. Analyte analysis in 22 of 24 ALL patients showed that the measured value of 6-TGMP as an active metabolite was in the range of 29(-)429 pmol/8 &times; 10(8) erythrocytes.

METHODS: The circPVT1 level was detected by qRT-PCR and western blot. The apoptotic cells were examined by the annexin V assay in lentiviral shRNA knockdown cells. RESULTS: circPVT1 was highly expressed in ALL compared with normal bone marrow samples. circPVT1 expression was also significantly higher in ALL cell lines. circPVT1 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis through suppression of its neighbor gene c-Myc, and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein expression. CONCLUSION: circPVT1 is upregulated in ALL. Silencing circPVT1 results in cell growth arrest and apoptosis of the cells. Our results also suggested a therapeutic potential of targeting circPVT1 in ALL.","['Hu, Jiaojiao', 'Han, Qi', 'Gu, Yan', 'Ma, Jinlong', 'McGrath, Mary', 'Qiao, Fengchang', 'Chen, Baoan', 'Song, Chunhua', 'Ge, Zheng']","['Hu J', 'Han Q', 'Gu Y', 'Ma J', 'McGrath M', 'Qiao F', 'Chen B', 'Song C', 'Ge Z']","['Department of Hematology, Zhongda Hospital, Medical School of Southeast University, Nanjing 210009, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongda Hospital, Medical School of Southeast University, Nanjing 210009, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongda Hospital, Medical School of Southeast University, Nanjing 210009, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pennsylvania State University Medical College, Hershey, PA 17033, USA.', 'Department of Prenatal Diagnosis, State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Medicine, Obstetrics & Gynecology Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210004, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongda Hospital, Medical School of Southeast University, Nanjing 210009, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pennsylvania State University Medical College, Hershey, PA 17033, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongda Hospital, Medical School of Southeast University, Nanjing 210009, China.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180425,England,Epigenomics,Epigenomics,101519720,"['0 (PVT1 long-non-coding RNA, human)', '0 (RNA, Circular)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', '*RNA', 'RNA, Circular', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*genetics/metabolism', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Bcl-2', '*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*c-Myc', '*circPVT1']",2018/04/26 06:00,2019/03/23 06:00,['2018/04/26 06:00'],"['2018/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/23 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.2217/epi-2017-0142 [doi]'],ppublish,Epigenomics. 2018 Jun;10(6):723-732. doi: 10.2217/epi-2017-0142.

Analysis of the proteomic profile of saliva may allow for the selection of potential marker of preterm delivery in humans. Saliva samples were collected from 12 patients diagnosed with threatened preterm delivery and 10 controls with uncomplicated pregnancies at the same gestational age. Samples were analysed using 2D electrophoresis. Based on statistical analysis, spots of interest were selected and collected from gels. Subsequently, spots were decoloured and proteins were identified by mass spectrometry using the matrix assisted laser desorption ionizationtime of flight technique. The results of identification were compared with the SwissProt database. A total of 1,393 spots were detected in the present study with 59 significantly different between control and preterm samples. Increased intensity of staining of 32 spots was observed in the premature delivery group compared with control patients and 27 spots were stained more intensely in the control group compared with the premature delivery group. A total of nine spots, which were significantly different between examined samples were identified and three of them exhibited increased intensity of staining in premature delivery group compared with controls, including dedicator of cytokinesis protein 1, metallothionein2, guanylyl cyclaseactivating protein 1. The six remaining spots included, epithelialstromal interaction protein 1, serum albumin, tyrosinetRNA ligase, cytoplasmic, protein chibby homolog 3, leukemia inhibitory factor receptor and adenosylhomocysteinase 3, and exhibited increased intensity of staining in healthy controls compared with premature delivery group. Further studies with an increased number of patients and identification of the complete protein profile are required to confirm the results of the present study and applicability of saliva as a source of disease biomarkers.","['Lopucki, Maciej', 'Wawrzykowski, Jacek', 'Geca, Tomasz', 'Miturski, Andrzej', 'Franczyk, Monika', 'Kankofer, Marta']","['Lopucki M', 'Wawrzykowski J', 'Geca T', 'Miturski A', 'Franczyk M', 'Kankofer M']","['Department of Gynaecological Oncology and Gynaecology, Medical University of Lublin, 20081 Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Life Sciences in Lublin, 20033 Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Pathology of Pregnancy, Medical University of Lublin, 20081 Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Pathology of Pregnancy, Medical University of Lublin, 20081 Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Life Sciences in Lublin, 20033 Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Life Sciences in Lublin, 20033 Lublin, Poland.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180420,Greece,Mol Med Rep,Molecular medicine reports,101475259,['0 (Proteome)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Obstetric Labor, Premature', 'Pregnancy', '*Proteome', '*Proteomics/methods', 'Saliva/*metabolism', 'Young Adult']",,,2018/04/26 06:00,2018/09/27 06:00,['2018/04/26 06:00'],"['2017/10/18 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/27 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.3892/mmr.2018.8909 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Med Rep. 2018 Jun;17(6):8253-8259. doi: 10.3892/mmr.2018.8909.

Most of these studied extracts were obtained from sea anemones or jellyfish. The present study aimed to determine the toxic activity and assess the antitumor and antiparasitic potential of Palythoa caribaeorum venom by evaluating its in vitro toxicity on several models including human tumor cell lines and against the parasite Giardia intestinalis. Methods: The presence of cytolysins and vasoconstrictor activity of P. caribaeorum venom were determined by hemolysis, PLA2 and isolated rat aortic ring assays, respectively. The cytotoxic effect was tested on HCT-15 (human colorectal adenocarcinoma), MCF-7 (human mammary adenocarcinoma), K562 (human chronic myelogenous leukemia), U251 (human glyoblastoma), PC-3 (human prostatic adenocarcinoma) and SKLU-1 (human lung adenocarcinoma). An in vivo toxicity assay was performed with crickets and the antiparasitic assay was performed against G. intestinalis at 24 h of incubation. Results: P. caribaeorum venom produced hemolytic and PLA2 activity and showed specific cytotoxicity against U251 and SKLU-1 cell lines, with approximately 50% growing inhibition. The venom was toxic to insects and showed activity against G. intestinalis in a dose-dependent manner by possibly altering its membrane osmotic equilibrium. Conclusion: These results suggest that P. caribaeorum venom contains compounds with potential therapeutic value against microorganisms and cancer.","['Lazcano-Perez, Fernando', 'Zavala-Moreno, Ariana', 'Rufino-Gonzalez, Yadira', 'Ponce-Macotela, Martha', 'Garcia-Arredondo, Alejandro', 'Cuevas-Cruz, Miguel', 'Gomez-Manzo, Saul', 'Marcial-Quino, Jaime', 'Arreguin-Lozano, Barbarin', 'Arreguin-Espinosa, Roberto']","['Lazcano-Perez F', 'Zavala-Moreno A', 'Rufino-Gonzalez Y', 'Ponce-Macotela M', 'Garcia-Arredondo A', 'Cuevas-Cruz M', 'Gomez-Manzo S', 'Marcial-Quino J', 'Arreguin-Lozano B', 'Arreguin-Espinosa R']","['1Departamento de Quimica de Biomacromoleculas, Instituto de Quimica, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Av.

Yet, current DC vaccines do not encompass the ideal stimulatory triggers for innate gamma delta (gammadelta) T cell anti-tumor activity. Promoting type 1 cytotoxic gammadelta T cells in patients with AML is, however, most interesting, considering these unconventional T cells are primed for rapid function and exert meaningful control over AML. In this work, we demonstrate that interleukin (IL)-15 DCs have the capacity to enhance the anti-tumoral functions of gammadelta T cells. IL-15 DCs of healthy donors and of AML patients in remission induce the upregulation of cytotoxicity-associated and co-stimulatory molecules on the gammadelta T cell surface, but not of co-inhibitory molecules, incite gammadelta T cell proliferation and stimulate their interferon-gamma production in the presence of blood cancer cells and phosphoantigens. Moreover, the innate cytotoxic capacity of gammadelta T cells is significantly enhanced upon interaction with IL-15 DCs, both towards leukemic cell lines and allogeneic primary AML blasts. Finally, we address soluble IL-15 secreted by IL-15 DCs as the main mechanism behind the IL-15 DC-mediated gammadelta T cell activation. These results indicate that the application of IL-15-secreting DC subsets could render DC-based anti-cancer vaccines more effective through, among others, the involvement of gammadelta T cells in the anti-leukemic immune response.","['Van Acker, Heleen H', 'Anguille, Sebastien', 'De Reu, Hans', 'Berneman, Zwi N', 'Smits, Evelien L', 'Van Tendeloo, Viggo F']","['Van Acker HH', 'Anguille S', 'De Reu H', 'Berneman ZN', 'Smits EL', 'Van Tendeloo VF']","['Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Tumor Immunology Group (TIGR), Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Vaccine & Infectious Disease Institute (VAXINFECTIO), University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium.', 'Division of Hematology, Antwerp University Hospital, Edegem, Belgium.', 'Center for Cell Therapy and Regenerative Medicine, Antwerp University Hospital, Edegem, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Tumor Immunology Group (TIGR), Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Vaccine & Infectious Disease Institute (VAXINFECTIO), University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Tumor Immunology Group (TIGR), Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Vaccine & Infectious Disease Institute (VAXINFECTIO), University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium.', 'Division of Hematology, Antwerp University Hospital, Edegem, Belgium.', 'Center for Cell Therapy and Regenerative Medicine, Antwerp University Hospital, Edegem, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Tumor Immunology Group (TIGR), Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Vaccine & Infectious Disease Institute (VAXINFECTIO), University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium.', 'Center for Cell Therapy and Regenerative Medicine, Antwerp University Hospital, Edegem, Belgium.', 'Center for Oncological Research (CORE), Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Tumor Immunology Group (TIGR), Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Vaccine & Infectious Disease Institute (VAXINFECTIO), University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180410,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,"['0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (IL15 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-15)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cancer Vaccines', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-15/*immunology', 'Intraepithelial Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",['NOTNLM'],"['*acute myeloid leukemia', '*dendritic cell vaccination', '*immunotherapy', '*interleukin-15', '*gammadelta T cells']",2018/04/26 06:00,2018/04/26 06:01,['2018/04/26 06:00'],"['2017/11/09 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/26 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2018.00658 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2018 Apr 10;9:658. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2018.00658. eCollection 2018.,,,,PMC5902500,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Changing diagnostic criteria and the rarity of the disease, with incidence approximately 100-times lower than the incidence of BCR-ABL1-positive chronic myeloid leukaemia, result in limited knowledge on aCML. At present the diagnosis is made based on the presence of granulocytic lineage dysplasia and precisely defined quantitative peripheral blood criteria, after exclusion of other molecularly defined myeloid neoplasms. Distinctive cytogenetic and molecular changes for aCML are missing, although recently SETBP1 mutations were described in a significant proportion of patients.

However, operational population-based cancer registries in Pakistan are lacking. Limited data are available based on institutional or Karachi Cancer Registry from Karachi; however, no exclusive registry for hematological malignancies is established till date. Hence, we decided to conduct a database analysis to determine the frequencies of various hematological cancers in our tertiary care center in Karachi. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective assessment of 366 patients presented to Hematology Department, Liaquat National Hospital and Medical College from May 2012 to May 2016 with confirmed diagnosis of hematological cancers was performed. Data were retrieved from hospital-based tumor registry. All pro forma was filled by qualified medical research officer, which included demographic data as age, gender, history, disease type, and its stage at presentation. RESULTS: Male gender was predominant and accounted for 69.9% (n = 256) and female accounted for 30.0% (n = 110) of the total cases with the male-to-female ratio of ~2:1. The mean ages of female and male patients were 42.9 +/- 20.7 and 49.7 +/- 18.1 years with the median age of 45 and 51.5 years, respectively. In males, the three most frequent malignancies were chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) (16%), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (12.8% of each). In females, AML was the most common cancer accounting for 21.8% followed by CML (18.1%) and ALL (10%). CONCLUSIONS: Our institution-based tumor registry indicates CML and AML were the most common cancers in males and females, respectively, followed by ALL. Chronic lymphoid leukemia, unlike in the West, is seen infrequently in our population. National and provisional hematological tumor registry will be beneficial for future health planning and research.","['Sultan, Sadia', 'Irfan, Syed Mohammed', 'Ali, Navaira', 'Nawaz, Neesha']","['Sultan S', 'Irfan SM', 'Ali N', 'Nawaz N']","['Department of Hematology and Blood Bank, Liaquat National Medical College, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'Department of Hematology and Blood Bank, Liaquat National Medical College, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'Department of Oncology, Liaquat National Medical College, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'Liaquat National Medical College, Karachi, Pakistan.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Germany,J Lab Physicians,Journal of laboratory physicians,101551511,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Hematological', 'Karachi', 'tumor registry']",2018/04/26 06:00,2018/04/26 06:01,['2018/04/26 06:00'],"['2018/04/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/26 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/JLP.JLP_60_17 [doi]', 'JLP-10-168 [pii]']",ppublish,J Lab Physicians. 2018 Apr-Jun;10(2):168-172. doi: 10.4103/JLP.JLP_60_17.,,,,PMC5896183,,,['There are no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we identify the circadian clock transcription factor SHARP1 as a novel oncogenic target in MLL-AF6 AML, which has the worst prognosis among all subtypes of MLL-rearranged AMLs. SHARP1 is expressed solely in MLL-AF6 AML, and its expression is regulated directly by MLL-AF6/DOT1L. Suppression of SHARP1 induces robust apoptosis of human MLL-AF6 AML cells. Genetic deletion in mice delays the development of leukemia and attenuated leukemia-initiating potential, while sparing normal hematopoiesis. Mechanistically, SHARP1 binds to transcriptionally active chromatin across the genome and activates genes critical for cell survival as well as key oncogenic targets of MLL-AF6.

A subset of CBF AML patients harbors several signaling gene mutations. Genotyping of colonies and of relapse samples indicates that these arise in independent clones, thus defining a process of clonal interference (or parallel evolution). Clonal interference is pervasive in cancers, but the mechanisms underlying this process remain unclear, and its prognostic impact remains unknown. We analyzed a cohort of 445 adult and pediatric patients with CBF AML treated with intensive chemotherapy and with deep sequencing of 6 signaling genes (KIT, NRAS, KRAS, FLT3, JAK2, CBL). A total of 152 (34%), 167 (38%), and 126 (28%) patients harbored no, a single, and multiple signaling clones (clonal interference), respectively. Clonal interference of signaling mutations was associated with older age (P = .004) and inv(16) subtype (P = .025) but not with white blood cell count or mutations in chromatin or cohesin genes. The median allele frequency of signaling mutations was 31% in patients with a single clone or clonal interference (P = .14). The repertoire of KIT, FLT3, and NRAS/KRAS variants differed between groups. Clonal interference did not affect complete remission rate or minimal residual disease after 1-2 courses, but it did convey inferior event-free survival (P < 10(-4)), whereas the presence of a single signaling clone did not (P = .44). This inferior outcome was independent of clinical parameters and of the presence of specific signaling clones. Our results suggest that specific clonal architectures can herald distinct prognoses in AML.","['Itzykson, Raphael', 'Duployez, Nicolas', 'Fasan, Annette', 'Decool, Gauthier', 'Marceau-Renaut, Alice', 'Meggendorfer, Manja', 'Jourdan, Eric', 'Petit, Arnaud', 'Lapillonne, Helene', 'Micol, Jean-Baptiste', 'Cornillet-Lefebvre, Pascale', 'Ifrah, Norbert', 'Leverger, Guy', 'Dombret, Herve', 'Boissel, Nicolas', 'Haferlach, Torsten', 'Preudhomme, Claude']","['Itzykson R', 'Duployez N', 'Fasan A', 'Decool G', 'Marceau-Renaut A', 'Meggendorfer M', 'Jourdan E', 'Petit A', 'Lapillonne H', 'Micol JB', 'Cornillet-Lefebvre P', 'Ifrah N', 'Leverger G', 'Dombret H', 'Boissel N', 'Haferlach T', 'Preudhomme C']","['Department of Hematology, Hopital Saint-Louis, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Paris Diderot University, Paris, France.', 'INSERM/Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Unite Mixte de Recherche 944/7212, Paris Cancer Research Institute, Paris, France.', 'INSERM Lille, University of Lille, Lille, France.', 'Laboratory of Hematology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Lille, Lille, France.', 'Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'INSERM Lille, University of Lille, Lille, France.', 'Laboratory of Hematology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Lille, Lille, France.', 'INSERM Lille, University of Lille, Lille, France.', 'Laboratory of Hematology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Lille, Lille, France.', 'Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Nimes, Nimes, France.', 'Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Department and.', 'Laboratory of Hematology, Trousseau Hospital, AP-HP, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Gustave Roussy Institute, Villejuif, France.', 'Laboratory of Hematology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, Reims, France.', 'Clinical Hematology Department, Hotel-Dieu, Angers, France; and.', 'Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Department and.', 'Department of Hematology, Hopital Saint-Louis, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Paris Diderot University, Paris, France.', 'EA3518, Paris Diderot University, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Hopital Saint-Louis, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Paris Diderot University, Paris, France.', 'EA3518, Paris Diderot University, Paris, France.', 'Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'INSERM Lille, University of Lille, Lille, France.', 'Laboratory of Hematology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Lille, Lille, France.']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-2139-6262'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180424,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Core Binding Factors)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Clonal Evolution/*genetics', 'Core Binding Factors/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*etiology/*metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Signal Transduction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Young Adult']",,,2018/04/26 06:00,2019/07/10 06:00,['2018/04/26 06:00'],"['2018/03/05 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/10 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)32084-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2018-03-837781 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2018 Jul 12;132(2):187-196. doi: 10.1182/blood-2018-03-837781.

Two pathologic variants of RS are recognized: namely, the diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) variant and the rare Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) variant. Histologic documentation is mandatory to diagnose RS. The clinical suspicion of RS should be based on clinical signs and symptoms. Differential diagnosis between CLL progression and RS and choice of the biopsy site may take advantage of positron emission tomography/computed tomography. Molecular lesions of regulators of proliferation (CDKN2A, NOTCH1, MYC) and apoptosis (TP53) overall associate with approximately 90% of DLBCL-type RS, whereas the biology of the HL-type RS is largely unknown. The prognosis of the DLBCL-type RS is unfavorable; the outcome of HL-type RS appears to be better. The most important RS prognostic factor is the clonal relationship between the CLL and the aggressive lymphoma clones, with clonally unrelated RS having a better prognosis. Rituximab-containing combination chemotherapy for DLBCL is the most widely used treatment in DLBCL-type RS. Fit patients who respond to induction therapy should be offered stem cell transplantation (SCT) to prolong survival. Adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine is the preferred regimen for the HL-type RS, and SCT consolidation is less used in this condition.","['Rossi, Davide', 'Spina, Valeria', 'Gaidano, Gianluca']","['Rossi D', 'Spina V', 'Gaidano G']","['Division of Hematology, Oncology Institute of Southern Switzerland, Bellinzona, Switzerland.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Oncology Research, Bellinzona, Switzerland; and.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology Institute of Southern Switzerland, Bellinzona, Switzerland.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Translational Medicine, University of Eastern Piedmont, Novara, Italy.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20180424,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Hodgkin Disease/diagnosis/pathology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*pathology/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Stem Cell Transplantation']",,,2018/04/26 06:00,2019/07/11 06:00,['2018/04/26 06:00'],"['2018/01/16 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/11 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)32135-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2018-01-791376 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2018 Jun 21;131(25):2761-2772. doi: 10.1182/blood-2018-01-791376.

Pterocarpanquinone (LQB-118) and 11a-aza-5-carbapterocarpan (LQB-223) were the most promising. LQB-118 induced cell death, in vitro, in the microM range, to a number of human cancer cell lines as well as to fresh tumor cells obtained from patients with acute or chronic myeloid leukemia, independent on whether they exhibit the MDR phenotype or not. Furthermore, leukemic cells were more sensitive to LQB- 118 compared to cells from solid tumors. Given to mice, in vivo, LQB-118 affected the growth of melanoma, Ehrlich carcinoma and prostate cancer cells. Conversely, no general toxicity was observed in vivo, by biochemical, hematological, anatomical or histological parameters and toxicity in vitro against normal cells was low. The process involved in tumor cell death seemed to vary according to cell type. Apoptosis was studied by externalization of phosphatidylserine, DNA fragmentation, caspase-3 activation, reduced expression of XIAP and survivin, ER stress, cytosolic calcium increase and mitochondrial membrane depolarization. Autophagy was also evaluated inhibiting caspase-9, with no effect observed in beclin 1, whereas pre-treatment with rapamycin increased cytotoxicity induced by LQB-118. In addition, LQB-118 increased ROS, inhibited NFkappaB nuclear translocation and secretion of TNF-alpha, modulated microRNAs miR-9 and miR-21 and modified the cell cycle.

Today, it is known that due to resistance to single agents, combination therapy is essential for tumor eradication and cure. In the last decade, studies have shown that anticancer drug combinations can act synergistically or antagonistically against tumor cells in vitro, depending on the ratios of the individual drugs forming the combination. From this observation and facing the possibility of maintaining the in vivo synergistic ratio of combinations came the idea of co-encapsulating anticancer agents in nanosystems. In vivo studies validated this idea by showing that the co-encapsulation of anticancer agents in liposomes allows the maintenance of drug ratios in the plasma and the delivery of fixed drug ratios directly to tumor tissue, leading to a better efficacy compared to the administration of the free drugs combination. Liposomes co-encapsulating irinotecan/floxuridine are now in Phase II trial, and liposomes co-encapsulating cytarabine/daunorubicin were recently approved by the FDA for treatment of patients with acute myeloid leukemia.","['Franco, Marina S', 'Oliveira, Monica C']","['Franco MS', 'Oliveira MC']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Products, Faculty of Pharmacy, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Av.

METHODS: Using dd-PCR and RT-qPCR, two cell suspensions were obtained from K562 cells and normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells by gradient dilution and were measured at the cellular level. At peripheral blood (PB) level, 61 cases with CML-chronic phase (CML-CP) were obtained after tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment and regular follow-ups. By RT-qPCR, BCR/ABL (P210) fusion gene was undetectable in PB after three successive analyses, which were performed once every 3 months. At the same time, dd-PCR was performed simultaneously with the last equal amount of cDNA. Ten CML patients with MR4.5 were followed up by the two methods. RESULTS: At the cellular level, consistency of results of dd-PCR and RT-qPCR reached R(2 ) >/= 0.99, with conversion equation of Y = 33.148X(1.222) (Y: dd-PCR results; X: RT-qPCR results). In the dd-PCR test, 11 of the 61 patients with CML (18.03%) tested positive and showed statistically significant difference (P < .01). In the follow-up of 10 CML patients who were in MR4.5. All patients were loss of MR4.0, and 4 were tested positive by dd-PCR 3 months earlier than by RT-qPCR. CONCLUSION: In contrast with RT-qPCR, dd-PCR is more sensitive, thus enabling accurate conversion of dd-PCR results into internationally standard RT-qPCR results by conversion equation, to achieve a deeper molecular biology-based stratification of BCR/ABL(P210) MRD. It has some reference value to monitor disease progression in clinic.","['Wang, Wen-Jun', 'Zheng, Chao-Feng', 'Liu, Zhuang', 'Tan, Yan-Hong', 'Chen, Xiu-Hua', 'Zhao, Bin-Liang', 'Li, Guo-Xia', 'Xu, Zhi-Fang', 'Ren, Fang-Gang', 'Zhang, Yao-Fang', 'Chang, Jian-Mei', 'Wang, Hong-Wei']","['Wang WJ', 'Zheng CF', 'Liu Z', 'Tan YH', 'Chen XH', 'Zhao BL', 'Li GX', 'Xu ZF', 'Ren FG', 'Zhang YF', 'Chang JM', 'Wang HW']","['Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, Shanxi, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, Shanxi, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, Shanxi, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, Shanxi, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, Shanxi, China.', 'School of Public Health, Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, Shanxi, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, Shanxi, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, Shanxi, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, Shanxi, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, Shanxi, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, Shanxi, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, Shanxi, China.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2902-591X'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180712,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods/standards', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['BCR/ABL(P210)', 'CML', 'RT-qPCR', 'droplet digital PCR', 'minimal residual disease']",2018/04/25 06:00,2018/12/12 06:00,['2018/04/26 06:00'],"['2018/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ejh.13084 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2018 Sep;101(3):291-296. doi: 10.1111/ejh.13084.

There is a strong association between the GvL effects and graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), a major life-threatening complication of allo-HSCT. The limiting of GvHD while maintaining the GvL effect remains the goal of allo-HSCT. Therefore, identifying optimal therapeutic targets to selectively suppress GvHD while maintaining the GvL effects represents a significant unmet medical need. We demonstrate that the dual inhibition of interferon gamma receptor (IFNgammaR) and interleukin-6 receptor (IL6R) results in near-complete elimination of GvHD in a fully major histocompatibility complex-mismatched allo-HSCT model. Furthermore, baricitinib (an inhibitor of Janus kinases 1 and 2 (JAK1/JAK2) downstream of IFNgammaR/IL6R) completely prevented GvHD; expanded regulatory T cells by preserving JAK3-STAT5 signaling; downregulated CXCR3 and helper T cells 1 and 2 while preserving allogeneic antigen-presenting cell-stimulated T-cell proliferation; and suppressed the expression of major histocompatibility complex II (I-Ad), CD80/86, and PD-L1 on host antigen-presenting cells. Baricitinib also reversed established GvHD with 100% survival, thus demonstrating both preventive and therapeutic roles for this compound. Remarkably, baricitinib enhanced the GvL effects, possibly by downregulating tumor PD-L1 expression.","['Choi, Jaebok', 'Cooper, Matthew L', 'Staser, Karl', 'Ashami, Kidist', 'Vij, Kiran R', 'Wang, Bing', 'Marsala, Lynne', 'Niswonger, Jessica', 'Ritchey, Julie', 'Alahmari, Bader', 'Achilefu, Samuel', 'Tsunoda, Ikuo', 'Schroeder, Mark A', 'DiPersio, John F']","['Choi J', 'Cooper ML', 'Staser K', 'Ashami K', 'Vij KR', 'Wang B', 'Marsala L', 'Niswonger J', 'Ritchey J', 'Alahmari B', 'Achilefu S', 'Tsunoda I', 'Schroeder MA', 'DiPersio JF']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, 63110, USA. jchoi25@wustl.edu.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, 63110, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, 63110, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Dermatology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, 63110, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, 63110, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, 63110, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, 63110, USA.', 'Department of Radiology, Molecular Imaging Center, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, 63110, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, 63110, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, 63110, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, 63110, USA.', 'Department of Radiology, Molecular Imaging Center, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, 63110, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology, Kindai University Faculty of Medicine, Osakasayama, Osaka, 589-8511, Japan.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, 63110, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, 63110, USA. jdipersi@wustl.edu.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5590-087X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6026-1347']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180402,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Azetidines)', '0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (B7-2 Antigen)', '0 (B7-H1 Antigen)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Receptors, Interferon)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '07MXG07O12 (interferon gamma receptor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)', 'ISP4442I3Y (baricitinib)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Azetidines/*pharmacology', 'B7-1 Antigen/metabolism', 'B7-2 Antigen/metabolism', 'B7-H1 Antigen/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*metabolism/*prevention & control', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Janus Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Purines', 'Pyrazoles', 'Receptors, Interferon/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/drug effects/metabolism', 'Transplantation, Homologous/methods']",,,2018/04/25 06:00,2019/06/14 06:00,['2018/04/26 06:00'],"['2017/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/02/26 00:00 [revised]', '2018/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-018-0123-z [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-018-0123-z [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2018 Nov;32(11):2483-2494. doi: 10.1038/s41375-018-0123-z.

SUMMARY: The University of Arizona Cancer Center and Banner-University Medical Center Tucson are affiliated not-for-profit academic medical centers in Tucson, Arizona, whose facilities include a hospital and ambulatory care clinics that maintain 3 outpatient infusion centers. The cancer center pharmacy currently employs 25 pharmacists, with 4 clinical pharmacists serving both the inpatient and outpatient treatment sites. A multidisciplinary team of staff members was assembled to address the transition of chemotherapy from inpatient to outpatient that included physicians, ambulatory clinical oncology pharmacists, finance, social workers, pharmacy staff, nursing staff, and information technology. The program was initiated in May 2014, with a 2-year postimplementation evaluation of our transition of chemotherapy to the outpatient setting. Chemotherapy order sets were developed in our electronic medical record for transitioning rituximab to the outpatient setting for inpatient chemotherapy orders as well as transitioning leukemia, lymphoma, and solid tumor chemotherapy regimens to be administered in the outpatient setting. Eighteen rituximab-containing regimens and 14 chemotherapy protocols were switched to the outpatient setting, with numerous variants of these regimens also created for outpatient only administration. The realized savings for high-cost chemotherapy transitioned to the outpatient setting with rituximab and clofarabine was $1,902,890. Over 747 inpatient bed days were saved, with an approximated cost savings to the health system of $1,402,866, with a cumulative cost savings to our health system of $3,305,756. CONCLUSION: This model for transitioning chemotherapy from the hospital to the outpatient setting enhanced access to care, decreased bed utilization in the hospital, and improved clinical and financial metrics.","['McBride, Ali', 'Campen, Christopher J', 'Camamo, James', 'Maloney, Marie', 'Persky, Daniel', 'Kurtin, Sandra E', 'Barket, Nikki L', 'Krishnadasan, Ravitharan', 'Elquza, Emad', 'Anwer, Faiz', 'Weibel, Kurt']","['McBride A', 'Campen CJ', 'Camamo J', 'Maloney M', 'Persky D', 'Kurtin SE', 'Barket NL', 'Krishnadasan R', 'Elquza E', 'Anwer F', 'Weibel K']","['University of Arizona Cancer Center, Tucson, AZ alimcbride@gmail.com.', 'Greenville Health System Cancer Institute, Greenville, SC.', 'Banner-University Medical Center Tucson, Tucson, AZ.', 'Banner-University Medical Center Tucson, Tucson, AZ.', 'University of Arizona Cancer Center, Tucson, AZ.', 'Clinical Assistant Professor of Medicine Adjunct Clinical Assistant Professor of Nursing, University of Arizona Cancer Center, Tucson, Arizona.', 'The University of Arizona Cancer Center, Tucson, AZ.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Arizona Cancer Center, Tucson, AZ.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Arizona Cancer Center, Tucson, AZ.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Arizona Cancer Center, Tucson, AZ.', 'Banner-University Medical Center Tucson, Tucson, AZ.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Am J Health Syst Pharm,American journal of health-system pharmacy : AJHP : official journal of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists,9503023,['4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)'],IM,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Ambulatory Care/economics/*methods', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/economics', 'Arizona', 'Cost Savings', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/economics/pathology', 'Patient Care Team/organization & administration', 'Patient Transfer/organization & administration', 'Pharmacists/*organization & administration', 'Pharmacy Service, Hospital/*organization & administration', 'Rituximab/administration & dosage']",['NOTNLM'],"['EPOCH', 'ESHAP', 'HiDAC', 'ambulatory chemotherapy administration', 'clofarabine', 'outpatient chemotherapy']",2018/04/25 06:00,2019/02/07 06:00,['2018/04/26 06:00'],"['2018/04/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/07 06:00 [medline]']","['75/9/e246 [pii]', '10.2146/ajhp170138 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Health Syst Pharm. 2018 May 1;75(9):e246-e258. doi: 10.2146/ajhp170138.,"['Copyright (c) 2018 by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, Inc.

Here we elucidate the role of MHC-I-independent NKR-P1B:Clr-b interactions in the detection of oncogenic transformation by NK cells. Ras oncogene overexpression was found to promote a real-time loss of Clr-b on mouse fibroblasts and leukemia cells, mediated in part via the Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K pathways. Ras-driven Clr-b downregulation occurred at the level of the Clrb (Clec2d) promoter, nascent Clr-b transcripts, and cell surface Clr-b protein, in turn promoting missing-self recognition via the NKR-P1B inhibitory receptor. Both Ras- and c-Myc-mediated Clr-b loss selectively augmented cytotoxicity of oncogene-transformed leukemia cells by NKR-P1B(+) NK cells in vitro and enhanced rejection by WT mice in vivo Interestingly, genetic ablation of either one (Clr-b(+/-)) or two Clr-b alleles (Clr-b(-/-)) enhanced survival of Emu-cMyc transgenic mice in a primary lymphoma model despite preferential rejection of Clr-b(-/-) hematopoietic cells previously observed following adoptive transfer into naive wild-type mice in vivo Collectively, these findings suggest that the inhibitory NKR-P1B:Clr-b axis plays a beneficial role in innate detection of oncogenic transformation via NK-cell-mediated cancer immune surveillance, in addition to a pathologic role in the immune escape of primary lymphoma cells in Emu-cMyc mice in vivo These results provide a model for the human NKR-P1A:LLT1 system in cancer immunosurveillance in patients with lymphoma and suggest it may represent a target for immune checkpoint therapy.Significance: A mouse model shows that an MHC-independent NK-cell recognition axis enables the detection of leukemia cells, with implications for a novel immune checkpoint therapy target in human lymphoma.

We describe a case of Staphylococcus epidermidis meningitis in a patient with neutropenia who had no intracranial foreign body, and we review the literature on meningitis that is caused by coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. without a neurosurgical device. CASE PRESENTATION: A 47-year-old Japanese man with acute myeloid leukemia receiving chemotherapy through a totally implantable central venous catheter developed fever and headache. The patient had a history of craniotomy for anaplastic oligodendroglioma without an indwelling neurosurgical device. The results of two blood cultures and a cerebrospinal fluid culture were positive for Staphylococcus epidermidis. Clinical improvement was observed with treatment with vancomycin and removal of the central venous catheter despite prolonged neutropenia. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of Staphylococcus epidermidis meningitis in a patient with neutropenia without a neurosurgical device who was successfully treated.","['Noguchi, Taro', 'Nagao, Miki', 'Yamamoto, Masaki', 'Matsumura, Yasufumi', 'Kitano, Toshiyuki', 'Takaori-Kondo, Akifumi', 'Ichiyama, Satoshi']","['Noguchi T', 'Nagao M', 'Yamamoto M', 'Matsumura Y', 'Kitano T', 'Takaori-Kondo A', 'Ichiyama S']","['Department of Clinical Laboratory Medicine, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, 54 Shogoin-Kawara-cho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory Medicine, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, 54 Shogoin-Kawara-cho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan. mnagao@kuhp.kyoto-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory Medicine, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, 54 Shogoin-Kawara-cho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory Medicine, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, 54 Shogoin-Kawara-cho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, 54 Shogoin-Kawara-cho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, 54 Shogoin-Kawara-cho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory Medicine, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, 54 Shogoin-Kawara-cho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan.']",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20180425,England,J Med Case Rep,Journal of medical case reports,101293382,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '6Q205EH1VU (Vancomycin)']",IM,"['Administration, Intravenous', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Brain/diagnostic imaging', 'Catheter-Related Infections/complications', 'Catheters, Indwelling/*adverse effects', 'Central Venous Catheters/adverse effects', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/drug therapy', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Meningitis, Bacterial/blood/cerebrospinal fluid/complications/*drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Staphylococcus epidermidis/*isolation & purification', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Vancomycin/*therapeutic use']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute leukemia', 'Catheter-related bloodstream infection', 'Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus', 'Meningitis', 'Neurosurgical device', 'Neutropenia']",2018/04/25 06:00,2018/10/03 06:00,['2018/04/26 06:00'],"['2017/09/26 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/03 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13256-018-1646-7 [doi]', '10.1186/s13256-018-1646-7 [pii]']",epublish,J Med Case Rep. 2018 Apr 25;12(1):106. doi: 10.1186/s13256-018-1646-7.,,,,PMC5916725,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have recently shown that allogeneic double negative T cells (DNTs) are able to target the majority of primary AML blasts in vitro and in patient-derived xenograft models. However, some primary AML blast samples are resistant to DNT cell therapy. Given the differences in the modes of action of DNTs and chemotherapy, we hypothesize that DNT therapy can be used in combination with conventional chemotherapy to further improve their anti-leukemic effects and to target chemotherapy-resistant disease. METHODS: Drug titration assays and flow-based cytotoxicity assays using ex vivo expanded allogeneic DNTs were performed on multiple AML cell lines to identify therapy-resistance. Primary AML samples were also tested to validate our in vitro findings. Further, a xenograft model was employed to demonstrate the feasibility of combining conventional chemotherapy and adoptive DNT therapy to target therapy-resistant AML. Lastly, blocking assays with neutralizing antibodies were employed to determine the mechanism by which chemotherapy increases the susceptibility of AML to DNT-mediated cytotoxicity. RESULTS: Here, we demonstrate that KG1a, a stem-like AML cell line that is resistant to DNTs and chemotherapy, and chemotherapy-resistant primary AML samples both became more susceptible to DNT-mediated cytotoxicity in vitro following pre-treatment with daunorubicin. Moreover, chemotherapy treatment followed by adoptive DNT cell therapy significantly decreased bone marrow engraftment of KG1a in a xenograft model. Mechanistically, daunorubicin increased the expression of NKG2D and DNAM-1 ligands on KG1a; blocking of these pathways attenuated DNT-mediated cytotoxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate the feasibility and benefit of using DNTs as an immunotherapy after the administration of conventional chemotherapy.","['Chen, Branson', 'Lee, Jong Bok', 'Kang, Hyeonjeong', 'Minden, Mark D', 'Zhang, Li']","['Chen B', 'Lee JB', 'Kang H', 'Minden MD', 'Zhang L']","['Toronto General Hospital Research Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Toronto General Hospital Research Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Toronto General Hospital Research Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Toronto General Hospital Research Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. lzhang@uhnresearch.ca.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. lzhang@uhnresearch.ca.', 'Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. lzhang@uhnresearch.ca.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180424,England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy/*methods', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Mice']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Adoptive cellular therapy', 'Allogeneic double negative T cell', 'Chemotherapy']",2018/04/25 06:00,2019/04/25 06:00,['2018/04/26 06:00'],"['2018/03/01 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13046-018-0756-9 [doi]', '10.1186/s13046-018-0756-9 [pii]']",epublish,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2018 Apr 24;37(1):88. doi: 10.1186/s13046-018-0756-9.,,,"['704121/Canadian Cancer Society (CA)', '141723/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada']",PMC5916833,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it suffers from a similar short half-life as other DNA methyltransferase inhibitors with a 5-azacytosine base, which is problematic for nucleosides that primarily target tumor cells in S phase. Because of the relative instability of 5-azanucleosides, a prodrug approach was developed to improve the pharmacology of NUC013. NUC013 was conjugated with trimethylsilanol (TMS) at the 3' and 5' position of the sugar, rendering the molecule hydrophobic and producing 3',5'-di-trimethylsilyl-2',2'-difluoro-5-azadeoxycytidine (NUC041). NUC041 was designed to be formulated in a hydrophobic vehicle, protecting it from deamination and hydrolysis. In contact with blood, the TMS moieties are readily hydrolyzed to release NUC013. The half-life of NUC013 administered intravenously in mice is 20.1 min, while that of NUC013 derived from intramuscular NUC041 formulated in a pegylated-phospholipid depot is 3.4 h. In a NCI-H460 xenograft of non-small cell lung cancer, NUC013 was shown to significantly inhibit tumor growth and improve survival. Treatment with NUC041 also led to significant tumor growth inhibition. However, NUC041-treated mice had significantly more tumors ulcerate than either NUC013 treated mice or saline control mice, and such ulceration occurred at significantly lower tumor volumes. In these nude mice, tumor regression was likely mediated by the derepression of the tumor suppressor gene p53 and resultant activation of natural killer (NK) cells.","['Daifuku, Richard', 'Grimes, Sheila', 'Stackhouse, Murray']","['Daifuku R', 'Grimes S', 'Stackhouse M']","['Epigenetics Pharma, 9270 SE 36th Pl, Mercer Island, WA 98040, USA. rdaifuku@yahoo.com.', 'Southern Research, 2000 9th Avenue South, Birmingham, AL 35205, USA. sgrimes@southernresearch.org.', 'Southern Research, 2000 9th Avenue South, Birmingham, AL 35205, USA. mstackhouse@southernresearch.org.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180423,Switzerland,Pharmaceuticals (Basel),"Pharmaceuticals (Basel, Switzerland)",101238453,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*5-azacytidine', '*DNA methyltransferase', '*NUC013', '*NUC041', '*cancer', '*decitabine', '*epigenetics', '*natural killer cells', '*nucleoside', '*p53', '*ribonucleotide reductase']",2018/04/25 06:00,2018/04/25 06:01,['2018/04/26 06:00'],"['2018/03/28 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/17 00:00 [revised]', '2018/04/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/25 06:01 [medline]']","['ph11020036 [pii]', '10.3390/ph11020036 [doi]']",epublish,Pharmaceuticals (Basel). 2018 Apr 23;11(2). pii: ph11020036. doi: 10.3390/ph11020036.,,,,PMC6027359,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: This study was to explore the expression status of miR-192 and its clinical significance in pediatric patients with AML. METHODS: Quantitative RT-PCR was carried out to detect miR-192 expression level in the serum from 97 AML cases and 50 healthy controls. RESULTS: The results showed that downregulation of serum miR-192 was observed in pediatric AML patients and strongly correlated with aggressive clinical features. Increased serum miR-192 expression occurred more frequently in the AML subjects with favorable risk cytogenetics. Moreover, serum miR-192 expression showed good performance to screen pediatric AML subjects from normal controls. Furthermore, serum miR-192 was identified as a independent prognostic indicator for both overall survival and event free survival. In addition, low serum miR-192 expression significantly contributed to poor prognosis in the whole cohort of AML patients or the AML patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics.

The expression of glycolytic enzyme enolase 2 (ENO2) was found to be closely associated with the clinical features of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients, but its functions remain unclear in ALL. METHODS: We evaluated the association between ENO2 mRNA expression in bone marrow mononuclear cells (BM-MNCs) and the efficacy of chemotherapy, and further explored the function of ENO2 in ALL. The molecular mechanisms of ENO2 expression and its effects on cell growth, glycolysis and glucocorticoid resistance were explored by Cell Counting Kit-8, glucose-consumption assay, Quantitative RT-PCR, Western blotting and in vivo tumorigenesis in NOD/SCID mice. RESULTS: The results showed that ENO2 mRNA expression in BM-MNCs was significantly decreased when patients completed induction chemotherapy and reached complete remission (CR). ENO2 mRNA expression was increased when patients suffered relapse. Functional studies demonstrated that ENO2 promoted cell growth, glycolysis, and glucocorticoid resistance, all of which were effectively inhibited when ENO2 was silenced with shRNAs. Further studies revealed that ENO2 up-regulated various glycolysis-related genes and enhanced Akt activity with subsequent glycogen synthase kinase3beta (GSK-3beta) phosphorylation, inducing cell proliferation and glycolysis. The combination of silencing ENO2 and 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) synergistically inhibited leukemia cell survival. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that ENO2 may be a biological marker for monitoring chemotherapeutic efficacy and relapse in ALL. ENO2 may provide a potential therapeutic strategy for ALL.","['Liu, Cheng-Cheng', 'Wang, Hua', 'Wang, Wei-da', 'Wang, Liang', 'Liu, Wen-Jian', 'Wang, Jing-Hua', 'Geng, Qi-Rong', 'Lu, Yue']","['Liu CC', 'Wang H', 'Wang WD', 'Wang L', 'Liu WJ', 'Wang JH', 'Geng QR', 'Lu Y']","['Department of Hematologic Oncology.

By contrast, MRD monitoring in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has been limited by variable assay methodologies and a relative paucity of patient-specific MRD markers. Inter- and intratumor genetic heterogeneity poses significant challenges for the identification of molecular markers suitable for MRD monitoring in AML, particularly for those cases without structural chromosomal rearrangements associated with fusion genes. Furthermore, the need to discriminate which mutations may be suitable for MRD monitoring creates additional complexity. The mainstay of current molecular MRD monitoring is real-time quantitative PCR, targeting fusion genes, mutations, and gene overexpression.

In this context, maintenance of assay fidelity and detection of technical inaccuracy are crucial. Beside multiple common negative controls for the clinical sample preparations, quality control charts (QCC) are a common validation tool to sustain high process quality by continuously recording of qRT-PCR control parameters. Here, we report on establishment and benefit of QCC in qRT-PCR-based CML diagnostics. The absolute quantification of BCR-ABL1 fusion transcripts in patient samples is based on coamplification of a serially diluted reference plasmid (pME-2). For QCC establishment the measured Ct values of each pME-2 standard dilution (4-400,000) of a test set resembling 21 sequential qRT-PCR experiments were recorded and statistically evaluated. Test set data were used for determination of warning limits (mean +/- 2-fold standard deviation) and control (intervention) limits (mean +/- 3-fold standard deviation) to allow rapid detection of defined out-of-control situations which may require intervention. We have retrospectively analyzed QCC data of 282 sequential qRT-PCR experiments (564 reactions). Data evaluation using QCCs revealed three out-of-control situations that required intervention like experiment repeats, renewal of pME-2 standards, replacement of reagents or personnel re-training. In conclusion, with minimal more effort and hands-on time QCC rank among the best tools to grant high quality and reproducibility in CML routine molecular diagnosis.","['Spiess, Birgit', 'Naumann, Nicole', 'Galuschek, Norbert', 'Rinaldetti, Sebastien', 'Kossak-Roth, Ute', 'Tarnopolscaia, Irina', 'Felde, Elena', 'Fabarius, Alice', 'Hofmann, Wolf-Karsten', 'Saussele, Susanne', 'Seifarth, Wolfgang']","['Spiess B', 'Naumann N', 'Galuschek N', 'Rinaldetti S', 'Kossak-Roth U', 'Tarnopolscaia I', 'Felde E', 'Fabarius A', 'Hofmann WK', 'Saussele S', 'Seifarth W']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-9930-7069'],['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180424,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Case-Control Studies', '*Diagnostic Tests, Routine/methods/standards', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*analysis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/genetics/pathology', 'Medical Records/standards', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques/standards', 'Monitoring, Physiologic/methods/standards', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Predictive Value of Tests', '*Quality Control', '*Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction/standards', 'Reference Standards', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Software Design']",,,2018/04/25 06:00,2018/08/21 06:00,['2018/04/25 06:00'],"['2017/12/13 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0196326 [doi]', 'PONE-D-17-43040 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2018 Apr 24;13(4):e0196326. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0196326. eCollection 2018.,,,,PMC5916859,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PML-RARA, RUNX1-RUNX1T1, and KMT2A-rearrangement are common genetic rearrangements that drive the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). By contrast, rare genetic rearrangements may also contribute to leukemogenesis but are less summarized. CASE PRESENTATION: Here we reported rare fusion genes ZNF717-ZNF37A, ZNF273-DGKA, and ZDHHC2-TTTY15 in a 47-year-old AML-M4 patient with FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) discovered by whole genome sequencing (WGS) using the patient's healthy sibling as a sequencing control.

The AMPK activator 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-beta-4-ribofuranoside (AICAR) interferes with inflammatory pathways in skeletal muscle, but the mechanisms are undefined. We hypothesized that AMPK activation reduces cytokine mRNA levels by blocking transcription through one or several transcription factors. Three skeletal muscle models were used to study AMPK effects on cytokine mRNA: human skeletal muscle strips obtained from healthy men incubated in vitro, primary human muscle cells, and rat L6 cells. In all three skeletal muscle systems, AICAR acutely reduced cytokine mRNA levels. In L6 myotubes treated with the transcriptional blocker actinomycin D, AICAR addition did not further reduce Il6 or leukemia inhibitory factor ( Lif) mRNA, suggesting that AICAR modulates cytokine expression through regulating transcription rather than mRNA stability. A cross-species bioinformatic approach identified novel transcription factors that may regulate LIF and IL6 mRNA. The involvement of these transcription factors was studied after targeted gene-silencing by siRNA. siRNA silencing of the transcription factors nuclear transcription factor Y subunit c ( Nfyc), specificity protein 1 ( Sp1), and zinc finger and BTB domain containing 14 ( Zbtb14), or AMPK alpha1/alpha2 subunits, increased constitutive levels of Il6 and Lif. Our results identify novel candidates in the regulation of skeletal muscle cytokine expression and identify AMPK, Nfyc, Sp1, and Zbtb14 as novel regulators of immunometabolic signals from skeletal muscle.","['Nylen, Carolina', 'Aoi, Wataru', 'Abdelmoez, Ahmed M', 'Lassiter, David G', 'Lundell, Leonidas S', 'Wallberg-Henriksson, Harriet', 'Naslund, Erik', 'Pillon, Nicolas J', 'Krook, Anna']","['Nylen C', 'Aoi W', 'Abdelmoez AM', 'Lassiter DG', 'Lundell LS', 'Wallberg-Henriksson H', 'Naslund E', 'Pillon NJ', 'Krook A']","['Integrative Physiology, Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Karolinska Institutet , Stockholm , Sweden.', 'Integrative Physiology, Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Karolinska Institutet , Stockholm , Sweden.', 'Division of Applied Life Sciences, Graduate School of Life and Environmental Sciences Kyoto Prefectural University , Kyoto , Japan.', 'Integrative Physiology, Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Karolinska Institutet , Stockholm , Sweden.', 'Integrative Physiology, Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Karolinska Institutet , Stockholm , Sweden.', 'Integrative Physiology, Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Karolinska Institutet , Stockholm , Sweden.', 'Integrative Physiology, Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Karolinska Institutet , Stockholm , Sweden.', 'Division of Surgery, Department of Clinical Sciences, Danderyd Hospital, Karolinska Institutet , Stockholm , Sweden.', 'Integrative Physiology, Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Karolinska Institutet , Stockholm , Sweden.', 'Integrative Physiology, Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Karolinska Institutet , Stockholm , Sweden.']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-1107-9490'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180424,United States,Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab,American journal of physiology.

In the present study, we investigated the effects of DCZ3301 on T-cell leukemia/lymphoma cells both in vitro and in vivo via cell proliferation, cell cycle analysis, apoptosis assay, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) assay, western blot analysis and tumor xenograft models. We found that DCZ3301 inhibited the viability of T-cell leukemia/lymphoma cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. DCZ3301-induced G2/M cell cycle arrest, associated with downregulation of CDK1, cyclin B1, and cdc25C. DCZ3301 also induced cell apoptosis by decreasing MMP in T-cell leukemia/lymphoma cells, but had no significant pro-apoptotic effect on normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). In addition, DCZ3301-induced apoptosis may be mediated by the caspase-dependent pathway and suppressing the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway. Finally, we showed that DCZ3301 treatment effectively inhibited tumor growth, with no significant side effects, in xenograft mouse models.

We assessed the treatment and outcome of TYA patients (aged 16-24 years) recruited to the UKALL2003 trial, who relapsed following attainment of complete morphological remission. Forty-two of 223 patients (18.8%) relapsed, the majority (n = 26, 62%) on treatment. Thirty-eight (90%) patients received salvage treatment, with 22 (58%) achieving second remission (CR2) and 21 patients receiving an allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplant (alloHSCT). Post-relapse outcomes were poor with a 5-year overall survival (OS) of 23% (95% confidence interval; 11-37%). Outcomes for patients relapsing on active treatment were inferior to those relapsing after completing treatment (5-year OS 9% vs. 52%, log-rank P = 0.001). No patient with B cell ALL relapsing on treatment was alive at the end of the study period. TYA patients with ALL who relapse on the UK paediatric protocol, UKALL2003, are largely unsalvageable with conventional approaches aimed at achieving CR2 followed by alloHSCT. Future efforts should be aimed at identifying those patients who are destined to relapse and exploring novel treatment approaches for this high-risk group and for those who do relapse.","['Sellar, Rob S', 'Rowntree, Clare', 'Vora, Ajay J', 'Furness, Caroline L', 'Goulden, Nicholas', 'Mitchell, Chris', 'Moorman, Anthony V', 'Hough, Rachael']","['Sellar RS', 'Rowntree C', 'Vora AJ', 'Furness CL', 'Goulden N', 'Mitchell C', 'Moorman AV', 'Hough R']","['Cancer Institute, University College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, University College London Hospitals, London, United Kingdom.', 'University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, United Kingdom.', ""Department of Paediatric Haematology, The Children's Hospital, Sheffield, United Kingdom."", 'Haemato-Oncology, Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, London, United Kingdom.', 'John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, United Kingdom.', 'Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Institute, University College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, University College London Hospitals, London, United Kingdom.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-0472-7034', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2284-4365', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7616-443X']",['eng'],"['Clinical Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180424,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/*drug therapy/*mortality', 'Recurrence', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Survival Rate', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', '*allogeneic transplant', '*relapse', '*salvage chemotherapy', '*teenage and young adults']",2018/04/25 06:00,2019/03/26 06:00,['2018/04/25 06:00'],"['2017/11/07 00:00 [received]', '2018/01/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/26 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.15208 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2018 May;181(4):515-522. doi: 10.1111/bjh.15208.

To investigate the relationship between SCNAs and somatic mutations, we performed whole-exome sequencing and single nucleotide polymorphism microarray analyses on 98 CLL patients from 40 families with a high burden of CLL. Overall, 69 somatic mutations in 29 CLL driver genes were detected among 45 subjects (46%), with the most frequently mutated genes being TP53 (8.2%), NOTCH1 (8.2%) and ATM (5.1%). Additionally, 142 SCNAs from 54 subjects (57%) were detected, including losses of chromosome 13q14 (28.9%), 11q (5.6%), 17p (2.1%), and gain of chromosome 12 (4.2%). We found that patients having both an adverse point mutation in a CLL driver gene and an unfavourable SCNA tended to have poorer survival (Hazard ratio [HR] = 3.17, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.97-10.35; P = 0.056) than patients having either a point mutation (HR = 1.34, 95%CI = 0.66-2.71; P = 0.42) or SCNAs (HR = 2.65, 95%CI = 0.77-9.13; P = 0.12). TP53 mutation carriers were associated with the poorest overall survival (HR = 4.39, 95%CI = 1.28-15.04; P = 0.018).

We identified potentially relevant articles through a search of electronic databases which included all studies of pesticide exposure and human cancer. A total of 18 articles were selected, including six identified from the list of references of other articles. Most articles were based on analyzes of the Agriculture Health Study (AHS); they provided no evidence of an increased risk of cancers of colon, rectum, pancreas, lung, melanoma, female breast, prostate, urinary bladder, as well as non-Hodgkin lymphoma (including its main subtypes), and leukemia. An increased risk of multiple myeloma was reported among AHS members with the highest tertile of estimated permethrin exposure (odds ratio 5.01; 95% confidence interval 2.41-10.42; p for trend <0.01). A subsequent analysis with a larger number of cases found a less pronounced association between permethrin exposure and risk of multiple myeloma; no exposed cases were reported in a separate study. Two case-control studies of childhood leukemia reported an association with biological markers of permethrin metabolites; in another study self-reported exposure to permethrin was associated with risk in children below 1 year of age, but not in older children. In conclusion, permethrin exposure does not seem to entail a risk of cancer in humans. Results on multiple myeloma and childhood leukemia are weak and inconsistent, and require replication in independent populations.","['Boffetta, Paolo', 'Desai, Vimi']","['Boffetta P', 'Desai V']","['a Tisch Cancer institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai , New York , NY , USA.', 'a Tisch Cancer institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai , New York , NY , USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Systematic Review']",20180424,England,Crit Rev Toxicol,Critical reviews in toxicology,8914275,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Insecticides)', '509F88P9SZ (Permethrin)']",,"['Carcinogens/toxicity', 'Environmental Exposure/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Insecticides/*toxicity', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Permethrin/*toxicity', 'Risk']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Multiple myeloma', '*cancer', '*epidemiology', '*insecticides', '*permethrin']",2018/04/25 06:00,2019/07/30 06:00,['2018/04/25 06:00'],"['2018/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/30 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10408444.2018.1439449 [doi]'],ppublish,Crit Rev Toxicol. 2018 Jul;48(6):433-442. doi: 10.1080/10408444.2018.1439449.

A survey was conducted in all Dutch academic haematology centres on their current diagnostic, prophylactic and therapeutic approach towards IFD in the context of azole-resistance. In all 8 centres, a haematologist and microbiologist filled in the questionnaire that focused on different subgroups of haematology patients. Fungal prophylaxis during neutropaenia was directed against Candida and consisted of fluconazole and/or amphotericin B suspension. Mould-active prophylaxis was given to acute myeloid leukaemia patients during chemotherapy in 2 of 8 centres. All centres used azole prophylaxis in a subset of patients with graft-versus-host disease. A uniform approach towards the diagnosis and treatment of IFD and in particular azole-resistant Aspergillus fumigatus was lacking. In 2017, all centres agreed to implement a uniform diagnostic and treatment algorithm regarding invasive aspergillosis with a central role for comprehensive diagnostics and PCR-based detection of azole-resistance. This study (DB-MSG 002) will re-evaluate this algorithm when 280 patients have been treated. A heterogeneous approach towards antifungal prophylaxis, diagnosis and treatment was apparent in the Netherlands. Facing triazole-resistance, consensus was reached on the implementation of a uniform diagnostic approach in all 8 centres.","['Schauwvlieghe, Alexander F A D', 'de Jonge, Nick', 'van Dijk, Karin', 'Verweij, Paul E', 'Bruggemann, Roger J', 'Biemond, Bart J', 'Bart, Aldert', 'von dem Borne, Peter A', 'Verbon, Annelies', 'van der Beek, Martha T', 'Demandt, Astrid M P', 'Oudhuis, Guy J', 'Cornelissen, Jan J', 'van der Velden, Walter J F M', 'Span, Lambert F R', 'Kampinga, Greetje A', 'Bruns, Anke H', 'Vonk, Alieke G', 'Haas, Pieter-Jan A', 'Doorduijn, Jeanette K', 'Rijnders, Bart J A']","['Schauwvlieghe AFAD', 'de Jonge N', 'van Dijk K', 'Verweij PE', 'Bruggemann RJ', 'Biemond BJ', 'Bart A', 'von dem Borne PA', 'Verbon A', 'van der Beek MT', 'Demandt AMP', 'Oudhuis GJ', 'Cornelissen JJ', 'van der Velden WJFM', 'Span LFR', 'Kampinga GA', 'Bruns AH', 'Vonk AG', 'Haas PA', 'Doorduijn JK', 'Rijnders BJA']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Infectious Diseases, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Haematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Medical Microbiology and Infection Control, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Medical Microbiology, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Center of Expertise in Mycology Radboudumc/CWZ, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Haematology, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Medical Microbiology (CINIMA), Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Haematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Infectious Diseases, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Medical Microbiology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Haematology, Maastricht University Medical Center, Maastricht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Medical Microbiology, Maastricht University Medical Center, Maastricht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Haematology, Erasmus MC Cancer Institute, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Haematology, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Haematology, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Medical Microbiology, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and Infectious Diseases, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Medical Microbiology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Medical Microbiology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Haematology, Erasmus MC Cancer Institute, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Infectious Diseases, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3224-3969'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180713,Germany,Mycoses,Mycoses,8805008,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Azoles)']",IM,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Antifungal Agents/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Aspergillus fumigatus/drug effects', 'Azoles/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Chemoprevention/methods', '*Disease Management', '*Drug Resistance, Fungal', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications', 'Humans', 'Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/prevention & control', 'Netherlands', 'Prevalence', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",['NOTNLM'],"['IFD', 'azole-resistance', 'invasive aspergillosis', 'management']",2018/04/25 06:00,2019/06/14 06:00,['2018/04/25 06:00'],"['2017/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/16 00:00 [revised]', '2018/04/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/myc.12788 [doi]'],ppublish,Mycoses. 2018 Sep;61(9):656-664. doi: 10.1111/myc.12788.

With four agents currently approved for frontline use in chronic-phase (CP) disease, it follows that treatment decision-making has been rendered more challenging. Here we will review recent advances that help inform the selection of a first-line TKI. RECENT FINDINGS: Extended follow-up of the seminal CML trials has demonstrated the long-term efficacy of TKIs, while also highlighting significant differences in their respective toxicity profiles and potency. Dasatinib and nilotinib generate deeper molecular responses than imatinib, particularly among patients with higher risk disease, but this has not translated into a significant survival advantage. Similar results have been obtained at 1 year with bosutinib; its efficacy and toxicity were well balanced at a dose of 400 mg daily, prompting its recent approval for this indication. Lastly, multiple studies have demonstrated that TKIs can be safely discontinued in select individuals who have maintained deep responses for extended periods, establishing treatment-free remission as a novel goal in CP CML.

To this end, we recently developed a chemically defined cell culture medium that robustly expands all T cell subsets in the absence of human serum. Using a humanized mouse model, we observed that T cells expanded in the absence of human serum provided durable control of tumors, whereas T cells expanded in medium supplemented with human serum only mediated transient control of tumor growth. Importantly, our new medium effectively expanded more differentiated T cells from multiple myeloma patients in the absence of serum. These patient-derived T cells were also able to provide durable control of B cell tumors in vivo, and this long-term control of cancer was lost when T cells were expanded in the presence of serum. Thus, engineered T cells expanded in an optimized medium in the absence of serum may have improved therapeutic potential.","['Medvec, Andrew R', 'Ecker, Christopher', 'Kong, Hong', 'Winters, Emily A', 'Glover, Joshua', 'Varela-Rohena, Angel', 'Riley, James L']","['Medvec AR', 'Ecker C', 'Kong H', 'Winters EA', 'Glover J', 'Varela-Rohena A', 'Riley JL']","['Department of Microbiology and Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.', 'Gibco BioProduction Cell Culture and Cell Therapy, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 3175 Staley Road, Grand Island, NY 14072, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20171107,United States,Mol Ther Methods Clin Dev,Molecular therapy.

Here we combined sequencing of the TCR-encoding genes with assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (ATAC-seq) analysis at the single-cell level to provide information on the TCR specificity and epigenomic state of individual T cells. By using this approach, termed transcript-indexed ATAC-seq (T-ATAC-seq), we identified epigenomic signatures in immortalized leukemic T cells, primary human T cells from healthy volunteers and primary leukemic T cells from patient samples. In peripheral blood CD4(+) T cells from healthy individuals, we identified cis and trans regulators of naive and memory T cell states and found substantial heterogeneity in surface-marker-defined T cell populations. In patients with a leukemic form of cutaneous T cell lymphoma, T-ATAC-seq enabled identification of leukemic and nonleukemic regulatory pathways in T cells from the same individual by allowing separation of the signals that arose from the malignant clone from the background T cell noise. Thus, T-ATAC-seq is a new tool that enables analysis of epigenomic landscapes in clonal T cells and should be valuable for studies of T cell malignancy, immunity and immunotherapy.","['Satpathy,

The m(6)A modification is deposited by the m(6)A methyltransferase complex (MTC; i.e., writer) composed of METTL3, METTL14 and WTAP, and probably also VIRMA and RBM15, and can be removed by m(6)A demethylases (i.e., erasers) such as FTO and ALKBH5. The fates of m(6)A-modified mRNAs rely on the functions of distinct proteins that recognize them (i.e., readers), which may affect the stability, splicing, and/or translation of target mRNAs. Given the functional importance of the m(6)A modification machinery in normal bioprocesses, it is not surprising that evidence is emerging that dysregulation of m(6)A modification and the associated proteins also contributes to the initiation, progression, and drug response of cancers. In this review, we focus on recent advances in the study of biological functions and the underlying molecular mechanisms of dysregulated m(6)A modification and the associated machinery in the pathogenesis and drug response of various types of cancers. In addition, we also discuss possible therapeutic interventions against the dysregulated m(6)A machinery to treat cancers.","['Deng, Xiaolan', 'Su, Rui', 'Weng, Hengyou', 'Huang, Huilin', 'Li, Zejuan', 'Chen, Jianjun']","['Deng X', 'Su R', 'Weng H', 'Huang H', 'Li Z', 'Chen J']","['Department of Systems Biology & the Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, The Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope, Monrovia, CA, 91016, USA. xideng@coh.org.', 'School of Pharmacy, China Medical University, Shenyang, 110122, China. xideng@coh.org.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, 45219, USA. xideng@coh.org.', 'Department of Systems Biology & the Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, The Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope, Monrovia, CA, 91016, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, 45219, USA.', 'Department of Systems Biology & the Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, The Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope, Monrovia, CA, 91016, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, 45219, USA.', 'Department of Systems Biology & the Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, The Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope, Monrovia, CA, 91016, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, 45219, USA.', 'Department of Human Genetics, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, 60637, USA.', 'Department of Systems Biology & the Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, The Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope, Monrovia, CA, 91016, USA. jianchen@coh.org.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, 45219, USA. jianchen@coh.org.']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-3749-2902'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180423,England,Cell Res,Cell research,9425763,"['63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'CLE6G00625 (N-methyladenosine)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",IM,"['Adenosine/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/metabolism', 'Carcinogenesis/metabolism/pathology', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'RNA/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",,,2018/04/25 06:00,2019/09/14 06:00,['2018/04/25 06:00'],"['2017/12/21 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/14 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41422-018-0034-6 [doi]', '10.1038/s41422-018-0034-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Cell Res. 2018 May;28(5):507-517. doi: 10.1038/s41422-018-0034-6.

SIRT2 has been implicated in carcinogenesis in various cancers including leukaemia and is considered an attractive target for cancer therapy. Here, we identified NPD11033, a selective small-molecule SIRT2 inhibitor, by a high-throughput screen using the RIKEN NPDepo chemical library. NPD11033 was largely inactive against other sirtuins and zinc-dependent deacetylases. Crystallographic analysis revealed a unique mode of action, in which NPD11033 creates a hydrophobic cavity behind the substrate-binding pocket after a conformational change of the Zn-binding small domain of SIRT2. Furthermore, it forms a hydrogen bond to the active site histidine residue. In addition, NPD11033 inhibited cell growth of human pancreatic cancer PANC-1 cells with a concomitant increase in the acetylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A, a physiological substrate of SIRT2. Importantly, NPD11033 failed to inhibit defatty-acylase activity of SIRT2, despite its potent inhibitory effect on its deacetylase activity. Thus, NPD11033 will serve as a useful tool for both developing novel anti-cancer agents and elucidating the role of SIRT2 in various cellular biological processes.This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'Frontiers in epigenetic chemical biology'.","['Kudo, Norio', 'Ito, Akihiro', 'Arata, Mayumi', 'Nakata, Akiko', 'Yoshida, Minoru']","['Kudo N', 'Ito A', 'Arata M', 'Nakata A', 'Yoshida M']","['Seed Compounds Exploratory Unit for Drug Discovery Platform, RIKEN Center for Sustainable Resource Science, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, Japan.', 'Chemical Genomics Research Group, RIKEN Center for Sustainable Resource Science, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, Japan.', 'School of Life Sciences, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, 1432-1 Horinouchi, Hachioji, Tokyo 192-0392, Japan.', 'Seed Compounds Exploratory Unit for Drug Discovery Platform, RIKEN Center for Sustainable Resource Science, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, Japan.', 'Seed Compounds Exploratory Unit for Drug Discovery Platform, RIKEN Center for Sustainable Resource Science, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, Japan.', 'Seed Compounds Exploratory Unit for Drug Discovery Platform, RIKEN Center for Sustainable Resource Science, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, Japan yoshidam@riken.jp.', 'Chemical Genomics Research Group, RIKEN Center for Sustainable Resource Science, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, Japan.', 'Chemical Genetics Laboratory, RIKEN, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, Japan.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Yayoi, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-4376-5674'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci,"Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

We aimed to review current literature of ATLL in order to consider it as a differential diagnosis in front of patients with compatible symptoms. Prognosis is still poor in aggressive and indolent variants, with survival rates from months to few years. Treatment based on chemotherapy, antiretroviral, and allogenic stem cell transplantation are currently improving survival rates, but with limited results.","['Rodriguez-Zuniga, M J M', 'Cortez-Franco, F', 'Qujiano-Gomero, E']","['Rodriguez-Zuniga MJM', 'Cortez-Franco F', 'Qujiano-Gomero E']","['Servicio de Dermatologia, Hospital Nacional Daniel Alcides Carrion, Callao, Peru; Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Lima, Peru.

BLV ELISA variability between samples from the same herd or from different herds has not been investigated over long time periods. The main objective of this study was to determine the within-herd and between-herd variability of a BTM BLV ELISA assay over 1-month, 3-month, and 3-year sampling intervals. All of the Canadian Maritime region dairy herds (n=523) that were active in 2013 and 2016 were included (83.9% and 86.9% of total herds in 2013 and 2016, respectively). BLV antibody levels were measured in three BTM samples collected at 1-month intervals in early 2013 as well as two BTM samples collected over a 3-month interval in early 2016. Random-effects models, with fixed effects for sample replicate and province and random effects for herd, were used to estimate the variability between BTM samples from the same herd and between herds for 1-month, 3-month, and 3-year sampling intervals. The majority of variability of BTM BLV ELISA results was seen between herds (1-month, 6.792+/-0.533; 3-month, 7.806+/-0.652; 3-year, 6.222+/-0.528). Unexplained variance between samples from the same herd, on square-root scale, was greatest for the 3-year (0.976+/-0.104), followed by the 1-month (0.611+/-0.035) then the 3-month (0.557+/-0.071) intervals. Variability of BTM antibody levels within the same herd was present but was much smaller than the variability between herds, and was greatest for the 3-year sampling interval. The 3-month sampling interval resulted in the least variability and is appropriate to use for estimating the baseline level of within-herd prevalence for BLV control programs. Knowledge of the baseline variability and within-herd prevalence can help to determine effectiveness of control programs when BTM sampling is repeated at longer intervals.","['John, Emily E', 'Nekouei, Omid', 'McClure, J T', 'Cameron, Marguerite', 'Keefe, Greg', 'Stryhn, Henrik']","['John EE', 'Nekouei O', 'McClure JT', 'Cameron M', 'Keefe G', 'Stryhn H']","['Department of Health Management, Atlantic Veterinary College, University of Prince Edward Island, 550 University Ave, Charlottetown, PE, C1A 4P3, Canada.

However, it is still unknown that the reason why CD25 positive AML patients have a dismal clinical outcome. CD25 positive AML cells are generally unresponsive to IL-2, but strongly respond to IL-3. The levels of IL-3Ralpha on these AML cells are very high and directly proportional to the CD25 levels. T-lymphocytes produce IL-3 in response to stimuli including IL-2-mediated activation. Thus, CD25 on AML cells may capture environmental IL-2 and deliver it to the surrounding T-lymphocytes expressing IL-2Rbeta/gammac, leading to the production of IL-3 as a growth stimulus to CD25 positive AML cells. We hypothesize that IL-2/IL-3 interplay via CD25 is responsible for the growth property of CD25 positive AML, which may affect clinical behavior of those patients.","['Nakase, Kazunori', 'Kita, Kenkichi', 'Katayama, Naoyuki']","['Nakase K', 'Kita K', 'Katayama N']","['Cancer Center, Mie University Hospital, Tsu, Japan.

However, the biological role of BMI1 and its relevant molecular mechanism needs further elaboration. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 system is an excellent genome-editing tool and is scarcely used in EOC studies. METHODS: We first applied CRISPR/Cas9 technique to silence BMI1 in EOC cells; thereafter we accomplished various in vivo and in vitro experiments to detect biological behaviors of ovarian cancer cells, including MTT, flow cytometry, Transwell, real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blotting assays, etc.; eventually, we used RNA sequencing to reveal the underlying molecular traits driven by BMI1 in EOC. RESULTS: We successfully shut off the expression of BMI1 in EOC cells using CRISPR/Cas9 system, providing an ideal cellular model for investigations of target gene. Silencing BMI1 could reduce cell growth and metastasis, promote cell apoptosis, and enhance the platinum sensitivity of EOC cells. BMI1 might alter extracellular matrix structure and angiogenesis of tumor cells through regulating Focal adhesion and PI3K/AKT pathways. CONCLUSION: BMI1 is a potential biomarker in EOC management, especially for tumor progression and chemo-resistance. Molecular traits, including BMI1 and core genes in Focal adhesion and PI3K/AKT pathways, might be alternatives as therapeutic targets for EOC.","['Zhao, Qianying', 'Qian, Qiuhong', 'Cao, Dongyan', 'Yang, Jiaxin', 'Gui, Ting', 'Shen, Keng']","['Zhao Q', 'Qian Q', 'Cao D', 'Yang J', 'Gui T', 'Shen K']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, No.1 Shuaifuyuan, Dongcheng District, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University, Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children (Sichuan University), Ministry of Education, Chengdu, China.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, No.1 Shuaifuyuan, Dongcheng District, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Shandong, China.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, No.1 Shuaifuyuan, Dongcheng District, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, No.1 Shuaifuyuan, Dongcheng District, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, No.1 Shuaifuyuan, Dongcheng District, Beijing, China. gt_greating@sina.com.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, No.1 Shuaifuyuan, Dongcheng District, Beijing, China. shenkeng.pumc@hotmail.com.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180423,England,J Ovarian Res,Journal of ovarian research,101474849,"['0 (BMI1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', '*CRISPR-Cas Systems', 'Carcinoma, Ovarian Epithelial', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Focal Adhesions/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Silencing', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/*methods', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness/genetics', 'Neoplasms, Glandular and Epithelial/*genetics/pathology', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus integration site 1 (BMI1)', 'Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9', 'Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC)', 'Focal adhesion pathway', 'PI3K/AKT pathway']",2018/04/25 06:00,2018/10/03 06:00,['2018/04/25 06:00'],"['2018/01/16 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/03 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13048-018-0406-z [doi]', '10.1186/s13048-018-0406-z [pii]']",epublish,J Ovarian Res. 2018 Apr 23;11(1):31. doi: 10.1186/s13048-018-0406-z.,,,"['81372780/National Natural Science Foundation of China (CN)', '81402140/National Natural Science Foundation of China (CN)']",PMC5911954,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells are T cells with recombinant receptors targeting tumor-associated antigens. The Food and Drug Administration has approved CAR T cells that target CD19 for treatment of advanced B cell leukemia and lymphoma. However, CAR T cell therapy in solid tumors has been hampered by multiple obstacles. Preclinical and clinical studies suggest that combinatorial immune checkpoint blockade and IDO1 inhibition provide durable therapeutic efficacy against cancer. Yet, the combination of IDO1 inhibition and CAR T has not been attempted. METHODS: We analyze IDO1 downregulation by miR-153 in colon cancer cells and the association of IDO1 and miR-153 expression with colorectal patient survival. We generate CAR T cells targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor variant III and measure their tumor killing effects against colon cancer cells with or without miR-153 overexpression by killing assays and in xenografts. RESULTS: IDO1 is highly expressed in colorectal tumors and is inversely associated with patient survival. miR-153 directly inhibits IDO1 expression by targeting its 3' untranslated region in colon cancer cells; yet, miR-153 overexpression does not affect cancer cell survival, apoptosis, and colony formation. When colon cancer cells are targeted by CAR T cells, miR-153 overexpression within tumor cells significantly enhances T cell killing in vitro and suppresses xenograft tumor growth in mice. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that miR-153 inhibits IDO1 expression in colon cancer cells and is a tumor-suppressive miRNA that enhances CAR T cell immunotherapy. This study supports the combinatorial use of IDO1 inhibitors and CAR T cells in treating solid tumors.","['Huang, Qian', 'Xia, Jiajia', 'Wang, Lei', 'Wang, Xu', 'Ma, Xiaodong', 'Deng, Qipan', 'Lu, Yong', 'Kumar, Munish', 'Zhou, Zhiyuan', 'Li, Ling', 'Zeng, Zhaoyang', 'Young, Ken H', 'Yi, Qing', 'Zhang, Mingzhi', 'Li, Yong']","['Huang Q', 'Xia J', 'Wang L', 'Wang X', 'Ma X', 'Deng Q', 'Lu Y', 'Kumar M', 'Zhou Z', 'Li L', 'Zeng Z', 'Young KH', 'Yi Q', 'Zhang M', 'Li Y']","['Department of Cancer Biology, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, 44195, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, 44195, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, 44195, USA.', 'Institute for Brain Research and Rehabilitation, South China Normal University, Guangzhou, 510631, China.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, 44195, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, 44195, USA.', 'Institute for Brain Research and Rehabilitation, South China Normal University, Guangzhou, 510631, China.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, 44195, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, 44195, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, 44195, USA.', 'Raman Fellow (UGC), Department of Biochemistry, University of Allahabad, Allahabad, India.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, 44195, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Lymphoma Diagnosis and Treatment Center of Henan Province, Zhengzhou, 450000, Henan Province, China.', 'Department of Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Lymphoma Diagnosis and Treatment Center of Henan Province, Zhengzhou, 450000, Henan Province, China.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Central South University, Changsha, 410078, China.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, 44195, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Lymphoma Diagnosis and Treatment Center of Henan Province, Zhengzhou, 450000, Henan Province, China.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, 44195, USA. liy2@ccf.org.']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-8838-1714'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180423,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (IDO1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Indoleamine-Pyrrole 2,3,-Dioxygenase)', '0 (MIRN153 microRNA, mouse)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Indoleamine-Pyrrole 2,3,-Dioxygenase/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Microenvironment']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)', '*Colon cancer', '*Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1)', '*T cells', '*Tumor microenvironment', '*miR-153']",2018/04/25 06:00,2019/10/28 06:00,['2018/04/25 06:00'],"['2018/02/27 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13045-018-0600-x [doi]', '10.1186/s13045-018-0600-x [pii]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2018 Apr 23;11(1):58. doi: 10.1186/s13045-018-0600-x.,,,['R01 CA177810/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC5914051,,,,['J Hematol Oncol. 2018 Jul 3;11(1):90.

During the progression of epithelial cancer, activation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition is tightly associated with metastasis, stemness and drug resistance. However, the role of epithelial-mesenchymal transition in non-epithelial cancer is relatively unclear. MAIN BODY: Epithelial-mesenchymal transition transcription factors are critical in both myeloid and lymphoid development. Growing evidence indicates their roles in cancer cells to promote leukemia and lymphoma progression. The expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition transcription factors can cause the differentiation of indolent type to the aggressive type of lymphoma. Their up-regulation confers cancer cells resistant to chemotherapy, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and radiotherapy. Conversely, the down-regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition transcription factors, monoclonal antibodies, induce lymphoma cells apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: Epithelial-mesenchymal transition transcription factors are potentially important prognostic or predictive factors and treatment targets for leukemia and lymphoma.","['Chen, San-Chi', 'Liao, Tsai-Tsen', 'Yang, Muh-Hwa']","['Chen SC', 'Liao TT', 'Yang MH']","['Institute of Clinical Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, No. 155, Sec. 2, Li-Nong Street, Taipei, 11221, Taiwan.', 'Faculty of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Oncology, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Clinical Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, No. 155, Sec. 2, Li-Nong Street, Taipei, 11221, Taiwan.', 'Cancer Progression Center of Excellence, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Otolaryngology, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Clinical Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, No. 155, Sec. 2, Li-Nong Street, Taipei, 11221, Taiwan. mhyang2@vghtpe.gov.tw.', 'Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Oncology, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan. mhyang2@vghtpe.gov.tw.', 'Cancer Progression Center of Excellence, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan. mhyang2@vghtpe.gov.tw.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180423,England,J Biomed Sci,Journal of biomedical science,9421567,['0 (Transcription Factors)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition/*physiology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['Epithelial-mesenchymal transition', 'Leukemia', 'Lymphoma']",2018/04/25 06:00,2018/09/12 06:00,['2018/04/25 06:00'],"['2018/01/30 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12929-018-0440-6 [doi]', '10.1186/s12929-018-0440-6 [pii]']",epublish,J Biomed Sci. 2018 Apr 23;25(1):37. doi: 10.1186/s12929-018-0440-6.,,,"['NHRI-EX107-10622BI/National health research institute', 'V107C-071/Taipei Veterans General Hospital', 'MOHW106-TDU-B-211-144-003/Ministry of Health and Welfare']",PMC5913878,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We correlated HBV-related pathogenesis in genetically engineered mice and human carriers with metabolic proteomics and lipogenic gene expression profiles. The immunohistochemistry showed that the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML, a tumor suppressor involved in genome maintenance and fatty acid oxidation), being inversely influenced by the dynamic HBsAg levels from acute phase to seroclearance, appeared as a lipo-metabolic switch linking HBsAg-induced steatosis (lipogenesis) to HBsAg-lost fat-burning hepatocarcinogenesis (lipolysis). Knockdown of PML in HBsAg-transgenic mice predisposed to obesity and drove early steatosis-specific liver tumorigenesis. Proteome analysis revealed that the signaling pathways corresponding to energy metabolism and its regulators were frequently altered by suppression or depletion of PML in the HBsAg-transgenic mice, mainly including oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid metabolism. Expression profiling further identified upregulation of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (Scd1) and epigenetic methylation of NDUFA13 in the mitochondrial respiratory chain and the cell cycle inhibitor CDKN1c in concordance to the increased severity of lipodystrophy and neoplasia in the livers of HBsAg-transgenic mice with PML insufficiency. The defect in lipolysis in PML-deficient HBsAg-transgenic mice made the HBsAg-induced adipose-like liver tumors vulnerable to synthetic lethality from toxic saturated fat accumulation with a Scd1 inhibitor. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the evolution of steatosis-associated hepatic tumors driven by reciprocal interactions of HBsAg and PML, and a potential utility of lipid metabolic reprogramming as a treatment target.","['Chung, Yih-Lin', 'Wu, Mei-Ling']","['Chung YL', 'Wu ML']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Koo Foundation Sun-Yat-Sen Cancer Center, Taipei 112, Taiwan.

Though well tolerated, high relapse rates remain a concern with this regimen. Intensification of conditioning may reduce relapse without increasing transplant-related mortality (TRM). We performed a retrospective cohort comparison of outcomes in adult patients who underwent first double-unit CBT with standard RIC as compared with the intensified regimen of Flu 150 mg/m(2), Cy 50 mg/kg, thiotepa 10 mg/kg, and 400-cGy TBI (intensified RIC). Of the 99 patients studied, 47 received intensified RIC. Acute myelogenous leukemia was the major indication for transplant. The median age at transplant was 67 years (range, 24 to 74 years) and 54 years (range, 25 to 67 years) in standard RIC and intensified RIC, respectively. Median hematopoietic stem cell transplantation comorbidity index was 3 (range, 0 to 5) and 1 (range, 0 to 6) in the standard RIC and intensified RIC groups, respectively. Median follow-up among survivors was 22 months (range, 3.7 to 79 months) following standard RIC and 15 months (range, 2.8 to 36 months) following intensified RIC. The cumulative incidence (CI) of relapse was significantly lower following intensified RIC compared with standard RIC (P = .0013); this finding maintained significance in multivariate analysis (P = .045). TRM was comparable between the 2 groups (P = .99). Overall survival (OS) was significantly improved following intensified RIC as compared with standard RIC (P = .03). Median OS was 17 months following standard RIC versus not reached followed intensified RIC. The CI of grade II to IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was significantly higher in the intensified RIC cohort than the standard RIC-cohort (P = .007), while CI of grade III to IV acute GVHD, any chronic GVHD, and moderate-to-severe chronic GVHD was comparable in each cohort (P = .20, P = .21, and P = .61, respectively). This retrospective analysis shows an improvement in OS and decreased relapse without increase in TRM in patients receiving intensified RIC as compared with standard RIC.

Measurable residual disease (MRD) detected by multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) before and after HCT is a strong, independent risk factor for relapse. As next-generation sequencing (NGS) is increasingly applied in AML MRD detection, it remains to be determined if NGS can improve prediction of post-HCT relapse. Herein, we investigated pre-HCT MRD detected by MFC and NGS in 59 adult patients with NPM1-mutated AML in morphologic remission; 45 of the 59 had post-HCT MRD determined by MFC and NGS around day 28. Before HCT, MRD detected by MFC was the most significant risk factor for relapse (hazard ratio [HR], 4.63; P < .001), whereas MRD detected only by NGS was not. After HCT, MRD detected by either MFC or NGS was significant risk factor for relapse (HR, 4.96, P = .004 and HR, 4.36, P = .002, respectively). Combining pre- and post-HCT MRD provided the best prediction for relapse (HR, 5.25; P < .001), with a sensitivity at 83%.

The aim of this study is to determine the hospital outcome of critically ill patients with HM and the factors predicting the outcome. METHODS AND MATERIALS: All patients with HM admitted to MICU at a tertiary academic medical center were enrolled. Clinical data upon admission and during ICU stay were collected. Hospital, ICU, and 6months outcomes were documented. RESULTS: There were 130 HM patients during the study period. Acute Leukemia was the most common malignancy (31.5%) followed by Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (28.5%). About 12.5% patients had autologous HSCT and 51.5% had allogeneic HSCT. Sepsis was the most common ICU diagnosis (25.9%). ICU mortality and hospital mortality were 24.8% and 45.3%, respectively. Six months mortality (available on 80% of patients) was 56.7%. Hospital mortality was higher among mechanically ventilated patients (75%). Using multivariate analysis, only mechanical ventilation (OR of 19.0, CI: 3.1-117.4, P: 0.001) and allogeneic HSCT (OR of 10.9, CI: 1.8-66.9, P: 0.01) predicted hospital mortality. CONCLUSION: Overall hospital outcome of critically ill patients with HM is improving. However those who require mechanical ventilation or underwent allogeneic HSCT continue to have poor outcome.","['Al-Zubaidi, Nassar', 'Shehada, Emad', 'Alshabani, Khaled', 'ZazaDitYafawi, Jihane', 'Kingah, Pascal', 'Soubani, Ayman O']","['Al-Zubaidi N', 'Shehada E', 'Alshabani K', 'ZazaDitYafawi J', 'Kingah P', 'Soubani AO']","['Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, United States.', 'Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, United States.', 'Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, United States.', 'Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, United States.', 'Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, United States.', 'Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, United States.

The neoplasm can occur in any part of the body, including the bone, periosteum, lymph nodes, skin, and soft tissue and they may occur de novo or in association with acute myeloid leukemia, myeloproliferative neoplasms and myelodysplastic syndromes. Most cases display a myelomonocytic or pure monoblastic morphology. Tumors with megakaryoblastic differentiation are extremely uncommon and may occur in association with transformation of a myeloproliferative disorder. Myeloid sarcoma presenting as a breast mass is very rare and diagnostically challenging. We report a case of myeloid sarcoma with megakaryoblastic differentiation in the breast of a patient with history of essential thrombocythemia. The mass was composed of undifferentiated pleomorphic malignant cells in trabecular cords and nests with many scattered giant malignant cells and brisk abnormal mitoses. On immunohistochemistry, the neoplastic cells were positive for CD61, CD31, CD34, Factor VIII and CD43 which confirmed the diagnosis. To our knowledge, this is the first report of myeloid sarcoma with megakaryoblastic morphology occurring in the breast. Here we discuss the clinicopathologic features of this rare entity and the challenges involved in making this difficult diagnosis.","['Obiorah, Ifeyinwa E', 'Ozdemirli, Metin']","['Obiorah IE', 'Ozdemirli M']","['Department of Pathology, Medstar Georgetown University Hospital, Washington, D.C. 20007, United States.

In this study, we aimed to investigate candidate pharmacogenetic determinants of 6-MP and MTX intolerance in Turkish ALL children. METHODS: In total, 48 children with ALL who had completed or were receiving maintenance therapy according to Children's Oncology Group (COG) protocols were enrolled. Fifteen single-nucleotide polymorphisms in 8 candidate genes that were related to drug toxicity or had a role in the 6-MP/MTX metabolism (TPMT, ITPA, MTHFR, IMPDH2, PACSIN2, SLCO1B1, ABCC4, and PYGL) were genotyped by competitive allele-specific PCR (KASP). Drug doses during maintenance therapy were modified according to the protocol. RESULTS: The median drug dose intensity was 50% (28% to 92%) for 6-MP and 58% (27% to 99%) for MTX in the first year of maintenance therapy, which were lower than that scheduled in all patients. Among the analyzed polymorphisms, variant alleles in SLCO1B1 rs4149056 and rs11045879 were found to be associated with lower 6-MP/MTX tolerance. CONCLUSIONS: SLCO1B1 rs4149056 and rs11045879 polymorphisms may be important genetic markers to individualize 6-MP/MTX doses.","['Eldem, Irem', 'Yavuz, Duygu', 'Cumaogullari, Ozge', 'Ileri, Talia', 'Unal Ince, Elif', 'Ertem, Mehmet', 'Doganay Erdogan, Beyza', 'Bindak, Recep', 'Ozdag, Hilal', 'Satiroglu-Tufan, N Lale', 'Uysal, L Zumrut']","['Eldem I', 'Yavuz D', 'Cumaogullari O', 'Ileri T', 'Unal Ince E', 'Ertem M', 'Doganay Erdogan B', 'Bindak R', 'Ozdag H', 'Satiroglu-Tufan NL', 'Uysal LZ']","['Departments of Pediatrics.', 'Forensic Medicine and Sciences.', 'Ankara University Biotechnology Institute.', 'Pediatric Hematology.', 'Pediatric Hematology.', 'Pediatric Hematology.', 'Biostatistics, Ankara University Faculty of Medicine.', 'Technical Sciences School, Gaziantep University, Turkey.', 'Ankara University Biotechnology Institute.', 'Forensic Medicine and Sciences.', 'Pediatric Hematology.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['0 (Liver-Specific Organic Anion Transporter 1)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (SLCO1B1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Liver-Specific Organic Anion Transporter 1/*genetics', 'Maintenance Chemotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics', 'Turkey']",,,2018/04/24 06:00,2019/03/20 06:00,['2018/04/24 06:00'],"['2018/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/20 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MPH.0000000000001153 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2018 Jul;40(5):e289-e294. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0000000000001153.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We conducted a phase 1 pilot, controlled, randomized trial to evaluate the gene expression modified by pentoxifylline during the steroid window of induction to remission phase in patients newly diagnosed with ALL. Experimental and control treatments induced broad changes in the gene expression profile. Patients who received just prednisone upregulated 377 and downregulated 344 genes, in contrast with patients treated with the experimental treatment (combination of prednisone and pentoxifylline), who demonstrated upregulation of 1319 and downregulation of 1594 genes. The most important genes modified in this pathway are those with proapoptotic activity, the majority of these overexpressed.

Previous studies reported that natural killer (NK) cells expanded by coculturing with K562-mb15-41BBL feeder cells, a genetically modified K562 leukemia cell line that expresses membrane-bound interleukin (IL)-15 and 41BBL ligand, were highly proliferative and highly cytotoxic. Here, we investigated the potential of expanded NK cells for ESCC treatment. We analyzed both genetic and surface expression levels of NKG2D ligands (NKG2DLs) in ESCC using publicly available microarray data sets and ESCC cell lines. The cytotoxicity of resting and of IL-2-activated NK cells against ESCC cell lines was compared with that of expanded NK cells. We then also investigated the effect of epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) inducers, GSK3beta inhibitor and epidermal growth factor, on NKG2DLs expressions. As a result, MICA and MICB were significantly overexpressed in ESCC compared with adjacent normal tissues and surface NKG2DLs were expressed in ESCC cell lines. Expanded NK cells were much potent than IL-2-activated and resting NK cells against ESCC cell lines. Blocking of NKG2D with anti-NKG2D monoclonal antibody dampened expanded NK cell cytotoxicity, suggesting that the NKG2DLs-NKG2D interaction is crucial for NK cells to eliminate ESCC cells. EMT inducers concurrently induced EMT and NKG2DLs expression in ESCC cell lines rendering transitioned cells more sensitive to expanded NK cells. In conclusion, expanded NK cells were highly cytotoxic against NKG2DLs-expressing ESCC cells, particularly the EMT phenotype. These results provide a strong rationale for clinical use of these NK cells in ESCC patients.","['Lim, Kee Siang', 'Mimura, Kosaku', 'Kua, Ley-Fang', 'Shiraishi, Kensuke', 'Kono, Koji']","['Lim KS', 'Mimura K', 'Kua LF', 'Shiraishi K', 'Kono K']","['Cancer Science Institute of Singapore.', 'Departments of Gastrointestinal Tract Surgery.', 'Advanced Cancer Immunotherapy.', 'Progressive DOHaD Research.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Surgery, Fujikawa Hospital, Kyonan Medical Center, Kajikazawa Fujikawa-cho, Minamikoman-gun, Yamanashi, Japan.', 'Departments of Gastrointestinal Tract Surgery.', 'Advanced Cancer Immunotherapy.', 'Organ Regulatory Surgery, Fukushima Medical University, Fukushima City, Fukushima.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Immunother,"Journal of immunotherapy (Hagerstown, Md. : 1997)",9706083,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/metabolism', 'Cancer Vaccines/*immunology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition', 'Esophageal Neoplasms/immunology/*therapy', 'Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma/immunology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Interleukin-1/metabolism', 'Interleukin-15/metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/transplantation', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K/immunology/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",,,2018/04/24 06:00,2019/09/13 06:00,['2018/04/24 06:00'],"['2018/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/13 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/CJI.0000000000000227 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunother. 2018 Jul/Aug;41(6):261-273. doi: 10.1097/CJI.0000000000000227.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Centrosomal protein 55 kDa (CEP55) is necessary for somatic cell abscission during cytokinesis. It facilitates equal segregation of cytoplasmic contents between daughter cells by recruiting endosomal sorting complex required for transport machinery (ESCRT) at the midbody. In germ cells, CEP55, in partnership with testes expressed-14 (TEX14) protein, has also been shown to be an integral component of intercellular bridge before meiosis. Various in vitro studies have demonstrated a role for CEP55 in multiple cancers and other diseases. However, its oncogenic potential in vivo remains elusive. To investigate, we generated ubiquitously overexpressing Cep55 transgenic ( Cep55(Tg/Tg)) mice aiming to characterize its oncogenic role in cancer. Unexpectedly, we found that Cep55(Tg/Tg) male mice were sterile and had severe and progressive defects in spermatogenesis related to spermatogenic arrest and lack of spermatids in the testes. In this study, we characterized this male-specific phenotype and showed that excessively high levels of Cep55 results in hyperactivation of PI3K/protein kinase B (Akt) signaling in testis. In line with this finding, we observed increased phosphorylation of forkhead box protein O1 (FoxO1), and suppression of its nuclear retention, along with the relative enrichment of promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) -positive cells. Independently, we observed that Cep55 amplification favored upregulation of ret ( Ret) proto-oncogene and glial-derived neurotrophic factor family receptor alpha-1 ( Gfra1). Consistent with these data, we observed selective down-regulation of genes associated with germ cell differentiation in Cep55-overexpressing testes at postnatal day 10, including early growth response-4 ( Egr4) and spermatogenesis and oogenesis specific basic helix-loop-helix-1 ( Sohlh1). Thus, Cep55 amplification leads to a shift toward the initial maintenance of undifferentiated spermatogonia and ultimately results in progressive germ cell loss. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that Cep55 overexpression causes change in germ cell proportions and manifests as a Sertoli cell only tubule phenotype, similar to that seen in many azoospermic men.-Sinha, D., Kalimutho, M., Bowles, J., Chan, A.-L., Merriner, D.

Inhibition of BCR-ABL1 kinase activity offers long-term relief to CML patients. However, for a proportion of them, BCR-ABL1 inhibition will become ineffective at treating the disease, and CML will progress to blast crisis (BC) CML with poor prognosis. BC-CML is often associated with excessive phosphorylated eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), which renders LSCs capable of proliferating via self-renewal, oblivious to BCR-ABL1 inhibition. In vivo, eIF4E is exclusively phosphorylated on Ser209 by MNK1/2. Consequently, a selective inhibitor of MNK1/2 should reduce the level of phosphorylated eIF4E and re-sensitize LSCs to BCR-ABL1 inhibition, thus hindering the proliferation of BC LSCs. We report herein the structure-activity relationships and pharmacokinetic properties of a selective MNK1/2 inhibitor clinical candidate, ETC-206, which in combination with dasatinib prevents BC-CML LSC self-renewal in vitro and enhances dasatinib antitumor activity in vivo.","['Yang, Haiyan', 'Chennamaneni, Lohitha Rao', 'Ho, Melvyn Wai Tuck', 'Ang, Shi Hua', 'Tan, Eldwin Sum Wai', 'Jeyaraj,

In the present work, we explored how two recently developed mitochondrial STAT3 inhibitors (Mitocur-1 and Mitocur-3) modulate the allergic response. METHODS: Experiments were performed both in vitro in cultured human/mouse mast cells and with rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells and also in vivo in mice. The effect of mitochondrial STAT3 inhibition on mast cell function was determined via checking degranulation and several cytokines secretion levels. RESULTS: Here, we show that treatment of rodent and human cultured mast cells with low concentrations of mitochondrial STAT3 inhibitors had no effect on STAT3 target gene expression. However, these inhibitors caused a significant reduction in mast cell exocytosis and cytokine release, due to a decrease in OXPHOS activity and STAT3 serine 727 phosphorylation. It was also observed in an OVA mouse model of allergic asthma that one of the inhibitors used significantly reduced eosinophilia and neutrophilia compared to the control mice group. Furthermore, it was observed that treatment with this inhibitor resulted in a significant reduction in blood histamine levels in mice after IgE-Ag challenge. CONCLUSION: The present data strongly suggest that the development of mitochondrial STAT3 inhibitors could serve as a potential treatment for allergy-associated diseases.","['Erlich, T H', 'Sharkia, I', 'Landolina, N', 'Assayag, M', 'Goldberger, O', 'Berkman, N', 'Levi-Schaffer, F', 'Razin, E']","['Erlich TH', 'Sharkia I', 'Landolina N', 'Assayag M', 'Goldberger O', 'Berkman N', 'Levi-Schaffer F', 'Razin E']","['Faculty of Medicine, The Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Institute for Medical Research Israel-Canada, The Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Faculty of Medicine, The Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Institute for Medical Research Israel-Canada, The Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics Unit, School of Pharmacy, Institute for Drug Research, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'The Institute of Pulmonary Medicine at Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Faculty of Medicine, The Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Institute for Medical Research Israel-Canada, The Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'The Institute of Pulmonary Medicine at Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics Unit, School of Pharmacy, Institute for Drug Research, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Faculty of Medicine, The Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Institute for Medical Research Israel-Canada, The Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Singapore-HUJI Alliance for Research and Enterprise, Molecular Mechanisms of Inflammatory Diseases Interdisciplinary Research Group, Campus for Research Excellence and Technological Enterprise, Singapore city, Singapore.']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-8041-3718'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181030,Denmark,Allergy,Allergy,7804028,"['0 (Anti-Allergic Agents)', '0 (Antigens)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', '820484N8I3 (Histamine)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Anti-Allergic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antigens/immunology', 'Asthma/drug therapy/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Biomarkers', 'Caspase 3', 'Cell Line', 'Female', 'Histamine/blood', 'Humans', 'Hypersensitivity/drug therapy/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Immunoglobulin E/blood/immunology', 'Male', 'Mast Cells/drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors']",['NOTNLM'],"['*STAT3', '*asthma', '*degranulation', '*mast cells', '*mitochondria']",2018/04/24 06:00,2019/10/01 06:00,['2018/04/24 06:00'],"['2018/04/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/01 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/all.13467 [doi]'],ppublish,Allergy. 2018 Nov;73(11):2160-2171. doi: 10.1111/all.13467.

By a well-balanced interplay between self-renewal and differentiation, they ensure a lifelong supply of mature blood cells. Physiologically, multiple different cell types contribute to the regulation of stem and progenitor cells in the BM microenvironment by cell-extrinsic and cell-intrinsic mechanisms. During the last decades, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have been identified as one of the main cellular components of the BM microenvironment holding an indispensable role for normal hematopoiesis. During aging, MSCs diminish their functional and regenerative capacities and in some cases encounter replicative senescence, promoting inflammation and cancer progression. It is now evident that alterations in specific stromal cells that comprise the BM microenvironment can contribute to hematologic malignancies, and there is growing interest regarding the contribution of MSCs to the pathogenesis of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs), a clonal hematological disorder, occurring mostly in the elderly, characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis and increased tendency to acute myeloid leukemia evolution. The pathogenesis of MDS has been associated with specific genetic and epigenetic events occurring both in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and in the whole BM microenvironment with an aberrant cross talk between hematopoietic elements and stromal compartment. This review highlights the role of MSCs in MDS showing functional and molecular alterations such as altered cell-cycle regulation with impaired proliferative potential, dysregulated cytokine secretion, and an abnormal gene expression profile. Here, the current knowledge of impaired functional properties of both aged MSCs and MSCs in MDS have been described with a special focus on inflammation and senescence induced changes in the BM microenvironment. Furthermore, a better understanding of aberrant BM microenvironment could improve future potential therapies.","['Mattiucci, Domenico', 'Maurizi, Giulia', 'Leoni, Pietro', 'Poloni, Antonella']","['Mattiucci D', 'Maurizi G', 'Leoni P', 'Poloni A']","['1 Dipartimento di Scienze Cliniche e Molecolari, Clinica di Ematologia, Universita Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy.', '1 Dipartimento di Scienze Cliniche e Molecolari, Clinica di Ematologia, Universita Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy.', '1 Dipartimento di Scienze Cliniche e Molecolari, Clinica di Ematologia, Universita Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy.', '1 Dipartimento di Scienze Cliniche e Molecolari, Clinica di Ematologia, Universita Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180423,United States,Cell Transplant,Cell transplantation,9208854,,IM,"['Cellular Microenvironment', '*Cellular Senescence', 'Humans', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Models, Biological', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*pathology', 'Phenotype']",['NOTNLM'],"['*aging', '*inflammation', '*mesenchymal stromal cell', '*microenvironment', '*myelodysplastic syndrome', '*senescence']",2018/04/24 06:00,2019/05/18 06:00,['2018/04/24 06:00'],"['2018/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/18 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/0963689717745890 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Transplant. 2018 May;27(5):754-764. doi: 10.1177/0963689717745890.

Next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based, targeted genotyping for somatic mutations is increasingly used in the diagnosis, prognostication, and treatment selection for patients with hematologic malignancies. However, certain mutations that may be somatically acquired can also be present as germline mutations in some individuals and families. Whether the results of NGS-based leukemia panels can be used to inform decisions and subsequent evaluation of patients with possible inherited cancer predispositions has not been described previously. Because a normal control often is not available when using NGS panels in patients with hematologic malignancies, NGS panel results offer both an opportunity and a challenge to determine the origin and pathogenicity of identified mutations. In the absence of a matched germline control, variant allele frequency (VAF) estimation and data from publically available data sets provide important clues to the possible germline origin of a variant. Careful annotation and review of NGS panels in patients with hematologic malignancies can provide a useful screening tool to systematically improve upon the detection of potentially pathogenic germline variants.

Methods: The toxicity and C0 of bosutinib in Japanese chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients were monitored every 2 weeks for the first 3 months of treatment, and subsequently once a month during the 6 months after beginning 500 mg/day of standard dose (SD group, n = 10) or beginning 100 mg/day and increased by 100 mg every 2 weeks of dose escalation (DE group, n = 15). Results: Nine of 10 patients (90%) in the SD group were not able to continue bosutinib therapy without interruption due to adverse events, compared to 2 patients (13.5%) in the DE group. The total duration of treatment interruption was 35 and 14 days in the SD and DE groups, respectively. The median time until liver dysfunction or diarrhea was day 28 and day 1 in the SD group, and day 53.5 and day 19 in the DE group, respectively. The cumulative dose of bosutinib was comparable between the SD and DE groups (51,700 vs. 53,550 mg, respectively). At 6 months, the median C0 was 63.7 ng/mL and 63.0 ng/mL in the SD and DE groups, respectively. Liver dysfunction (all grades) and diarrhea (> grade 2) were prevalent in quartile 4 of C0 (> 91.0 ng/mL), as calculated by the total C0 distribution. Conclusions: The DE regimen was better suited to avoid treatment interruption. The daily dose of bosutinib might be adjusted based on target C0 to avoid adverse events by therapeutic drug monitoring in general practice.","['Mita, Akiko', 'Abumiya, Maiko', 'Miura, Masatomo', 'Niioka, Takenori', 'Takahashi, Saori', 'Yoshioka, Tomoko', 'Kameoka, Yoshihiro', 'Takahashi, Naoto']","['Mita A', 'Abumiya M', 'Miura M', 'Niioka T', 'Takahashi S', 'Yoshioka T', 'Kameoka Y', 'Takahashi N']","['1Department of Hematology, Nephrology, and Rheumatology, Akita University Graduate School of Medicine, 1-1-1 Hondo, Akita City, Akita 010-8543 Japan.0000 0001 0725 8504grid.251924.9', '2Department of Pharmacy, Akita University Hospital, Akita, Japan.0000 0004 0631 7850grid.411403.3', '2Department of Pharmacy, Akita University Hospital, Akita, Japan.0000 0004 0631 7850grid.411403.3', '2Department of Pharmacy, Akita University Hospital, Akita, Japan.0000 0004 0631 7850grid.411403.3', '3Clinical Research Promotion and Support Center, Akita University Hospital, Akita, Japan.0000 0004 0631 7850grid.411403.3', '1Department of Hematology, Nephrology, and Rheumatology, Akita University Graduate School of Medicine, 1-1-1 Hondo, Akita City, Akita 010-8543 Japan.0000 0001 0725 8504grid.251924.9', '1Department of Hematology, Nephrology, and Rheumatology, Akita University Graduate School of Medicine, 1-1-1 Hondo, Akita City, Akita 010-8543 Japan.0000 0001 0725 8504grid.251924.9', '3Clinical Research Promotion and Support Center, Akita University Hospital, Akita, Japan.0000 0004 0631 7850grid.411403.3', '1Department of Hematology, Nephrology, and Rheumatology, Akita University Graduate School of Medicine, 1-1-1 Hondo, Akita City, Akita 010-8543 Japan.0000 0001 0725 8504grid.251924.9']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-6758-3787'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180413,England,Exp Hematol Oncol,Experimental hematology & oncology,101590676,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Bosutinib', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Diarrhea', 'Liver dysfunction', 'Trough concentration']",2018/04/24 06:00,2018/04/24 06:01,['2018/04/24 06:00'],"['2018/01/31 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/24 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40164-018-0101-1 [doi]', '101 [pii]']",epublish,Exp Hematol Oncol. 2018 Apr 13;7:9. doi: 10.1186/s40164-018-0101-1. eCollection 2018.,,,,PMC5899348,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An EM sarcoma can manifest in any part of the body, although preferentially manifesting in immunological sanctuary sites as a single or multiple tumors. The development of myeloid sarcoma after allo-SCT is associated with certain cytogenetic abnormalities, developing of graft versus host disease (GVHD), and treatment with donor lymphocytes infusion (DLI). It is believed that posttransplant myeloid sarcomas develop because the EM sites evade immune surveillance. We present two patients with EM myeloid sarcoma in the breast and epipharynx, respectively, as the only manifestation of leukemia relapse. Both patients were treated with a combination of local and systemic therapy, with successfully longtime disease-free survival. Based on these two case reports, we give an updated review of the literature and discuss the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of EM sarcoma as the only manifestation of AML relapse after allo-SCT. There are no standard guidelines for the treatment of myeloid sarcomas in allotransplant recipients. In our opinion, the treatment of these patients needs to be individualized and should include local treatment (i.e., radiotherapy) combined with systemic therapy (i.e., chemotherapy, immunotherapy, DLI, or retransplantation). The treatment has to consider both the need for sufficient antileukemic efficiency versus the risk of severe complications due to cumulative toxicity.","['Johansen, Silje', 'Kollsete Gjelberg, Hilde', 'Ahmed, Aymen Bushra', 'Bruserud, Oystein', 'Reikvam, Hakon']","['Johansen S', 'Kollsete Gjelberg H', 'Ahmed AB', 'Bruserud O', 'Reikvam H']","['Section of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, 5021 Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Pathology, Haukeland University Hospital, 5021 Bergen, Norway.', 'Section of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, 5021 Bergen, Norway.', 'Section of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, 5021 Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, 5021 Bergen, Norway.', 'Section of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, 5021 Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, 5021 Bergen, Norway.']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-7892-4367', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5439-8411']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20180228,United States,Case Rep Oncol Med,Case reports in oncological medicine,101581035,,,,,,2018/04/24 06:00,2018/04/24 06:01,['2018/04/24 06:00'],"['2017/10/07 00:00 [received]', '2018/02/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/24 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2018/7697283 [doi]'],epublish,Case Rep Oncol Med. 2018 Feb 28;2018:7697283. doi: 10.1155/2018/7697283. eCollection 2018.,,,,PMC5851332,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The clinical course of a patient with IE is described manifesting as a persistent erythrocytosis with a low serum erythropoietin level, mild eosinophilia, and with evidence of a thrombotic event. The patient subsequently developed a myelodysplasic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), an event not observed in erythrocytosis patients other than those with polycythemia vera (PV). Application of a next-generation sequencing (NGS) approach targeted for myeloid malignancies confirmed wild-type JAK2 exons 12-15 and identified a common SH2B3 W262R single-nucleotide polymorphism associated with the development of hematological features of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs).

This is influenced by the negative effects of the disease and by the treatments of childhood cancer. In the past, children were advised to recover in bed, and to take as much relax as possible. Nowadays, it is considered that too much immobility may result in a further decrease of physical fitness and functioning. Exercise training for ALL children has frequently been reported to improve physical fitness and the well-being of the children, since it prevents the negative effects of a sedentary life-style, such as obesity and a poor skeletal health. In recent years, different studies and protocols on this subject has become available for children and young adults with cancer, both during and after treatment. The efficacy of recent physical exercise training interventions, that act on several ALL impairments in children such as skeletal, musculoskeletal, neuromuscular, cardiopulmonary and cardiovascular systems, fatigue, body balance disorders and metabolism alterations have been examined. These side effects might be prevented or significantly reduced by introducing a physical exercise program during or shortly after cancer treatment. Several interventions are discussed and presented for each impairment, reducing their level caused by the disease and thus suggesting the importance of physical training activity in ameliorating the children quality of life.","['Simioni, Carolina', 'Zauli, Giorgio', 'Martelli, Alberto M', 'Vitale, Marco', 'Ultimo, Simona', 'Milani, Daniela', 'Neri, Luca M']","['Simioni C', 'Zauli G', 'Martelli AM', 'Vitale M', 'Ultimo S', 'Milani D', 'Neri LM']","['Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Parma, Parma, Italy.', 'CoreLab, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Parma, Parma, Italy.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180330,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)', 'cancer treatments', 'childhood', 'physical assessment tests', 'physical exercise']",2018/04/24 06:00,2018/04/24 06:01,['2018/04/24 06:00'],"['2018/01/05 00:00 [received]', '2018/02/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/24 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.24762 [doi]', '24762 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2018 Mar 30;9(24):17199-17209. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.24762. eCollection 2018 Mar 30.,,,,PMC5908317,,,"['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare that they have no conflicts of', 'interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: In our center, 2294 patients were screened between 2004 and 2014 by (68)Ga somatostatin receptor (SSTR) PET/CT. Intention to treat analysis included 1048 patients, who received at least one cycle of (90)Yttrium or (177)Lutetium-based PRRT. Progression free survival was determined by (68)Ga SSTR-PET/CT and EORTC response criteria. Adverse events were determined by CTCAE criteria. Results: Overall survival (95% confidence interval) of all patients was 51 months (47.0-54.9) and differed significantly according to radionuclide, grading, previous therapies, primary site and functionality. Progression free survival (based on PET/CT) of all patients was 19 months (16.9-21), which was significantly influenced by radionuclide, grading, and origin of neuroendocrine neoplasm. Progression free survival after initial progression and first and second resumption of PRRT after therapy-free intervals of more than 6 months were 11 months (9.4-12.5) and 8 months (6.4-9.5), respectively. Myelodysplastic syndrome or leukemia developed in 22 patients (2.1%) and 5 patients required hemodialysis after treatment, other adverse events were rare. Conclusion: PRRT is effective and overall survival is favorable in patients with neuroendocrine neoplasms depending on the radionuclide used for therapy, grading and origin of the neuroendocrine neoplasm which is not exactly mirrored in progression free survival as determined by highly sensitive (68)Ga somatostatin receptor PET/CT using EORTC criteria for determining response to therapy.","['Baum, Richard P', 'Kulkarni, Harshad R', 'Singh, Aviral', 'Kaemmerer, Daniel', 'Mueller, Dirk', 'Prasad, Vikas', 'Hommann, Merten', 'Robiller, Franz C', 'Niepsch, Karin', 'Franz, Holger', 'Jochems, Arthur', 'Lambin, Philippe', 'Horsch, Dieter']","['Baum RP', 'Kulkarni HR', 'Singh A', 'Kaemmerer D', 'Mueller D', 'Prasad V', 'Hommann M', 'Robiller FC', 'Niepsch K', 'Franz H', 'Jochems A', 'Lambin P', 'Horsch D']","['THERANOSTICS Center for Molecular Radiotherapy, Zentralklinik Bad Berka GmbH, Bad Berka, Germany.', 'THERANOSTICS Center for Molecular Radiotherapy, Zentralklinik Bad Berka GmbH, Bad Berka, Germany.', 'THERANOSTICS Center for Molecular Radiotherapy, Zentralklinik Bad Berka GmbH, Bad Berka, Germany.', 'Department of General and Visceral Surgery, Zentralklinik Bad Berka GmbH, Bad Berka, Germany.', 'THERANOSTICS Center for Molecular Radiotherapy, Zentralklinik Bad Berka GmbH, Bad Berka, Germany.', 'Clinic for Nuclear Medicine, Charite, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of General and Visceral Surgery, Zentralklinik Bad Berka GmbH, Bad Berka, Germany.', 'Center of Molecular Imaging, Zentralklinik Bad Berka GmbH, Bad Berka, Germany.', 'THERANOSTICS Center for Molecular Radiotherapy, Zentralklinik Bad Berka GmbH, Bad Berka, Germany.', 'Lohmann and Birkner, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Radiology, GROW - School for Oncology and Developmental Biology, Maastricht University Hospital, Maastricht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Radiology, GROW - School for Oncology and Developmental Biology, Maastricht University Hospital, Maastricht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology (The D-Lab), GROW - School for Oncology and Developmental Biology, Maastricht University, Maastricht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Gastroenterology/Endocrinology, Center for Neuroendocrine Tumors Bad Berka - ENETS Center of Excellence, Zentralklinik Bad Berka GmbH, Bad Berka, Germany.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180215,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['functional syndromes', 'neuroendocrine tumors', 'peptide receptor radionuclide therapy', 'survival']",2018/04/24 06:00,2018/04/24 06:01,['2018/04/24 06:00'],"['2017/11/11 00:00 [received]', '2018/02/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/24 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.24524 [doi]', '24524 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2018 Feb 15;9(24):16932-16950. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.24524. eCollection 2018 Mar 30.,,,,PMC5908296,,,"['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST R.P.

Although FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors initially exhibit clinical activity, resistance to treatment inevitably occurs within months. PIM kinases are thought to be major drivers of the resistance phenotype and their inhibition in relapsed samples restores cell sensitivity to FLT3 inhibitors. Thus, simultaneous PIM and FLT3 inhibition represents a promising strategy in AML therapy. For such reasons, we have developed SEL24-B489 - a potent, dual PIM and FLT3-ITD inhibitor. SEL24-B489 exhibited significantly broader on-target activity in AML cell lines and primary AML blasts than selective FLT3-ITD or PIM inhibitors. SEL24-B489 also demonstrated marked activity in cells bearing FLT3 tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) mutations that lead to FLT3 inhibitor resistance. Moreover, SEL24-B489 inhibited the growth of a broad panel of AML cell lines in xenograft models with a clear pharmacodynamic-pharmacokinetic relationship. Taken together, our data highlight the unique dual activity of the SEL24-B489 that abrogates the activity of signaling circuits involved in proliferation, inhibition of apoptosis and protein translation/metabolism. These results underscore the therapeutic potential of the dual PIM/FLT3-ITD inhibitor for the treatment of AML.","['Czardybon, Wojciech', 'Windak, Renata', 'Golas, Aniela', 'Galezowski, Michal', 'Sabiniarz, Aleksandra', 'Dolata, Izabela', 'Salwinska, Magdalena', 'Guzik, Pawel', 'Zawadzka, Magdalena', 'Gabor-Worwa, Ewelina', 'Winnik, Bozena', 'Zurawska, Malgorzata', 'Kolasinska, Ewa', 'Wincza, Ewelina', 'Bugaj, Marta', 'Danielewicz, Monika', 'Majewska, Eliza', 'Mazan, Milena', 'Dubin, Grzegorz', 'Noyszewska-Kania, Monika', 'Jablonska, Ewa', 'Szydlowski, Maciej', 'Sewastianik, Tomasz', 'Pula, Bartosz', 'Szumera-Cieckiewicz, Anna', 'Prochorec-Sobieszek, Monika', 'Madro, Elzbieta', 'Lech-Maranda, Ewa', 'Warzocha, Krzysztof', 'Tamburini, Jerome', 'Juszczynski, Przemyslaw', 'Brzozka, Krzysztof']","['Czardybon W', 'Windak R', 'Golas A', 'Galezowski M', 'Sabiniarz A', 'Dolata I', 'Salwinska M', 'Guzik P', 'Zawadzka M', 'Gabor-Worwa E', 'Winnik B', 'Zurawska M', 'Kolasinska E', 'Wincza E', 'Bugaj M', 'Danielewicz M', 'Majewska E', 'Mazan M', 'Dubin G', 'Noyszewska-Kania M', 'Jablonska E', 'Szydlowski M', 'Sewastianik T', 'Pula B', 'Szumera-Cieckiewicz A', 'Prochorec-Sobieszek M', 'Madro E', 'Lech-Maranda E', 'Warzocha K', 'Tamburini J', 'Juszczynski P', 'Brzozka K']","['Selvita S.A., Krakow, Poland.', 'Selvita S.A., Krakow, Poland.', 'Selvita S.A., Krakow, Poland.', 'Selvita S.A., Krakow, Poland.', 'Selvita S.A., Krakow, Poland.', 'Selvita S.A., Krakow, Poland.', 'Selvita S.A., Krakow, Poland.', 'Selvita S.A., Krakow, Poland.', 'Selvita S.A., Krakow, Poland.', 'Selvita S.A., Krakow, Poland.', 'Selvita S.A., Krakow, Poland.', 'Selvita S.A., Krakow, Poland.', 'Selvita S.A., Krakow, Poland.', 'Selvita S.A., Krakow, Poland.', 'Selvita S.A., Krakow, Poland.', 'Selvita S.A., Krakow, Poland.', 'Selvita S.A., Krakow, Poland.', 'Selvita S.A., Krakow, Poland.', 'Malopolska Centre of Biotechnology, Krakow, Poland.', 'Dept. of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Dept. of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Dept. of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Dept. of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Dept. of Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Dept. of Diagnostic Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Dept. of Diagnostic Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Dept. of Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Dept. of Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Dept. of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Centre of Postgraduate Medical Education, Marymoncka, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Dept. of Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Institut Cochin, Departement Developpement, Reproduction, Cancer, Paris, France.', 'Faculte de Medecine, Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'Equipe Labellisee, Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer (LNCC), Paris, France.', 'Dept. of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Selvita S.A., Krakow, Poland.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180330,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'FLT3 kinase', 'PIM kinase', 'dual inhibitor', 'targeted therapy']",2018/04/24 06:00,2018/04/24 06:01,['2018/04/24 06:00'],"['2017/03/06 00:00 [received]', '2018/02/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/24 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.24747 [doi]', '24747 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2018 Mar 30;9(24):16917-16931. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.24747. eCollection 2018 Mar 30.,,,,PMC5908295,,,"['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST W.C., R.W., A.G., M.G., A.S., I.D., M.S., P.G, M.Z.,', 'E.G.-W., B.W., M.Z., E.K., E.W., M.B., M.D., E.M., M.M. and K.B. are or were', 'Selvita employees.

Here, we use patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to dissect the individual contributions of two recurrent genetic lesions, the splicing factor SRSF2 P95L mutation and the chromosome 7q deletion, to the development of myeloid malignancy. Using a comprehensive panel of isogenic iPSCs-with none, one, or both genetic lesions-we characterize their relative phenotypic contributions and identify drug sensitivities specific to each one through a candidate drug approach and an unbiased large-scale small-molecule screen. To facilitate drug testing and discovery, we also derive SRSF2-mutant and isogenic normal expandable hematopoietic progenitor cells. We thus describe here an approach to dissect the individual effects of two cooperating mutations to clinically relevant features of malignant diseases.","['Chang, Chan-Jung', 'Kotini, Andriana G', 'Olszewska, Malgorzata', 'Georgomanoli, Maria', 'Teruya-Feldstein, Julie', 'Sperber, Henrik', 'Sanchez, Roberto', 'DeVita, Robert', 'Martins, Timothy J', 'Abdel-Wahab, Omar', 'Bradley, Robert K', 'Papapetrou, Eirini P']","['Chang CJ', 'Kotini AG', 'Olszewska M', 'Georgomanoli M', 'Teruya-Feldstein J', 'Sperber H', 'Sanchez R', 'DeVita R', 'Martins TJ', 'Abdel-Wahab O', 'Bradley RK', 'Papapetrou EP']","['Department of Oncological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, One Gustave L.

Such alterations result in the acquisition of stem cell-like features, overexpression of adhesion molecules causing aberrant cell-cell and cell-stroma interaction, and decreased sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Here we report coding germline IKZF1 variation in familial childhood ALL and 0.9% of presumed sporadic B-ALL, identifying 28 unique variants in 45 children. The majority of variants adversely affected IKZF1 function and drug responsiveness of leukemic cells. These results identify IKZF1 as a leukemia predisposition gene, and emphasize the importance of germline genetic variation in the development of both familial and sporadic ALL.","['Churchman, Michelle L', 'Qian, Maoxiang', 'Te Kronnie, Geertruy', 'Zhang, Ranran', 'Yang, Wenjian', 'Zhang, Hui', 'Lana, Tobia', 'Tedrick, Paige', 'Baskin, Rebekah', 'Verbist, Katherine', 'Peters, Jennifer L', 'Devidas, Meenakshi', 'Larsen, Eric', 'Moore, Ian M', 'Gu, Zhaohui', 'Qu, Chunxu', 'Yoshihara, Hiroki', 'Porter, Shaina N', 'Pruett-Miller, Shondra M', 'Wu, Gang', 'Raetz, Elizabeth', 'Martin, Paul L', 'Bowman, W Paul', 'Winick, Naomi', 'Mardis, Elaine', 'Fulton, Robert', 'Stanulla, Martin', 'Evans, William E', 'Relling, Mary V', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Hunger, Stephen P', 'Loh, Mignon L', 'Handgretinger, Rupert', 'Nichols, Kim E', 'Yang, Jun J', 'Mullighan, Charles G']","['Churchman ML', 'Qian M', 'Te Kronnie G', 'Zhang R', 'Yang W', 'Zhang H', 'Lana T', 'Tedrick P', 'Baskin R', 'Verbist K', 'Peters JL', 'Devidas M', 'Larsen E', 'Moore IM', 'Gu Z', 'Qu C', 'Yoshihara H', 'Porter SN', 'Pruett-Miller SM', 'Wu G', 'Raetz E', 'Martin PL', 'Bowman WP', 'Winick N', 'Mardis E', 'Fulton R', 'Stanulla M', 'Evans WE', 'Relling MV', 'Pui CH', 'Hunger SP', 'Loh ML', 'Handgretinger R', 'Nichols KE', 'Yang JJ', 'Mullighan CG']","[""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA."", ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, University of Padova, 35128 Padova, Italy."", 'Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510120 Guangdong, China.', ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA;

Thirty-three patients received either prophylactic or therapeutic fluconazole administration for at least 7 days. In 7 of these 33 patients (21.2%), nonalbicans Candida including C. krusei, C. glabrata, C. maris, and C. inconspicua emerged during, or immediately after, fluconazole administration, with C. inconspicua the most prevalent Candida spp. Since these yeast strains are resistant to fluconazole, it is possible that selection occurred favoring Candida spp. resistant to fluconazole. Therefore, surveillance for yeast strains resistant to fluconazole should be performed as a routine procedure during fluconazole administration. In cases of resistance, other effective antifungal agents should be administered.","['Yano, Kunio', 'Fujisawa, Shinya', 'Matsui, Hirotaka', 'Yamamoto, Yukio', 'Iijima, Kazunari', 'Nakano, Yasuyuki']","['Yano K', 'Fujisawa S', 'Matsui H', 'Yamamoto Y', 'Iijima K', 'Nakano Y']","['Department of Hematology, Hamamatsu Medical Center, Hamamatsu, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Hamamatsu Medical Center, Hamamatsu, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Hamamatsu Medical Center, Hamamatsu, Japan.', 'Department of Microbiology, Hamamatsu Medical Center, Hamatsu, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Hamamatsu Medical Center, Hamamatsu, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Hamamatsu Medical Center, Hamamatsu, Japan.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140405,Netherlands,J Infect Chemother,Journal of infection and chemotherapy : official journal of the Japan Society of Chemotherapy,9608375,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['fluconazole', 'leukemia', 'nonalbicans Candida species']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['2018/04/24 06:00'],"['1996/07/08 00:00 [received]', '1996/10/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/24 06:00 [entrez]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]']","['S1341-321X(96)71526-X [pii]', '10.1007/BF02355127 [doi]']",ppublish,J Infect Chemother. 1996;2(4):268-270. doi: 10.1007/BF02355127.

The total incidence of enterococcal bacteremia at the National Cancer Institute increased from 5.1% in 1991 to 11.1% in 1993 and then decreased to 4.3% in 1995. Analysis of the 77 episodes of enterococcal bacteremia from 66 patients showed that 69 episodes from 60 patients were due to vancomycin-sensitive Enterococcus faecalis (group 1) and 8 episodes from 8 patients were due to vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (group 2). The features most frequently associated with enterococcal bacteremia were the insertion of a central venous catheter, neutropenia lasting more than 10 days, previous therapy with cephalosporins or vancomycin, previous prophylaxis with quinolones, and the incidence of superinfections. There was no difference in the clinical course or outcome between the 2 study groups. Previous therapy with aminoglycosides, cephalosporins, vancomycin or imipenem, neutropenia less than 10 days in length, malignancies other than leukemia or solid tumors, and the incidence of breakthrough bacteremia significantly correlated with patients with vancomycin-resistant E. faecium rather than patients with vancomycin-sensitive E. faecalis. The overall mortality was similar in both groups and averaged 32.5% for all enterococcal bacteremic patients.

We performed a systematic review in order to analyze the clinical outcomes reported with conventional chemotherapy schemes in adult patients with R/R AML. To have a better understanding of the R/R ground, we included studies in R/R AML adult population at any disease stage (i.e., primary refractory as well as first relapse or beyond). Study selection included a total number of 157 out of 850 records, with a wide variety of schedules. Furthermore, only 24 studies were randomized clinical trials (RCTs), being the majority of the studies retrospective analyses in small cohorts. This review reveals that several intensive regimens (cytarabine + mitoxantrone + etoposide or gemtuzumab, and cytarabine + purine analogue +/- antracycline) achieve relatively high complete remission (CR) rates (44 to 59.4%). However, most of these schemes did not obtain substantial CR duration (4.9 to 9.8 months) or overall survival (6.2 to 8.7 months). In unfit/vulnerable patients non-intensive approaches are recommended to control disease progression and minimize treatment-related mortality. A better knowledge of the prognostic factors, more effective and less toxic combinations using conventional and new therapies, as well as improvements in allo-HSCT procedure and timing, could play a role to improve the clinical outcomes in the future. Clinical trials should be the first treatment option in R/R AML, both in fit and unfit patients.","['Megias-Vericat, Juan Eduardo', 'Martinez-Cuadron, David', 'Sanz, Miguel Angel', 'Montesinos, Pau']","['Megias-Vericat JE', 'Martinez-Cuadron D', 'Sanz MA', 'Montesinos P']","['Servicio de Farmacia, Area del Medicamento, Hospital Universitari i Politecnic La Fe, Av.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of de novo pediatric AML patients with or without MS diagnosed at our cancer center between June 2003 and June 2016. RESULTS: MS was present in 121 of 570 (21.2%), the most frequent site being the orbit. Patients with MS had a younger median age (6 years vs. 10 years) and presented with higher hemoglobin and platelet but lower white blood cell count compared with patients without MS. Further, t (8; 21) (P < .01), loss of Y chromosome (P < .01), and deletion 9q (P = .03) were significantly higher in patients with AML with MS. Event-free survival (EFS; P = .003) and overall survival (OS; P = .001) were better among patients with AML with MS (median EFS 21.0 months and median OS 37.1 months) compared with those with AML without MS (median EFS 11.2 months and median OS 16.2 months). The t (8; 21) was significantly associated with MS (odds ratio, 3.92). In a comparison of the 4 groups divided according to the presence or absence of MS and t (8; 21), the subgroup of patients having MS without concomitant t (8; 21) was the only group to have a significantly better OS (hazard ratio, 0.53; 95% confidence interval, 0.34-0.82; P = .005).

AIM OF THE STUDY: The expression levels of CD95, active caspase-3, and Bcl-2 were determined in 111 patients with de novo acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and correlated with overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). METHODS: The immunophenotyped ok leukemia and the expression of CD95, active caspase-3, and Bcl-2, were determined by flow cytometry. Apoptotic variables were correlated by Spearman test, and survival by Kaplan-Meier method. Log-rank test was used to compare survival curves. RESULTS: From a total of 111 patients, 56 cases were B-ALL, 16 T-ALL, 16 B-ALL/CD33(+), and 23 ambiguous lineage-AL (AmbLin-AL). The median expression of CD95 (61.5%) and active-caspase-3 (19.4%) was higher in T-ALL (p <0.05), whereas Bcl-2 was lower in T-ALL (p <0.038). There was a highly significant correlation in B-ALL, B-ALL/CD33(+) and AmbLin-AL between CD95 and Bcl-2, CD95-Active caspase-3, and Bcl-2-Active caspase-3; while in T-ALL, there was only a correlation between CD95-Active caspase-3, and Bcl-2-Active caspase-3. OS and DFS were better for T-ALL than the other groups, especially in patients having higher values of CD95 and active caspase 3, and lower values of Bcl-2.

However, these results remain controversial. Thus, we performed a meta-analysis to clarify the prognostic value of ZAP-70 expression in CLL. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Relevant studies were searched in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane library, and Web of Science up to January 2018. Clinicopathological features and prognostic data were extracted from the studies. We pooled estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and estimated the heterogeneity of studies using Mantel-Haenszel or DerSimonian and Laird method. RESULTS: Twelve studies that included 1956 patients with CLL were eligible for inclusion. The pooled results revealed that increased ZAP-70 expression was significantly associated with poor overall survival (hazard ratio [HR]=2.48, 95% CI: 1.72-3.59, P=0.019, I(2)=53.0%) and event-free survival (HR=4.17, 95% CI: 2.17-8.01, P=0.014, I(2)=68.2%) in a random-effects model with significant heterogeneity. Clinicopathological analysis demonstrated that ZAP-70 expression was significantly associated with unmutated immunoglobulin heavy-chain genes, CD38 expression, serum beta-2 microglobulin, and lymphocyte doubling time. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicated that ZAP-70 was a strong prognostic biomarker for patients with CLL.","['Liu, Yini', 'Wang, Yangfeng', 'Yang, Jule', 'Bi, Yongyi', 'Wang, Hong']","['Liu Y', 'Wang Y', 'Yang J', 'Bi Y', 'Wang H']","['Department of Occupational and Environmental Health, School of Health Sciences, Wuhan University, Donghu Road 115, Wuhan 430071, China.', 'Department of Occupational and Environmental Health, School of Health Sciences, Wuhan University, Donghu Road 115, Wuhan 430071, China.', 'Department of Occupational and Environmental Health, School of Health Sciences, Wuhan University, Donghu Road 115, Wuhan 430071, China.', 'Department of Occupational and Environmental Health, School of Health Sciences, Wuhan University, Donghu Road 115, Wuhan 430071, China.', 'Department of Occupational and Environmental Health, School of Health Sciences, Wuhan University, Donghu Road 115, Wuhan 430071, China.

This study aimed at developing and validating an interview-administrated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) that will serve to estimate the impact of nutrition in the development of long-term sequalea of French-Canadian cALL survivors. METHODS: The FFQ was developed to assess habitual diet, Mediterranean diet score, nutrients promoting bone health and antioxidants. It was validated using a 3-day food record (3-DFR) in 80 cALL survivors (50% male) aged between 11.4 and 40.1 years (median of 18.0 years). Reproducibility was evaluated by comparing FFQs from visit 1 and 2 in 29 cALL survivors. RESULTS: When compared to 3-DFR, the mean values for macro- and micronutrient intake were overestimated by our FFQ with the exception of lipid-related nutrients. Correlations between nutrient intakes derived from the FFQs and the 3-DFRs showed moderate to very good correlations (0.46-0.74). Intraclass correlation coefficients assessing FFQ reproducibility ranged from 0.62 to 0.92, indicating moderate to good reliability. Furthermore, classification into quartiles showed more than 75% of macro- and micronutrients derived from FFQs 1 and 2 classified into the same or adjacent quartile. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our results support the reproducibility and accuracy of the developed FFQ to appropriately classify individuals according to their dietary intake. This validated tool will be valuable for future studies analyzing the impact of nutrition on cardiometabolic and bone complications in French-speaking populations.","['Morel, Sophia', 'Portolese, Olivia', 'Chertouk, Yasmine', 'Leahy, Jade', 'Bertout, Laurence', 'Laverdiere, Caroline', 'Krajinovic, Maja', 'Sinnett, Daniel', 'Levy, Emile', 'Marcil, Valerie']","['Morel S', 'Portolese O', 'Chertouk Y', 'Leahy J', 'Bertout L', 'Laverdiere C', 'Krajinovic M', 'Sinnett D', 'Levy E', 'Marcil V']","['Research Centre, Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Department of Nutrition, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, H3T 1C5, Canada.', 'Institute of Nutrition and Functional Foods, Laval University, Quebec City, QC, G1V 0A6, Canada.', 'Research Centre, Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Department of Nutrition, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, H3T 1C5, Canada.', 'Research Centre, Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Department of Nutrition, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, H3T 1C5, Canada.', 'Research Centre, Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Department of Nutrition, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, H3T 1C5, Canada.', 'Research Centre, Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Department of Pediatrics, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, H3T 1C5, Canada.', 'Research Centre, Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Department of Pediatrics, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, H3T 1C5, Canada.', 'Research Centre, Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Department of Pediatrics, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, H3T 1C5, Canada.', 'Research Centre, Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Department of Pediatrics, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, H3T 1C5, Canada.', 'Research Centre, Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Department of Nutrition, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, H3T 1C5, Canada.', 'Institute of Nutrition and Functional Foods, Laval University, Quebec City, QC, G1V 0A6, Canada.', 'Research Centre, Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Department of Nutrition, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, H3T 1C5, Canada. valerie.marcil@umontreal.ca.', 'Institute of Nutrition and Functional Foods, Laval University, Quebec City, QC, G1V 0A6, Canada. valerie.marcil@umontreal.ca.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-7683-674X'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",20180421,England,Nutr J,Nutrition journal,101152213,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Diseases/epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Canada/epidemiology', 'Child', '*Diet Records', 'Diet, Mediterranean', 'Feeding Behavior', 'Female', 'France/ethnology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Metabolic Syndrome/epidemiology/prevention & control', '*Nutrition Assessment', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/therapy', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Surveys and Questionnaires/*standards', '*Survivors', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Adolescent', '*Dietary assessment', '*Dietary intake', '*Food frequency questionnaire', '*Quebec', '*Young adults']",2018/04/24 06:00,2019/05/29 06:00,['2018/04/23 06:00'],"['2017/08/14 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/29 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12937-018-0355-9 [doi]', '10.1186/s12937-018-0355-9 [pii]']",epublish,Nutr J. 2018 Apr 21;17(1):45. doi: 10.1186/s12937-018-0355-9.,,,,PMC5911374,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We retrospectively compared results of myeloablative alloHSCT from either matched sibling donor (MSD) or unrelated donor (URD) with autologous (auto) HSCT for adults with Ph+ ALL in molecular remission, treated between 2007 and 2014. RESULTS: In univariate analysis, the incidence of relapse at 2 years was 47% after autoHSCT, 28% after MSD-HSCT and 19% after URD-HSCT (P = 0.0002). Respective rates of non-relapse mortality were 2%, 18%, and 22% (P = 0.001). The probabilities of leukaemia-free survival were 52%, 55% and 60% (P = 0.69), while overall survival rates were 70%, 70% and 69% (P = 0.58), respectively. In multivariate analysis, there was a trend towards increased risk of overall mortality after MSD-HSCT (hazard ratio [HR], 1.5, P = 0.12) and URD-HSCT (HR, 1.6, P = 0.08) when referred to autoHSCT. The use of total body irradiation (TBI)-based regimens was associated with reduced risk of relapse (HR, 0.65, P = 0.02) and overall mortality (HR, 0.67, P = 0.01). CONCLUSION: In the era of TKIs, outcomes of myeloablative autoHSCT and alloHSCT for patients with Ph+ ALL in first molecular remission are comparable. Therefore, autoHSCT appears to be an attractive treatment option potentially allowing for circumvention of alloHSCT sequelae. Irrespective of the type of donor, TBI-based regimens should be considered the preferable type of conditioning for Ph+ ALL.","['Giebel, Sebastian', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Potter, Michael', 'Poire, Xavier', 'Sengeloev, Henrik', 'Socie, Gerard', 'Huynh, Anne', 'Afanasyev, Boris V', 'Schanz, Urs', 'Ringden, Olle', 'Kalhs, Peter', 'Beelen, Dietrich W', 'Campos, Antonio M', 'Masszi, Tamas', 'Canaani, Jonathan', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Nagler, Arnon']","['Giebel S', 'Labopin M', 'Potter M', 'Poire X', 'Sengeloev H', 'Socie G', 'Huynh A', 'Afanasyev BV', 'Schanz U', 'Ringden O', 'Kalhs P', 'Beelen DW', 'Campos AM', 'Masszi T', 'Canaani J', 'Mohty M', 'Nagler A']","['Dept. of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Onco-Hematology, Maria Sklodowska-Curie Institute - Oncology Center, Gliwice Branch, Gliwice, Poland.

The objective of this study was to examine changes in DXA measures used in clinical practice and expressed as Z-scores using robust national reference data. Children and adolescents, ages 5 to 18years were enrolled within 2 (median 0.8) years of completing ALL therapy. DXA total-body less-head bone mineral content (TBLH-BMC), and spine, total hip, femoral neck, and 1/3rd radius areal BMD (aBMD) were assessed in 45 participants at enrollment and 12-months later. Linear regression models examined correlates of changes in DXA Z-scores. Changes in DXA outcomes were compared to changes in tibia pQCT trabecular and cortical volumetric BMD (vBMD) and cortical area. At enrollment, DXA TBLH-BMC, spine and radius aBMD Z-scores were not significantly reduced in ALL survivors; however, total hip [median -0.74 (IQ range -1.51 to -0.04)] and femoral neck [-0.51 (-1.24 to 0.14)] aBMD Z-scores were lower (both p<0.01) compared to reference data. DXA Z-scores at all skeletal sites increased over 12months. Despite improvement, total hip Z-score remained lower at -0.55 (-1.05 to 0.18). The increases in TBLH-BMC, total hip and femoral neck aBMD Z-scores were more pronounced in those enrolled within 6months of completing ALL therapy, compared to those enrolled at >6months. Gains in TBLH-BMC, total hip, femoral neck and radius aBMD Z-scores were significantly associated with gains in tibia cortical area Z-scores (R=0.56 to 0.67, p</=0.001). Changes in TBLH and proximal femur sites were associated with gains in trabecular vBMD Z-scores (R=0.37 to 0.40; p</=0.01); these associations were not significant when adjusted for gains in cortical area. In summary, gains in DXA measures were most pronounced in total hip and femoral neck following ALL therapy. The gains in all DXA measures, with the exception of lumbar spine, reflected gains in cortical area. Overall, ALL survivors demonstrate skeletal recovery following completion of therapy; a small sub-group continue to demonstrate deficits and benefit from continued observation to ensure improvement over time.","['Mostoufi-Moab, Sogol', 'Kelly, Andrea', 'Mitchell, Jonathan A', 'Baker, Joshua', 'Zemel, Babette S', 'Brodsky, Jill', 'Long, Jin', 'Leonard, Mary B']","['Mostoufi-Moab S', 'Kelly A', 'Mitchell JA', 'Baker J', 'Zemel BS', 'Brodsky J', 'Long J', 'Leonard MB']","[""Department of Pediatrics, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, The University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19104, United States.

In this single center retrospective study, pediatric patients who underwent a first allogeneic or autologous HSCT from 1998 to 2016 were included. Of the 251 HSCT recipients: 143 transplants were allogeneic and 108 were autologous. Overall, 23 (9%) experienced an IFI, mostly due to yeasts (83%). IFIs were more common in allogeneic HSCT (18/143, 13%) than in autologous HSCT (5/108, 5%; P = .045). Of the 23 patients with IFIs, 14 (61%) died, but only 1 directly from IFI (pulmonary aspergillosis). Overall survival at 3 years was 0.42 +/- 0.11 in patients with IFIs and 0.60 +/- 0.37 in those without IFIs (P = .049). In Argentina, IFIs during HSCT are common. Recipients of allogeneic HSCT are at higher risk, and IFI is associated with reduced overall survival. Future work should focus on interventions to reduce and improve IFI outcomes in children undergoing transplants in low- and middle-income countries.","['Gomez, Sergio M', 'Caniza, Miguela', 'Fynn, Alicira', 'Vescina, Cecilia', 'Ruiz, Clau-Dia', 'Iglesias, Daniela', 'Sosa, Fernanda', 'Sung, Lillian']","['Gomez SM', 'Caniza M', 'Fynn A', 'Vescina C', 'Ruiz CD', 'Iglesias D', 'Sosa F', 'Sung L']","['Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, Hospital de Ninos Sor Maria Ludovica, La Plata, Argentina.', ""Global Pediatric Medicine, Infectious Diseases.

METHODS: Focused group discussion (FGDs) served as a primary source of providing phenomenal perspectives to explore the key objective. Eight focus groups of 45-60 min each were held with 5-9 members in each discussion. The participants were either patients, their caregivers or health care providers. The focus group audio recordings were professionally transcribed after all identifiers were removed. Employing a constructivist paradigm with a phenomenological approach, also known as emergent-systematic focus group design the study reported on families' experiences of childhood cancer as construction of objective reality. Investigator triangulation method was adopted to ensure trustworthiness. RESULTS: Using constant comparison analysis, multistage process analysis was done which resulted in 849 codes, 32 subthemes, 20 themes and 5 domains. A total of 64 participants participated: 4 FGDs with parents of children with ALL (n = 31); 1 FGD with professionals working in the field of cancer (n = 10) and 3 FGDs with children with ALL (n = 23). Participant's mean age at the time of study was 10 y (+3.3) for children; 37 y (+4.93) for caregivers and 35 y (+3.5) for professionals.

We found Wnt5a could induce ROR1 to complex with DOCK2 (dedicator of cytokinesis 2) and induce activation of Rac1/2; these effects could be blocked by cirmtuzumab, a humanized anti-ROR1 monoclonal antibody. We find that silencing DOCK2 specifically impaired the capacity of Wnt5a to induce activation of Rac1/2 or enhance CLL cell proliferation. We generated truncated forms of ROR1 and found the cytoplasmic proline-rich domain (PRD) of ROR1 was required for Wnt5a to induce ROR1 to complex with DOCK2 and activate Rac1/2 in the CLL cell-line MEC1. We introduced single amino acid substitutions of proline (P) to alanine (A) in the ROR1-PRD at potential binding sites for the Src-homology 3 domain of DOCK2. In contrast to wild-type ROR1, or other ROR1 P-->A variants, ROR1(P808A) was unable to recruit DOCK2 in response to Wnt5a. Moreover, unlike MEC1 cells transfected with wild-type ROR1 or ROR1 with P-->A substitutions at positions 784, 826, or 841, MEC1 cells transfected to express ROR1(P808A) did not have a growth advantage over MEC1 cells that do not express ROR1. This study reveals that the recruitment of DOCK2 may be critical for the capacity of Wnt5a to enhance CLL proliferation, which may contribute to the observed increased tendency for disease progression in patients who have CLL cells that express high levels of ROR1.","['Hasan, Md Kamrul', 'Yu, Jian', 'Widhopf, George F 2nd', 'Rassenti, Laura Z', 'Chen, Liguang', 'Shen, Zhouxin', 'Briggs, Steven P', 'Neuberg, Donna S', 'Kipps, Thomas J']","['Hasan MK', 'Yu J', 'Widhopf GF 2nd', 'Rassenti LZ', 'Chen L', 'Shen Z', 'Briggs SP', 'Neuberg DS', 'Kipps TJ']","['Moores Cancer Center and.', 'Moores Cancer Center and.', 'Moores Cancer Center and.', 'Moores Cancer Center and.', 'Moores Cancer Center and.', 'Section of Cell and Developmental Biology, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA; and.', 'Section of Cell and Developmental Biology, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA; and.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Moores Cancer Center and.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180420,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DOCK2 protein, human)', '0 (GTPase-Activating Proteins)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (WNT5A protein, human)', '0 (Wnt-5a Protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ROR1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Tyrosine Kinase-like Orphan Receptors)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (rac2 GTP-binding protein)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rac GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rac1 GTP-Binding Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation', 'GTPase-Activating Proteins', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*etiology/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Receptor Tyrosine Kinase-like Orphan Receptors/*metabolism', 'Wnt-5a Protein/*metabolism', 'rac GTP-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'rac1 GTP-Binding Protein/*metabolism']",,,2018/04/22 06:00,2019/07/10 06:00,['2018/04/22 06:00'],"['2017/12/01 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/10 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)32082-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2017-12-819383 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2018 Jul 12;132(2):170-178. doi: 10.1182/blood-2017-12-819383.

Here we introduce and explore a new model that may apply to many tissues. ANALYSES: An age-structured model describing coexistence between mutated and ordinary stem cells is developed and explored. The model is transformed into a nonlinear time-delay system governing the dynamics of healthy cells, coupled to a nonlinear differential-difference system describing dynamics of unhealthy cells. Its main features are highlighted and an advanced stability analysis of several steady states is performed, through specific Lyapunov-like functionals for descriptor-type systems. RESULTS: We propose a biologically based model endowed with rich dynamics. It incorporates a new parameter representing immunoediting processes, including the case where proliferation of cancer cells is locally kept under check by the immune cells. It also considers the overproliferation of cancer stem cells, modeled as a subpopulation of mutated cells that is constantly active in cell division. The analysis that we perform here reveals the conditions of existence of several steady states, including the case of cancer dormancy, in the coupled model of interest. Our study suggests that cancer dormancy may result from a plastic sensitivity of mutated cells to their shared environment, different from that - fixed - of healthy cells, and this is related to an action (or lack of action) of the immune system. Next, the stability analysis that we perform is essentially oriented towards the determination of sufficient conditions, depending on all the model parameters, that ensure either a regionally (i.e., locally) stable dormancy steady state or eradication of unhealthy cells. Finally, we discuss some biological interpretations, with regards to our findings, in light of current and emerging therapeutics. These final insights are particularly formulated in the paradigmatic case of hematopoiesis and acute leukemia, which is one of the best known malignancies for which it is always hard, in presence of a clinical and histological remission, to decide between cure and dormancy of a tumoral clone.","['Djema, Walid', 'Bonnet, Catherine', 'Mazenc, Frederic', 'Clairambault, Jean', 'Fridman, Emilia', 'Hirsch, Pierre', 'Delhommeau, Francois']","['Djema W', 'Bonnet C', 'Mazenc F', 'Clairambault J', 'Fridman E', 'Hirsch P', 'Delhommeau F']","[""Inria Saclay, CentraleSupelec, Universite Paris-Saclay & Inria Sophia-Antipolis, Biocore and McTao teams, Universite Cote d'Azur (UCA), France.

In CAR T cell therapy targeting CD19 for lymphoma, host immune anti-murine CAR responses limited the efficacy of repeat dosing and possibly long-term persistence. This clinically relevant concern can be addressed by generating a CAR incorporating a human single-chain variable fragment (scFv). We screened a human B cell-derived scFv phage display library and identified a panel of BCMA-specific clones from which human CARs were engineered. Despite a narrow range of affinity for BCMA, dramatic differences in CAR T cell expansion were observed between unique scFvs in a repeat antigen stimulation assay. These results were confirmed by screening in a MM xenograft model, where only the top preforming CARs from the repeat antigen stimulation assay eradicated disease and prolonged survival. The results of this screening identified a highly effective CAR T cell therapy with properties, including rapid in vivo expansion (>10,000-fold, day 6), eradication of large tumor burden, and durable protection to tumor re-challenge. We generated a bicistronic construct including a second-generation CAR and a truncated-epithelial growth factor receptor marker. CAR T cell vectors stemming from this work are under clinical investigation.","['Smith, Eric L', 'Staehr, Mette', 'Masakayan, Reed', 'Tatake, Ishan J', 'Purdon, Terence J', 'Wang, Xiuyan', 'Wang, Pei', 'Liu, Hong', 'Xu, Yiyang', 'Garrett-Thomson, Sarah C', 'Almo, Steven C', 'Riviere, Isabelle', 'Liu, Cheng', 'Brentjens, Renier J']","['Smith EL', 'Staehr M', 'Masakayan R', 'Tatake IJ', 'Purdon TJ', 'Wang X', 'Wang P', 'Liu H', 'Xu Y', 'Garrett-Thomson SC', 'Almo SC', 'Riviere I', 'Liu C', 'Brentjens RJ']","['Cellular Therapeutics Center, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA; Myeloma Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Cellular Therapeutics Center, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Cellular Therapeutics Center, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Cellular Therapeutics Center, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Cellular Therapeutics Center, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Cell Therapy and Cell Engineering Facility, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Eureka Therapeutics, Emeryville, CA, USA.', 'Eureka Therapeutics, Emeryville, CA, USA.', 'Eureka Therapeutics, Emeryville, CA, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, USA.', 'Cell Therapy and Cell Engineering Facility, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Eureka Therapeutics, Emeryville, CA, USA.', 'Cellular Therapeutics Center, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA; Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.

Little is known about patient risk factors and outcomes in sAML after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT); thus, this large systemic analysis of the European Society for Blood and Bone Marrow Transplantation registry was performed. This study included 4997 patients with sAML who received HCT from 2000 to 2016. In univariate analysis the 2-year cumulative incidence of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), relapse, and nonrelapse mortality (NRM) were 33.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 32% to 34.9%), 33.7% (95% CI, 32.3% to 35.1%), and 27.5% (95% CI, 26.1% to 28.7%), respectively. Overall survival (OS), leukemia-free survival (LFS), and GVHD-free, relapse-free survival (GRFS) at 2 years were 44.5% (95% CI, 43% to 46%), 38.8% (95% CI, 37.4% to 40.3%), and 27.2% (95% CI, 25.9% to 28.6%), respectively. In multivariate analysis, patients receiving myeloablative regimens had decreased relapse (hazard ratio, .859; 95% CI, .761 to .97; P = .01), higher NRM (hazard ratio, 1.175; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.341; P = .02), and no differences in OS, LFS, and GRFS compared with patients receiving reduced-intensity conditioning regimens.

PBX1 displays oncogenic activity in several different types of cells, but little is known about how signaling pathways are altered, and the function of PBX1 in renal clear cell carcinoma has not been well investigated. In this study, we demonstrate that the expression of PBX1 was significantly upregulated in 30 pairs of human tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues and the overall survival rate of PBX1-high group was significantly worse than that of PBX1-low group. Furthermore, JAK2 expression is significantly correlated to PBX1 expression in human clinical specimen and PBX1 knockdown inhibits STAT3 phosphorylation and reduced transcription of STAT3 target genes Cyclin D1. More interestingly, PBX1 knockdown inhibits ccRCC cell viability, proliferation and cell cycle progression in vivo and in vitro. Thus, our results demonstrate that PBX1 plays an oncogenic role in ccRCC via JAK2/STAT3 pathway and indicate its potential application for the treatment of human ccRCC in future.","['Wei, Xin', 'Yu, Lili', 'Li, Yi']","['Wei X', 'Yu L', 'Li Y']","['Department of Urology, China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, 130033, Jilin, China.', 'Department of Radiology, China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, 130033, Jilin, China.', 'Department of Radiology, China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, 130033, Jilin, China.

Although donor-derived T cells are considered the principal effectors of anti-tumor immunity after alloHSCT or donor leukocyte infusion (DLI), growing evidence indicate that recipient-derived immune cells may also contribute. Whereas the role of recipient-derived antigen-presenting cells in eliciting graft-versus-host reactions and priming donor T cells following DLI is well known, resulting inflammatory responses may also break tolerance of recipient effector cells towards the tumor. Additionally, mouse studies indicated that post-transplant recipient leukocyte infusion produces anti-leukemia and anti-solid-tumor effects that were exclusively mediated by recipient-type effector cells, without graft-versus-host disease.

Preliminary mechanism studies showed that Da-1 significantly induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at the G2 phase. Decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, accompanied by activated PARP cleavage, was observed in K562/VCR cells after incubation with Da-1. Meanwhile, Da-1 caused the accumulation of intracellular ROS, regulated JNK and AKT signaling, and down-regulated the expression levels of P-gp and MRP1 proteins. Importantly, Western blotting revealed that Da-1 could induce K562/VCR cells autophagy, by increasing the levels of Beclin1 and LC3-II. Finally, Da-1 could disrupt microtubule organization, and binding mode to tubulin was investigated by using molecular modeling.

Microscopic and immunohistochemical features of each case were reviewed and fully described, and clinical data were retrieved from the pathology reports. RESULTS: During the period considered, 6 cases were identified. Male patients were the most affected (4:2), with a mean age of 19 years old. The mandible was involved in 2 cases, the maxilla in 2, the cheek mucosa in 1, and the parotid gland in 1. Painful swelling was the most common presentation, and 3 patients also had systemic complaints. Microscopically, tumors revealed solid infiltrations of small to medium-sized immature cells. ""Puzzle-like"" and ""starry-sky"" patterns were observed, and ""single lane"" growth was also identified.

To identify genetic units affecting sensitivity to cytarabine, the mainstay of treatment for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we developed a comprehensive and integrated genome-wide platform based on a dual protein-coding and non-coding integrated CRISPRa screening (DICaS). Putative resistance genes were initially identified using pharmacogenetic data from 760 human pan-cancer cell lines. Subsequently, genome scale functional characterization of both coding and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) genes by CRISPR activation was performed. For lncRNA functional assessment, we developed a CRISPR activation of lncRNA (CaLR) strategy, targeting 14,701 lncRNA genes. Computational and functional analysis identified novel cell-cycle, survival/apoptosis, and cancer signaling genes. Furthermore, transcriptional activation of the GAS6-AS2 lncRNA, identified in our analysis, leads to hyperactivation of the GAS6/TAM pathway, a resistance mechanism in multiple cancers including AML. Thus, DICaS represents a novel and powerful approach to identify integrated coding and non-coding pathways of therapeutic relevance.","['Bester, Assaf C', 'Lee, Jonathan D', 'Chavez, Alejandro', 'Lee, Yu-Ru', 'Nachmani, Daphna', 'Vora, Suhani', 'Victor, Joshua', 'Sauvageau, Martin', 'Monteleone, Emanuele', 'Rinn, John L', 'Provero, Paolo', 'Church, George M', 'Clohessy, John G', 'Pandolfi, Pier Paolo']","['Bester AC', 'Lee JD', 'Chavez A', 'Lee YR', 'Nachmani D', 'Vora S', 'Victor J', 'Sauvageau M', 'Monteleone E', 'Rinn JL', 'Provero P', 'Church GM', 'Clohessy JG', 'Pandolfi PP']","['Cancer Research Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Cancer Center, Department of Medicine and Pathology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA; Ludwig Center at Harvard, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Cancer Center, Department of Medicine and Pathology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA; Ludwig Center at Harvard, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', ""Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA; Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA; Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA."", 'Cancer Research Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Cancer Center, Department of Medicine and Pathology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA; Ludwig Center at Harvard, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Cancer Center, Department of Medicine and Pathology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA; Ludwig Center at Harvard, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Cancer Center, Department of Medicine and Pathology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA; Ludwig Center at Harvard, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology, Harvard University, The Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA; Functional Genomics and Noncoding RNAs Research Unit, Institut de Recherches Cliniques de Montreal (IRCM), Montreal, QC, Canada; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences, and GenoBiToUS, Genomics and Bioinformatics Service, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology, Harvard University, The Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences, and GenoBiToUS, Genomics and Bioinformatics Service, University of Turin, Turin, Italy; Center for Translational Genomics and Bioinformatics, San Raffaele Scientific Institute IRCCS, Milan, Italy.', 'Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Cancer Center, Department of Medicine and Pathology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA; Ludwig Center at Harvard, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA; Preclinical Murine Pharmacogenetics Facility and Mouse Hospital, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Cancer Center, Department of Medicine and Pathology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA; Ludwig Center at Harvard, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.

Murine studies have shown that type I NKT cells can promote liver inflammation, whereas type II NKT cells have an anti-inflammatory role. In humans, type II NKT cells were found to accumulate in the gut during inflammation and IL13Ralpha2 was proposed as a marker for these cells. In the human liver, less is known about type I and II NKT cells. Here, we studied the phenotype and function of human liver T cells expressing IL13Ralpha2. We found that IL13Ralpha2 was expressed by around 1% of liver-resident memory T cells but not on circulating T cells. In support of their innate-like T-cell character, the IL13Ralpha2(+) T cells had higher expression of promyelocytic leukaemia zinc finger (PLZF) compared to IL13Ralpha2(-) T cells and possessed the capacity to produce IL-22. However, only a minority of human liver sulfatide-reactive type II NKT cells expressed IL13Ralpha2. Collectively, these findings suggest that IL13Ralpha2 identifies tissue-resident intrahepatic T cells with innate characteristics and the capacity to produce IL-22.","['Paquin-Proulx, Dominic', 'Greenspun, Benjamin C', 'Pasquet, Lise', 'Strunz, Benedikt', 'Aleman, Soo', 'Falconer, Karolin', 'Terabe, Masaki', 'Berzofsky, Jay A', 'Sandberg, Johan K', 'Melum, Espen', 'Nixon, Douglas F', 'Bjorkstrom, Niklas K']","['Paquin-Proulx D', 'Greenspun BC', 'Pasquet L', 'Strunz B', 'Aleman S', 'Falconer K', 'Terabe M', 'Berzofsky JA', 'Sandberg JK', 'Melum E', 'Nixon DF', 'Bjorkstrom NK']","['Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Tropical Medicine, The George Washington University, Washington, DC, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Tropical Medicine, The George Washington University, Washington, DC, USA.', 'Vaccine Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Department of Medicine Huddinge, Center for Infectious Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Vaccine Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Vaccine Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Department of Medicine Huddinge, Center for Infectious Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Division of Surgery, Department of Transplantation Medicine, Inflammatory Diseases and Transplantation, Norwegian PSC Research Center, Oslo University Hospital Rikshospitalet, Oslo, Norway.', 'Division of Surgery, Inflammatory Diseases and Transplantation, Research Institute of Internal Medicine, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'KG Jebsen Inflammation Research Centre, Faculty of Medicine, Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Tropical Medicine, The George Washington University, Washington, DC, USA.', 'Department of Medicine Huddinge, Center for Infectious Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-1407-3414', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1777-0189', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0967-076X']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180525,Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Interleukin-13 Receptor alpha2 Subunit)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)', 'XEO71E2E45 (interleukin-22)']",IM,"['Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Memory/*immunology', 'Interleukin-13 Receptor alpha2 Subunit/*metabolism', 'Interleukins/*metabolism', 'Liver/cytology/*immunology', 'Natural Killer T-Cells/*immunology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Human liver', '*IL-22', '*IL13Ralpha2', '*Innate T cells', '*PLZF']",2018/04/21 06:00,2019/03/21 06:00,['2018/04/21 06:00'],"['2017/09/21 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/06 00:00 [revised]', '2018/04/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/21 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.201747334 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 2018 Aug;48(8):1329-1335. doi: 10.1002/eji.201747334.

They are the second most common group of extranodal non-Hodgkin lymphomas, that present in the skin with no evidence of systemic involvement at the time of diagnosis. Aims: The aim of the study was the analysis of clinical profile of cutaneous lymphomas in the tertiary referral center in Poland. Material and Methods: We analyzed case records of 63 patients (26 women, 37 men aged 19 - 86) referred to the Department of Dermatology, University Hospital in Cracow for the diagnosis and treatment of cutaneous lymphoma. Results: After analysis of clinical and histological data, the final diagnoses were: mycosis fungoides (42 patients), primary cutaneous CD30+ lymphoproliferative disorder (7), Sezary syndrome (3), parapsoriasis (3), primary cutaneous B-cell lymphoma (1), acute myeloid leukemia (1), Hodgkin lymphoma coexistent with mycosis fungoides (1), generalized allergic contact dermatitis (2) and erythema elevatum diutinum (1). We excluded 2 patients due to incomplete data. The most common location of skin lesions was the lower limb (52.46%) and most common clinical presentation was raised erythematous lesion (26.23%). Pruritus was present in 45.9% of the patients and 39.3% had extracutaneous symptoms, with lymphadenopathy as the most common symptom. 37.7% of patients presented with mild eosinophilia and another 37.7% with mild monocytosis. Prior to referral to our center, general practitioners misdiagnosed the lymphomas commonly as: atopic and contact dermatitis, borreliosis, drug-induced exanthema. Conclusions: The diagnosis of cutaneous lymphoma is often delayed due to their indolent, often recurring course, non-specific symptoms and uncommon appearance. The cooperation of a clinician and pathologist is essential in the diagnostic process.","['Spalkowska, Magdalena', 'Brzewski, Pawel', 'Walter, Scott', 'Jaworek, Andrzej K', 'Sulowicz, Joanna', 'Andres, Michal', 'Wojas-Pelc, Anna']","['Spalkowska M', 'Brzewski P', 'Walter S', 'Jaworek AK', 'Sulowicz J', 'Andres M', 'Wojas-Pelc A']",,,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Poland,Przegl Lek,Przeglad lekarski,19840720R,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Dermatology', 'Female', '*Hospitals, University', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/diagnosis/epidemiology/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/diagnosis/epidemiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycosis Fungoides/diagnosis/epidemiology/pathology', 'Parapsoriasis/diagnosis/epidemiology/pathology', 'Poland/epidemiology', 'Sezary Syndrome/diagnosis/epidemiology/pathology', 'Skin Neoplasms/diagnosis/epidemiology/*pathology', 'Young Adult']",,,2016/01/01 00:00,2018/05/17 06:00,['2018/04/21 06:00'],"['2018/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/17 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Przegl Lek. 2016;73(7):452-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We therefore determined the cell cycle status of leukaemic cells by immunophenotypic analysis of bone marrow trephine biopsies from 181 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and correlated the results with biological features and clinical outcome. There was considerable heterogeneity between patients. The presenting white cell count significantly correlated with the proportion of non-quiescent cells (P < 0.0001), of cycling cells beyond G1 (P < 0.0001) and the speed of cycling (P < 0.0001). Profiles in acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) differed from non-APL and were consistent with more differentiated cells with reduced proliferative potential, but no significant differences were observed between non-APL cytogenetic risk groups. NPM1 mutations but not FLT3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3(ITD) ) were significantly associated with a higher proportion of cells beyond G1 (P = 0.002) and faster speed of cycling (P = 0.003). Resistance to standard cytosine arabinoside and daunorubicin induction chemotherapy was significantly related to a slower speed of cycling (P = 0.0002), as was a higher relapse rate (P = 0.05), but not with the proportion of non-quiescent cells or actively cycling cells. These results show a link between the cycling speed of AML cells and the response to chemotherapy, and help to identify a group with a very poor prognosis.","['Sellar, Rob S', 'Gale, Rosemary E', 'Khwaja, Asim', 'Garbowski, Maciej', 'Loddo, Marco', 'Stoeber, Kai', 'Williams, Gareth H', 'Linch, David C']","['Sellar RS', 'Gale RE', 'Khwaja A', 'Garbowski M', 'Loddo M', 'Stoeber K', 'Williams GH', 'Linch DC']","['Department of Haematology, UCL Cancer Institute, London, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, UCL Cancer Institute, London, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, UCL Cancer Institute, London, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, UCL Cancer Institute, London, UK.', 'Department of Pathology, UCL Cancer Institute, London, UK.', 'Department of Pathology, UCL Cancer Institute, London, UK.', 'Shinogi Ltd, London, UK.', 'Department of Pathology, UCL Cancer Institute, London, UK.', 'Oncologica Ltd, Cambridge, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, UCL Cancer Institute, London, UK.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-0103-1787'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180420,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biopsy', '*Cell Cycle', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/genetics', 'Female', '*Genotype', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', '*Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Nucleophosmin', '*fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*acute myeloid leukaemia', '*cell cycle analysis', '*response to chemotherapy']",2018/04/21 06:00,2019/03/26 06:00,['2018/04/21 06:00'],"['2017/11/17 00:00 [received]', '2018/02/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/26 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.15211 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2018 May;181(4):486-494. doi: 10.1111/bjh.15211.

Results: During this study, NHL constitutes 77.61% of all lymphomas. PTCL formed about 12.55% (251 cases) of all NHL. PTCL NOS was the most common subtype (30.68%). The most common site of involvement was lymph nodes (75%) followed by extranodal sites such as soft tissue (8.33%), gastrointestinal tract including oral cavity (6.67%), nasal cavity (5%), central nervous system (1.67%), lung (1.67%), and spleen (1.67%). PTCL, NOS showed a broad morphologic spectrum and had varied morphologic patterns with some mimicking reactive hyperplasia and some mimicking known type of T-cell lymphomas, B-cell lymphomas, and Hodgkin's lymphoma. Conclusions: PTCL, NOS constituted about 30.68% of all PTCLs in our institution during a 5-year period and was the second most common type of PTCL. Immunophenotyping using a wide panel of T-cell antibodies is necessary to distinguish PTCL, NOS from other lymphomas which they mimic, as they are known to carry a worse prognosis.","['Lakshmanan, Archana', 'Sikri, Deeksha', 'Patil, Sushama', 'Kurian, Ann', 'Annapurneswari, S', 'Nair, Sheila']","['Lakshmanan A', 'Sikri D', 'Patil S', 'Kurian A', 'Annapurneswari S', 'Nair S']","['Department of Histopathology, Apollo Hospitals, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.', 'Department of Histopathology, Apollo Hospitals, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.', 'Department of Histopathology, Apollo Hospitals, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.', 'Department of Histopathology, Apollo Hospitals, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.', 'Department of Histopathology, Apollo Hospitals, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.', 'Department of Histopathology, Apollo Hospitals, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,India,Indian J Pathol Microbiol,Indian journal of pathology & microbiology,7605904,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Central Nervous System/pathology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Tract/pathology', 'Hodgkin Disease/*diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Immunoblastic Lymphadenopathy/*diagnosis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'India/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis', 'Lung/pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*diagnosis', 'Lymphoma, Large-Cell, Anaplastic/*diagnosis', '*Lymphoma, T-Cell, Peripheral/diagnosis/epidemiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Spleen/pathology', 'Tertiary Care Centers', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"[""Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas"", 'Peripheral T-cell lymphomas Not Otherwise Specified', 'T-cell lymphoma', 'peripheral T-cell lymphomas']",2018/04/21 06:00,2018/10/03 06:00,['2018/04/21 06:00'],"['2018/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/03 06:00 [medline]']","['IndianJPatholMicrobiol_2018_61_2_204_230549 [pii]', '10.4103/IJPM.IJPM_405_17 [doi]']",ppublish,Indian J Pathol Microbiol. 2018 Apr-Jun;61(2):204-208. doi: 10.4103/IJPM.IJPM_405_17.,,,,,,,['There are no conflicts of interest'],,,,,,,,,,,

CD19 is extensively expressed on cancerous cells in B cell malignancies. To target this antigen, CAR T cells have gained great success in treating patients with B cell leukemia and lymphoma. Currently, the data from clinical trials on CAR T cells in solid tumors are limited; thus, CAR T cells targeting GD2, HER2, EGFRvIII, CSPG4, DNAX, mesothelin, and other molecules are under active investigation for solid tumors.

This study aims to examine the hypothesis that HT-induced spleen dysplasia may be associated with HT-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis, and resveratrol may activate the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathway, thus reducing oxidative stress and apoptosis. RESULTS: Results showed that HT caused spleen dysplasia in broilers, reflecting the lower relative weight of the spleen (P < 0.05). Compared with birds in a normal ambient temperature group, birds in the HT group exhibited higher (P < 0.05) malondialdehyde (MDA), protein carbonyl (PC), 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax) content, higher Bax, caspase-3 and caspase-9 mRNA levels, and caspase-3 and caspase-9 activity, and a higher Bax/B-cell lympoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2) ratio, but they exhibited lower (P < 0.05) glutathione (GSH) and Bcl-2 content, and lower Nrf2, glutathione peroxidase (Gpx), MnSOD, heme oxygenase 1, glutathione reductase (GR) and Bcl-2 mRNA levels, and lower total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), T-SOD and catalase and maganese superoixide dismutase (CAT) activity, indicating HT-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis. Compared with birds in the HT group, birds in the HT + Res group exhibited higher (P < 0.05) GSH and Bcl-2 content, higher Nrf2, CAT, MnSOD, GR and Bcl-2 mRNA levels, and higher T-AOC, T-SOD and CAT activity, but lower (P < 0.05) MDA content, and Bax and caspase-3 mRNA levels, lower caspase-3 and caspase-9 activities, and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, indicating that resveratrol activated the Nrf2 signaling pathway and decreased apoptosis in the spleen. CONCLUSION: Resveratrol was effective in ameliorating HT-induced spleen dysplasia in broilers through the activation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway, thereby decreasing apoptosis, suggesting that resveratrol may offer a potential nutritional strategy to protect against some HT-induced detriments.

Gene expression profiling (GEP) can identify these cases but it is expensive and not widely available. Using GEP, we identified 10 genes specifically overexpressed by BCR/ABL1-like ALL cases and used their expression values - assessed by quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction (Q-RT-PCR) in 26 BCR/ABL1-like and 26 non-BCR/ABL1-like cases to build a statistical ""BCR/ABL1-like predictor"", for the identification of BCR/ABL1-like cases. By screening 142 B-lineage ALL patients with the ""BCR/ABL1-like predictor"", we identified 28/142 BCR/ABL1-like patients (19.7%). Overall, BCR/ABL1-like cases were enriched in JAK/STAT mutations (P < 0.001), IKZF1 deletions (P < 0.001) and rearrangements involving cytokine receptors and tyrosine kinases (P = 0.001), thus corroborating the validity of the prediction. Clinically, the BCR/ABL1-like cases identified by the BCR/ABL1-like predictor achieved a lower rate of complete remission (P = 0.014) and a worse event-free survival (P = 0.0009) compared to non-BCR/ABL1-like ALL. Consistently, primary cells from BCR/ABL1-like cases responded in vitro to ponatinib. We propose a simple tool based on Q-RT-PCR and a statistical model that is capable of easily, quickly and reliably identifying BCR/ABL1-like ALL cases at diagnosis.","['Chiaretti, Sabina', 'Messina, Monica', 'Grammatico, Sara', 'Piciocchi, Alfonso', 'Fedullo, Anna L', 'Di Giacomo, Filomena', 'Peragine, Nadia', 'Gianfelici, Valentina', 'Lauretti, Alessia', 'Bareja, Rohan', 'Martelli, Maria P', 'Vignetti, Marco', 'Apicella, Valerio', 'Vitale, Antonella', 'Li, Loretta S', 'Salek, Cyril', 'Elemento, Olivier', 'Inghirami, Giorgio', 'Weinstock, David M', 'Guarini, Anna', 'Foa, Robin']","['Chiaretti S', 'Messina M', 'Grammatico S', 'Piciocchi A', 'Fedullo AL', 'Di Giacomo F', 'Peragine N', 'Gianfelici V', 'Lauretti A', 'Bareja R', 'Martelli MP', 'Vignetti M', 'Apicella V', 'Vitale A', 'Li LS', 'Salek C', 'Elemento O', 'Inghirami G', 'Weinstock DM', 'Guarini A', 'Foa R']","['Haematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Haematology, ""Sapienza"" University, Rome, Italy.', 'Haematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Haematology, ""Sapienza"" University, Rome, Italy.', 'Haematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Haematology, ""Sapienza"" University, Rome, Italy.', 'GIMEMA Data Centre, GIMEMA Foundation, Rome, Italy.', 'Haematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Haematology, ""Sapienza"" University, Rome, Italy.', 'Haematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Haematology, ""Sapienza"" University, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'Haematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Haematology, ""Sapienza"" University, Rome, Italy.', 'Haematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Haematology, ""Sapienza"" University, Rome, Italy.', 'Haematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Haematology, ""Sapienza"" University, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'Institute of Haematology, Centro Ricerche Onco-Ematologiche (CREO), University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Haematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Haematology, ""Sapienza"" University, Rome, Italy.', 'Haematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Haematology, ""Sapienza"" University, Rome, Italy.', 'Haematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Haematology, ""Sapienza"" University, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology/Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Institute of Haematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, ""Sapienza"" University, Rome, Italy.', 'Haematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Haematology, ""Sapienza"" University, Rome, Italy.']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-8499-4492', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3531-4766']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180419,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/biosynthesis/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', '*Models, Biological', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/genetics/metabolism/mortality', 'Predictive Value of Tests', '*Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Rate']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', '*BCR/ABL1-like', '*adults', '*prognosis', '*tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",2018/04/21 06:00,2019/03/26 06:00,['2018/04/21 06:00'],"['2018/01/12 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/26 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.15251 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2018 Jun;181(5):642-652. doi: 10.1111/bjh.15251.

The trial Chinese Children Leukemia Group (CCLG)-ALL 2008 was a prospective clinical trial designed to improve treatment outcome of childhood ALL through the first nation-wide collaborative study in China. Totally 2231 patients were recruited from ten tertiary hospitals in eight cities. The patients were stratified according to clinical-biological characteristics and early treatment response. Standard risk (SR) and intermediate risk (IR) groups were treated with a modified BFM based protocol, and there was 25%-50% dose reduction during intensification phases in the SR group. Patients in high risk (HR) group received a more intensive maintenance treatment. Minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring with treatment adjustment was performed in two hospitals (the MRD group). Complete remission (CR) was achieved in 2100 patients (94.1%). At five years, the estimate for overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) of the whole group was 85.3% and 79.9%, respectively. The cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) was 15.3% at five years. The OS, EFS and CIR for the SR group were 91.5%, 87.9%, and 9.7%, respectively. The outcome of the MRD group is better than the non-MRD group (5y-EFS: 82.4% vs 78.3%, P = .038; 5y-CIR: 10.7% vs 18.0%, P < .001). Our results demonstrated that the large-scale multicenter trial for pediatric ALL was feasible in China. Dose reduction in the SR group could achieve high EFS.

Glycopeptide-based structural analysis technology using mass spectrometry has been developed; however, complicated analyses of complex spectra obtained by multistage fragmentation are necessary, and sensitivity and throughput of the analyses are low. Therefore, we developed a liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (MS)-based glycopeptide analysis method to reveal the site-specific glycome (Glycan heterogeneity-based Relational IDentification of Glycopeptide signals on Elution profile, Glyco-RIDGE). This method used accurate masses and retention times of glycopeptides, without requiring MS2, and could be applied to complex mixtures. To increase the number of identified peptide, fractionation of sample glycopeptides for reduction of sample complexity is required. Therefore, in this study, glycopeptides were fractionated into four fractions by hydrophilic interaction chromatography, and each fraction was analyzed using the Glyco-RIDGE method. As a result, many glycopeptides having long glycans were enriched in the highest hydrophilic fraction. Based on the monosaccharide composition, these glycans were thought to be poly-N-acetyllactosamine (polylactosamine [pLN]), and 31 pLN-carrier proteins were identified in HL-60 cells. Gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed that pLN carriers included many molecules related to signal transduction, receptors, and cell adhesion. Thus, these findings provided important insights into the analysis of the glycoproteome using our novel Glyco-RIDGE method.

We collected data from 29 CML patients, with a median age of 54 years (range 32-72). Eleven patients had received dasatinib, 15 patients received nilotinib, and 3 patients received imatinib as first-line treatment. Forty-five percent of patients started ponatinib for secondary resistance, 38% for primary resistance, 7% for severe intolerance associated to a molecular warning, 7% due to the presence of a T315I mutation, and 3% for severe intolerance. Ponatinib was started at a dose of 45 mg in 60% of patients, 30 mg in 38%, and 15 mg in 2% of patients. Overall, at a median follow-up of 12 months, 85% of treated patients improved the level of response as compared to baseline, with 10 patients achieving a deep molecular response (MR4-4.5). No thrombotic events were recorded. The dose was reduced during treatment in 2 patients due to intolerance and in 8 patients in order to reduce the cardiovascular risk. Ponatinib seems a valid second-line treatment option for chronic phase CML, in particular for patients who failed a front-line second-generation TKI due to BCR-ABL-independent mechanisms of resistance.","['Breccia, Massimo', 'Abruzzese, Elisabetta', 'Castagnetti, Fausto', 'Bonifacio, Massimiliano', 'Gangemi, Domenica', 'Sora, Federica', 'Iurlo, Alessandra', 'Luciano, Luigiana', 'Gozzini, Antonella', 'Gentile, Massimo', 'Bocchia, Monica', 'Luzi, Debora', 'Maggi, Alessandro', 'Sgherza, Nicola', 'Isidori, Alessandro', 'Crugnola, Monica', 'Pregno, Patrizia', 'Scortechini, Anna Rita', 'Capodanno, Isabella', 'Pizzuti, Michele', 'Foa, Robin']","['Breccia M', 'Abruzzese E', 'Castagnetti F', 'Bonifacio M', 'Gangemi D', 'Sora F', 'Iurlo A', 'Luciano L', 'Gozzini A', 'Gentile M', 'Bocchia M', 'Luzi D', 'Maggi A', 'Sgherza N', 'Isidori A', 'Crugnola M', 'Pregno P', 'Scortechini AR', 'Capodanno I', 'Pizzuti M', 'Foa R']","['Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Policlinico Umberto 1, ""Sapienza"" University, Via Benevento 6, 00161, Rome, Italy. breccia@bce.uniroma1.it.', 'S.

However, treatment success is still impaired by the same drug resistance mechanism of classical chemotherapy, known as multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype. This phenotype promotes resistance to drugs with different structures and mechanism of action. Recent reports have shown that resistance acquisition is coupled to metabolic reprogramming. High-gene expression, increase of active transport, and conservation of redox status are one of the few examples that increase energy and substrate demands. It is not clear if the role of this metabolic shift in the MDR phenotype is related to its maintenance or to its induction. Apart from the nature of this relation, the metabolism may represent a new target to avoid or to block the mechanism that has been impairing treatment success. In this mini-review, we discuss the relation between metabolism and MDR resistance focusing on the multiple non-metabolic functions that enzymes of the glycolytic pathway are known to display, with emphasis with the diverse activities of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.","['Vidal, Raphael Silveira', 'Quarti, Julia', 'Rodrigues, Mariana Figueiredo', 'Rumjanek, Franklin D', 'Rumjanek, Vivian M']","['Vidal RS', 'Quarti J', 'Rodrigues MF', 'Rumjanek FD', 'Rumjanek VM']","['Instituto de Bioquimica Medica Leopoldo de Meis, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Instituto de Bioquimica Medica Leopoldo de Meis, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Instituto de Nutricao Josue de Castro, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Instituto de Bioquimica Medica Leopoldo de Meis, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Instituto de Bioquimica Medica Leopoldo de Meis, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180404,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase', '*glycolysis', '*leukemia', '*multidrug resistance', '*reactive oxygen species']",2018/04/21 06:00,2018/04/21 06:01,['2018/04/21 06:00'],"['2018/01/10 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/21 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2018.00090 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2018 Apr 4;8:90. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2018.00090. eCollection 2018.,,,,PMC5895924,,,,['Front Oncol. 2018 Nov 12;8:441.

Thus, MYB has been regarded as an attractive target for tumor therapy. However, pioneer studies of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides against MYB, which were launched three decades ago in leukemia therapy, were discontinued because of their unsatisfactory clinical outcomes. In recent years, the roles of MYB in tumor transformation have become increasingly clear. Moreover, the regulatory mechanisms of MYB, such as the vital effects of MYB co-regulators on MYB activity and of transcriptional elongation on MYB expression, have been unveiled. These observations have underpinned novel approaches in inhibiting MYB. This review discusses the structure, function and regulation of MYB, focusing on recent insights into MYB-associated oncogenesis and how MYB-targeted therapeutics can be explored. Additionally, the main MYB-targeted therapies, including novel genetic therapy, RNA interference, microRNAs and low-molecular-weight compounds, which are especially promising inhibitors that target MYB co-regulators and transcriptional elongation, are described, and their prospects are assessed.","['Liu, Xiaofeng', 'Xu, Yunxiao', 'Han, Liping', 'Yi, Yan']","['Liu X', 'Xu Y', 'Han L', 'Yi Y']","['Department of Hematology, the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan Province, P.R.

Identifying the mechanisms underlying the oncogenic activity of A/E remains a major challenge. In this study, we identified a specific down-regulation of brain acid-soluble protein 1 (BASP1) in t(8;21) acute myeloid leukemia (AML). A/E recognized AML1-binding sites and recruited DNA methyltransferase 3a (DNMT3a) to the BASP1 promoter sequence, which triggered DNA methylation-mediated silencing of BASP1. Ectopic expression of BASP1 inhibited proliferation and the colony-forming ability of A/E-positive AML cell lines and led to apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. The DNMT inhibitor decitabine up-regulated the expression of BASP1 in A/E-positive AML cell lines. In conclusion, our data suggest that BASP1 silencing via promoter methylation may be involved in A/E-mediated leukemogenesis and that BASP1 targeting may be an actionable therapeutic strategy in t(8;21) AML.","['Zhou, Lei', 'Fu, Lin', 'Lv, Na', 'Liu, Jing', 'Li, Yan', 'Chen, Xiaosu', 'Xu, Qingyu', 'Chen, Guofeng', 'Pang, Baoxu', 'Wang, Lili', 'Li, Yonghui', 'Zhang, Xiaodong', 'Yu, Li']","['Zhou L', 'Fu L', 'Lv N', 'Liu J', 'Li Y', 'Chen X', 'Xu Q', 'Chen G', 'Pang B', 'Wang L', 'Li Y', 'Zhang X', 'Yu L']","['Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, No. 202 Hospital of PLA, Shenyang, 110083, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Lymphoma Research Center, Peking University, Third Hospital, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, 221002, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, General Hospital of Shenzhen University, 1098 Xueyuan Avenue, Shenzhen, 518060, China.', 'Carson International Cancer Center, General Hospital of Shenzhen University, 1098 Xueyuan Avenue, Shenzhen, 518060, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'School of Medicine, Nankai University, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'School of Medicine, Nankai University, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Chemical Immunology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, No. 202 Hospital of PLA, Shenyang, 110083, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, China. chunhuiliyu@yahoo.com.', 'Department of Hematology, General Hospital of Shenzhen University, 1098 Xueyuan Avenue, Shenzhen, 518060, China. chunhuiliyu@yahoo.com.', 'Carson International Cancer Center, General Hospital of Shenzhen University, 1098 Xueyuan Avenue, Shenzhen, 518060, China. chunhuiliyu@yahoo.com.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180420,United States,Exp Mol Med,Experimental & molecular medicine,9607880,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (BASP1 protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNMT3A protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA Methyltransferase 3A)']",IM,"['Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/genetics/*metabolism', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/genetics/*metabolism', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics/metabolism', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA Methyltransferase 3A', 'Gene Silencing', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/metabolism', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'THP-1 Cells', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'U937 Cells']",,,2018/04/21 06:00,2019/02/08 06:00,['2018/04/21 06:00'],"['2017/06/14 00:00 [received]', '2018/01/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/06 00:00 [revised]', '2018/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s12276-018-0067-4 [doi]', '10.1038/s12276-018-0067-4 [pii]']",epublish,Exp Mol Med. 2018 Apr 20;50(4):1-8. doi: 10.1038/s12276-018-0067-4.,,,,PMC5938046,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we elucidate the molecular pathogenesis of ANKL using a combination of genomic and drug sensitivity profiling. We study 14 ANKL patients using whole-exome sequencing (WES) and identify mutations in STAT3 (21%) and RAS-MAPK pathway genes (21%) as well as in DDX3X (29%) and epigenetic modifiers (50%). Additional alterations include JAK-STAT copy gains and tyrosine phosphatase mutations, which we show recurrent also in extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type (NKTCL) through integration of public genomic data. Drug sensitivity profiling further demonstrates the role of the JAK-STAT pathway in the pathogenesis of NK-cell malignancies, identifying NK cells to be highly sensitive to JAK and BCL2 inhibition compared to other hematopoietic cell lineages. Our results provide insight into ANKL genetics and a framework for application of targeted therapies in NK-cell malignancies.","['Dufva, Olli', 'Kankainen, Matti', 'Kelkka, Tiina', 'Sekiguchi,

In an intention-to-treat analysis including 237 patients, the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 25 months. The presence of del(17p), unmutated IGHV and advanced stage were associated with a shorter PFS at multivariate analysis. The median time-to-next treatment was 31.3 months. Front-line treatment with a chemoimmunotherapy regimen was the only predictive factor for a shorter time to next treatment at multivariate analysis. The median overall survival (OS) was 74.5 months. Advanced disease stage (i.e. Rai stage III-IV or Binet stage C) and resistant disease were the only parameters significantly associated with a shorter OS. Grade 3-5 infections were recorded in 6.3% of patients. A matched-adjusted indirect comparison with ibrutinib given second-line within Named Patient Programs in the United Kingdom and in Italy was carried out with OS as objective end point. When restricting the analysis to patients with intact 17p who had received chemoimmunotherapy in first line, there was no difference in OS between patients treated with ibrutinib (63% alive at 36 months) and patients treated with BR (74.4% alive at 36 months). BR is an efficacious first salvage regimen in CLL in a real-life population, including the elderly and unfit patients. BR and ibrutinib may be equally effective in terms of OS when used as first salvage treatment in patients without 17p deletion.","['Cuneo, Antonio', 'Follows, George', 'Rigolin, Gian Matteo', 'Piciocchi, Alfonso', 'Tedeschi, Alessandra', 'Trentin, Livio', 'Perez, Angeles Medina', 'Coscia, Marta', 'Laurenti, Luca', 'Musuraca, Gerardo', 'Farina, Lucia', 'Delgado, Alfredo Rivas', 'Orlandi, Ester Maria', 'Galieni, Piero', 'Mauro, Francesca Romana', 'Visco, Carlo', 'Amendola, Angela', 'Billio, Atto', 'Marasca, Roberto', 'Chiarenza, Annalisa', 'Meneghini, Vittorio', 'Ilariucci, Fiorella', 'Marchetti, Monia', 'Molica, Stefano', 'Re, Francesca', 'Gaidano, Gianluca', 'Gonzalez, Marcos', 'Forconi, Francesco', 'Ciolli, Stefania', 'Cortelezzi, Agostino', 'Montillo, Marco', 'Smolej, Lukas', 'Schuh, Anna', 'Eyre, Toby A', 'Kennedy, Ben', 'Bowles, Kris M', 'Vignetti, Marco', 'de la Serna, Javier', 'Moreno, Carol', 'Foa, Robin', 'Ghia, Paolo']","['Cuneo A', 'Follows G', 'Rigolin GM', 'Piciocchi A', 'Tedeschi A', 'Trentin L', 'Perez AM', 'Coscia M', 'Laurenti L', 'Musuraca G', 'Farina L', 'Delgado AR', 'Orlandi EM', 'Galieni P', 'Mauro FR', 'Visco C', 'Amendola A', 'Billio A', 'Marasca R', 'Chiarenza A', 'Meneghini V', 'Ilariucci F', 'Marchetti M', 'Molica S', 'Re F', 'Gaidano G', 'Gonzalez M', 'Forconi F', 'Ciolli S', 'Cortelezzi A', 'Montillo M', 'Smolej L', 'Schuh A', 'Eyre TA', 'Kennedy B', 'Bowles KM', 'Vignetti M', 'de la Serna J', 'Moreno C', 'Foa R', 'Ghia P']","['Hematology, Department of Medical Sciences, St. Anna University Hospital, Ferrara, Italy cut@unife.it.', 'UK CLL Forum, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, UK.', 'Hematology, Department of Medical Sciences, St. Anna University Hospital, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Italian Group for Adult Hematologic Diseases (GIMEMA), Data Center and Health Outcomes Research Unit, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology, Niguarda Cancer Center, ASST Grande Ospedale Metropolitano Niguarda, Milan, Italy.', 'Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Department of Medicine, University of Padua, Italy.', 'Hospital Costa del Sol, Marbella, Malaga, Spain.', 'Hematology Unit, Citta della Salute e della Scienza, University of Turin, Italy.', 'Hematology, Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Policlinico A.

A combined polygenic risk score (PRS) of representative single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from these loci may improve risk prediction over individual SNPs. Herein, we evaluated the association of a PRS with CLL risk and its precursor, monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL). We assessed its validity and discriminative ability in an independent sample and evaluated effect modification and confounding by family history (FH) of hematological cancers. For discovery, we pooled genotype data on 41 representative SNPs from 1499 CLL and 2459 controls from the InterLymph Consortium. For validation, we used data from 1267 controls from Mayo Clinic and 201 CLL, 95 MBL, and 144 controls with a FH of CLL from the Genetic Epidemiology of CLL Consortium. We used odds ratios (ORs) to estimate disease associations with PRS and c-statistics to assess discriminatory accuracy. In InterLymph, the continuous PRS was strongly associated with CLL risk (OR, 2.49; P = 4.4 x 10(-94)). We replicated these findings in the Genetic Epidemiology of CLL Consortium and Mayo controls (OR, 3.02; P = 7.8 x 10(-30)) and observed high discrimination (c-statistic = 0.78). When jointly modeled with FH, PRS retained its significance, along with FH status. Finally, we found a highly significant association of the continuous PRS with MBL risk (OR, 2.81; P = 9.8 x 10(-16)). In conclusion, our validated PRS was strongly associated with CLL risk, adding information beyond FH. The PRS provides a means of identifying those individuals at greater risk for CLL as well as those at increased risk of MBL, a condition that has potential clinical impact beyond CLL.","['Kleinstern,

Together, these factors are critical for the control of myeloid progenitor cell expansion and lineage determination in the development of granulocytes and monocytes/macrophages. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are expressed in a cell type and lineage specific manner. There is increasing evidence that miRNAs fine-tune the expression of hematopoietic lineage-specific transcription factors and drive the lineage decisions of hematopoietic progenitor cells. In this review, we discuss recently discovered self-activating and feed-back mechanisms in which transcription factors and miRNAs interact during myeloid cell development. Furthermore, we delineate how some of these mechanisms are affected in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and how disrupted transcription factor-miRNA interplays contribute to leukemogenesis.","['Stavast, Christiaan J', 'Leenen, Pieter J M', 'Erkeland, Stefan J']","['Stavast CJ', 'Leenen PJM', 'Erkeland SJ']","['Department of Immunology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Immunology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.

This study characterizes treatment patterns, hospitalizations, and outcomes among older patients with AML. METHODS: Using the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' 2010-2012 100% Limited Data Set (LDS), data from all hospital claims from fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries between 60 and 75 years of age with newly diagnosed AML and >/=1 hospitalization were analyzed. FINDINGS: Among 3700 identified patients with AML, 1979 (53.5%) received chemotherapy. Hospitalization rates were highest initially and then declined over time, irrespective of chemotherapy use. The mean length of initial hospital stay was longer in patients receiving chemotherapy. Intensive care unit admissions occurred in 33% of initial hospitalizations. Factors associated with receiving chemotherapy included younger age, fewer comorbidities, and the absence of prior hematologic disorders. Chemotherapy was associated with significantly increased survival compared with no chemotherapy (P < 0.0001). IMPLICATIONS: AML in older patients is associated with frequent hospitalizations and intensive care unit admissions.

As novel agents are being used more commonly in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), toxicities of these agents in older patients have not been well studied. Further, impact of these toxicities on outcomes in the elderly is unknown. This study aimed to answer both questions. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed 14 Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology trials that enrolled CLL and/or NHL patients between 2004-2014. Toxicity was assessed per the NCI-CTCAE (version 3-5). Probabilities of experiencing grade three or four hematologic and non-hematologic toxicities were modeled as a function of clinical and disease-related factors using logistic regression. RESULTS: 1199 patients (409 age>/=65; 790 age<65) were analyzed; 438 received only biologic therapy (145 age>/=65; 293 age<65), and 761 received biologic+chemotherapy (264 age>/=65; 497 age<65). The odds of grade three or four hematologic [odds ratio (OR) 1.70; p=0.009: 95% CI (1.57-1.84)] and non-hematologic toxicities [OR 1.47; p=0.022; 95% CI (1.39-1.55)] were increased in older patients with CLL, as well as odds of grade three or four non-hematologic toxicities [OR 1.89; p=0.017; 95% CI (1.64-2.17)] in older patients with NHL. Grade three or four hematologic toxicities were associated with inferior OS and PFS in older patients with NHL [HR 3.14; p=0.006; 95% CI (2.25-4.39) for OS and 3.06; p=0.011; 95% CI (2.10-4.45) for PFS], though not in CLL. A prognostic model predicting grade three or four toxicities was also developed. CONCLUSIONS: CLL and NHL patients>/=65 year encounter more toxicities than younger patients even when treated with novel biologic agents. Development of grade three or four hematologic toxicities lead to inferior PFS and OS in NHL but not in CLL.","['Tallarico, Michael', 'Foster, Jared C', 'Seisler, Drew', 'Lafky, Jacqueline M', 'Hurria, Arti', 'Jatoi, Aminah', 'Cohen, Harvey J', 'Muss, Hyman B', 'Bartlett, Nancy', 'Cheson, Bruce D', 'Jung, Sin-Ho', 'Leonard, John P', 'Byrd, John C', 'Nabhan, Chadi']","['Tallarico M', 'Foster JC', 'Seisler D', 'Lafky JM', 'Hurria A', 'Jatoi A', 'Cohen HJ', 'Muss HB', 'Bartlett N', 'Cheson BD', 'Jung SH', 'Leonard JP', 'Byrd JC', 'Nabhan C']","['University of Chicago Comprehensive Cancer Center, Chicago, IL, United States.', 'Alliance Statistics and Data Center, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, United States.', 'Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, United States.', 'Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, United States.', 'City of Hope, Duarte, CA, United States.', 'Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, United States.', 'Duke Cancer Institute, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, United States.', 'University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, United States.', 'Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, United States.', 'MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, Washington, DC, United States.', 'Duke Cancer Institute, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, United States.', 'Weill Medical College of Cornell University, New York, NY, United States.', 'The Ohio State Medical Center, Columbus, OH, United States.', 'Cardinal Health, Dublin, OH, United States.

This rare disorder is due to acquired consumption of C1-INH, hyperactivation of the classic pathway of human complement, and potentially fatal recurrent angioedema symptoms. Clinical symptoms of C1-INH-AAE are very similar to those of hereditary angioedema (HAE) but usually appear after the fourth decade of life and induce abdominal pain less frequently. Laboratory tests are essential in establishing the diagnosis with low levels or abnormal structure and function of C1-INH. Most patients present C1-INH autoantibodies. Furthermore, C1q is reduced in AAE, contrary to HAE. The long-term prognosis is determined by associated hematologic malignancies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report 4 cases of C1-INH-AAE associated with lymphoproliferative disorders referred to the Reference Centre for Angioedema of Besancon, France. The patients were aged between 60 and 77 years. C1 INH antibodies were found in three patients. Symptoms were triggered by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) in 3 patients. Hematologic malignancy was present at diagnosis (one case of chronic lymphoid leukemia) or was diagnosed during follow-up (one case of indolent marginal zone non-Hodgkin lymphoma and two cases of monoclonal gammopathy). DISCUSSION: C1-INH-AAE induced by ACE inhibitors or ARBs may be associated with hematologic malignancies. This form of revelation does not necessarily indicate a diagnosis of ACE or ARBs angioedema, and screening should therefore be performed for C1 Inh and C1q. An underlying hematologic malignancy should be routinely sought and the long-term prognosis determined.","['Jacquin-Porretaz, C', 'Castelain, F', 'Daguindau, E', 'Seilles, E', 'Nardin, C', 'Aubin, F', 'Pelletier, F']","['Jacquin-Porretaz C', 'Castelain F', 'Daguindau E', 'Seilles E', 'Nardin C', 'Aubin F', 'Pelletier F']","['Dermatologie, CHRU Minjoz, 3, boulevard Alexandre-Fleming, 25030 Besancon, France.

METHODS: The study cohort included 305 patients who were newly diagnosed with AML from 2000 to 2015 and received standard induction chemotherapy. Transplantation was performed in 168 patients. RESULTS: The median ferritin value was 512 ng/mL (range, 8-9475 ng/mL). Ferritin correlated with lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, white blood cell count, and blast count, and elevation of ferritin was associated with poor performance status. The median follow-up period was 58 months (range, 4-187 months) among survivors. The high ferritin group (>/= 400 ng/mL) demonstrated inferior event-free survival (EFS) at the 5-year interval (30% vs. 40%; P = .033) compared to the low ferritin group. Multivariate analysis in the high-risk karyotype revealed that high ferritin levels predicted worse EFS (hazard ratio = 2.07; 95% confidence interval, 1.28-3.33; P = .003). CONCLUSION: Elevated ferritin at diagnosis may indicate tumor burden in patients with AML and predict worse EFS in the high-risk group.","['Tachibana, Takayoshi', 'Andou, Taiki', 'Tanaka, Masatsugu', 'Ito, Satomi', 'Miyazaki, Takuya', 'Ishii, Yoshimi', 'Ogusa, Eriko', 'Koharazawa, Hideyuki', 'Takahashi, Hiroyuki', 'Motohashi, Kenji', 'Aoki, Jun', 'Nakajima, Yuki', 'Matsumoto, Kenji', 'Hagihara, Maki', 'Hashimoto, Chizuko', 'Taguchi, Jun', 'Fujimaki, Katsumichi', 'Fujita, Hiroyuki', 'Fujisawa, Shin', 'Kanamori, Heiwa', 'Nakajima, Hideaki']","['Tachibana T', 'Andou T', 'Tanaka M', 'Ito S', 'Miyazaki T', 'Ishii Y', 'Ogusa E', 'Koharazawa H', 'Takahashi H', 'Motohashi K', 'Aoki J', 'Nakajima Y', 'Matsumoto K', 'Hagihara M', 'Hashimoto C', 'Taguchi J', 'Fujimaki K', 'Fujita H', 'Fujisawa S', 'Kanamori H', 'Nakajima H']","['Department of Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Yokohama City University School of Medicine, Yokohama, Japan; Department of Hematology, Kanagawa Cancer Center, Yokohama, Japan.

Hemin increased ROS levels in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas NAC and AA had opposite effects. Both NAC and AA eliminated transient increased ROS levels after hemin treatment, inhibited hemin-induced hemoglobin synthesis, and decreased mRNA expression levels of beta-globin, gamma-globin, and GATA-1 genes significantly. Pretreatment with 5,000 mumol/L AA for 2 h resulted in a considerably lower inhibition ratio of hemoglobin synthesis than that when pretreated for 24 h, whereas the ROS levels were the lowest when treated with 5,000 mumol/L AA for 2 h.

Our previous studies have shown that miR-708 down-regulates DKK3 at the post-transcriptional level in B-ALL. However, whether transcriptional mechanisms lead to DKK3 silencing remains unclear. Here, we analysed the promoter regions of DKK3 by bioinformatics and found binding sites for MYCN. A dual-luciferase reporter gene assay and ChIP experiments revealed that MYCN negatively regulates DKK3 at the transcriptional level in B-ALL cell lines, and using bisulphite sequencing PCR, we affirmed that MYCN has no effect on the methylation of the DKK3 promoter. MYCN silencing in B-ALL cells resulted in reduced cell proliferation, increased apoptosis and G1 phase arrest. Treatment with MYCN siRNA or 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-AdC), a demethylating agent, significantly increased the levels of DKK3 mRNA and protein and decreased the protein levels of p-GSK3beta and nuclear beta-catenin, which indicates inhibition of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in vitro. MYCN knockdown significantly decreased the tumorigenic capacity of Nalm6 cells, which restored DKK3 levels and inhibited the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in vivo. Our study provides an increased understanding of adult B-ALL pathogenesis, which may be beneficial to the development of effective prognostic markers or therapeutic targets.","['Kong, Desheng', 'Zhao, Linlin', 'Sun, Lili', 'Fan, Shengjin', 'Li, Huibo', 'Zhao, Yanqiu', 'Guo, Zhibo', 'Lin, Leilei', 'Cui, Lin', 'Wang, Ke', 'Chen, Wenjia', 'Zhang, Yihui', 'Zhou, Jin', 'Li, Yinghua']","['Kong D', 'Zhao L', 'Sun L', 'Fan S', 'Li H', 'Zhao Y', 'Guo Z', 'Lin L', 'Cui L', 'Wang K', 'Chen W', 'Zhang Y', 'Zhou J', 'Li Y']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Fourth Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Blood Transfusion, The First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-1623-3226'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180419,England,J Cell Mol Med,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,101083777,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (CTNNB1 protein, human)', '0 (DKK3 protein, human)', '0 (MYCN protein, human)', '0 (N-Myc Proto-Oncogene Protein)', '0 (beta Catenin)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Methylation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Mice, SCID', 'N-Myc Proto-Oncogene Protein/*genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway/*genetics', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'beta Catenin/genetics/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*5-AdC', '*DKK3', '*MYCN', '*Wnt/beta-catenin', '*adult B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia']",2018/04/20 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2018/04/20 06:00'],"['2017/11/27 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jcmm.13644 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Mol Med. 2018 Jul;22(7):3627-3637. doi: 10.1111/jcmm.13644.

We recently reported that in Ewing sarcoma, MLL1 (lysine methyltransferase 2A, KMT2A) and menin are overexpressed and function as oncogenes. Small molecule inhibition of the menin-MLL interaction leads to loss of menin and MLL1 protein expression, and to inhibition of growth and tumorigenicity. Here, we have investigated the mechanistic basis of menin-MLL-mediated oncogenic activity in Ewing sarcoma. Bromouridine sequencing (Bru-seq) was performed to identify changes in nascent gene transcription in Ewing sarcoma cells, following exposure to the menin-MLL interaction inhibitor MI-503. Menin-MLL inhibition resulted in early and widespread reprogramming of metabolic processes. In particular, the serine biosynthetic pathway (SSP) was the pathway most significantly affected by MI-503 treatment. Baseline expression of SSP genes and proteins (PHGDH, PSAT1, and PSPH), and metabolic flux through the SSP were confirmed to be high in Ewing sarcoma. In addition, inhibition of PHGDH resulted in reduced cell proliferation, viability, and tumor growth in vivo, revealing a key dependency of Ewing sarcoma on the SSP. Loss of function studies validated a mechanistic link between menin and the SSP. Specifically, inhibition of menin resulted in diminished expression of SSP genes, reduced H3K4me3 enrichment at the PHGDH promoter, and complete abrogation of de novo serine and glycine biosynthesis, as demonstrated by metabolic tracing studies with (13) C-labeled glucose. These data demonstrate that the SSP is highly active in Ewing sarcoma and that its oncogenic activation is maintained, at least in part, by menin-dependent epigenetic mechanisms involving trithorax complexes.

New rearrangements giving rise to novel fusion genes define hitherto unrecognized genetic leukemia subgroups. G-banding, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and molecular genetic analyses were done on bone marrow cells from a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and secondary myelodysplasia. The G-banding analysis revealed the karyotype 46,XX,del(21)(q22)[9]/46,XX[2]. FISH on metaphase spreads with a RUNX1 break apart probe demonstrated that part of RUNX1 (from 21q22) had moved to chromosome band 5p15. RNA sequencing showed in-frame fusion of RUNX1 with PDCD6 (from 5p15), something that was verified by RT-PCR together with Sanger sequencing. Further FISH analyses with PDCD6 and RUNX1 home-made break apart/double fusion probes showed a red signal (PDCD6) on chromosome 5, a green signal on chromosome 21 (RUNX1), and two yellow fusion signals, one on der(5) and the other on der(21).

This study aimed to identify the key factors in HDMTX-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) in childhood ALL. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data in 1,329 courses of HDMTX treatment in 336 Chinese ALL children at the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University from September 2012 to November 2016. The clinical data were compared between the groups of children with development of AKI and those without. Risk factors were identified by multiple logistic regression analysis, and the diagnostic performance of plasma MTX concentration was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. RESULTS: AKI was observed in 88 patients (26.2%) and 104 courses (7.8%). Binary logistic regression revealed that age (OR 1.349; p = 0.005), first HDMTX course (OR 1.767; p = 0.013), MTX dose per body surface area (BSA; OR 1.944; p = 0.015), and baseline serum total protein (OR 0.929; p = 0.021) significantly correlated with AKI. The area under the ROC for 48-h plasma MTX concentration was 0.890 (95% CI 0.850-0.930), and sensitivity and specificity values of the cut-off value were 78.8 and 90.4%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Increasing age, higher MTX dose per BSA, lower baseline serum protein, and first HDMTX course were significant risk factors for developing HDMTX-induced AKI in childhood ALL. The threshold of 48-h MTX plasma concentration is valuable for the prediction of HDMTX-induced AKI.","['Cheng, Dao-Hai', 'Lu, Hua', 'Liu, Tao-Tao', 'Zou, Xiao-Qin', 'Pang, Hui-Mei']","['Cheng DH', 'Lu H', 'Liu TT', 'Zou XQ', 'Pang HM']","['Department of Pharmacy, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, China.', 'Department Scientific Research, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, China.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180419,Switzerland,Chemotherapy,Chemotherapy,0144731,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute kidney injury', 'Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Children', 'High-dose methotrexate']",2018/04/20 06:00,2018/04/20 06:00,['2018/04/20 06:00'],"['2017/11/09 00:00 [received]', '2018/01/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/20 06:00 [medline]']","['000486823 [pii]', '10.1159/000486823 [doi]']",aheadofprint,Chemotherapy. 2018 Apr 19;63(2):101-107. doi: 10.1159/000486823.,"['(c) 2018 S.

In the present study, based on the combination of virtual screening and biochemical validations, we discovered a series of small-molecule inhibitors targeting PRMT5. Among those, DC_Y134 exhibited the most potent activity with IC50 value of 1.7 muM and displayed good selectivity against other methyltransferases. Further treatment with DC_Y134 inhibited the proliferation of several hematological malignancy cell lines by causing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Western blot assays indicated that DC_Y134 reduced the cellular symmetrically dimethylated levels. In addition, we analyzed the binding mode of DC_Y134 through molecular docking, which revealed that DC_Y134 occupies the binding site of substrate arginine and explained the selectivity of this inhibitor. Taken together, compound DC_Y134 could be used to elucidate the biological roles of PRMT5 and serve as a lead compound for treatment of hematologic malignancies.","['Ye, Fei', 'Zhang, Weiyao', 'Ye, Xiaoqing', 'Jin, Jia', 'Lv, Zhengbing', 'Luo, Cheng']","['Ye F', 'Zhang W', 'Ye X', 'Jin J', 'Lv Z', 'Luo C']","['College of Life Sciences , Zhejiang Sci-Tech University , Hangzhou 310018 , China.', 'College of Life Sciences , Zhejiang Sci-Tech University , Hangzhou 310018 , China.', 'College of Life Sciences , Zhejiang Sci-Tech University , Hangzhou 310018 , China.', 'College of Life Sciences , Zhejiang Sci-Tech University , Hangzhou 310018 , China.', 'College of Life Sciences , Zhejiang Sci-Tech University , Hangzhou 310018 , China.', 'Drug Discovery and Design Center, State Key Laboratory of Drug Research , Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences , Shanghai 201203 , China.']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-4119-3219', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3864-8382']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180426,United States,J Chem Inf Model,Journal of chemical information and modeling,101230060,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Small Molecule Libraries)', 'EC 2.1.1.319 (Protein-Arginine N-Methyltransferases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein-Arginine N-Methyltransferases/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/metabolism', 'Small Molecule Libraries/chemistry/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'User-Computer Interface']",,,2018/04/20 06:00,2019/04/24 06:00,['2018/04/20 06:00'],"['2018/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/24 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.jcim.8b00050 [doi]'],ppublish,J Chem Inf Model. 2018 May 29;58(5):1066-1073. doi: 10.1021/acs.jcim.8b00050.

Thus, in this current study, ER stress-related apoptosis via miR-216b of the ethanol extract of Salviamiltiorrhiza (SM) is elucidated for the first time. SM treatment inhibited the viability of U266 and U937 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. However, SM-exposed Raw264.7 cells were intact compared to U266 or U937 cells. Treatment with SM significantly elevated the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The anti-proliferative effect of SM was reversed by pretreatment with the ROS scavenger, N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC), compared to cells treated only with SM. Also, SM treatment increased the ER stress by elevation of phosphorylated activating transcription factor 4 (p-ATF4), phosphorylated eukaryotic Initiation Factor 2 (p-eIF2), and phosphorylated protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (p-PERK) expression. Caspase-3 and Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) were cleaved and CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) was activated by SM treatment. PARP cleavage and CHOP activation were attenuated by NAC pretreatment. Furthermore, SM increased the tumor suppressor, miR-216b, and suppressed its target, c-Jun. miR-216b inhibitor attenuated the apoptotic effect of SM. Taken together, SM treatment induced apoptosis through regulation of miR-216b and ROS/ER stress pathways. SM could be a potential drug for treatment of multiple myeloma and myeloid leukemia.","['Kim, Changmin', 'Song, Hyo-Sook', 'Park, Hojung', 'Kim, Bonglee']","['Kim C', 'Song HS', 'Park H', 'Kim B']","['Department of Pathology, College of Korean Medicine, Graduate School, Kyung Hee University, 1 Hoegi-dong, Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul 130-701, Korea. ckdals4302@khu.ac.kr.', 'Department of Science in Korean Medicine, College of Korean Medicine, Graduate School, Kyung Hee University, 1 Hoegi-dong, Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul 130-701, Korea. shs331@khu.ac.kr.', 'Department of Pathology, College of Korean Medicine, Graduate School, Kyung Hee University, 1 Hoegi-dong, Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul 130-701, Korea. rosapark93@khu.ac.kr.', 'Department of Pathology, College of Korean Medicine, Graduate School, Kyung Hee University, 1 Hoegi-dong, Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul 130-701, Korea. bongleekim@khu.ac.kr.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-8678-156X'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180419,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (MIRN216 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Plant Extracts/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Salvia miltiorrhiza/*chemistry', 'U937 Cells']",['NOTNLM'],"['C/EBP homologous protein', 'Salvia miltiorrhiza', 'c-Jun', 'endoplasmic reticulum stress', 'miR-216b', 'oxidative stress', 'reactive oxygen species']",2018/04/20 06:00,2018/09/14 06:00,['2018/04/20 06:00'],"['2018/02/27 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/03 00:00 [revised]', '2018/04/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/14 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms19041240 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms19041240 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2018 Apr 19;19(4). pii: ijms19041240. doi: 10.3390/ijms19041240.,,,,PMC5979365,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has recently been shown that DC-SIGN directly interacts with acute T lymphoblastic leukemia cells. However, the mechanism regulating DC-SIGN-dependent DC association as well as related functions is still elusive. Here we showed that DC-SIGN preferentially bound to a set of malignant T lymphocytes, including Jurkat, CCRF-HSB2 and CCRF-CEM. ICAM-2/3 on Jurkat cells appeared to be the responsible ligands and the block of ICAM-2/3 dramatically impaired DC-SIGN association. We also found that ICAM-2/3 bear a considerable amount of Lewis X, Lewis Y and Lewis A residues, which are important for DC-SIGN recognition. Furthermore, transcriptome analysis revealed an upregulation of fucosyltransferase 4 (FUT4) in Jurkat cells and downregulating FUT4 limited DC-SIGN binding, indicating a previously unappreciated role of FUT4 in the control of Lewis antigens on malignant T lymphocytes. In addition, the presence of Jurkat cells impaired DC maturation and the block of DC-SIGN improved Jurkat cell-mediated effects on DC function and T cell differentiation. Together, we provide evidence that DC-SIGN orients DC association with acute T lymphoblastic leukemia cells and orchestrates DC functions.","['Jin, Xin', 'Bu, Qingpan', 'Zou, Yingying', 'Feng, Yunpeng', 'Wei, Min']","['Jin X', 'Bu Q', 'Zou Y', 'Feng Y', 'Wei M']","[""Key Laboratory of Molecular Epigenetics of the Ministry of Education (MOE), Northeast Normal University, 5268 Renmin Street, Changchun, Jilin, 130024, People's Republic of China."", ""School of Life Sciences, Changchun Normal University, 677 Changji Northroad, Changchun, Jilin, 130032, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of Molecular Epigenetics of the Ministry of Education (MOE), Northeast Normal University, 5268 Renmin Street, Changchun, Jilin, 130024, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of Molecular Epigenetics of the Ministry of Education (MOE), Northeast Normal University, 5268 Renmin Street, Changchun, Jilin, 130024, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of Molecular Epigenetics of the Ministry of Education (MOE), Northeast Normal University, 5268 Renmin Street, Changchun, Jilin, 130024, People's Republic of China. weim750@nenu.edu.cn.""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180418,United States,Glycoconj J,Glycoconjugate journal,8603310,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (DC-specific ICAM-3 grabbing nonintegrin)', '0 (ICAM2 protein, human)', '0 (ICAM3 protein, human)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (Lewis Blood Group Antigens)', '0 (Lewis X Antigen)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (FUT4 protein, human)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (Fucosyltransferases)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*metabolism', 'Dendritic Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Fucosyltransferases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Lectins, C-Type/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lewis Blood Group Antigens/*metabolism', 'Lewis X Antigen/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*DC-SIGN', '*FUT4', '*ICAM-2', '*ICAM-3', '*Immune response', '*Lewis antigens']",2018/04/20 06:00,2018/12/12 06:00,['2018/04/20 06:00'],"['2017/12/28 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/02/25 00:00 [revised]', '2018/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10719-018-9822-y [doi]', '10.1007/s10719-018-9822-y [pii]']",ppublish,Glycoconj J. 2018 Jun;35(3):287-297. doi: 10.1007/s10719-018-9822-y.

We review risk factors and the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome (MetS), a cluster of obesity-related comorbidities, including abdominal obesity, atherogenic dyslipidemia, elevated blood pressure, impaired glucose metabolism, and type 2 diabetes in ALL and HSCT survivors. RECENT FINDINGS: Components of the MetS are already detected during the first year of ALL maintenance therapy and significantly worsen over time. The prevalence of MetS increases at a faster rate in this setting than in the general population. Factors found to be of the greatest potential risk to the development of the MetS are central obesity, increased BMI, irradiation therapy, older age, poor diet, and low level of physical activity. The early onset of MetS and its components among ALL and HSCT survivors calls for early and continuous screening to identify those at risk and to implement preventive measures.","['Bielorai, Bella', 'Pinhas-Hamiel, Orit']","['Bielorai B', 'Pinhas-Hamiel O']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology and BMT, The Edmond and Lily Safra Children's Hospital, Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Ramat-Gan, Israel."", 'Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel. orit.hamiel@sheba.health.gov.il.', ""Pediatric Endocrinology and Diabetes Unit, The Edmond and Lily Safra Children's Hospital, Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Ramat-Gan, Israel. orit.hamiel@sheba.health.gov.il.""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180418,United States,Curr Diab Rep,Current diabetes reports,101093791,,IM,"['Adult', '*Cancer Survivors', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*etiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Metabolic Syndrome/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/*therapy', 'Risk Factors']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Central obesity', '*Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)', '*Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)', '*Metabolic syndrome', '*Sarcopenia', '*Survivors']",2018/04/20 06:00,2018/12/26 06:00,['2018/04/20 06:00'],"['2018/04/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11892-018-0998-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s11892-018-0998-0 [pii]']",epublish,Curr Diab Rep. 2018 Apr 18;18(6):32. doi: 10.1007/s11892-018-0998-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We present a case of MCL diagnosed concomitantly with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML). Case Report: A 41-year-old woman presented with asthenia, anorexia, fever, epigastralgia, and diarrhea. She had a maculopapular skin rash, hepatosplenomegaly, retroperitoneal adenopathies, pancytopenia, 6% blast cells (BC) and 20% MC in the peripheral blood, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, cholestasis, hypoalbuminemia, hypogammaglobulinemia, and increased serum tryptase (184 mug/L). The bone marrow (BM) smears showed 24% myeloblasts, 17% promyelocytes, and 16% abnormal toluidine blue positive MC, and flow cytometry revealed 12% myeloid BC, 34% aberrant promyelocytes, a maturation blockage at the myeloblast/promyelocyte level, and 16% abnormal CD2-CD25+ MC. The BM karyotype was normal, and the KIT D816V mutation was positive in BM cells. The diagnosis of MCL associated with AML was assumed. The patient received corticosteroids, disodium cromoglycate, cladribine, idarubicin and cytosine arabinoside, high-dose cytosine arabinoside, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The outcome was favorable, with complete hematological remission two years after diagnosis and one year after HSCT. Conclusions: This case emphasizes the need of an exhaustive laboratory evaluation for the concomitant diagnosis of MCL and AML, and the therapeutic options.","['Lopes, Marta', 'Teixeira, Maria Dos

To date, no consensus has been reached concerning the normal cellular counterpart of CLL B-cells and several B-cell types have been proposed. CLL B-cells have remarkable phenotypic and gene expression profile homogeneity. In recent years, the molecular and cellular biology of CLL has been enriched by seminal insights that are leading to a better understanding of the natural history of the disease. Immunophenotypic and molecular approaches (including immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable gene mutational status, transcriptional and epigenetic profiling) comparing the normal B-cell subset and CLL B-cells provide some new insights into the normal cellular counterpart. Functional characteristics (including activation requirements and propensity for plasma cell differentiation) of CLL B-cells have now been investigated for 50 years. B-cell subsets differ substantially in terms of their functional features. Analysis of shared functional characteristics may reveal similarities between normal B-cell subsets and CLL B-cells, allowing speculative assignment of a normal cellular counterpart for CLL B-cells. In this review, we summarize current data regarding peripheral B-cell differentiation and human B-cell subsets and suggest possibilities for a normal cellular counterpart based on the functional characteristics of CLL B-cells. However, a definitive normal cellular counterpart cannot be attributed on the basis of the available data. We discuss the functional characteristics required for a cell to be logically considered to be the normal counterpart of CLL B-cells.","['Darwiche, Walaa', 'Gubler, Brigitte', 'Marolleau, Jean-Pierre', 'Ghamlouch, Hussein']","['Darwiche W', 'Gubler B', 'Marolleau JP', 'Ghamlouch H']","['EA 4666 Lymphocyte Normal - Pathologique et Cancers, HEMATIM, Universite de Picardie Jules Verne, Amiens, France.', ""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Amiens-Picardie, Amiens, France."", 'EA 4666 Lymphocyte Normal - Pathologique et Cancers, HEMATIM, Universite de Picardie Jules Verne, Amiens, France.', ""Laboratoire d'Oncobiologie Moleculaire, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Amiens-Picardie, Amiens, France."", 'EA 4666 Lymphocyte Normal - Pathologique et Cancers, HEMATIM, Universite de Picardie Jules Verne, Amiens, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique et Therapie cellulaire, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Amiens-Picardie, Amiens, France."", 'Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM) U1170, Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.', 'Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.', 'Universite Paris-Sud, Faculte de Medecine, Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20180404,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,,IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation']",['NOTNLM'],"['*B-cell differentiation', '*B-cell subsets', '*antibody-secreting plasma cell', '*chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*chronic lymphocytic leukemia B-cell', '*memory B-cell', '*normal cellular counterpart', '*transitional B cell']",2018/04/20 06:00,2018/04/20 06:01,['2018/04/20 06:00'],"['2017/12/26 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/20 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2018.00683 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2018 Apr 4;9:683. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2018.00683. eCollection 2018.,,,,PMC5893869,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fifty-three patients were transplanted with active disease and 45 in complete remission.

Both high and low Trib2 expression levels correlate with different types of cancer. Elevated Trib2 expression has oncogenic properties in both leukaemia and lung cancer dependent on interactions with proteasome machinery proteins and degradation of transcription factors. Here, we demonstrated that Trib2 deficiency conferred a growth and survival advantage both at steady state and in stress conditions in leukaemia cells. In response to stress, wild type leukaemia cells exited the cell cycle and underwent apoptosis. In contrast, Trib2 deficient leukaemia cells continued to enter mitosis and survive. We showed that Trib2 deficient leukaemia cells had defective MAPK p38 signalling, which associated with a reduced gamma-H2Ax and Chk1 stress signalling response, and continued proliferation following stress, associated with inefficient activation of cell cycle inhibitors p21, p16 and p19. Furthermore, Trib2 deficient leukaemia cells were more resistant to chemotherapy than wild type leukaemia cells, having less apoptosis and continued propagation. Trib2 re-expression or pharmacological activation of p38 in Trib2 deficient leukaemia cells sensitised the cells to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis comparable with wild type leukaemia cells.

Targeted therapy with tyrosine-kinase inhibitors induces a partial cytogenetic response in most patients. Nanosystems can represent an opportunity for combinatorial therapy with the capacity to simultaneously release different therapeutic agents, checking the pharmacokinetic properties. In this work, we have developed a novel poly-(&epsilon;-caprolactone) (PCL) nanosystem for combinatorial therapy in CML, composed of a biodegradable pH sensitive core releasing Nilotinib (Nil) and an enzymatic sensitive outer shell releasing Imatinib Mesylate (IM), resulting in wool-like nanoparticles (NPs). The resulting double loaded wool-like hollow PCL NPs showed a high dual-drug encapsulation efficiency, pH and enzymatic sensitivity and synchronized drug release capability. The combinatorial delivery of IM and Nil exhibited an importantly reduced IC50 value of IM and Nil on leukaemia cells compared to single free drugs administration. In vitro results, showed that combinatorial nanomixures preserved the biological activity of loaded drugs for extensive time windows and led to a constant release of active drug. In addition, the combination of IM and Nil in single PCL NPs have shown a more therapeutic efficiency at a low dose with respect to the single drug nanomixures, confirming that both drugs reached the target cell precisely, maximizing the cytotoxicity while minimizing the chances of cell resistance to drugs.","['Cortese, Barbara', ""D'Amone, Stefania"", 'Palama, Ilaria Elena']","['Cortese B', ""D'Amone S"", 'Palama IE']","['Nanotechnology Institute, CNR-Nanotechnology Institute (CNR-NANOTEC), University La Sapienza, P.zle A.

While their biophysical effects on capsid assembly in vitro have been previously studied, the effect of HAP treatment on capsid protein (Cp) in individual HBV-infected cells remains unknown. We report here that the HAP Bay 38-7690 promotes aggregation of recombinant Cp in vitro and causes a time- and dose-dependent decrease of Cp in infected cells, consistent with previously studied HAPs. Interestingly, immunofluorescence analysis showed Cp aggregating in nuclear foci of Bay 38-7690-treated infected cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. We found these foci to be associated with promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies (NBs), which are structures that affect many cellular functions, including DNA damage response, transcription, apoptosis, and antiviral responses. Cp aggregation is not an artifact of the cell system used, as it is observed in HBV-expressing HepAD38 cells, in HepG2 cells transfected with an HBV-expressing plasmid, and in HepG2-NTCP cells infected with HBV. Use of a Cp overexpression vector without HBV sequences shows that aggregation is independent of viral replication, and use of an HBV-expressing plasmid harboring a HAP resistance mutation in Cp abrogated the aggregation, demonstrating that the effect is due to direct compound-Cp interactions. These studies provide novel insight into the effects of HAP-based treatment at a single-cell level.IMPORTANCE Despite the availability of effective vaccines and treatments, HBV remains a significant global health concern, with more than 240 million individuals chronically infected. Current treatments are highly effective at controlling viral replication and disease progression but rarely cure infections. Therefore, much emphasis is being placed on finding therapeutics with new drug targets, such as viral gene expression, covalently closed circular DNA formation and stability, capsid formation, and host immune modulators, with the ultimate goal of an HBV cure. Understanding the mechanisms by which novel antiviral agents act will be imperative for the development of curative HBV therapies.","['Huber, Andrew D', 'Wolf, Jennifer J', 'Liu, Dandan', 'Gres, Anna T', 'Tang, Jing', 'Boschert, Kelsey N', 'Puray-Chavez, Maritza N', 'Pineda, Dallas L', 'Laughlin, Thomas G', 'Coonrod, Emily M', 'Yang, Qiongying', 'Ji, Juan', 'Kirby, Karen A', 'Wang, Zhengqiang', 'Sarafianos, Stefan G']","['Huber AD', 'Wolf JJ', 'Liu D', 'Gres AT', 'Tang J', 'Boschert KN', 'Puray-Chavez MN', 'Pineda DL', 'Laughlin TG', 'Coonrod EM', 'Yang Q', 'Ji J', 'Kirby KA', 'Wang Z', 'Sarafianos SG']","['Christopher S.

While the cure rate for newly diagnosed ALL is excellent, the genetic heterogeneity and chemoresistance of leukemia cells at relapse makes individualized curative treatment plans difficult. We hypothesize that genetic events would coalesce into a finite number of protein signatures that could guide the design of individualized therapy. Custom reverse-phase protein arrays were produced from pediatric ALL (n = 73) and normal CD34(+) (n = 10) samples with 194 validated antibodies. Proteins were allocated into 31 protein functional groups (PFG) to analyze them in the context of other proteins, based on known associations from the literature. The optimal number of protein clusters was determined for each PFG. Protein networks showed distinct transition states, revealing ""normal-like"" and ""leukemia-specific"" protein patterns. Block clustering identified strong correlation between various protein clusters that formed 10 protein constellations. Patients that expressed similar recurrent combinations of constellations comprised 7 distinct signatures, correlating with risk stratification, cytogenetics, and laboratory features. Most constellations and signatures were specific for T-cell ALL or pre-B-cell ALL; however, some constellations showed significant overlap. Several signatures were associated with Hispanic ethnicity, suggesting that ethnic pathophysiologic differences likely exist. In addition, some constellations were enriched for ""normal-like"" protein clusters, whereas others had exclusively ""leukemia-specific"" patterns.Implications: Recognition of proteins that have universally altered expression, together with proteins that are specific for a given signature, suggests targets for directed combinatorial inhibition or replacement to enable personalized therapy.

Moreover, the ITD status may be of relevance for selecting patients eligible for FLT3 inhibitors. Here, we included 172 pediatric AML patients, of whom 36 (21%) harbored FLT3-ITD as determined on both RNA and DNA. Although there was a good correlation between both parameters ARspearman = 0.62 (95% confidence interval, 0.22-0.87) and ITDlengthspearman = 0.98 (95% confidence interval, 0.90-1.00), only AR >/= 0.5 and length >/=48 base pairs (bps) based on RNA measurements were significantly associated with overall survival (AR: Plogrank = .008; ITDlength: Plogrank = .011). In large ITDs (>156 bp on DNA) a remarkable 90-bp difference exists between DNA and RNA, including intron 14, which is spliced out in RNA. Ex vivo exposure (n = 30) to FLT3 inhibitors, in particular to the FLT3-specific inhibitor gilteritinib, showed that colony-forming capacity was significantly more reduced in FLT3-ITD-AR >/= 0.5 compared with ITD-AR-low and ITD(-) patient samples (P < .001). RNA-based FLT3-ITD measurements are recommended for risk stratification, and the relevance of AR regarding eligibility for FLT3-targeted therapy warrants further study.","['Cucchi, David G J', 'Denys, Barbara', 'Kaspers, Gertjan J L', 'Janssen, Jeroen J W M', 'Ossenkoppele, Gert J', 'de Haas, Valerie', 'Zwaan, C Michel', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink, Marry M', 'Philippe, Jan', 'Csikos, Tamas', 'Kwidama, Zinia', 'de Moerloose, Barbara', 'de Bont, Eveline S J M', 'Lissenberg-Witte, Birgit I', 'Zweegman, Sonja', 'Verwer, Femke', 'Vandepoele, Karl', 'Schuurhuis, Gerrit Jan', 'Sonneveld, Edwin', 'Cloos, Jacqueline']","['Cucchi DGJ', 'Denys B', 'Kaspers GJL', 'Janssen JJWM', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'de Haas V', 'Zwaan CM', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink MM', 'Philippe J', 'Csikos T', 'Kwidama Z', 'de Moerloose B', 'de Bont ESJM', 'Lissenberg-Witte BI', 'Zweegman S', 'Verwer F', 'Vandepoele K', 'Schuurhuis GJ', 'Sonneveld E', 'Cloos J']","['Pediatric Oncology/Hematology and.', 'Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Hematology, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Pediatric Oncology/Hematology and.', 'Prinsess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Dutch Childhood Oncology Group, The Hague, The Netherlands.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Prinsess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Hematology, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Pediatric Oncology/Hematology and.', 'Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, University Medical Center, Groningen, The Netherlands; and.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Dutch Childhood Oncology Group, The Hague, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Hematology, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Dutch Childhood Oncology Group, The Hague, The Netherlands.', 'Pediatric Oncology/Hematology and.', 'Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180418,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (gilteritinib)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'ID912S5VON (midostaurin)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Aniline Compounds/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Chromosome Duplication', 'DNA/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mutation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrazines/*therapeutic use', 'RNA/*genetics', 'Staurosporine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Treatment Outcome', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics']",,,2018/04/20 06:00,2019/07/02 06:00,['2018/04/20 06:00'],"['2017/12/03 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/02 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)32193-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2017-12-819508 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2018 May 31;131(22):2485-2489. doi: 10.1182/blood-2017-12-819508.

Using the California Cancer Registry, we describe AYA ALL patterns of care and outcomes over the past decade. Sociodemographics, treatment location, and front-line therapies administered to AYAs diagnosed with ALL between 2004 and 2014 were obtained. Cox regression models evaluated associations between ALL setting and regimen and overall survival (OS) and leukemia-specific survival (LSS) for the entire cohort, younger AYA (<25 years), and AYAs treated in the adult cancer setting only. Of 1473 cases, 67.7% were treated in an adult setting; of these, 24.8% received a pediatric ALL regimen and 40.7% were treated at a National Cancer Institute (NCI)-designated center. In multivariable analyses, front-line treatment in a pediatric (vs adult) setting (OS HR = 0.53, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.37-0.76; LSS HR = 0.51, 95% CI, 0.35-0.74) and at an NCI/Children's Oncology Group (COG) center (OS HR = 0.80, 95% CI, 0.66-0.96; LSS HR = 0.80, 95% CI, 0.65-0.97) were associated with significantly superior survival. Results were similar when analyses were limited to younger AYAs. Outcomes for AYAs treated in an adult setting did not differ following front-line pediatric or adult ALL regimens. Our population-level findings demonstrate that two-thirds of AYAs with newly diagnosed ALL are treated in an adult cancer setting, with the majority receiving care in community settings. Given the potential survival benefits, front-line treatment of AYA ALL at pediatric and/or NCI/COG-designated cancer centers should be considered.","['Muffly, Lori', 'Alvarez, Elysia', 'Lichtensztajn, Daphne', 'Abrahao, Renata', 'Gomez, Scarlett Lin', 'Keegan, Theresa']","['Muffly L', 'Alvarez E', 'Lichtensztajn D', 'Abrahao R', 'Gomez SL', 'Keegan T']","['Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Department of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of California Davis School of Medicine, Sacramento, CA.', 'Cancer Prevention Institute of California, Fremont, CA.', 'Cancer Prevention Institute of California, Fremont, CA.', 'Cancer Prevention Institute of California, Fremont, CA.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA; and.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of California Davis School of Medicine, Sacramento, CA.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-9887-6136'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Community Health Services/methods/standards', 'Delivery of Health Care/*standards', 'Humans', 'National Cancer Institute (U.S.)', 'Pediatrics/methods/*standards', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Treatment Outcome', 'United States', 'Young Adult']",,,2018/04/20 06:00,2019/03/09 06:00,['2018/04/20 06:00'],"['2017/12/05 00:00 [received]', '2018/02/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/09 06:00 [medline]']","['bloodadvances.2017014944 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2017014944 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2018 Apr 24;2(8):895-903. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2017014944.,['(c) 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,"['HHSN261201000140C/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HHSN261201000035C/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HHSN261201000035I/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HHSN261201000034C/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U58 DP003862/DP/NCCDPHP CDC HHS/United States']",PMC5916002,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

High-throughput screening and medicinal chemistry efforts led to the identification of structurally diverse SPT inhibitors 4 and 5. Both compounds potently inhibited SPT enzyme and decreased intracellular ceramide content. In addition, they suppressed cell growth of human lung adenocarcinoma HCC4006 and acute promyelocytic leukemia PL-21, and displayed good pharmacokinetic profiles. Reduction of 3-ketodihydrosphingosine, the direct downstream product of SPT, was confirmed under in vivo settings after oral administration of compounds 4 and 5. Their anti-tumor efficacy was observed in a PL-21 xenograft mouse model.

This study aims to develop clinically sound HSs for previously untreated patients with AML and to assign utility values based on preferences of the general UK population. METHODS: This study was conducted in the UK and comprised 2 stages. During the first stage, AML HSs were drafted based on evidence from a literature review of AML clinical and health-related quality-of-life studies (published January 2000-June 2016) and patient-reported outcome measures previously used in this population. A panel of UK hematologists with AML experience validated the clinical relevance and accuracy of the HSs. During the second stage, validated HSs were valued in an elicitation survey with a representative UK population sample using the time trade-off (TTO) method. Descriptive statistics and bivariate tests were obtained and performed. RESULTS: A total of eight HSs were developed and clinically validated, including treatment with chemotherapy, consolidation therapy, transplant, graft-vs-host disease (GvHD), remission, relapse, refractory, and functionally cured. In total, 125 adults participated (mean age, 49.6 years [range, 18-87 years], 52.8% female). Mean (95% confidence interval [CI]) TTO preference values (n = 120), ranked from lowest (worst HS) to highest (best HS) were as follows: refractory - 0.11 (- 0.21 to - 0.01), relapse 0.10 (0.00-0.20), transplant 0.28 (0.20-0.37), treatment with chemotherapy 0.36 (0.28-0.43), GvHD 0.43 (0.36-0.50), consolidation 0.46 (0.40-0.53), remission 0.62 (0.57-0.67), and functionally cured 0.76 (0.72-0.79). Mean (95% CI) visual analog scale preference values followed the same rank order, ranging from 0.15 (0.13-0.17) for refractory to 0.71 (0.68-0.73) for functionally cured. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study to report utility values for AML from the UK societal perspective. Participants were able to distinguish differences in severity among AML HSs, and preference values were consistent with clinical perception of HS severity. HS preference values observed in this study may be useful in future evaluations of treatment benefit, including cost-effectiveness analyses and improved patient well-being.","['Castejon, Nacho', 'Cappelleri, Joseph C', 'Cuervo, Jesus', 'Lang, Kathryn', 'Mehta, Priyanka', 'Mokgokong, Ruth', 'Mamolo, Carla']","['Castejon N', 'Cappelleri JC', 'Cuervo J', 'Lang K', 'Mehta P', 'Mokgokong R', 'Mamolo C']","['HEOR Senior Consultant, Barrio de Abajo, ""Las Barcas"", 33595, Celorio, Spain. nachoo@gmail.com.', 'Pfizer Inc, 445 Eastern Point Road, MS 8260-2502, Groton, CT, 06340, USA.', 'LA-SER Research Espana, C/Condado de Trevino 2, Portal 1-Bajo 3, 28033, Madrid, Spain.', 'Pfizer Ltd, Walton Oaks, Dorking Road, Tadworth, Surrey, KT20 7NS, UK.', 'Bristol Haematology Oncology Centre, University Hospitals Bristol NHS Trust, Horfield Road, Bristol, BS2 8ED, UK.', 'Pfizer Ltd, Walton Oaks, Dorking Road, Tadworth, Surrey, KT20 7NS, UK.', 'Pfizer Inc, 445 Eastern Point Road, MS 8260-2502, Groton, CT, 06340, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Validation Study']",20180418,England,Health Qual Life Outcomes,Health and quality of life outcomes,101153626,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Attitude to Health', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*psychology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Patient Preference', 'Quality of Life/*psychology', 'Sex Factors', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'United Kingdom', 'Visual Analog Scale', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Health states', 'Health-related quality of life', 'Time trade-off', 'Utility values']",2018/04/20 06:00,2018/08/17 06:00,['2018/04/20 06:00'],"['2017/08/31 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12955-018-0897-8 [doi]', '10.1186/s12955-018-0897-8 [pii]']",epublish,Health Qual Life Outcomes. 2018 Apr 18;16(1):66. doi: 10.1186/s12955-018-0897-8.,,,,PMC5907377,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In BCR-ABL independent pathway, SOCS1 plays an important role as it helps in regulating optimal JAK/STAT activity. OBJECTIVE: To identify the association of SOCS1 gene hypermethylation in mediating IM Resistance. METHOD: The SOCS1 promoter methylation level of 92 BCR-ABL non mutated IM resistant CML patients, 83 IM good response CML patients and 5 normal samples from healthy individuals were measured using Methylation Specific-High Resolution Melt (MS-HRM) analysis. RESULTS: Both primers used to amplify promoter region from -333 to -223 and from -332 to -188 showed less than 10% methylation in all CML and normal samples. Consequently, there was no significant difference in SOCS1 promoter methylation level between IM resistant and IM good response patients. CONCLUSION: SOCS1 promoter methylation level is not suitable to be used as one of the biomarkers for predicting the possibility of acquiring resistance among CML patients treated with IM.","['Elias, Marjanu Hikmah', 'Azlan, Husin', 'Baba, Abdul Aziz', 'Ankathil, Ravindran']","['Elias MH', 'Azlan H', 'Baba AA', 'Ankathil R']","['Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universiti Sains Islam, Malaysia.', 'Haemato-Oncology Unit, Department of Internal Medicine, Universiti Sains Malaysia Hospital, Malaysia.', 'International Medical University, Universiti Sains Malaysia, USM Pinang, Malaysia.', 'Human Genome Centre, School of Medical Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia, USM Pinang, Malaysia.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United Arab Emirates,Cardiovasc Hematol Disord Drug Targets,Cardiovascular & hematological disorders drug targets,101269160,"['0 (SOCS1 protein, human)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Chronic Disease', '*DNA Methylation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein/*genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Chronic myeloid leukemia', '*cytokine signaling tumour', '*high resolution melt analysis', '*imatinib mesylate', '*methylation.']",2018/04/20 06:00,2019/06/06 06:00,['2018/04/20 06:00'],"['2017/12/07 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/12 00:00 [revised]', '2018/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/06 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['CHDDT-EPUB-89837 [pii]', '10.2174/1871529X18666180419101416 [doi]']",ppublish,Cardiovasc Hematol Disord Drug Targets. 2018;18(3):234-238. doi: 10.2174/1871529X18666180419101416.,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.org.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Saturated free fatty acids (SFAs) levels are found to be elevated in obesity and T2D. Chemokines are known to have potent inflammatory functions in a wide range of biological processes linked to immunological disorders. Since CCL4 (Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 4), also known as macrophage inflammatory protein-1beta (MIP-1beta), plays an important role in the migration of monocytes into the adipose tissue, we investigated the expression of CCL4 in monocytic cells/macrophages following activation with free fatty acid palmitate. METHODS: Human monocytic cell line THP-1 and macrophages derived from THP-1 and primary monocytes were stimulated with palmitate and LPS (positive control). CCL4 expression and secretion were measured with real time RT-PCR and ELISA respectively. Signaling pathways were identified by using THP-1-XBlueTM cells, THP-1-XBlueTM-defMyD cells, anti-TLR4 mAb and TLR4 siRNA. RESULTS: Palmitate induces CCL4 expression at both mRNA and protein levels in human monocytic cells. Palmitate-induced CCL4 production was markedly suppressed by neutralizing anti-TLR-4 antibody. Additionally, silencing of TLR4 by siRNA also significantly suppressed the palmitate-induced up-regulation of CCL4. MyD88-deficient cells did not express CCL4 in response to palmitate treatment. Inhibition of NF-kB and MAPK pathways suppressed the palmitate mediated induction of CCL4. Moreover, induction of CCL4 was blocked by PI3 Kinase inhibitors LY294002 and wortmannin. CONCLUSION: Collectively, our results show that palmitate induces CCL4 expression via activation of the TLR4-MyD88/NF-kB/MAPK/ PI3K signaling cascade. Thus, our findings suggest that the palmitate-induced CCL4 production might be an underlying mechanism of metabolic inflammation.","['Kochumon, Shihab', 'Wilson, Ajit', 'Chandy, Betty', 'Shenouda, Steve', 'Tuomilehto, Jaakko', 'Sindhu, Sardar', 'Ahmad, Rasheed']","['Kochumon S', 'Wilson A', 'Chandy B', 'Shenouda S', 'Tuomilehto J', 'Sindhu S', 'Ahmad R']","['Immunology Unit, Dasman, Kuwait.', 'Immunology Unit, Dasman, Kuwait.', 'National Biobank Core Facility, Dasman, Kuwait.', 'Immunology Unit, Dasman, Kuwait.', 'Research Division, Dasman, Kuwait.', 'Animal and Zebrafish Core Facility, Dasman Diabetes Institute, Dasman, Kuwait.', 'Immunology Unit, Dasman, Kuwait.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180413,Germany,Cell Physiol Biochem,"Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology",9113221,"['0 (Antibodies, Neutralizing)', '0 (Chemokine CCL4)', '0 (Chromones)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (MYD88 protein, human)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Palmitates)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 4)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Neutralizing/immunology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemokine CCL4/genetics/*metabolism', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Lipopolysaccharides/toxicity', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Palmitates/*pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/*drug effects']",['NOTNLM'],"['CCL4/MIP-1beta', 'Palmitate', 'TLR4']",2018/04/19 06:00,2018/07/06 06:00,['2018/04/19 06:00'],"['2017/10/24 00:00 [received]', '2018/02/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/06 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['000488824 [pii]', '10.1159/000488824 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Physiol Biochem. 2018;46(3):953-964. doi: 10.1159/000488824.

Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is the most common complication following CAR-T treatment, but the current understanding of the clinical manifestations and pathogenesis of CRS is still limited. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 34-year-old male patient was diagnosed with ALL in June 2015. Complete remission (CR) was achieved after induction chemotherapy. The patient received 8 cycles of consolidation chemotherapy to maintain CR. In May 2017, the patient had recurrent ALL. Induction chemotherapy was given again, but without remission. In October 2017, CAR-T cell therapy was given. On October 14, the patient was pretreated with an FC regimen (fludarabine phosphate 50 mg qd on days 1-3; cyclophosphamide 0.4 g qd on days 1-3). CAR-T cells were infused on October 19 and October 20, with the number of infused cells at 2 x 10/kg and 1 x 10/kg, respectively. On October 25, the patient had a high fever, swelling, and pain in the large joints of the limbs, and joint effusion. DIAGNOSIS: This patient was diagnosed with relapsed ALL, and he developed CRS after CAR-T therapy. INTERVENTIONS: Tacilizumab (400 mg) was infused after CRS was diagnosed, and another dose of tacilizumab (240 mg) was given 6 days later. The pain was also treated with an analgesic drug. Methylprednisolone (1 mg/kg) was given to treat arthritis of the large joints. OUTCOMES: The patient's temperature was back to normal within 1 hour following the treatment of tacilizumab, but the pain in the large joints was progressively aggravated. The joint swelling and pain were obviously alleviated after the treatment of methylprednisolone, and the joint mobility was gradually recovered.

Tocilizumab can lower the body temperature, but it has no significant effect on arthritis.

Capillary closure, retinal microaneurysms and neovascularization following massive fundus hemorrhage could be involved in few of the above instances. However, single choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in macular has not been observed in acute myelocytic leukemia (AML). PATIENT CONCERNS: A 22-year-old woman presented with a 7-day history of vision decline in the right eye (OD). The patient was diagnosed as M3 AML one month earlier. Chemotherapy was immediately administered, which led to temporary myelosuppression. Recent examination showed that best corrected visual acuity was 20/400 OD. Fundoscopy showed petechial and patchy intra-retinal hemorrhage in both eyes and grayish-white lesion in the right macular center, which was confirmed as macular CNV by OCT and OCTA. DIAGNOSES: The patient was diagnosed as macular CNV OD related to AML and chemotherapeutic regimens. INTERVENTIONS: She received intravitreal ranibizumab injection 0.5 mg (10 mg/ml) in the right eye for once on January 3, 2017. OUTCOMES: CNV resolved three days after treatment with intravitreal ranibizumab injection 0.5 mg for once. No recurrence was observed after 10-month follow-up. Vision recovered to 20/40 at the last visit. LESSONS: This is the first report demonstrating that macular CNV could be an ophthalmic side-effect secondary to initiated chemotherapeutic regimens in patients with M3 AML. Intravitreal injection of ranibizumab could be beneficial and safe in treating this CNV.","['Yang, Xiaochun', 'Xu, Jianbiao', 'Yang, Jianhui', 'Zhou, Yikun', 'Mei, Yan', 'Yang, Tonghua', 'Zhang, Yangmo']","['Yang X', 'Xu J', 'Yang J', 'Zhou Y', 'Mei Y', 'Yang T', 'Zhang Y']","[""Department of Ophthalmology, The First People's Hospital of Yunnan Province, Ocular Fundus Disease Research Center of Yunnan Province Department of General surgery, The First People's Hospital of Yunnan Province, The Affiliated Hospital of Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan Department of Ophthalmology, Dali University, Dali Department of Medicine, The First People's Hospital of Yunnan Province, Kunming Yunnan, China.""]",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', 'ZL1R02VT79 (Ranibizumab)']",IM,"['Angiogenesis Inhibitors/administration & dosage', 'Choroid/blood supply/pathology', '*Choroidal Neovascularization/diagnosis/drug therapy/etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy/*adverse effects/methods', 'Intravitreal Injections', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Ophthalmoscopy/methods', 'Ranibizumab/*administration & dosage', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vision Tests/methods', '*Vision, Low/diagnosis/etiology/therapy', 'Young Adult']",,,2018/04/19 06:00,2018/04/26 06:00,['2018/04/19 06:00'],"['2018/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000010344 [doi]', '00005792-201804200-00011 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2018 Apr;97(16):e0344. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000010344.,,,,PMC5916696,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of this report is to stress the importance of documenting and monitoring adverse drug reactions that arise from chemotherapy. After four years of treatment with the combined chemotherapy, the patient presented inguinal lymphadenopathy and enlarged lymph nodes and histopathology rapport was suggestive for plasmacytoid variant of Castleman disease. Three years later, biopsy of lymph node was performed and diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma - mixed cellularity has been established. Molecular analyses revealed presence of dominant monoclonal population of the immunoglobulin genes in the oligo/monoclonal background. Bone marrow biopsy findings suggested secondary myelodysplasia and revealed signs of hematopoietic cells dismaturation with signs of megaloblastic maturation of the erytropoetic lineage, appearance of ALIP (abnormal localization of immature precursors) in the myeloid lineage and dysplastic megakaryocytes. In addition, an increased level of polyclonal plasmacytes (lambda vs kappa was 60%:40%) was found. Hodgkin lymphoma and MDS occurring after 4 years of carboplatin/paclitaxel therapy might be contributed to the accumulation of alkylator-related DNA damage.

Here, we report an AuNP-based therapeutic system (HDL-AuNPs-BMS) for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) by delivering BMS309403 (BMS), a small molecule that selectively inhibits AML-promoting factor fatty acid-binding protein 4. To synthesize HDL-AuNPs-BMS, we use AuNP as a template to control conjugate size ensuring a spherical shape to engineer HDL-like nanoparticles containing BMS. The zeta potential and size of the HDL-AuNPs obtained from transmission electron microscopy demonstrate that the HDL-AuNPs-BMS are electrostatically stable and 25 nm in diameter. Functionally, compared to free drug, HDL-AuNPs-BMS conjugates are more readily internalized by AML cells and have more pronounced effects on downregulation of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), induction of DNA hypomethylation, and restoration of epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor p15(INK4B) coupled with AML growth arrest. Importantly, systemic administration of HDL-AuNPs-BMS conjugates into AML-bearing mice inhibits DNMT1-dependent DNA methylation, induces AML cell differentiation, and diminishes AML disease progression without obvious side effects. In summary, these data, for the first time, demonstrate HDL-AuNPs as an effective delivery platform with great potential to attach distinct inhibitors and HDL-AuNPs-BMS conjugates as a promising therapeutic platform to treat leukemia.","['Shen, Na', 'Yan, Fei', 'Pang, Jiuxia', 'Gao, Zhe', 'Al-Kali, Aref', 'Haynes, Christy L', 'Litzow, Mark R', 'Liu, Shujun']","['Shen N', 'Yan F', 'Pang J', 'Gao Z', 'Al-Kali A', 'Haynes CL', 'Litzow MR', 'Liu S']","['The Hormel Institute , University of Minnesota , Austin , Minnesota 55912 , United States.', 'The Hormel Institute , University of Minnesota , Austin , Minnesota 55912 , United States.', 'The Hormel Institute , University of Minnesota , Austin , Minnesota 55912 , United States.', 'Department of Chemistry , College of Science and Engineering , Minneapolis , Minnesota 55455 , United States.', 'Division of Hematology , Mayo Clinic , Rochester , Minnesota 55905 , United States.', 'Department of Chemistry , College of Science and Engineering , Minneapolis , Minnesota 55455 , United States.', 'Division of Hematology , Mayo Clinic , Rochester , Minnesota 55905 , United States.', 'The Hormel Institute , University of Minnesota , Austin , Minnesota 55912 , United States.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5420-5867', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2605-8089']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180418,United States,ACS Appl Mater Interfaces,ACS applied materials & interfaces,101504991,"[""0 (2-(2'-(5-ethyl-3,4-diphenyl-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)biphenyl-3-yloxy)acetic acid)"", '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Lipoproteins, HDL)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '7440-57-5 (Gold)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biphenyl Compounds', 'Gold', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Lipoproteins, HDL', '*Metal Nanoparticles', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Pyrazoles']",['NOTNLM'],"['DNA methylation', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'fatty acid-binding protein', 'gold nanoparticle', 'high-density lipoprotein']",2018/04/19 06:00,2019/02/16 06:00,['2018/04/19 06:00'],"['2018/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/16 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acsami.8b01696 [doi]'],ppublish,ACS Appl Mater Interfaces. 2018 May 2;10(17):14454-14462. doi: 10.1021/acsami.8b01696.

HTLV-I and HTLV-II are of clinically importance as they cause different diseases such as adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, tropical spastic paraparesis, and human T-lymphotropic virus type I-associated myelopathy (HAM). OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of presumptive and confirmatory reactivity to HTLV-I/II in blood donors of Hospital Pablo Tobon Uribe Blood Bank between 2014 and 2015. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The information was obtained from the Hospital Pablo Tobon Uribe Blood Bank database. We analyzed age, sex, place of origin, and place of residence of donors, and the reactivity using the screening test (ELISA) as well as the confirmatory test (immunoblot). RESULTS: The donor population studied included 6,275 men and 8,148 women, for a total of 14,423 donors recruited between March 1, 2014, and June 30, 2015. Of all tested donors, 25 were positive for HTLV-I/II by the screening test (ELISA). After performing the confirmatory test (immunoblot), only nine patients were positive for HTLV-I/II (36%), of whom eight were reactive to HTLV-I (32%) and one to HTLV-II (4%), for a global seroprevalence of 0.06% (CI 95%: 0.10-0.25). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings were consistent with those found in similar studies in non-endemic areas of the country and with those from studies at international level reported in the literature.","['Munoz, Manuela', 'Carvalho, Santiago', 'Donado, Jorge Hernando', 'Barco, Gloria Eugenia', 'Jaramillo, Sergio']","['Munoz M', 'Carvalho S', 'Donado JH', 'Barco GE', 'Jaramillo S']","['Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana, Medellin, Colombia. mamugogo@hotmail.com.']",,['spa'],['Journal Article'],20180315,Colombia,Biomedica,Biomedica : revista del Instituto Nacional de Salud,8205605,,IM,"['Adult', 'Blood Banks', 'Blood Donors/*statistics & numerical data', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Prevalence', 'Seroepidemiologic Studies']",['NOTNLM'],"['Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Retroviridae', 'blood banks', 'blood donors', 'human T-lymphotropic virus 2', 'prevalence']",2018/04/19 06:00,2018/07/17 06:00,['2018/04/19 06:00'],"['2016/06/22 00:00 [received]', '2016/11/29 00:00 [revised]', '2018/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7705/biomedica.v38i0.3417 [doi]'],epublish,Biomedica. 2018 Mar 15;38(1):37-41. doi: 10.7705/biomedica.v38i0.3417.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The goal of the study is to describe the incidence and outcome of IMI in patients after allo-HSCT in a large cohort of patients receiving anti-mold prophylaxis. We conducted a retrospective review of 988 consecutive adults who underwent allo-HSCT in our center from 2008 through 2014. Standard prophylaxis consisted of micafungin 150 mg IV daily from admission to day +7 +/- 3 followed by voriconazole until day +75 to +100. Cases meeting criteria for proven or probable IMI according to EORTC-MSG criteria were included. Median age at HSCT was 54 years. The most common diagnoses were acute myeloid leukemia (n = 351, 36%) and lymphoid malignancies (n = 248, 25%). Matched related or unrelated donors (URD) were used in 686 (69%) patients, mismatched URD in 142 (14%) and cord blood units in 154 (16%). Twenty-one patients were diagnosed with IMI after allo-HSCT, 19 probable and 2 proven, and one patient was diagnosed postmortem. Microbiological diagnosis was established in 9 cases, 5 of them being Aspergillus. One-year cumulative incidence (CI) of IMI was 1.6% (95% CI 0.9-2.5) while 12-week overall survival after IMI was 39% (95% CI 24-65) Analyzed by disease, there was a trend for a higher 1-year CI of IMI in patients with ALL (5% [95% CI 1.6-11.4]) when compared with AML (1.4%), MDS (1.5%) and lymphoma (1.2%), P = .06. The 1-year CI of IMI after transplantation is low in patients receiving anti-mold prophylaxis with micafungin bridged to voriconazole, although these infections are associated with a higher risk of mortality.","['Rosillo, Claudia', 'Avila, Ana Maria', 'Huang, Yao-Ting', 'Devlin, Sean', 'Cho, Christina', 'Montoro, Juan', 'Maloy, Molly A', 'Papanicolaou, Genovefa A', 'Barba, Pere', 'Perales, Miguel-Angel']","['Rosillo C', 'Avila AM', 'Huang YT', 'Devlin S', 'Cho C', 'Montoro J', 'Maloy MA', 'Papanicolaou GA', 'Barba P', 'Perales MA']","['Department of Medicine, Adult Bone Marrow Transplant Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Hospital Clinic, Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Medicine, Adult Bone Marrow Transplant Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'La Sabana School of Medicine, Bogota, Colombia.', 'Department of Medicine, Infectious Disease Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Adult Bone Marrow Transplant Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Adult Bone Marrow Transplant Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Hospital Universitario La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'Department of Medicine, Adult Bone Marrow Transplant Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Infectious Disease Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Adult Bone Marrow Transplant Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', ""Hospital Universitario Vall d'Hebron- Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Department of Medicine, Adult Bone Marrow Transplant Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1038-5197'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180507,Denmark,Transpl Infect Dis,Transplant infectious disease : an official journal of the Transplantation Society,100883688,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Echinocandins)', '0 (Lipopeptides)', 'JFU09I87TR (Voriconazole)', 'R10H71BSWG (Micafungin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibiotic Prophylaxis/*methods', 'Antifungal Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Echinocandins/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Fungi/*isolation & purification', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/mortality/surgery', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Invasive Fungal Infections/*epidemiology/microbiology/prevention & control', 'Lipopeptides/therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Micafungin', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Voriconazole/therapeutic use', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'antifungal', 'invasive fungal infection', 'molds']",2018/04/19 06:00,2018/11/06 06:00,['2018/04/19 06:00'],"['2017/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2018/01/25 00:00 [revised]', '2018/02/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/06 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/tid.12897 [doi]'],ppublish,Transpl Infect Dis. 2018 Aug;20(4):e12897. doi: 10.1111/tid.12897.

The 24-h pretreatment of BITC significantly inhibited the IL-13 expression enhanced by hydrogen peroxide. Although the BITC pretreatment did not change the enhanced level of the phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), it significantly inhibited the nuclear translocation of c-Jun induced by hydrogen peroxide. BITC also increased the protein expression of glutathione S-transferase (GST) isozymes, GSTP1/2, as well as the total GST activity. A GSTP1/2-specific inhibitor, 6-(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-ylthio)hexanol (NBDHEX), significantly counteracted the inhibitory effect of BITC on the hydrogen peroxide-enhanced IL-13 upregulation as well as the c-Jun nuclear translocation. Taken together, these results suggested that BITC inhibits the oxidative stress-mediated IL-13 mRNA expression, possibly through interference of the c-Jun phosphorylation by GSTP.","['Tang, Yue', 'Naito, Sho', 'Abe-Kanoh, Naomi', 'Ogawa, Seiji', 'Yamaguchi, Shu', 'Zhu, Beiwei', 'Murata, Yoshiyuki', 'Nakamura, Yoshimasa']","['Tang Y', 'Naito S', 'Abe-Kanoh N', 'Ogawa S', 'Yamaguchi S', 'Zhu B', 'Murata Y', 'Nakamura Y']","['School of Food Science and Technology, Dalian Polytechnic University, Dalian, 116034, China.', 'Graduate School of Environmental and Life Science, Okayama University, Okayama, 700-8530, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Environmental and Life Science, Okayama University, Okayama, 700-8530, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Environmental and Life Science, Okayama University, Okayama, 700-8530, Japan.', 'Department of Food Science, Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Tokushima University, Tokushima, 770-8503, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Environmental and Life Science, Okayama University, Okayama, 700-8530, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Environmental and Life Science, Okayama University, Okayama, 700-8530, Japan.', 'School of Food Science and Technology, Dalian Polytechnic University, Dalian, 116034, China.', 'Graduate School of Environmental and Life Science, Okayama University, Okayama, 700-8530, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Environmental and Life Science, Okayama University, Okayama, 700-8530, Japan.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7864-1903', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6606-9105']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180418,United States,J Biochem Mol Toxicol,Journal of biochemical and molecular toxicology,9717231,"['0 (6-(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-ylthio)hexanol)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-13)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Isothiocyanates)', '0 (Oxadiazoles)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '871J6YOR8Q (benzyl isothiocyanate)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Cell Nucleus/enzymology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Glutathione Transferase/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*toxicity', 'Interleukin-13/*genetics', 'Isoenzymes/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Isothiocyanates/*toxicity', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Oxadiazoles/pharmacology', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects/genetics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Transport', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",['NOTNLM'],"['benzyl isothiocyanate', 'c-Jun', 'glutathione S-transferase', 'hydrogen peroxide', 'interleukin 13']",2018/04/19 06:00,2018/08/16 06:00,['2018/04/19 06:00'],"['2017/12/26 00:00 [received]', '2018/02/08 00:00 [revised]', '2018/03/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/16 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jbt.22054 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biochem Mol Toxicol. 2018 Jun;32(6):e22054. doi: 10.1002/jbt.22054.

In addition, life-long irreversible late effects from chemo- and radiation therapy, including secondary malignancies, are a growing problem for leukemia survivors. Targeted therapy holds promising perspectives for cancer treatment as it may be more effective and have fewer side effects than conventional therapies. The phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway is a key regulatory cascade which controls proliferation, survival and drug-resistance of cancer cells, and it is frequently upregulated in the different subtypes of B-ALL, where it plays important roles in the pathophysiology, maintenance and progression of the disease. Moreover, activation of this signaling cascade portends a poorer prognosis in both pediatric and adult B-ALL patients. Promising preclinical data on PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitors have documented their anticancer activity in B-ALL and some of these novel drugs have entered clinical trials as they could lead to a longer event-free survival and reduce therapy-associated toxicity for patients with B-ALL. This review highlights the current status of PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitors in B-ALL, with an emphasis on emerging evidence of the superior efficacy of synergistic combinations involving the use of traditional chemotherapeutics or other novel, targeted agents.","['Simioni, Carolina', 'Martelli, Alberto M', 'Zauli, Giorgio', 'Vitale, Marco', 'McCubrey, James A', 'Capitani, Silvano', 'Neri, Luca M']","['Simioni C', 'Martelli AM', 'Zauli G', 'Vitale M', 'McCubrey JA', 'Capitani S', 'Neri LM']","['Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Parma, Parma, Italy.', 'CoreLab, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Parma, Parma, Italy.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Brody School of Medicine, East Carolina University, Greenville, North Carolina.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-7924-1477'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180418,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase/*genetics', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sirolimus/therapeutic use', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*B-ALL', '*PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling', '*combination therapy', '*protein kinase inhibitors', '*targeted therapy']",2018/04/19 06:00,2019/10/01 06:00,['2018/04/19 06:00'],"['2017/11/09 00:00 [received]', '2018/02/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/01 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.26539 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2018 Oct;233(10):6440-6454. doi: 10.1002/jcp.26539.

Over the years, a number of conventional cytotoxic approaches for neoplastic diseases has been developed. However, due to their limited effectiveness in accordance with the heterogeneity of cancer cells, there is a constant search for therapeutic approaches with improved outcome, such as immunotherapy that utilizes and enhances the normal capacity of the patient's immune system. METHODS: Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy involves genetic modification of patient's autologous T-cells to express a CAR specific for a tumor antigen, following by ex vivo cell expansion and re-infusion back to the patient. CARs are fusion proteins of a selected single-chain fragment variable from a specific monoclonal antibody and one or more T-cell receptor intracellular signaling domains. This T-cell genetic modification may occur either via viral-based gene transfer methods or nonviral methods, such as DNA-based transposons, CRISPR/Cas9 technology or direct transfer of in vitro transcribed-mRNA by electroporation. RESULTS: Clinical trials have shown very promising results in end-stage patients with a full recovery of up to 92% in Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia. Despite such results in hematological cancers, the effective translation of CAR T-cell therapy to solid tumors and the corresponding clinical experience is limited due to therapeutic barriers, like CAR T-cell expansion, persistence, trafficking, and fate within tumors. CONCLUSION: In this review, the basic design of CARs, the main genetic modification strategies, the safety matters as well as the initial clinical experience with CAR T-cells are described.","['Miliotou, Androulla N', 'Papadopoulou, Lefkothea C']","['Miliotou AN', 'Papadopoulou LC']","['Laboratory of Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, GR-54124 Thessaloniki, Macedonia, Greece.', 'Laboratory of Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, GR-54124 Thessaloniki, Macedonia, Greece.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Netherlands,Curr Pharm Biotechnol,Current pharmaceutical biotechnology,100960530,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/genetics/immunology/therapeutic use', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/genetics/immunology/therapeutic use', 'Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy/methods/*trends', 'Gene Transfer Techniques/trends', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/methods/*trends', 'Neoplasms/genetics/*immunology/*therapy', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/immunology/therapeutic use', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics/immunology/therapeutic use', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/immunology/therapeutic use', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer', 'T-cell therapy', 'chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)', 'genetic engineering', 'immunotherapy', 'safety.']",2018/04/19 06:00,2018/10/04 06:00,['2018/04/19 06:00'],"['2017/12/08 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/06 00:00 [revised]', '2018/04/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/04 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['CPB-EPUB-89803 [pii]', '10.2174/1389201019666180418095526 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Pharm Biotechnol. 2018;19(1):5-18. doi: 10.2174/1389201019666180418095526.,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.org.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The clinical records of 163 patients with LE were reviewed. Immunohistochemistry on rat brain, cultured neurons and cell-based assays were used to identify neuronal autoantibodies. Patients were included if (i) there was adequate clinical, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and magnetic resonance imaging information to classify the syndrome as LE, (ii) magnetic resonance images were accessible for central review and (iii) serum and CSF were available and were confirmed negative for neuronal antibodies. RESULTS: Twelve (7%) of 163 LE patients [median age 62 years; range 40-79; 9 (75%) male] without neuronal autoantibodies were identified. The most frequent initial complaints were deficits in short-term memory leading to hospital admission in a few weeks (median time 2 weeks; range 0.5-12). In four patients the short-term memory dysfunction remained as an isolated symptom during the entire course of the disease. Seizures, drowsiness and psychiatric problems were unusual. Four patients had solid tumors (one lung, one esophagus, two metastatic cervical adenopathies of unknown primary tumor) and one chronic lymphocytic leukemia. CSF showed pleocytosis in seven (58%) with a median of 13 white blood cells/mm(3) (range 9-25). Immunotherapy included corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulins and combinations of both drugs or with rituximab. Clinical improvement occurred in six (54%) of 11 assessable patients. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the discovery of new antibodies, 7% of LE patients remain seronegative. Antibody-negative LE is more frequent in older males and usually develops with predominant or isolated short-term memory loss. Despite the absence of antibodies, patients may have an underlying cancer and respond to immunotherapy.","['Graus, F', 'Escudero, D', 'Oleaga, L', 'Bruna, J', 'Villarejo-Galende, A', 'Ballabriga, J', 'Barcelo, M I', 'Gilo, F', 'Popkirov, S', 'Stourac, P', 'Dalmau, J']","['Graus F', 'Escudero D', 'Oleaga L', 'Bruna J', 'Villarejo-Galende A', 'Ballabriga J', 'Barcelo MI', 'Gilo F', 'Popkirov S', 'Stourac P', 'Dalmau J']","[""Neuroimmunology Program, Institut d'Investigacio Biomedica August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Service of Neurology, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Service of Neurology, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Radiology, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain.', ""Unit of Neuro-Oncology, Hospital de Bellvitge, Institut Catala d'Oncologia (ICO) L'Hospitalet, Institut d'Investigacio Biomedica de Bellvitge (IDIBELL), Hospitalet del Llobregat, Spain."", 'Service of Neurology, Hospital 12 de Octubre, Madrid, Spain.', 'Service of Neurology, Hospital Son Llatzer, Palma de Mallorca, Spain.', 'Service of Neurology, Hospital Son Espases, Palma de Mallorca, Spain.', 'Service of Neurology, Hospital Nuestra Senora del Rosario, Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Neurology, University Hospital Knappschaftskrankenhaus Bochum, Ruhr-University Bochum, Bochum, Germany.', 'Department of Neurology, Masaryk University and University Hospital, Brno, Czech Republic.', ""Neuroimmunology Program, Institut d'Investigacio Biomedica August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Institucio Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avancats (ICREA), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Neurology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-6852-6936', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6895-5047']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180521,England,Eur J Neurol,European journal of neurology,9506311,"['0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Autoantigens)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Autoantibodies/*analysis', 'Autoantigens/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukocytes/immunology', 'Leukocytosis', 'Limbic Encephalitis/*immunology/psychology/*therapy', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Memory Disorders/etiology/psychology', 'Memory, Short-Term', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/complications', 'Neurons/immunology', 'Rats', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['*antibodies', '*autoimmune', '*limbic encephalitis', '*paraneoplastic']",2018/04/19 06:00,2019/03/16 06:00,['2018/04/19 06:00'],"['2018/01/25 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/16 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ene.13661 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Neurol. 2018 Aug;25(8):1011-1016. doi: 10.1111/ene.13661.

However, to date, the studies were restricted to a few immune markers, which were considered separately. Using a nested case-control study within two European prospective cohorts, we measured plasma levels of 28 immune markers in samples collected a median of 6 years before diagnosis (range 2.01-15.97) in 268 incident cases of BCL (including multiple myeloma [MM]) and matched controls. Linear mixed models and partial least square analyses were used to analyze the association between levels of immune marker and the incidence of BCL and its main histological subtypes and to investigate potential biomarkers predictive of the time to diagnosis. Linear mixed model analyses identified associations linking lower levels of fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2 p = 7.2 x 10(-4) ) and transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha, p = 6.5 x 10(-5) ) and BCL incidence. Analyses stratified by histological subtypes identified inverse associations for MM subtype including FGF-2 (p = 7.8 x 10(-7) ), TGF-alpha (p = 4.08 x 10(-5) ), fractalkine (p = 1.12 x 10(-3) ), monocyte chemotactic protein-3 (p = 1.36 x 10(-4) ), macrophage inflammatory protein 1-alpha (p = 4.6 x 10(-4) ) and vascular endothelial growth factor (p = 4.23 x 10(-5) ). Our results also provided marginal support for already reported associations between chemokines and diffuse large BCL (DLBCL) and cytokines and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Case-only analyses showed that Granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor levels were consistently higher closer to diagnosis, which provides further evidence of its role in tumor progression. In conclusion, our study suggests a role of growth-factors in the incidence of MM and of chemokine and cytokine regulation in DLBCL and CLL.","['Vermeulen, Roel', 'Saberi Hosnijeh, Fatemeh',

Persistent C. psittaci infection can inhibit apoptosis in host cells, thus extending their survival and enabling them to complete their growth cycle. In this study, the antiapoptotic effects of persistent C. psittaci infection, induced by treatment with IFN-gamma, were found to be associated with both the death receptor and the mitochondrial pathways of apoptosis. These effects were mediated by Bcl-2 family members, as evidenced by the decreased expression of proapoptotic proteins, such as tBid and Bim. Simultaneously, the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1 was upregulated by persistent C. psittaci infection. Increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was observed; however, the expression of Bad, unlike that of other proapoptotic proteins, did not seem to be involved in this process. In summary, persistent chlamydial infection exerts antiapoptotic effects through both the death receptor and the mitochondrial pathways, in a process that is regulated by the ERK1/2 and apoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family.","['Li, Li', 'Wang, Chuan', 'Wen, Yating', 'Hu, Yuming', 'Xie, Yafeng', 'Xu, Man', 'Liang, Mingxing', 'Liu, Wei', 'Liu, Liangzhuan', 'Wu, Yimou']","['Li L', 'Wang C', 'Wen Y', 'Hu Y', 'Xie Y', 'Xu M', 'Liang M', 'Liu W', 'Liu L', 'Wu Y']","['Hunan Provincial Key Laboratory for Special Pathogens Prevention and Control, Institute of Pathogenic Biology, Medical College, University of South China, Hengyang, China; and Hunan Province Cooperative Innovation Center for Molecular Target New Drug Study, Hengyang, 421001, China.', 'Hunan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changsha, 410005, China.', 'Hunan Provincial Key Laboratory for Special Pathogens Prevention and Control, Institute of Pathogenic Biology, Medical College, University of South China, Hengyang, China; and Hunan Province Cooperative Innovation Center for Molecular Target New Drug Study, Hengyang, 421001, China.', 'Hunan Provincial Key Laboratory for Special Pathogens Prevention and Control, Institute of Pathogenic Biology, Medical College, University of South China, Hengyang, China; and Hunan Province Cooperative Innovation Center for Molecular Target New Drug Study, Hengyang, 421001, China.', 'Hunan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changsha, 410005, China.', 'Hunan Provincial Key Laboratory for Special Pathogens Prevention and Control, Institute of Pathogenic Biology, Medical College, University of South China, Hengyang, China; and Hunan Province Cooperative Innovation Center for Molecular Target New Drug Study, Hengyang, 421001, China.', 'Hunan Provincial Key Laboratory for Special Pathogens Prevention and Control, Institute of Pathogenic Biology, Medical College, University of South China, Hengyang, China; and Hunan Province Cooperative Innovation Center for Molecular Target New Drug Study, Hengyang, 421001, China.', 'Hunan Provincial Key Laboratory for Special Pathogens Prevention and Control, Institute of Pathogenic Biology, Medical College, University of South China, Hengyang, China; and Hunan Province Cooperative Innovation Center for Molecular Target New Drug Study, Hengyang, 421001, China.', 'Hunan Provincial Key Laboratory for Special Pathogens Prevention and Control, Institute of Pathogenic Biology, Medical College, University of South China, Hengyang, China; and Hunan Province Cooperative Innovation Center for Molecular Target New Drug Study, Hengyang, 421001, China.', 'Hunan Provincial Key Laboratory for Special Pathogens Prevention and Control, Institute of Pathogenic Biology, Medical College, University of South China, Hengyang, China; and Hunan Province Cooperative Innovation Center for Molecular Target New Drug Study, Hengyang, 421001, China.', 'Hunan Provincial Key Laboratory for Special Pathogens Prevention and Control, Institute of Pathogenic Biology, Medical College, University of South China, Hengyang, China; and Hunan Province Cooperative Innovation Center for Molecular Target New Drug Study, Hengyang, 421001, China. yimouwu@sina.com.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Inflammation,Inflammation,7600105,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*metabolism', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Cell Line', '*Chlamydophila psittaci', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*physiology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism/*physiology', 'Psittacosis/*pathology']",['NOTNLM'],"['Bcl-2 family proteins', 'Chlamydia psittaci', 'IFN-gamma', 'apoptosis', 'persistent infection']",2018/04/19 06:00,2018/11/27 06:00,['2018/04/19 06:00'],"['2018/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/27 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10753-018-0785-8 [doi]', '10.1007/s10753-018-0785-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Inflammation. 2018 Aug;41(4):1372-1383. doi: 10.1007/s10753-018-0785-8.,,,"['31300156/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '31270218/National Natural Science Foundation of China']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The clinical, radiological, histological, and molecular findings are described of three cases of radiation-induced glioblastoma after the treatment for ALL. They received radiation therapy at age 6-8 years. The latency from radiation therapy to the onset of radiation-induced glioblastoma was 5-10 years. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated diffuse lesions with multiple small enhanced lesions in all cases. Histological examination showed that the tumors consisted of mainly small round astrocytic atypical cells in one case, and astrocytic atypical cells with elongated cytoplasm and nuclear pleomorphism with small cell component in two cases. Microvascular proliferation was present in all cases. Immunohistochemical analysis for B-Raf V600E, and mutational analysis for the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1, IDH2, and H3F3A gene revealed the wild-type alleles in all three cases. The integrated diagnoses were IDH wild-type glioblastoma, and local irradiation and concomitant temozolomide were performed. After the initial treatment, significant shrinkage of the diffuse lesion and enhanced lesion was found in all cases. Radiation-induced glioblastoma occurring after the treatment for ALL had unique clinical, radiological, histological, and molecular characteristics in our three cases.","['Kajitani, Takumi', 'Kanamori, Masayuki', 'Saito, Ryuta', 'Watanabe, Yuko', 'Suzuki, Hiroyoshi', 'Watanabe, Mika', 'Kure, Shigeo', 'Tominaga, Teiji']","['Kajitani T', 'Kanamori M', 'Saito R', 'Watanabe Y', 'Suzuki H', 'Watanabe M', 'Kure S', 'Tominaga T']","['Department of Neurosurgery, Graduate School of Medicine, Tohoku University, 1-1 Seiryo-cho, Aoba-ku, Sendai, Miyagi, 980-8574, Japan.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Graduate School of Medicine, Tohoku University, 1-1 Seiryo-cho, Aoba-ku, Sendai, Miyagi, 980-8574, Japan. mkanamori@med.tohoku.ac.jp.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Graduate School of Medicine, Tohoku University, 1-1 Seiryo-cho, Aoba-ku, Sendai, Miyagi, 980-8574, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, Tohoku University, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, National Hospital Organization Sendai Medical Center, Sendai, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Tohoku University Hospital, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, Tohoku University, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Graduate School of Medicine, Tohoku University, 1-1 Seiryo-cho, Aoba-ku, Sendai, Miyagi, 980-8574, Japan.']",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20180417,Japan,Brain Tumor Pathol,Brain tumor pathology,9716507,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (H3-3A protein, human)', '0 (Histones)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (IDH2, human)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.1.1.42.

Aberrant activity of this signaling pathway is linked to the initiation and progression of several hematological malignancies, exemplified by T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Interestingly, frequent non-mutational activation of NOTCH1 signaling has recently been demonstrated in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), significantly extending the pathogenic significance of this pathway in B-CLL. Leukemia patients often present with high-blood cell counts, diffuse disease with infiltration of the bone marrow, secondary lymphoid organs, and diffusion to the central nervous system (CNS). Chemokines are chemotactic cytokines that regulate migration of cells between tissues and the positioning and interactions of cells within tissue. Homeostatic chemokines and their receptors have been implicated in regulating organ-specific infiltration, but may also directly and indirectly modulate tumor growth. Recently, oncogenic NOTCH1 has been shown to regulate infiltration of leukemic cells into the CNS hijacking the CC-chemokine ligand 19/CC-chemokine receptor 7 chemokine axis. In addition, a crucial role for the homing receptor axis CXC-chemokine ligand 12/CXC-chemokine receptor 4 has been demonstrated in leukemia maintenance and progression. Moreover, the CCL25/CCR9 axis has been implicated in the homing of leukemic cells into the gut, particularly in the presence of phosphatase and tensin homolog tumor suppressor loss. In this review, we summarize the latest developments regarding the role of NOTCH signaling in regulating the chemotactic microenvironmental cues involved in the generation and progression of T-ALL and compare these findings to B-CLL.","['Piovan, Erich', 'Tosello, Valeria', 'Amadori, Alberto', 'Zanovello, Paola']","['Piovan E', 'Tosello V', 'Amadori A', 'Zanovello P']","['UOC Immunologia e Diagnostica Molecolare Oncologica, Istituto Oncologico Veneto IOV-IRCCS, Padova, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Scienze Chirurgiche, Oncologiche e Gastroenterologiche, Universita di Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'UOC Immunologia e Diagnostica Molecolare Oncologica, Istituto Oncologico Veneto IOV-IRCCS, Padova, Italy.', 'UOC Immunologia e Diagnostica Molecolare Oncologica, Istituto Oncologico Veneto IOV-IRCCS, Padova, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Scienze Chirurgiche, Oncologiche e Gastroenterologiche, Universita di Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'UOC Immunologia e Diagnostica Molecolare Oncologica, Istituto Oncologico Veneto IOV-IRCCS, Padova, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Scienze Chirurgiche, Oncologiche e Gastroenterologiche, Universita di Padova, Padova, Italy.']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20180403,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,"['0 (Chemokines)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinogenesis', 'Cell Movement', 'Central Nervous System/*immunology', 'Chemokines/metabolism', 'Chemotaxis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Receptor, Notch1/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Microenvironment']",['NOTNLM'],"['*CXC-chemokine receptor 4', '*CXCR7', '*NOTCH', '*T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*chemokines', '*infiltration', '*stromal-derived factor-1']",2018/04/19 06:00,2018/04/19 06:01,['2018/04/19 06:00'],"['2018/01/24 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/19 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2018.00633 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2018 Apr 3;9:633. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2018.00633. eCollection 2018.,,,,PMC5891592,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although this system is highly expressed in interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-treated cells and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1)-expressing cells, its identity remains incompletely understood. Tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (TrpRS) is also highly expressed in IFN-gamma-treated cells and also has high affinity and selectivity for Trp. Here, we investigated the effects of human TrpRS expression on Trp uptake into IFN-gamma-treated human THP-1 monocytes or HeLa cells. Inhibition of human TrpRS expression by TrpRS-specific siRNAs decreased and overexpression of TrpRS increased Trp uptake into the cells. Of note, the TrpRS-mediated uptake system had more than hundred-fold higher affinity for Trp than the known System L amino acid transporter, promoted uptake of low Trp concentrations, and had very high Trp selectivity. Moreover, site-directed mutagenesis experiments indicated that Trp- and ATP-binding sites, but not tRNA-binding sites, in TrpRS are essential for TrpRS-mediated Trp uptake into the human cells. We further demonstrate that the addition of purified TrpRS to cell culture medium increases Trp uptake into cells. Taken together, our results reveal that TrpRS plays an important role in high-affinity Trp uptake into human cells.","['Miyanokoshi, Miki', 'Yokosawa, Takumi', 'Wakasugi, Keisuke']","['Miyanokoshi M', 'Yokosawa T', 'Wakasugi K']","['From the Department of Life Sciences, Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, University of Tokyo, 3-8-1 Komaba, Meguro-ku, Tokyo 153-8902, Japan and.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Graduate School of Science, University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-0033, Japan.', 'From the Department of Life Sciences, Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, University of Tokyo, 3-8-1 Komaba, Meguro-ku, Tokyo 153-8902, Japan and wakasugi@bio.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Graduate School of Science, University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-0033, Japan.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180417,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (IFNG protein, human)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '8DUH1N11BX (Tryptophan)', 'EC 6.1.1.2 (Tryptophan-tRNA Ligase)']",IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Conformation', 'Tryptophan/*metabolism', 'Tryptophan-tRNA Ligase/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",['NOTNLM'],"['*amino acid transport', '*aminoacyl tRNA synthetase', '*indoleamine-pyrrole 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1)', '*interferon', '*mutagenesis', '*tryptophan', '*tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase']",2018/04/19 06:00,2019/01/17 06:00,['2018/04/19 06:00'],"['2017/12/03 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/03 00:00 [revised]', '2018/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/17 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)39087-6 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.RA117.001247 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2018 Jun 1;293(22):8428-8438. doi: 10.1074/jbc.RA117.001247.

CLL and MCL are classically considered indolent and aggressive neoplasms, respectively. However, the clinical evolution of both tumors is very heterogeneous, with subsets of patients having stable disease for a long time whereas others require immediate intervention. Both CLL and MCL include 2 major molecular subtypes that seem to derive from antigen-experienced CD5(+) B cells that retain a naive or memory-like epigenetic signature and carry a variable load of immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region somatic mutations from truly unmutated to highly mutated, respectively. These 2 subtypes of tumors differ in their molecular pathways, genomic alterations, and clinical behavior, being more aggressive in naive-like than memory-like-derived tumors in both CLL and MCL. The pathogenesis of the 2 entities integrates the relevant influence of B-cell receptor signaling, tumor cell microenvironment interactions, genomic alterations, and epigenome modifications that configure the evolution of the tumors and offer new possibilities for therapeutic intervention. This review will focus on the similarities and differences of these 2 tumors based on recent studies that are enhancing the understanding of their pathogenesis and creating solid bases for new management strategies.","['Puente, Xose S', 'Jares, Pedro', 'Campo, Elias']","['Puente XS', 'Jares P', 'Campo E']","['Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Instituto Universitario de Oncologia, Universidad de Oviedo, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer, Madrid, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hematopathology Section, Laboratory of Pathology, Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; and.', ""Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hematopathology Section, Laboratory of Pathology, Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; and.', ""Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer, Barcelona, Spain.""]","['ORCID: 0000-0001-9525-1483', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8401-579X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9850-9793']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20180417,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,"['Biomarkers', 'Clonal Evolution', 'Disease Susceptibility', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*etiology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/*etiology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Signal Transduction', '*Tumor Microenvironment']",,,2018/04/19 06:00,2019/05/22 06:00,['2018/04/19 06:00'],"['2017/10/31 00:00 [received]', '2018/01/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/22 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)32206-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2017-10-764373 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2018 May 24;131(21):2283-2296. doi: 10.1182/blood-2017-10-764373.

Consistent with previous reports, t-MN cells preferentially acquired mutations in TP53 and epigenetic modifying genes, instead of mutations in tyrosine kinase and spliceosome genes. Furthermore, we compared the mutation status of three t-MN cells with each of the initial lymphoid malignant cells, and identified common mutations among t-MN and the initial malignant cells in two patients. In a patient who developed chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) after follicular lymphoma (FL), TET2 mutation was identified in both CMML and FL cells. Notably, the TET2 mutation was also identified in peripheral blood cells in the disease-free period with the same allelic frequency as CMML and FL cells, but not in a germ-line control, indicating that the TET2 mutation occurred somatically in the initiating clone for both malignant cells. On the other hand, a germ-line MYB mutation was identified in a patient who developed myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) after FL. These results suggest that germ-line deposition and clonal hematopoiesis are closely associated with t-MN susceptibility; however, further analysis is necessary to clarify the mechanism required to provide the initiating clone with lineage commitment and clonal expansion.","['Nishiyama, Takahiro', 'Ishikawa, Yuichi', 'Kawashima, Naomi', 'Akashi, Akimi', 'Adachi, Yoshiya', 'Hattori, Hikaru', 'Ushijima, Yoko', 'Kiyoi, Hitoshi']","['Nishiyama T', 'Ishikawa Y', 'Kawashima N', 'Akashi A', 'Adachi Y', 'Hattori H', 'Ushijima Y', 'Kiyoi H']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan; Department of Medical Technique, Nagoya University Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.

RESULTS: Bone marrow cell morphological examination showed the typical lymphoma cells in all the patients. The expression of differentiation antigens in lymphoma cell leukemia was consistent with that of original pathological diagnosis. In T-cell lymphoma cell leukemia, the expression of CD7, CD3, CD2, CD5, CD11b, CD34, and HLA-DR were present predominantly, among them the CD7 was the most sensitive antigen and its positive expression rate was 69.2%. In B-cell lymphoma cell leukemia, the expression of CD19, CD20, CD22, CD79a, Skappa, and early antigen HLA-DR were observed predominantly, among them the positive expression rate of CD19 was the highest (89.5%). Out of 35 cases, 28 cases showed that the percentage of lymphoma cells on bone marrow smears was consistent with that of bone marrow immunophenotyping, and 7 cases showed that the percentage of lymphoma cells between bone marrow smears and immunophenotyping differed by more than 1.5-fold. CONCLUSION: Bone marrow slides combined with immunophenotyping may be helpful for judging lymphoma cell marrow invasion and making early diagnosis of lymphoma cell leukemia.","['Wang, Wen-Juan', 'Zhao, Juan', 'He, Peng-Cheng', 'Wang, Xiao-Ning']","['Wang WJ', 'Zhao J', 'He PC', 'Wang XN']","[""Department of Hematology,The First Affiliated Hospital of XI'an Jiaotong University,Xi'an 710061, Shaanxi Province, China."", ""Department of Hematology,The First Affiliated Hospital of XI'an Jiaotong University,Xi'an 710061, Shaanxi Province, China."", ""Department of Hematology,The First Affiliated Hospital of XI'an Jiaotong University,Xi'an 710061, Shaanxi Province, China.

This study was aimed to evaluate the potential relation of erythrocyte mean corpuscular volume (MCV) increase after the treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) with the therapeutic response in patients with CML-chronic phase (CML-CP). METHODS: The clinical and hematologic data including MCV, molecular and cytogenetic response of 119 patients with CML-CP were collected after treatment with TKIs, and the relation of MCV changes after treatment with the clinical characteristics and therapeutic efficacy for patients with CML-CP was analyzed. RESULTS: The MCV in patients treated with TKIs for 12 months significantly increased as compared with that at initial diagnosis (P<0.05). The proportion of patients with increased MCV in group of complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) was significantly higher than that in group of non-CCyR (P<0.05).

METHODS: Thirty-three patients aged 1-13 with acute myelocytic leukemia (non-M3) were diagnosed from January 2013 to June 2017. FAB typing showed that 1 case in M0, 4 cases in M1, 12 cases in M2, 5 cases in M4, 8 cases in M5, 1 case in M6, and 2 cases in M7; Risk stratification showed that: 19 cases in standard risk, and 14 cases in high risk. All patients were treated with NOPHO-AML 2004 chemotherapy regimen. SPSS 22.0 software was used, the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis method and Cox regression model were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: In the first course of treatment (AIET), among 33 child patients there were 27 cases with complete remission, and 5 cases with non-remission, thus the remission rate was 81.8%. Out of the 5 child patients without remission, 4 cases reached to the complete remission after the second course (AM), and 1 case did not remission, thus the total remission rate was 96.9%.9 cases (27.3%) underwent bone marrow recurrence and the median recurrence time was 30 months after complete continuous remission. Univariate analysis showed that age and erythrocyte transfusion frequency were significant factors to affect the early treatment response; the multiple Cox regression analysis showed that: age >7, MRD positive, erythrocyte transfusion >4 times and poor response to early treatment were independent risk factors for recurrence; Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation(HSCT) in 8 high-risk children received enhanced chemotherapy had better efficacy as compared with the chemotherapy alone. The 3-year event-free survival rate was 59.9%, and 3-year overall survival rate was 69.2%. 33 children patients experienced varying degrees of infection and myelosuppression, or drug-related gastrointestinal reactions and allergic reactions, patients were tolerable to these side reactions after active symptomatic treatment. CONCLUSION: NOPHO-AML 2004 chemotherapy regimen has high response rate and good tolerance, early treatment response is an important factor influencing prognosis. Age and repeated red blood cell infusions are the important factors influencing the prognosis, which promote bone marrow recurrence in AML children. For the children suffered from clinical high-risk AML, the NOPHO-AML 2004 chemotherapy regimen combined with HSCT can improve the prognosis of patients.","['Qiu, Kun-Yin', 'Liao, Xiong-Yu', 'Huang, Ke', 'Li, Yang', 'Weng, Wen-Jun', 'Xu, Hong-Gui', 'Fang, Jian-Pei', 'Wu, Ruo-Hao', 'Zhou, Dun-Hua']","['Qiu KY', 'Liao XY', 'Huang K', 'Li Y', 'Weng WJ', 'Xu HG', 'Fang JP', 'Wu RH', 'Zhou DH']","['Department of Paediatrics, SUN Yat-Sen Memoria Hospital, SUN Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou 510120, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Department of Paediatrics, SUN Yat-Sen Memoria Hospital, SUN Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou 510120, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Department of Paediatrics, SUN Yat-Sen Memoria Hospital, SUN Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou 510120, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Department of Paediatrics, SUN Yat-Sen Memoria Hospital, SUN Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou 510120, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Department of Paediatrics, SUN Yat-Sen Memoria Hospital, SUN Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou 510120, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Department of Paediatrics, SUN Yat-Sen Memoria Hospital, SUN Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou 510120, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Department of Paediatrics, SUN Yat-Sen Memoria Hospital, SUN Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou 510120, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Department of Paediatrics, SUN Yat-Sen Memoria Hospital, SUN Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou 510120, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Department of Paediatrics, SUN Yat-Sen Memoria Hospital, SUN Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou 510120, Guangdong Province, China.

METHODS: Based on the gene expression microarray platform of 486 AML cases, the PRAM1 expression phenotypes were summarized in all of AML subtypes. The PRAM1 expression features were explored in every differentiation stage of hematocytes through normal human stem cell chips and bone marrow gene expression microarray. The clinical drugs which could up-regulate PRAM1 expression in AML cell lines should be found out. RESULTS: The PRAM1 expression was the richest in the inv(16) AML and the lowest in the t(15;17)M3, almost the same in the other subtypes of AML. By the classification of molecular abnormalities, PRAM1 expression was more in the panel of CN-AML with CEBPAdm than the other two panels. Interestingly, high/low expression of PRAM1 could be re-classified in the CN-AML, and the EFS is statistically significant. It was proven again that PRAM1 is more expressed in the mature granulocytes. Finally, it was confirmed that decitabine and the chidamide could up-regulate PRAM1 expression in AML cell lines, and chidamide effect is better. CONCLUSION: PRAM1 expression is the lowest in t(15;17) M3 and the highest in inv(16) AML. The high expression of PRAM1 is a sign for favorable prognosis in the CN-AML.

The inhibitory rate of Jurkat and CCRF-CEM cells at 0.2 mmol/L Fluvastatin was 41.14% and 57.08% respectively, while the 0.2 mmol/L Simvastatin could supress 68.42% of Jurkat and 77.10% of CCRF-CEM cells. Half or more than half of cell inhibition were observed in Statins-treated groups with significantly statistical differences, compared with the control groups (P<0.05). After the Jurkat and CCRF-CEM cells were treated with Fluvastation and Simvastation of different concentrations for 24 hours, the proportion of early and later apoptotic cells both increased; moreover, the total apoptotic rate increased significantly(P<0.05) at 0.2 mmol/L and 0.3 mmol/L concentration of Fluvastatin and Simvastatin. The detection of cell cycle showed that both of Jurkat and CCRF-CEM cells were arrested in G1 phase. Western blot revealed that, in comparison with the control group, the expressions of BAX, p21 and p27 in cells treated with Statins were up-regulated, while Cyclin D1, BCL-2 and p-Akt expressions were down-regulated. CONCLUSION: Statins can suppress T-ALL cell proliferation and induce cell apoptosis through the inhibition of Akt pathway.","['Wang, Jun-Jie', 'Tian, Yu', 'Xu, Kai-Lin', 'Fu, Rui-Xue', 'Niu, Ming-Shan', 'Zhao, Kai']","['Wang JJ', 'Tian Y', 'Xu KL', 'Fu RX', 'Niu MS', 'Zhao K']","['Institute of Hematology, Xuzhou Medical College, Department of Hematology of The Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical College; Xuzhou 221000, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Xuzhou Medical College, Department of Hematology of The Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical College; Xuzhou 221000, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Xuzhou Medical College, Department of Hematology of The Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical College; Xuzhou 221000, Jiangsu Province, China; Key subject, Key Laboratory of Bone Marrow Stem Cells, Xuzhou 221000, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Xuzhou Medical College, Department of Hematology of The Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical College; Xuzhou 221000, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Xuzhou Medical College, Department of Hematology of The Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical College; Xuzhou 221000, Jiangsu Province, China; Key subject, Key Laboratory of Bone Marrow Stem Cells, Xuzhou 221000, Jiangsu Province, China.

METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 128 newly diagnosed AML (except type M3) patients was performed between January 2014 and July 2017. Patients were divided into FLT3-ITD mutated group and non-mutated group. Mutation detection was carried out by using polymerase chain reaction(PCR) and gene sequencing analysis. Standard 3 + 7 or CAG regimen were taken as the first induction chemotherapy, 4 cases received sorafenib, overall survival (OS) was calculated by Kaplan-Meier. RESULTS: Ninety-seven patients can be evaluable for clinical data available; 4 patients were FLT3-TKD mutated, which accounted for 4.1%; 19 patients were FLT3-ITD mutated, which accounted for 19.59%(19/97). Median white blood cell count (WBC), percentage of peripheral blasts and LDH value were significantly higher in FLT3-ITD group than those in non-mutated group [64.65(1.07-587.92)x10(9)/L vs 39.68 (0.45-203.81) x10(9)/L](P<0.01), [69.62(16-99)% vs 36.35(0-92) %](P<0.01 ) and [LDH 526(124-2 729)U/L vs 265(20-1977)U/L](P<0.05), respectively. The frequency of coexisting NPM1 mutation was higher in FLT3-ITD group than that in non-mutated group [36.8(7/19)% vs 6.8 (5/74) %](P<0.01). The CR+PR was lower in FLT3-ITD group than that in non-mutated group [31.6(6/19)% vs 64.9 (48/74)%](P<0.05). OS in FLT3-ITD group was significantly shorter than that in non-mutated group (5 vs 18 months)(P<0.05). There is no significant difference in OS between FLT3-ITD concomitant with and without NPM1 mutation groups(5 vs 5 months)(P>0.05). The median OS was 13 months for the FLT3-ITD patients taking sorafenib. CONCLUSION: The FLT3-ITD is a common mutation in AML, FLT3-ITD mutated AML is more likely concomitant with NPM1 mutation with higher number of WBC, percentage of peripheral blasts and LDH value, thus CR is low after the 1st treatment and survival is poor.","['Liu, Yan', 'Ke, Xiao-Yan', 'Wang, Jing', 'Wang, Ji-Jun', 'Jing, Hong-Mei', 'Dong, Fei']","['Liu Y', 'Ke XY', 'Wang J', 'Wang JJ', 'Jing HM', 'Dong F']","['Department of Hematology, Peking University Third Hosital, Beijing 100191,China.', 'Department of Hematology, Peking University Third Hosital, Beijing 100191,China.

CONCLUSION: The expression level of E2F1 gene in patients with AL has been found to be higher, the higher level of E2F1 gene closely relates with AL patients, E2F1 gene can be used as a biological target for the clinical treatment of AL.","['Zhuang, Xiang-Long', 'Guan, Rui-Ting', 'Wu, Shi-Xin', 'Miu, Dong', 'Qin, Tong']","['Zhuang XL', 'Guan RT', 'Wu SX', 'Miu D', 'Qin T']","['Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Quanzhou 362000, FuJian Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Quanzhou 362000, FuJian Province, China.', 'Department of Laboratorial Examination, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Quanzhou 362000, FuJian Province, China.

Aberrant AS plays an important role in regulating various diseases, including cancers. METHODS: In this study, we integrated AS events derived from RNA-seq with H3K79me2 ChIP-seq data across 34 different normal and cancer cell types and found the higher enrichment of H3K79me2 in two AS types, skipping exon (SE) and alternative 3' splice site (A3SS). RESULTS: Interestingly, by applying self-organizing map (SOM) clustering, we unveiled two clusters mainly comprised of blood cancer cell types with a strong correlation between H3K79me2 and SE. Remarkably, the expression of transcripts associated with SE was not significantly different from that of those not associated with SE, indicating the involvement of H3K79me2 in splicing has little impact on full mRNA transcription. We further showed that the deletion of DOT1L1, the sole H3K79 methyltransferase, impeded leukemia cell proliferation as well as switched exon skipping to the inclusion isoform in two MLL-rearranged acute myeloid leukemia cell lines. Our data demonstrate H3K79me2 was involved in mediating SE processing, which might in turn influence transformation and disease progression in leukemias. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our work for the first time reveals that H3K79me2 plays functional and regulatory roles through a co-transcriptional splicing mechanism.","['Li, Tianbao', 'Liu, Qi', 'Garza, Nick', 'Kornblau, Steven', 'Jin, Victor X']","['Li T', 'Liu Q', 'Garza N', 'Kornblau S', 'Jin VX']","['College of Life Science, Jilin University, Changchun, 130012, China.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Texas Health, 8403 Floyd Curl, San Antonio, TX, 78229, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Texas Health, 8403 Floyd Curl, San Antonio, TX, 78229, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Texas Health, 8403 Floyd Curl, San Antonio, TX, 78229, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, 21218, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Texas Health, 8403 Floyd Curl, San Antonio, TX, 78229, USA.

The transforming activity and subcellular localization of Tax is strongly influenced by posttranslational modifications, among which ubiquitylation and SUMOylation have been identified as key regulators of the nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttling of Tax, as well as its ability to activate NF-kappaB signaling. RESULTS: Adding to the complex posttranslational modification landscape of Tax, we here demonstrate that Tax also interacts with the ubiquitin-related modifier 1 (Urm1). Conjugation of Urm1 to Tax results in a redistribution of Tax to the cytoplasm and major increase in the transcription of the NF-kB targets Rantes and interleukin-6. Utilizing a tax-transgenic Drosophila model, we show that the Urm1-dependent subcellular targeting of Tax is evolutionary conserved, and that the presence of Urm1 is strongly correlated with the transcriptional output of Diptericin, an antimicrobial peptide and established downstream target of NF-kappaB in flies. CONCLUSIONS: These data put forward Urm1 as a novel Tax modifier that modulates its oncogenic activity and hence represents a potential novel target for developing new strategies for treating ATL.","['Hleihel, Rita', 'Khoshnood, Behzad', 'Dacklin, Ingrid', 'Omran, Hayssam', 'Mouawad, Carine', 'Dassouki, Zeina', 'El-Sabban, Marwan', 'Shirinian, Margret', 'Grabbe, Caroline', 'Bazarbachi, Ali']","['Hleihel R', 'Khoshnood B', 'Dacklin I', 'Omran H', 'Mouawad C', 'Dassouki Z', 'El-Sabban M', 'Shirinian M', 'Grabbe C', 'Bazarbachi A']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Anatomy, Cell Biology and Physiological Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut, Medical Center, P.O.

Therefore, developing effective computational models for the prediction of novel associations between diseases and miRNAs could be beneficial for achieving an understanding of disease mechanisms at the miRNA level and the interactions between diseases and miRNAs at the disease level. Thus far, only a few miRNA-disease association pairs are known, and models analyzing miRNA-disease associations based on lncRNA are limited. RESULTS: In this study, a new computational method based on a distance correlation set is developed to predict miRNA-disease associations (DCSMDA) by integrating known lncRNA-disease associations, known miRNA-lncRNA associations, disease semantic similarity, and various lncRNA and disease similarity measures. The novelty of DCSMDA is due to the construction of a miRNA-lncRNA-disease network, which reveals that DCSMDA can be applied to predict potential lncRNA-disease associations without requiring any known miRNA-disease associations. Although the implementation of DCSMDA does not require known disease-miRNA associations, the area under curve is 0.8155 in the leave-one-out cross validation. Furthermore, DCSMDA was implemented in case studies of prostatic neoplasms, lung neoplasms and leukaemia, and of the top 10 predicted associations, 10, 9 and 9 associations, respectively, were separately verified in other independent studies and biological experimental studies. In addition, 10 of the 10 (100%) associations predicted by DCSMDA were supported by recent bioinformatical studies. CONCLUSIONS: According to the simulation results, DCSMDA can be a great addition to the biomedical research field.","['Zhao, Haochen', 'Kuang, Linai', 'Wang, Lei', 'Ping, Pengyao', 'Xuan, Zhanwei', 'Pei, Tingrui', 'Wu, Zhelun']","['Zhao H', 'Kuang L', 'Wang L', 'Ping P', 'Xuan Z', 'Pei T', 'Wu Z']","[""Key Laboratory of Intelligent Computing & Information Processing (Xiangtan University), Ministry of Education, China, Xiangtan, 411105, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""College of Information Engineering, Xiangtan University, Xiangtan, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""College of Computer Engineering & Applied Mathematics, Changsha University, Changsha, 410001, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of Intelligent Computing & Information Processing (Xiangtan University), Ministry of Education, China, Xiangtan, 411105, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""College of Information Engineering, Xiangtan University, Xiangtan, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""College of Computer Engineering & Applied Mathematics, Changsha University, Changsha, 410001, Hunan, People's Republic of China. wanglei@xtu.edu.cn."", ""Key Laboratory of Intelligent Computing & Information Processing (Xiangtan University), Ministry of Education, China, Xiangtan, 411105, Hunan, People's Republic of China. wanglei@xtu.edu.cn."", 'Department of Computer Science, Lakehead University, Thunder Bay, ON, P7B5E1, Canada. wanglei@xtu.edu.cn.', ""College of Information Engineering, Xiangtan University, Xiangtan, Hunan, People's Republic of China. wanglei@xtu.edu.cn."", ""Key Laboratory of Intelligent Computing & Information Processing (Xiangtan University), Ministry of Education, China, Xiangtan, 411105, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""College of Information Engineering, Xiangtan University, Xiangtan, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of Intelligent Computing & Information Processing (Xiangtan University), Ministry of Education, China, Xiangtan, 411105, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""College of Information Engineering, Xiangtan University, Xiangtan, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of Intelligent Computing & Information Processing (Xiangtan University), Ministry of Education, China, Xiangtan, 411105, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""College of Information Engineering, Xiangtan University, Xiangtan, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", 'Department of Computer Science, Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey, USA.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-5065-8447'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180417,England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)']",IM,"['Algorithms', 'Area Under Curve', 'Computational Biology', 'Databases, Genetic', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism', 'Models, Genetic', 'Neoplasms/genetics', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/genetics/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Disease-lncRNA-miRNA network', '*Distance correlation set', '*MiRNA-disease association predictions', '*Similarity measure']",2018/04/19 06:00,2018/10/30 06:00,['2018/04/19 06:00'],"['2017/10/18 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12859-018-2146-x [doi]', '10.1186/s12859-018-2146-x [pii]']",epublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2018 Apr 17;19(1):141. doi: 10.1186/s12859-018-2146-x.,,,"['No.61640210/National Natural Science Foundation of China/International', 'No.61672447/National Natural Science Foundation of China/International', 'No. NGII20160305/CERNET Next Generation Internet Technology Innovation', 'Project/International', 'No.2017JJ5036/Science &amp; Education Joint Project of Hunan Natural Science', 'Foundation/International', 'No.11KZ|KZ03051/Upgrading Project of Industry-University- Research of Xiangtan', 'University/International']",PMC5905221,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the OVA-induced allergic asthma mouse model, increased inflammatory cells and elevated Th2 and Th1 cytokine levels were observed in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue. PD1 administration decreased the numbers of inflammatory cells, especially eosinophils, and reduced the mRNA and protein levels of the Th2 cytokines including interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13, in BALF and lung tissue. The severity of inflammation and mucin secretion in the lungs of PD1-treated mice was also less.

Mutations in epigenetic regulators and RNA splicing genes may also occur, and play critical roles in PMF disease progression. Based on revised World Health Organization diagnostic criteria for MPNs, both screening for driver mutations and bone marrow biopsy are required for a specific diagnosis. Clinical trials of JAK2 inhibitors for PMF have revealed significant efficacy for improving splenomegaly and constitutional symptoms. However, the currently available drug therapies for PMF do not improve survival. Although allogeneic stem cell transplantation is potentially curative, it is associated with substantial treatment-related morbidity and mortality. PMF is a heterogeneous disorder and decisions regarding treatments are often complicated, necessitating the use of prognostic models to determine the management of treatments for individual patients.

Bromocoumarin hydrazide-hydrazone derivative (BCHHD) 11b showed excellent anticancer activity against all tested cancer cell lines. Enzyme assays showed that BCHHD 11b induced apoptosis due to activation of caspases 3/7. Moreover, 11b inhibited GST and CYP3A4 in a dose dependent manner and the induced cell death could be attributed to metabolic inhibition. Moreover, 11b microarray analysis showed significant up- and down-regulation of many genes in the treated cells related to apoptosis, cell cycle, tumor growth and suppressor genes. All of the above presents BCHHD 11b as a potent anticancer agent able to overcome drug resistance. In addition, compound 11b was able to serve as a chemical carrier for (99m)Tc and the in vivo biodistribution study of (99m)Tc-11b complex revealed a remarkable targeting ability of (99m)Tc into solid tumor showing that (99m)Tc-11b might be used as a promising radiopharmaceutical imaging agent for cancer.","['Nasr, Tamer', 'Bondock, Samir', 'Rashed, Hassan M', 'Fayad, Walid', 'Youns, Mahmoud', 'Sakr, Tamer M']","['Nasr T', 'Bondock S', 'Rashed HM', 'Fayad W', 'Youns M', 'Sakr TM']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Helwan University, Egypt; Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Modern University for Technology and Information, Egypt.

Among these mechanisms the knowledge gained on the roles played by epigenetic regulation of gene expression is extensive. Epigenetic control of transcription requires the function of protein complexes whose specific biochemical activities, such as histone mono-ubiquitylation, affect chromatin compaction and, consequently activation or repression of gene expression. Complexes composed of Polycomb Group (PcG) proteins promote transcriptional silencing while those containing trithorax group (trxG) proteins promote transcriptional activation. However, other epigenetic protein factors, such as RYBP, have the ability to interact with both PcG and trxG and thus putatively participate in the reversibility of chromatin compaction, essential to respond to developmental cues and stress signals. This review discusses the developmental and mechanistic functions of RYBP, a ubiquitin binding protein, in epigenetic control mediated by the PcG/trxG proteins to control transcription. Recent experimental evidence indicates that proteins regulating chromatin compaction also participate in other molecular mechanisms controlling development, such as cell death. This review also discusses the role of RYBP in apoptosis through non-epigenetic mechanisms as well as recent investigations linking the role of RYBP to apoptosis and cancer.","['Simoes da Silva, Carolina J', 'Simon, Rocio', 'Busturia, Ana']","['Simoes da Silva CJ', 'Simon R', 'Busturia A']","['Centro de Biologia Molecular ""Severo Ochoa"" CSIC-UAM, Nicolas Cabrera 1, 28049, Madrid, Spain.', 'Centro de Biologia Molecular ""Severo Ochoa"" CSIC-UAM, Nicolas Cabrera 1, 28049, Madrid, Spain.', 'Centro de Biologia Molecular ""Severo Ochoa"" CSIC-UAM, Nicolas Cabrera 1, 28049, Madrid, Spain.

Increasing evidence has revealed that the dysregulation of prolyl isomerase Pin 1 contributes to multicancer development and progression, including ALL, although the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we report that the expression of Pin 1 was enhanced in ph(+) ALL patient samples and was associated positively with the expression of BCR-ABL. Genetically or pharmacologically inhibiting Pin 1 expression or activity produces potent therapeutic efficacy against ph(+) ALL. We further demonstrated that BCR-ABL enhances the prolyl isomerase activity of Pin 1 by decreasing the phosphorylated level of Pin 1 at Ser 71 and interacting with DAPK1. The inhibition of BCR-ABL activity by imatinib in human ph(+) ALL cells reduces the prolyl isomerase activity of Pin 1, further suggesting a key role of the newly identified BCR-ABL-Pin 1 axis in ph(+) ALL progression. Thus, the combined suppression of Pin 1 and BCR-ABL proteins may be exploited as an additional target therapy for ph(+) ALL.","['Cao, Wen-Bin', 'Yao, Jian-Feng', 'Feng, Si-Zhou', 'He, Yi', 'Jiang, Er-Lie', 'Zhang, Rong-Li', 'Yang, Dong-Lin', 'Gong, Ming', 'Zheng, Xiao-Hui', 'Chen, Shu-Lian', 'Sun, Jia-Li', 'Zhou, Lu-Kun', 'Han, Ming-Zhe']","['Cao WB', 'Yao JF', 'Feng SZ', 'He Y', 'Jiang EL', 'Zhang RL', 'Yang DL', 'Gong M', 'Zheng XH', 'Chen SL', 'Sun JL', 'Zhou LK', 'Han MZ']","['Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, No. 288 Nanjing Road, 300020, Tianjin, China.', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, No. 288 Nanjing Road, 300020, Tianjin, China.', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, No. 288 Nanjing Road, 300020, Tianjin, China.', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, No. 288 Nanjing Road, 300020, Tianjin, China.', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, No. 288 Nanjing Road, 300020, Tianjin, China.', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, No. 288 Nanjing Road, 300020, Tianjin, China.', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, No. 288 Nanjing Road, 300020, Tianjin, China.', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, No. 288 Nanjing Road, 300020, Tianjin, China.', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, No. 288 Nanjing Road, 300020, Tianjin, China.', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, No. 288 Nanjing Road, 300020, Tianjin, China.', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, No. 288 Nanjing Road, 300020, Tianjin, China.', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, No. 288 Nanjing Road, 300020, Tianjin, China.', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, No. 288 Nanjing Road, 300020, Tianjin, China.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-9769-8577'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180417,United States,Cancer Med,Cancer medicine,101595310,"['0 (NIMA-Interacting Peptidylprolyl Isomerase)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (DAPK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Death-Associated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 5.2.1.8 (PIN1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Death-Associated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'NIMA-Interacting Peptidylprolyl Isomerase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['* ALL', '*BCR-ABL', '*DAPK1', '*Pin 1', '*protein-protein interaction']",2018/04/18 06:00,2019/10/30 06:00,['2018/04/18 06:00'],"['2017/09/05 00:00 [received]', '2018/01/06 00:00 [revised]', '2018/02/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/30 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cam4.1478 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Med. 2018 Jun;7(6):2530-2540. doi: 10.1002/cam4.1478.

CLL cells overexpress PIM kinases, which regulate apoptosis, cell cycle and migration. We demonstrate that BCR crosslinking, CD40 stimulation, and coculture with stromal cells increases PIMs expression in CLL cells, indicating microenvironment-dependent PIMs regulation. PIM1 and PIM2 expression at diagnosis was higher in patients with advanced disease (Binet C vs. Binet A/B) and in those, who progressed after first-line treatment. In primary CLL cells, inhibition of PIM kinases with a pan-PIM inhibitor, SEL24-B489, decreased PIM-specific substrate phosphorylation and induced dose-dependent apoptosis in leukaemic, but not in normal B cells. Cytotoxicity of SEL24-B489 was similar in TP53-mutant and TP53 wild-type cells. Finally, inhibition of PIM kinases decreased CXCR4-mediated cell chemotaxis in two related mechanisms-by decreasing CXCR4 phosphorylation and surface expression, and by limiting CXCR4-triggered mTOR pathway activity. Importantly, PIM and mTOR inhibitors similarly impaired migration, indicating that CXCL12-triggered mTOR is required for CLL cell chemotaxis. Given the microenvironment-modulated PIM expression, their pro-survival function and a role of PIMs in CXCR4-induced migration, inhibition of these kinases might override microenvironmental protection and be an attractive therapeutic strategy in this disease.","['Bialopiotrowicz, Emilia', 'Gorniak, Patryk', 'Noyszewska-Kania, Monika', 'Pula, Bartosz', 'Makuch-Lasica, Hanna', 'Nowak, Grazyna', 'Bluszcz, Aleksandra', 'Szydlowski, Maciej', 'Jablonska, Ewa', 'Piechna, Karolina', 'Sewastianik, Tomasz', 'Polak, Anna', 'Lech-Maranda, Ewa', 'Budziszewska, Bozena K', 'Wasylecka-Juszczynska, Maja', 'Borg, Katarzyna', 'Warzocha, Krzysztof', 'Czardybon, Wojciech', 'Galezowski, Michal', 'Windak, Renata', 'Brzozka, Krzysztof', 'Juszczynski, Przemyslaw']","['Bialopiotrowicz E', 'Gorniak P', 'Noyszewska-Kania M', 'Pula B', 'Makuch-Lasica H', 'Nowak G', 'Bluszcz A', 'Szydlowski M', 'Jablonska E', 'Piechna K', 'Sewastianik T', 'Polak A', 'Lech-Maranda E', 'Budziszewska BK', 'Wasylecka-Juszczynska M', 'Borg K', 'Warzocha K', 'Czardybon W', 'Galezowski M', 'Windak R', 'Brzozka K', 'Juszczynski P']","['Department of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Diagnostic Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Diagnostic Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Diagnostic Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Centre of Postgraduate Medical Education, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Centre of Postgraduate Medical Education, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Diagnostic Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Selvita S.A., Cracow, Poland.', 'Selvita S.A., Cracow, Poland.', 'Selvita S.A., Cracow, Poland.', 'Selvita S.A., Cracow, Poland.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-7215-0444'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180417,England,J Cell Mol Med,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,101083777,"['0 (CXCR4 protein, human)', '0 (PIM2 protein, human)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (PIM1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (proto-oncogene proteins pim)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism/mortality/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, CXCR4/*metabolism', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Microenvironment']",['NOTNLM'],"['*CXCR4', '*PIM kinase', '*chronic lymphocytic leukaemia', '*mTOR']",2018/04/18 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2018/04/18 06:00'],"['2017/10/02 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jcmm.13632 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Mol Med. 2018 Jul;22(7):3548-3559. doi: 10.1111/jcmm.13632.

However, the effect of GLUT3 silencing on treatment of AML remains poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to investigate role of GLUT3 in proliferation and chemosensitivity of AML and its underlying mechanisms. METHODS: The siRNA transfection was conducted using LipofectamineTM 2000. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blot analyses were employed to measure the expression levels of mRNA and protein for GLUT3, respectively. The cytotoxic effects of siRNA and vincristine were determined using the MTT assay. Flow cytometry was performed to analyze apoptosis. RESULTS: GLUT3 siRNA transfection significantly reduced expression levels of GLUT3 mRNA and protein, leading to a strong growth inhibition and enhanced apoptosis (P = 0.017) in AML cells. Moreover, treatment with GLUT3 siRNA, synergistically enhanced the cytotoxic and apoptotic effects of vincristine (P = 0.025). We further investigated the possible mechanism involved in regulation of GLUT3 in AML cell proliferation and apoptosis. We found that GLUT3 negatively regulates EGFR activity, as well as the expression of its downstream proteins. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that GLUT3 plays a fundamental role in the survival and resistance of AML cells to vincristine. Therefore, GLUT3 can be considered as an attractive target for gene therapy of AML patients and siRNA-mediated silencing of this gene may be a novel strategy in AML treatment.","['Zhuang, Yan', 'Zhao, Jing', 'Xu, Xi', 'Bi, Laixi']","['Zhuang Y', 'Zhao J', 'Xu X', 'Bi L']","['Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou 325000, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Wenzhou City Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Western Medicine Combined, Wenzhou 325000, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou 325000, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou 325000, Zhejiang Province, China.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180201,Iran,Arch Iran Med,Archives of Iranian medicine,100889644,"['0 (Glucose Transporter Type 3)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (SLC2A3 protein, human)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)']",,"['*Apoptosis', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Synergism', 'ErbB Receptors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Glucose Transporter Type 3/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'THP-1 Cells', 'Transfection', 'U937 Cells', 'Vincristine/*pharmacology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', '*Apoptosis', '*Chemosensitivity', '*Glucose transporter 3 (GLUT3)', '*siRNA']",2018/04/18 06:00,2019/08/06 06:00,['2018/04/18 06:00'],"['2017/07/23 00:00 [received]', '2018/01/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/06 06:00 [medline]']",['S1029-2977-21(02)073-0 [pii]'],epublish,Arch Iran Med. 2018 Feb 1;21(2):73-78.,"['(c) 2018 The Author(s).

It's considered the most serious complication of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, most frequently described after bone marrow transplantation (BMT). The skin is usually the first and most commonly affected organ, in both acute and chronic, with a variable clinical spectrum of presentation. OBJECTIVE: To report a case of vitiligo as a manifestation of cutaneous chronic GVHD, a low prevalence sign, which recognition could help to suspect this severe compli cation. CASE REPORT: 8 years old male, diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) at 3 years old, had a combined medullary and central nervous system (NCS) relapse with minimal positive disease 3 years afterwards. After 4 years ALL was diagnosed, he received an allogeneic bone marrow transplant. Seven months after the BMT he presented multiple melanocytic nevi with peripheral hypopigmentation, and some isolated asymptomatic, confluent achromic macules on the face, trunk and limbs. The skin biopsy was compatible with chronic vitiligo and sclerodermiform type GVHD. He received topical treatment with Tacrolimus, achieving clinical stabilization. CONCLUSIONS: GVHD leads to the appearance of autoantibodies that could act as a trigger in the onset of autoimmune diseases, such as vitiligo. Consequently it could explain this poorly described manifestation in the literature of chronic cutaneous GVHD.","['Galvez, Karla', 'Munoz, Paula', 'Vera, Valentina', 'Arce, Claudio']","['Galvez K', 'Munoz P', 'Vera V', 'Arce C']","['Servicio de Dermatologia, Hospital Clinico, Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile, kgalvezr@gmail.com.', 'Hospital Luis Calvo Mackenna, Santiago, Chile.', 'Servicio de Medicina Interna, Hospital San Juan de Dios, Santiago, Chile.', 'Departamento de Anatomia Patologica, Hospital Dr. Luis Calvo Mackenna, Santiago, Chile.']",,"['eng', 'spa']","['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Chile,Rev Chil Pediatr,Revista chilena de pediatria,0404261,,IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Graft vs Host Disease/complications/*diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Vitiligo/*etiology']",,,2018/04/18 06:00,2018/07/17 06:00,['2018/04/18 06:00'],"['2017/08/03 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0370-41062018000100113 [pii]', '10.4067/S0370-41062018000100113 [doi]']",ppublish,Rev Chil Pediatr. 2018 Feb;89(1):113-117. doi: 10.4067/S0370-41062018000100113.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Enfermedad injerto contra huesped cutanea cronica tipo vitiligo.

Gain of HDAC7 function in thymocytes blocks both negative selection and NKT development, and diverts Valpha14/Jalpha18 TCR transgenic thymocytes into a Tconv-like lineage. Conversely, HDAC7 deletion promotes thymocyte apoptosis and causes expansion of innate-effector cells. Investigating the mechanisms involved, we found that HDAC7 binds PLZF and modulates PLZF-dependent transcription. Moreover, HDAC7 and many of its transcriptional targets are human risk loci for IBD and PSC, autoimmune diseases that strikingly resemble the disease we observe in HDAC7 gain-of-function in mice. Importantly, reconstitution of iNKT cells in these mice mitigated their disease, suggesting that the combined defects in negative selection and iNKT cells due to altered HDAC7 function can cause tissue-restricted autoimmunity, a finding that may explain the association between HDAC7 and hepatobiliary autoimmunity.","['Kasler, Herbert G', 'Lee, Intelly S', 'Lim, Hyung W', 'Verdin, Eric']","['Kasler HG', 'Lee IS', 'Lim HW', 'Verdin E']","['Gladstone Institute of Virology and Immunology, San Francisco, United States.', 'Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, United States.', 'Buck Institute for Research on Aging, Novato, United States.', 'Gladstone Institute of Virology and Immunology, San Francisco, United States.', 'Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, United States.', 'Gladstone Institute of Virology and Immunology, San Francisco, United States.', 'Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, United States.', 'Gladstone Institute of Virology and Immunology, San Francisco, United States.', 'Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, United States.', 'Buck Institute for Research on Aging, Novato, United States.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6660-4267', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3703-3183']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180417,England,Elife,eLife,101579614,"['0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (HDAC7 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', '*Autoimmunity', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression', 'Histone Deacetylases/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Natural Killer T-Cells/*immunology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*HDAC7', '*NKT cell', '*autoimmunity', '*epigenetics', '*gene expression', '*immunology', '*inflammation', '*mouse']",2018/04/18 06:00,2019/05/29 06:00,['2018/04/18 06:00'],"['2017/09/19 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/29 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.7554/eLife.32109 [doi]', '32109 [pii]']",epublish,Elife. 2018 Apr 17;7. pii: 32109. doi: 10.7554/eLife.32109.,"['(c) 2018, Kasler et al.']",,"['T32 GM007618/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'AI117864/NH/NIH HHS/United States', 'DA041742/NH/NIH HHS/United States']",PMC5943034,,,"['HK, IL, EV No competing interests declared, HL is currently affiliated with', 'Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research (NIBR), but the research was', 'conducted when he was at the Gladstone Institute/University of California.

Here, we report the prevalence and clinical relevance of TET2 SNP rs2454206 in 254 Chinese patients with childhood AML.

Inverse associations were also observed for contact with dogs (OR = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.86, 0.99) and cats (OR = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.80, 0.94) in the first year of life. There was no evidence of a significant association with farm residence in the first year of life.

The proportion of patients with >/=CR2 was significantly higher in HAPLO transplantation than MUD transplantation. Patients with MUD transplantation were significantly higher ABO incompatible than patients with HAPLO transplantation. There was no difference between the 2 groups in terms of engraftment, aGvHD and cGvHD, VOD, hemorrhagic cystitis, infections, and relapse. The 5-year OS of MUD transplantation and HAPLO transplantation groups was found 65.8% and 71.1%, respectively (log-rank 0.51). The 5-year RFS was 80.7% for MUD transplantation group and 86.9% for HAPLO transplantation group (log-rank 0.48). There was no statistically significant difference between 2 groups according to TRM (25% MUD transplantation vs 16.3% HAPLO transplantation, log-rank 0.48).

Ubiquitin-conjugating (E2) enzymes of the ubiquitination pathway are associated with various cancers, such as leukemia, lung cancer, and gastric cancer. However, to date, detection of E2 activities is not practicable for capturing the pathological conditions of cancers due to complications related to the enzymatic cascade reaction. To overcome this hurdle, we have recently investigated a novel strategy for measuring E2 activities. Artificial RING fingers (ARFs) were developed to conveniently detect E2 activities during the ubiquitination reaction. ARFs were created by grafting the active sites of ubiquitin-ligating (E3) enzymes onto amino acid sequences with 38 residues. The grafting design downsized E3s to small molecules (ARFs). Such an ARF is a multifunctional molecule that possesses specific E2-binding capabilities and ubiquitinates itself without a substrate. In this review, we discuss the major findings from recent investigations on a new molecular design for ARFs and their simplified detection system for E2 activities. The use of the ARF allowed us to monitor E2 activities using acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL)-derived cells following treatment with the anticancer drug bortezomib. The molecular design of ARFs is extremely simple and convenient, and thus, may be a powerful tool for protein engineering. The ARF methodology may reveal a new screening method of E2s that will contribute to diagnostic techniques for cancers.","['Miyamoto, Kazuhide', 'Saito, Kazuki']","['Miyamoto K', 'Saito K']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Health Care, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Himeji Dokkyo University, Hyogo, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Health Care, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Himeji Dokkyo University, Hyogo, Japan.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20180503,United States,Protein Sci,Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society,9211750,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', 'EC 2.3.2.23 (Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Humans', '*Neoplasms/diagnosis/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Ubiquitin/chemistry/metabolism', '*Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes/chemistry/metabolism', 'Ubiquitination/*physiology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*E2', '*artificial RING finger', '*artificial ubiquitin-ligase', '*cancer', '*diagnosis', '*ubiquitination']",2018/04/18 06:00,2019/04/09 06:00,['2018/04/18 06:00'],"['2018/03/07 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/11 00:00 [revised]', '2018/04/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/09 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pro.3427 [doi]'],ppublish,Protein Sci. 2018 Aug;27(8):1354-1363. doi: 10.1002/pro.3427.

The wider introduction of next-generation sequencing technology has led to reports in recent years of mutations in the BCOR gene in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but the related clinical characteristics and prognosis are not sufficiently understood. We investigated the clinical characteristics and prognosis of 377 de novo AML cases with BCOR or BCORL1 mutation. BCOR or BCORL1 gene mutations were found in 28 cases (7.4%). Among cases aged 65 years or below that were also FLT3-ITD-negative and in the intermediate cytogenetic prognosis group, BCOR or BCORL1 gene mutations were observed in 11% of cases (12 of 111 cases), and this group had significantly lower 5-year overall survival (OS) (13.6% vs. 55.0%, P = 0.0021) and relapse-free survival (RFS) (14.3% vs. 44.5%, P = 0.0168) compared to cases without BCOR or BCORL1 gene mutations. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that BCOR mutations were an independent unfavorable prognostic factor (P = 0.0038, P = 0.0463) for both OS and RFS. In cases of AML that are FLT3-ITD-negative, aged 65 years or below, and in the intermediate cytogenetic prognosis group, which are considered to have relatively favorable prognosis, BCOR gene mutations appear to be an important prognostic factor.","['Terada, Kazuki', 'Yamaguchi, Hiroki', 'Ueki, Toshimitsu', 'Usuki, Kensuke', 'Kobayashi, Yutaka', 'Tajika, Kenji', 'Gomi, Seiji', 'Kurosawa, Saiko', 'Saito, Riho', 'Furuta, Yutaka', 'Miyadera, Keiki', 'Tokura, Taichiro', 'Marumo, Atsushi', 'Omori, Ikuko', 'Sakaguchi, Masahiro', 'Fujiwara, Yusuke', 'Yui, Shunsuke', 'Ryotokuji, Takeshi', 'Arai, Kunihito', 'Kitano, Tomoaki', 'Wakita, Satoshi', 'Fukuda, Takahiro', 'Inokuchi, Koiti']","['Terada K', 'Yamaguchi H', 'Ueki T', 'Usuki K', 'Kobayashi Y', 'Tajika K', 'Gomi S', 'Kurosawa S', 'Saito R', 'Furuta Y', 'Miyadera K', 'Tokura T', 'Marumo A', 'Omori I', 'Sakaguchi M', 'Fujiwara Y', 'Yui S', 'Ryotokuji T', 'Arai K', 'Kitano T', 'Wakita S', 'Fukuda T', 'Inokuchi K']","['Department of Hematology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nagano Red Cross Hospital, Nagano, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, NTT Medical Center Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Japanese Red Cross Kyoto Daini Hospital, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Yokohama Minami Kyousai Hospital, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Yokohama Minami Kyousai Hospital, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-0571-7495'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (BCOR protein, human)', '0 (BCORL1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Cytogenetic Analysis/methods', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', 'Survival Rate', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*BCOR', '*BCORL1', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*mutation', '*prognostic factor']",2018/04/18 06:00,2018/10/17 06:00,['2018/04/18 06:00'],"['2017/12/09 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/09 00:00 [revised]', '2018/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/17 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.22542 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2018 Aug;57(8):401-408. doi: 10.1002/gcc.22542.,"['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

LncRNA urothelial carcinoma-associated 1 (UCA1) was reported to play an oncogenic role in AML. However, whether UCA1 was involved in chemoresistance in pediatric AML remains unclear. UCA1 expression in AML patients after adriamycin (ADR)-based chemotherapy and ADR-resistant AML cells was examined by qRT-PCR. The effects of UCA1 on the cytotoxicity of ADR and glycolysis were evaluated by MTT assay and measuring the glucose consumption and lactate production in HL60 and HL60/ADR cells, repectively. The protein levels of hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha) and hexokinase 2 (HK2) were determined by Western blot. Luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay were used to confirm the relationships between UCA1, HK2, and miR-125a. We found that UCA1 expression was upregulated following ADR-based chemotherapy. Knockdown of UCA1 increased the cytotoxic effect of ADR and inhibited HIF-1alpha-dependent glycolysis in ADR-resistant AML cells. Additionally, UCA1 functioned as a ceRNA of miR-125a by directly binding to miR-125a. HK2, a target of miR-125a, was positively regulated by UCA1 in HL60 and HL60/ADR cells. More notably, UCA1 overexpression overturned miR-125-mediated inhibition on HIF-1alpha-dependent glycolysis in HL60 and HL60/ADR cells. Furthermore, 2-deoxy-glucose (2-DG) exposure inhibited HIF-1alpha-dependent glycolysis, and attenuated UCA1-induced increase of chemoresistance in HL60 and HL60/ADR cells. We conclude that knockdown of UCA1 plays a positive role in overcoming the chemoresistance of pediatric AML, through suppressing glycolysis by the miR-125a/HK2 pathway, contributing to a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of chemoresistance in AML.","['Zhang, Yuan', 'Liu, Yufeng', 'Xu, Xueju']","['Zhang Y', 'Liu Y', 'Xu X']","['Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, P.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) imatinib and its derivatives represent a breakthrough for CML therapy, but the use of TKI alone is ineffective for many CML patients. CD69, an early activation marker of lymphocytes, participates in immune and inflammatory responses. Previous studies revealed that BCR-ABL upregulates CD69 expression; however, the role of CD69 in CML cells is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that BCR-ABL induced CD69 promoter activity and mRNA and protein expression via the NF-kappaB pathway. CD69 knockdown partially increased apoptosis and expression of erythroid differentiation markers, alpha-globin, zeta-globin, and glycophorin A, and increased imatinib sensitivity in K562 and KU812 CML cells. Gene microarray analysis and quantitative real-time PCR verified that CD24, an oncogenic gene, downregulated in K562 cells upon CD69 knockdown. CD69 overexpression increased, whereas CD69 knockdown inhibited CD24 promoter activity and mRNA and protein levels. CD24 knockdown also partially increased apoptosis, erythroid differentiation, and imatinib sensitivity in K562 cells, whereas its overexpression inhibited the effects of CD69 knockdown on apoptosis, erythroid differentiation, and imatinib sensitivity in K562 cells. Imatinib-induced apoptosis and erythroid differentiation were also inhibited by CD69 or CD24 overexpression in BCR-ABL-expressing CML cell lines and CD34(+) cells. Taken together, CD24 is a downstream effector of CD69.

GHRH can also be produced by human cancers, in which it functions as an autocrine/paracrine growth factor. We have previously shown that synthetic antagonistic analogues of GHRH are able to successfully suppress the growth of 60 different human cancer cell lines representing over 20 cancers. Nevertheless, the expression of GHRH and its receptors in leukaemias has never been examined. Our study demonstrates the presence of GHRH receptor (GHRH-R) on 3 of 4 human acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cell lines-K-562, THP-1, and KG-1a-and significant inhibition of proliferation of these three cell lines in vitro following incubation with the GHRH antagonist MIA-602. We further show that this inhibition of proliferation is associated with the upregulation of pro-apoptotic genes and inhibition of Akt signalling in leukaemic cells. Treatment with MIA-602 of mice bearing xenografts of these human AML cell lines drastically reduced tumour growth. The expression of GHRH-R was further confirmed in 9 of 9 samples from patients with AML. These findings offer a new therapeutic approach to this malignancy and suggest a possible role of GHRH-R signalling in the pathology of AML.","['Jimenez, Joaquin J', 'DelCanto, Gina M', 'Popovics, Petra', 'Perez, Aymee', 'Vila Granda, Ailin', 'Vidaurre, Irving', 'Cai, Ren-Zhi', 'Rick, Ferenc G', 'Swords, Ronan T', 'Schally, Andrew V']","['Jimenez JJ', 'DelCanto GM', 'Popovics P', 'Perez A', 'Vila Granda A', 'Vidaurre I', 'Cai RZ', 'Rick FG', 'Swords RT', 'Schally AV']","['Department of Dermatology and Cutaneous Surgery, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Division of Endocrinology, Department of Medicine, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, Department of Medicine, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Department of Dermatology and Cutaneous Surgery, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Division of Endocrinology, Department of Medicine, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Department of Urology, Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine, Florida International University, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, Department of Medicine, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Division of Endocrinology, Department of Medicine, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, Department of Medicine, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-1544-5892'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20180416,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (GHRH(1-29)NH2, (PhAc-Ada)(0)-Tyr(1), Arg(2), Fpa(5,6), Ala(8), Har(9),', 'Tyr(Me)(10), His(11), Orn(12,) Abu(15), His(20), Orn(21), Nle(27), Arg(28),', 'Har(29)-)', '0 (Receptors, Neuropeptide)', '0 (Receptors, Pituitary Hormone-Regulating Hormone)', '86168-78-7 (Sermorelin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'F8L0ODC9D7 (somatotropin releasing hormone receptor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Drug Delivery Systems/*methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Receptors, Neuropeptide/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Receptors, Pituitary Hormone-Regulating Hormone/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Sermorelin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'THP-1 Cells', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",['NOTNLM'],"['*acute myeloid leukaemia', '*antagonist', '*growth hormone-releasing hormone', '*hormone', '*leukaemia']",2018/04/18 06:00,2019/03/26 06:00,['2018/04/18 06:00'],"['2017/11/14 00:00 [received]', '2018/01/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/26 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.15207 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2018 May;181(4):476-485. doi: 10.1111/bjh.15207.

Procedures that rapidly support the diagnosis and risk factors for serious bleeding were explored, with a focus on immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). Twenty-five patients with thrombocytopenia, including 13 with newly diagnosed ITP, 3 with chronic ITP, 6 with aplastic anemia (AA), and 3 with other thrombocytopenia (one acute myeloid leukemia, one acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and one hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis), were reviewed. In addition to platelet-related parameters obtained by an automated hematology analyzer, flow cytometric analysis of platelets was performed. A characteristic flow cytometric pattern with broad forward scatter and narrowed side scatter, which is specific to ITP, but not other types of thrombocytopenia, was found. CD62P-positive platelets were increased in newly diagnosed ITP cases compared to control (P < 0.0001), AA (P = 0.0032). Moreover, detection of dramatic changes in these parameters on sequential monitoring may suggest internal hemorrhage, even absent skin or visible mucosal bleeding. The bleeding score for visible mucosae had a negative correlation with platelet count and a positive correlation with immature platelet fraction (%), forward scatter, and CD62P. This characteristic flow cytometric pattern makes it possible to distinguish ITP from other thrombocytopenic disorders.","['Araki, Raita', 'Nishimura, Ryosei', 'Kuroda, Rie', 'Fujiki, Toshihiro', 'Mase, Shintaro', 'Noguchi, Kazuhiro', 'Ikawa, Yasuhiro', 'Maeba, Hideaki', 'Yachie, Akihiro']","['Araki R', 'Nishimura R', 'Kuroda R', 'Fujiki T', 'Mase S', 'Noguchi K', 'Ikawa Y', 'Maeba H', 'Yachie A']","['Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, Institute of Medical, Pharmaceutical and Health Sciences, Kanazawa University, 13-1 Takaramachi, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, 920-8641, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, Institute of Medical, Pharmaceutical and Health Sciences, Kanazawa University, 13-1 Takaramachi, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, 920-8641, Japan. ryosein@staff.kanazawa-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, Institute of Medical, Pharmaceutical and Health Sciences, Kanazawa University, 13-1 Takaramachi, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, 920-8641, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, Institute of Medical, Pharmaceutical and Health Sciences, Kanazawa University, 13-1 Takaramachi, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, 920-8641, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, Institute of Medical, Pharmaceutical and Health Sciences, Kanazawa University, 13-1 Takaramachi, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, 920-8641, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, Institute of Medical, Pharmaceutical and Health Sciences, Kanazawa University, 13-1 Takaramachi, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, 920-8641, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, Institute of Medical, Pharmaceutical and Health Sciences, Kanazawa University, 13-1 Takaramachi, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, 920-8641, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, Institute of Medical, Pharmaceutical and Health Sciences, Kanazawa University, 13-1 Takaramachi, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, 920-8641, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, Institute of Medical, Pharmaceutical and Health Sciences, Kanazawa University, 13-1 Takaramachi, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, 920-8641, Japan.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180416,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (P-Selectin)', '0 (SELP protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Hemorrhage/diagnosis/etiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Monitoring, Physiologic', 'P-Selectin', '*Platelet Count', 'Purpura, Thrombocytopenic, Idiopathic/blood/*diagnosis/etiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['Aplastic anemia', 'Flow cytometry', 'Immune thrombocytopenia', 'Platelets']",2018/04/18 06:00,2018/09/07 06:00,['2018/04/18 06:00'],"['2018/01/25 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/07 00:00 [revised]', '2018/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/07 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-018-2454-y [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-018-2454-y [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2018 Aug;108(2):151-160. doi: 10.1007/s12185-018-2454-y.

METHODS: A retrospective medical records review of all patients who underwent at least one corneal biopsy for the diagnosis of microbial keratitis at Sydney Eye Hospital, Australia between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2016 was performed. RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients (18 men and 20 women) underwent a corneal biopsy for progressive microbial keratitis unresponsive to broad-spectrum topical antimicrobials. Risk factors for microbial keratitis included contact lens wear in 8 (21%), recent intraocular surgery in 5 cases (13%), recent agricultural trauma in 3 cases (8%), exposure keratopathy due to Graves' orbitopathy in 1 case (3%), and profound systemic immunosuppression due to chemotherapy for leukaemia in 1 case (3%). The remaining 20 patients had no identifiable risk factors. Fifteen patients (39%) had a positive biopsy result, which identified bacteria in 6 cases and Mycobacteria in 1 case, both by culture of the biopsy specimen. Three cases of fungus were identified on culture of biopsy specimen, two of which were also confirmed on histopathology and an additional case was identified from histopathology alone. A single case of Acanthamoeba was diagnosed by culture and histopathology, and an additional 3 cases were diagnosed on histopathology alone. A corneal biopsy yielded new organisms in 73% (11/15) cases where the culture results of biopsy specimens were positive. CONCLUSION: Corneal biopsy is an important tool in the diagnosis of progressive keratitis, often identifying causal organisms not found on corneal scraping alone.","['Robaei, Dana', 'Chan, U-Teng', 'Khoo, Pauline', 'Cherepanoff, Svetlana', 'Li, Yi-Chiao', 'Hanrahan, Jane', 'Watson, Stephanie']","['Robaei D', 'Chan UT', 'Khoo P', 'Cherepanoff S', 'Li YC', 'Hanrahan J', 'Watson S']","['Save Sight Institute, University of Sydney, 8 Macquarie St, Sydney, NSW, 2000, Australia. dana.robaei@sydney.edu.au.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Westmead Hospital, Sydney, Australia. dana.robaei@sydney.edu.au.', ""Department of Anatomical Pathology, St Vincent's Hospital, Darlinghurst, Australia."", 'Save Sight Institute, University of Sydney, 8 Macquarie St, Sydney, NSW, 2000, Australia.', 'Save Sight Institute, University of Sydney, 8 Macquarie St, Sydney, NSW, 2000, Australia.', ""Department of Anatomical Pathology, St Vincent's Hospital, Darlinghurst, Australia."", 'Save Sight Institute, University of Sydney, 8 Macquarie St, Sydney, NSW, 2000, Australia.', 'SEALS Department of Microbiology, Prince of Wales Hospital, Randwick, Australia.', 'School of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of New South Wales, Randwick, Australia.', 'Save Sight Institute, University of Sydney, 8 Macquarie St, Sydney, NSW, 2000, Australia.', 'Sydney Eye Hospital, Sydney, Australia.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3307-6784'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180416,Germany,Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol,Graefe's archive for clinical and experimental ophthalmology = Albrecht von Graefes Archiv fur klinische und experimentelle Ophthalmologie,8205248,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bacteria/*isolation & purification', 'Biopsy/*methods', 'Cornea/microbiology/*pathology', 'Eye Infections, Bacterial/*diagnosis/microbiology', 'Eye Infections, Fungal/*diagnosis/microbiology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fungi/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Keratitis/*diagnosis/microbiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Time Factors', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['Corneal biopsy', 'Fungal keratitis', 'Microbial keratitis', 'Microbiology']",2018/04/18 06:00,2018/07/24 06:00,['2018/04/18 06:00'],"['2017/09/28 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/02/20 00:00 [revised]', '2018/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/24 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00417-018-3981-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s00417-018-3981-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol. 2018 Aug;256(8):1527-1533. doi: 10.1007/s00417-018-3981-1.

MicroRNAs (e.g., miR-29b) have been identified in various diseases to be critical modulators of cell growth and apoptosis by targeting Mcl-1 and CCND2. However, the role of miR-29b in PAH remains unknown. So we try to investigate the effect of miR-29b on Mcl-1 and CCND2 protein in PASMCs, analyze the effect of miR-29b on the proliferation of PASMCs, and explore the significance of miR-29b in the proliferation, apoptosis, and gene therapy of PAH. It was observed that gene chip analysis showed miR-29b expression in pulmonary artery tissue. The expression of miR-29b was significantly reduced in PAH model mice. MiR-29b inhibited the proliferation of PASMCs and promoted the apoptosis of PASMCs. Mechanically, miR-29b could inhibit the expression of Mcl-1 and CCND2 protein and silenced Mcl-1 and CCND2 could abolish the change of proliferation and apoptosis of PASMCs. These results demonstrate that miR-29b suppressed cellular proliferation and promoted apoptosis of PASMCs, possibly through the inhibition of Mcl-1 and CCND2. Therefore, miR-29b may serve as a useful therapeutic tool to treat PAH.","['Chen, Juan', 'Li, Yanping', 'Li, Yun', 'Xie, Lijian', 'Wang, Jianyi', 'Zhang, Yongwei', 'Xiao, Tingting']","['Chen J', 'Li Y', 'Li Y', 'Xie L', 'Wang J', 'Zhang Y', 'Xiao T']","[""Department of Cardiology, Shanghai Children's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 355 Lu Ding Road, Shanghai 200062, China."", ""Department of Cardiology, Shanghai Children's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 355 Lu Ding Road, Shanghai 200062, China."", ""Department of Cardiology, Shanghai Children's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 355 Lu Ding Road, Shanghai 200062, China."", ""Department of Cardiology, Shanghai Children's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 355 Lu Ding Road, Shanghai 200062, China."", ""Department of Cardiology, Shanghai Children's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 355 Lu Ding Road, Shanghai 200062, China."", ""Department of Cardiology, Shanghai Children's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 355 Lu Ding Road, Shanghai 200062, China."", ""Department of Cardiology, Shanghai Children's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 355 Lu Ding Road, Shanghai 200062, China.""]",['ORCID: 0000-0002-3230-0919'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180131,United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (CCND2 protein, human)', '0 (Ccnd2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin D2)', '0 (MIRN29 microRNA, mouse)', '0 (MIRN29a microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions/genetics"", 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Cyclin D2/*metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Hypertension, Pulmonary/genetics', 'Male', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Myocytes, Smooth Muscle/*metabolism/pathology', 'Pulmonary Artery/*pathology']",,,2018/04/18 06:00,2018/09/18 06:00,['2018/04/18 06:00'],"['2017/08/19 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2018/6051407 [doi]'],epublish,Biomed Res Int. 2018 Jan 31;2018:6051407. doi: 10.1155/2018/6051407. eCollection 2018.,,,,PMC5831881,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we aimed to explore the apoptotic effect of two natural components, resveratrol and prednisolone, on the T acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell line, CCRF-CEM. Our findings suggested the incorporation of these natural agents into drug regimens to treat patients with ALL. Methods: In this study, we investigated the effect of different doses of resveratrol (15, 50 and 100 microM) and prednisolone (700 microM) on BAX (apoptosis promoter) and BCL2 (apoptosis inhibitor) expressions following 24 and 48 hours of treatment on CCRF-CEM cells, using real-time PCR, and on apoptosis induction using flow cytometry. Results: The results showed a time- and dose-dependent increase in BAX expression and a decrease in BCL2 expression. Apoptosis was induced in CCRF-CEM cells treated with resveratrol and prednisolone for 24 and 48 hours. Combined resveratrol and prednisolone treatment showed synergistic effects on the overexpression of BAX and the downregulation of BCL2. The drug combination had a greater influence on apoptosis induction compared with either drug administered alone after 48 hours of treatment. Conclusion: The results of this study suggested that resveratrol exhibited a remarkable efficacy to improve the influence of glucocorticoids drugs, especially prednisolone, to induce apoptosis in the CCRF-CEM cell line.","['Khanzadeh, Taghi', 'Hagh, Majid Farshdousti', 'Talebi, Mehdi', 'Yousefi, Bahman', 'Azimi, Ako', 'Hossein Pour Feizi, Abbas Ali', 'Baradaran, Behzad']","['Khanzadeh T', 'Hagh MF', 'Talebi M', 'Yousefi B', 'Azimi A', 'Hossein Pour Feizi AA', 'Baradaran B']","['Student Research Committee, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Drug Applied Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Drug Applied Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Student Research Committee, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Basic Sciences, Maragheh University of Medical Sciences, Maragheh, Iran.', 'Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Drug Applied Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180327,Korea (South),Blood Res,Blood research,101605247,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'BAX', 'BCL2', 'Precursor cell lymphoblastic leukemia-lymphoma', 'Prednisolone', 'Resveratrol']",2018/04/18 06:00,2018/04/18 06:01,['2018/04/18 06:00'],"['2017/02/12 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/04 00:00 [revised]', '2017/12/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/18 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5045/br.2018.53.1.53 [doi]'],ppublish,Blood Res. 2018 Mar;53(1):53-60. doi: 10.5045/br.2018.53.1.53.

This study was conducted to determine the type and frequency of these aberrations and their relationship with hematologic and molecular findings in the Middle East. Methods: In this retrospective study, 134 well-established cases of CML were selected from 2010 to 2016. Their hematologic phase and type of fusion gene were determined. Finally, their karyotypes were analyzed and reported according to ISCN 2013. Results: Patients had a mean age of 44 years. Twenty-two patients (16.4%) showed additional cytogenetic aberrations. Nine patients (6.7%) harbored a variant Philadelphia chromosome, and most were in the chronic phase. Seventeen patients (12.7%) had major and minor route abnormalities. There was a significant relationship between additional cytogenetic aberrations and major molecular response (P=0.032). Patient survival in the group with additional cytogenetic aberrations was significantly lower (49.7+/-11.1 mo) than that in the group without additional cytogenetic aberrations (77.3+/-3.1 mo) (P=0.031). Conclusion: This study revealed the same frequency of additional cytogenetic aberrations in CML as found in previous studies.

This study aimed to describe the epidemiology, changes in treatment strategies, and improvement of outcomes in Gwangju-Chonnam children with AML over 2 decades. Methods: Medical records of 116 children with newly diagnosed AML were retrospectively reviewed for demographic characteristics, prognostic groups including cytogenetic risks, treatment protocols, and survival rates over the periods between 1996 and 2005 (Period I, N=53), and 2006 and 2015 (Period II, N=38). Results: The annual incidence of AML has decreased with reduced pediatric population. The 5-year Kaplan-Meier (K-M) estimated overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) rates in 110 AML patients were 53.2+/-5.1% and 43.8+/-5.1%, respectively. The 5-year OS rate significantly improved during period II (70.3+/-7.0%) as compared to that during period I (40.0+/-6.8%) (P =0.001). The 5-year OS was not significantly different among cytogenetic risk groups (P =0.11). Fifty-eight patients underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The K-M 5-year estimated survival for transplanted patients was 53.7+/-7.0%, while that for chemotherapy-only patients was 30.1+/-9.1% (P =0.014). Among the prognostic factors, treatment modality was the only independent factor. The chemotherapy-only group had a relative risk of 2.06 for death compared with the transplantation group (P=0.015). Conclusion: The survival of Korean children with AML has improved to a level comparable with that of developed countries over 2 decades, owing to a change in induction strategy, better supportive care with economic growth, refinement of HSCT techniques including a better selection of patients based on prognostic groups, and stem cell donor selection.","['Song, Tae Yang', 'Lee, Sang Hoon', 'Kim, Gun', 'Baek, Hee Jo', 'Hwang, Tai Ju', 'Kook, Hoon']","['Song TY', 'Lee SH', 'Kim G', 'Baek HJ', 'Hwang TJ', 'Kook H']","['Department of Pediatrics, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Chonnam National University Medical School, Hwasun, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Chonnam National University Medical School, Hwasun, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Chonnam National University Medical School, Hwasun, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Chonnam National University Medical School, Hwasun, Korea.', 'Environmental Health Center for Childhood Leukemia and Cancer, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Chonnam National University Medical School, Hwasun, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Chonnam National University Medical School, Hwasun, Korea.', 'Environmental Health Center for Childhood Leukemia and Cancer, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun, Korea.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180327,Korea (South),Blood Res,Blood research,101605247,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Child', 'Cytogenetics', 'Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'Survival rate']",2018/04/18 06:00,2018/04/18 06:01,['2018/04/18 06:00'],"['2017/07/17 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/30 00:00 [revised]', '2017/09/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/18 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5045/br.2018.53.1.25 [doi]'],ppublish,Blood Res. 2018 Mar;53(1):25-34. doi: 10.5045/br.2018.53.1.25.

Here, we discover that this synergism involves Dexa-stimulated downregulation of cellular FLICE-like inhibitory protein (cFLIP) in ALL cells. Dexa rapidly decreases cFLIPL protein levels, which is further enhanced by addition of BV6. While attenuating the activation of non-canonical nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling by BV6, Dexa suppresses cFLIPL protein but not mRNA levels pointing to a transcription-independent downregulation of cFLIPL by Dexa. Analysis of protein degradation pathways indicates that Dexa causes cFLIPL depletion independently of proteasomal, lysosomal or caspase pathways, as inhibitors of the proteasome, lysosomal enzymes or caspases all failed to protect from Dexa-mediated loss of cFLIPL protein. Also, Dexa alone or in combination with BV6 does not affect overall activity of the proteasome. Importantly, overexpression of cFLIPL to an extent that is no longer subject to Dexa-imposed downregulation rescues Dexa/BV6-mediated cell death. Vice versa, knockdown of cFLIP increases BV6-mediated cell death, thus mimicking the effect of Dexa. Altogether, these data demonstrate that Dexa-mediated downregulation of cFLIPL protein promotes Dexa/BV6-mediated cell death, thereby providing novel insights into the synergistic antitumor activity of this combination treatment.","['Kleinesudeik, Lara', 'Rohde, Katharina', 'Fulda, Simone']","['Kleinesudeik L', 'Rohde K', 'Fulda S']","['Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Pediatrics, Goethe-University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Partner site Frankfurt, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Pediatrics, Goethe-University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Pediatrics, Goethe-University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Partner site Frankfurt, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180327,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Smac mimetic', 'apoptosis', 'cFLIP', 'glucocorticoid']",2018/04/18 06:00,2018/04/18 06:01,['2018/04/18 06:00'],"['2017/12/13 00:00 [received]', '2018/02/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/18 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.24782 [doi]', '24782 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2018 Mar 27;9(23):16521-16532. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.24782. eCollection 2018 Mar 27.,,,,PMC5893259,,,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST None to declare.'],,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis on the utility of WT1 as a prognostic indicator of MDS. Published reports were searched in the following databases: Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science. The meta-analysis was conducted using the Cochrane Collaboration RevMan 5.2 software. Six publications with 450 total patients met the inclusion criteria and were subjected to further examination. The results showed a reduction in both overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) with increasing WT1 expression levels: 1-year OS (odds ratio, OR = 0.16; 95% CI = 0.08-0.34, P < 0.001), 3-year OS (OR = 0.21; 95% CI = 0.09-0.47, P < 0.001), 5-year OS (OR = 0.24; 95% CI = 0.06-0.92, P = 0.04), 1-year LFS (OR = 0.06; 95% CI = 0.02-0.18; P < 0.001), 3-year LFS (OR = 0.20; 95% CI = 0.09-0.46; P < 0.001), and 5-year LFS (OR = 0.12; 95% CI = 0.04-0.38; P < 0.001).

As the diagnosis of IA is rarely based on positive culture in this group of patients, molecular detection of resistance mutations directly from clinical samples is crucial. In addition to the in-house azole resistance ARAf polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays detecting the frequent mutation combinations TR34/L98H, TR46/Y121F/T289A, and M220 in the Aspergillus fumigatus (A. fumigatus) Cyp51A gene by subsequent DNA sequence analysis, we investigated in parallel the commercially available AsperGenius(R) real time PCR system in detecting the Cyp51A alterations TR34/L98H and Y121F/T289A directly from 52 clinical samples (15 biopsies, 22 bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), 15 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples) and ARAf isolates (n = 3) of immunocompromised patients. We analyzed DNA aliquots and compared both methods concerning amplification and detection of Aspergillus DNA and Cyp51A alterations. As positive control for the feasibility of our novel Y121F and T289A PCR assays, we used two A. fumigatus isolates with the TR46/Y121F/T289A mutation combination isolated from hematological patients with known Cyp51A alterations and a lung biopsy sample of a patient with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The rate of positive ARAf PCR results plus successful sequencing using the ARAf PCR assays was 61% in biopsies, 29% in CSF, 67% in BAL samples and 100% in isolates. In comparison the amount of positive PCRs using the AsperGenius(R) assays was 47% in biopsies, 42% in CSF, 59% in BAL samples and 100% in isolates. Altogether 17 Cyp51A alterations were detected using our ARAf PCRs plus DNA sequencing and therefrom 10 alterations also by the AsperGenius(R) system. The comparative evaluation of our data revealed that our conventional PCR assays are more sensitive in detecting ARAf in BAL and biopsy samples, whereby differences were not significant. The advantage of the AsperGenius(R) system is the time saving aspect. We consider non-culture based molecular detection of Aspergillus triazole resistance to be of high epidemiological and clinical relevance in patients with hematological malignancies.","['Postina, Patricia', 'Skladny, Julian', 'Boch, Tobias', 'Cornely, Oliver A', 'Hamprecht, Axel', 'Rath, Peter-Michael', 'Steinmann, Jorg', 'Bader, Oliver', 'Miethke, Thomas', 'Dietz, Anne', 'Merker, Natalia', 'Hofmann, Wolf-Karsten', 'Buchheidt, Dieter', 'Spiess, Birgit']","['Postina P', 'Skladny J', 'Boch T', 'Cornely OA', 'Hamprecht A', 'Rath PM', 'Steinmann J', 'Bader O', 'Miethke T', 'Dietz A', 'Merker N', 'Hofmann WK', 'Buchheidt D', 'Spiess B']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department I of Internal Medicine, University Hospital of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Clinical Trials Centre Cologne, ZKS Koln and Cologne Excellence Cluster on Cellular Stress Response in Aging-Associated Diseases, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Microbiology, Immunology and Hygiene, University Hospital of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Microbiology, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical Hygiene, Medical Microbiology and Clinical Infectiology, Paracelsus Medical University, Nuremberg, Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Microbiology, University Medical Center Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Microbiology and Hygiene, University Hospital Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Microbiology and Hygiene, University Hospital Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180327,Switzerland,Front Microbiol,Frontiers in microbiology,101548977,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['PCR', 'clinical samples', 'invasive aspergillosis', 'melting curve analysis', 'triazole resistance']",2018/04/18 06:00,2018/04/18 06:01,['2018/04/18 06:00'],"['2018/02/08 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/18 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fmicb.2018.00555 [doi]'],epublish,Front Microbiol. 2018 Mar 27;9:555. doi: 10.3389/fmicb.2018.00555. eCollection 2018.,,,,PMC5890139,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there are no studies on this effect in older adults with metabolic syndrome (MetS). Purpose: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of TC exercise on oxidative stress and inflammatory markers in older adults with MetS. Methods: A quasi-experimental study was carried out with a sample of 110 older sedentary volunteers with clinical diagnoses of MetS: (i) a control group, n = 50, of individuals who do not participate in physical exercise, of which 37 fulfilled the entire study protocol, and (ii) an experimental group, n = 60, of subjects enrolled in a TC exercise training program (eight-form easy), 5 days a week for 6 months, in sessions of 50 min, under the supervision of a qualified instructor, of which 48 fulfilled the entire study protocol. We measured in both groups (pre- and post-intervention) the following cardiovascular parameters: resting heart rate (RHR), diastolic and systolic blood pressure (DBP and SBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), RHR-SBP product, RHR-MAP product; glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c); oxidative stress markers (superoxide dismutase, total antioxidant status, thiobarbituric acid reacting substances, and oxidative stress score); and inflammation markers (TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10). Results: A statistically significant decrease in HbA1c concentration was observed in the TC group compared with the control group (p < 0.05). This group also showed a statistically significant increase in TAS and a decrease in the oxidative stress score (p < 0.05). We did not observe changes in the cardiovascular parameters (RHR, DBP, SBP, MAP, RHR-SBP product, and RHR-MAP product) in the TC experimental group compared to the control group. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the practice of TC exercise has an antioxidative and hypoglycemic effect in the elderly with MetS.","['Mendoza-Nunez, Victor Manuel', 'Arista-Ugalde, Taide Laurita', 'Rosado-Perez, Juana', 'Ruiz-Ramos, Mirna', 'Santiago-Osorio, Edelmiro']","['Mendoza-Nunez VM', 'Arista-Ugalde TL', 'Rosado-Perez J', 'Ruiz-Ramos M', 'Santiago-Osorio E']","['Research Unit on Gerontology, FES Zaragoza, National Autonomous University of Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Research Unit on Gerontology, FES Zaragoza, National Autonomous University of Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Research Unit on Gerontology, FES Zaragoza, National Autonomous University of Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Research Unit on Gerontology, FES Zaragoza, National Autonomous University of Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Hematopoiesis and Leukemia Laboratory, Research Unit on Cell Differentiation and Cancer, FES Zaragoza, National Autonomous University of Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180403,New Zealand,Clin Interv Aging,Clinical interventions in aging,101273480,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Lipid Peroxides)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antioxidants/*metabolism', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lipid Peroxides/metabolism', 'Male', 'Metabolic Syndrome/*metabolism/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Oxidative Stress/physiology', 'Superoxide Dismutase/metabolism', 'Tai Ji/*methods']",['NOTNLM'],"['HbA1c', 'Tai chi', 'metabolic syndrome', 'older subjects', 'oxidative stress']",2018/04/18 06:00,2018/08/28 06:00,['2018/04/18 06:00'],"['2018/04/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.2147/CIA.S157584 [doi]', 'cia-13-523 [pii]']",epublish,Clin Interv Aging. 2018 Apr 3;13:523-531. doi: 10.2147/CIA.S157584. eCollection 2018.,,,,PMC5892965,,,['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,['Clin Interv Aging. 2018 Jul 11;13:1233-1235.

It occurs secondary to Warburg effect, when glucose metabolism in cancer cells switches from the oxidative pathway to the glycolytic pathway. Malignant lactic acidosis is a life-threatening condition if not promptly diagnosed and treated urgently. CASE REPORT We report the case of a 58-year-old male patient who presented with severe chest pain, dyspnea, systemic symptoms, leukopenia, normocytic anemia, and severe lactic acidosis. He was admitted with a possible diagnosis of acute pericarditis and lactic acidosis. Sodium bicarbonate replacement did not improve the lactic acidosis. Liver biopsy was performed because of persistently elevated alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transferase; the biopsy showed atypical lymphoblasts and bone marrow biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of precursor B acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Lactic acidosis normalized after initiation of chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS Cancer, particularly hematological malignancy, should be considered as an etiology and differential diagnosis of type-B lactic acidosis. Prompt recognition and urgent initiation of specific therapy to control the underlying malignancy are critical to manage this serious metabolic complication.","['Sayyed, Ayman Hassan', 'Aleem, Aamer', 'Al-Katari, Mohammad Sami', 'Algahtani, Fatma', 'Aljerian, Khaldoon', 'Aleem, Talha A', 'Alsaleh, Khalid']","['Sayyed AH', 'Aleem A', 'Al-Katari MS', 'Algahtani F', 'Aljerian K', 'Aleem TA', 'Alsaleh K']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, College of Medicine and King Khalid University Hospital, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, College of Medicine and King Khalid University Hospital, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, College of Medicine and King Khalid University Hospital, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Division of Hematopathology, Department of Pathology, College of Medicine and King Khalid University Hospital, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Division of Histopathology and Forensic Medicine, Department of Pathology, College of Medicine and King Khalid University Hospital, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'College of Medicine, Alfaisal University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, College of Medicine and King Khalid University Hospital, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.']",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20180417,United States,Am J Case Rep,The American journal of case reports,101489566,,IM,"['Acidosis, Lactic/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Liver/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis']",,,2018/04/18 06:00,2018/10/12 06:00,['2018/04/18 06:00'],"['2018/04/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/12 06:00 [medline]']","['907383 [pii]', '10.12659/ajcr.907383 [doi]']",epublish,Am J Case Rep. 2018 Apr 17;19:453-457. doi: 10.12659/ajcr.907383.,,,,PMC5923601,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Obesity is known to mediate esophageal carcinogenesis through different mechanisms including insulin-resistance leading to hyperinsulinemia, which may mediate cancer progression via the insulin/insulin-like growth factor axis. We used the hyperinsulinemic non-obese FVB/N (Friend leukemia virus B strain) MKR (muscle (M)-IGF1R-lysine (K)-arginine (R) mouse model to evaluate the exclusive role of hyperinsulinemia in the pathogenesis of EAC related to duodeno-esophageal reflux. FVB/N wild-type (WT) and MKR mice underwent jejunum-esophageal anastomosis side-to end with the exclusion of the stomach. Thirty weeks after surgery, the esophagus was processed for histological, immunological and insulin/Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) signal transduction analyses. Most of the WT mice (63.1%) developed dysplasia, whereas most of the MKR mice (74.3%) developed squamous cell and adenosquamous carcinomas, both expressing Human Epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Hyperinsulinemia significantly increased esophageal cancer incidence in the presence of duodenal-reflux. Insulin receptor (IR) and IGF1 receptor (IGF1R) were overexpressed in the hyperinsulinemic condition. IGF1R, through ERK1/2 mitogenic pattern activation, seems to be involved in cancer onset.

Despite its importance, the structural basis of multidrug transport, i.e. the ability to transport multiple distinct chemicals, has remained elusive. Previous research has shown that at least two residues positioned towards the cytoplasmic end of transmembrane helix 3 (TM3) of the transporter play a role in drug transport. We hypothesised that other residues, either in the longitudinal span of TM3, or a perpendicular slice through the intracellular end of other TM helices would also contribute to drug binding and transport by ABCG2. Single-point mutant isoforms of ABCG2 were made at approximately 30 positions and were analysed for effects on protein expression, localisation (western blotting, confocal microscopy) and function (flow cytometry) in a mammalian stable cell line expression system. Our data were interpreted in terms of recent structural data on the ABCG protein subfamily and enabled us to propose a surface-binding site for the drug mitoxantrone (MX) as well as a second, buried site for the same drug. Further mutational analysis of residues that spatially separate these two sites prompts us to suggest a molecular and structural pathway for MX transport by ABCG2.","['Cox, Megan H', 'Kapoor, Parth', 'Briggs, Deborah A', 'Kerr, Ian D']","['Cox MH', 'Kapoor P', 'Briggs DA', 'Kerr ID']","[""School of Life Sciences, University of Nottingham, Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham NG7 2UH, U.K."", ""School of Life Sciences, University of Nottingham, Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham NG7 2UH, U.K."", ""School of Life Sciences, University of Nottingham, Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham NG7 2UH, U.K."", ""School of Life Sciences, University of Nottingham, Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham NG7 2UH, U.K. ian.kerr@nottingham.ac.uk.""]",['ORCID: 0000-0002-7544-8454'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180504,England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (ABCG2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '181494-14-4 (Zeocin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2/*chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Biological Transport', 'Bleomycin/*metabolism', 'Catalytic Domain', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Conformation']",['NOTNLM'],"['*ABC transport proteins', '*ABCG2', '*asymmetry', '*binding site', '*molecular docking', '*multidrug resistance']",2018/04/18 06:00,2019/02/13 06:00,['2018/04/18 06:00'],"['2017/12/19 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/28 00:00 [revised]', '2018/04/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/13 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['BCJ20170923 [pii]', '10.1042/BCJ20170923 [doi]']",epublish,Biochem J. 2018 May 4;475(9):1553-1567. doi: 10.1042/BCJ20170923.,['(c) 2018 The Author(s).'],,"['BB/J014508/1/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom']",PMC5934980,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of genetic polymorphisms on the posaconazole plasma concentration (PPC). This prospective study was conducted from September 2014 to August 2016. We enrolled patients with acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome treated with posaconazole oral suspension (200 mg) three times daily for fungal prophylaxis. The patients were examined for the multidrug resistance gene 1 3435C>T and 2677G>T/A variations and the UGT1A4*3 allele by direct sequencing of DNA from peripheral whole-blood samples. We defined poor absorbers to be those with PPCs of <200 ng/ml and the optimal PPC to be >/=700 ng/ml on day 8. The associations between genetic polymorphisms and the PPC were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression analysis including clinical variables. During the study period, 132 patients were enrolled. Six patients (4.5%) were defined as poor absorbers, and 49 patients (37.1%) did not reach the optimal PPC on day 8. In multivariate analysis, the independent risk factors for a poor absorber were at least one UGT1A4*3 allele (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 18.81; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09 to 324.44; P = 0.043) and poor oral food intake (aOR per -100 kcal, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.99; P = 0.029). There was no statistically significant association between the genetic polymorphisms and achievement of the optimal PPC on day 8. The UGT1A4*3 polymorphism is an independent risk factor for being a poor absorber of posaconazole oral suspension in patients with hematological malignancies.","['Suh, Hyeon Jeong', 'Yoon, Seo Hyun', 'Yu, Kyung-Sang', 'Cho, Joo-Youn', 'Park, Sang-In', 'Lee, Eunyoung', 'Lee, Jeong-Ok', 'Koh, Youngil', 'Song, Kyoung-Ho', 'Choe, Pyoeng Gyun', 'Kim, Eu Suk', 'Bang, Soo-Mee', 'Kim, Hong Bin', 'Kim, Inho', 'Kim, Nam Joong', 'Song, Sang Hoon', 'Park, Wan Beom', 'Oh, Myoung-Don']","['Suh HJ', 'Yoon SH', 'Yu KS', 'Cho JY', 'Park SI', 'Lee E', 'Lee JO', 'Koh Y', 'Song KH', 'Choe PG', 'Kim ES', 'Bang SM', 'Kim HB', 'Kim I', 'Kim NJ', 'Song SH', 'Park WB', 'Oh MD']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine and Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Seoul National University College of Medicine and Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Seoul National University College of Medicine and Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Seoul National University College of Medicine and Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Seoul National University College of Medicine and Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine and Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine and Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, South Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine and Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine and Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, South Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine and Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine and Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, South Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine and Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, South Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine and Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, South Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine and Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine and Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine and Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine and Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, South Korea wbpark1@snu.ac.kr.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine and Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, South Korea.']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-7132-0157', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6262-372X']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180626,United States,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,0315061,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Triazoles)', '0 (bilirubin glucuronoside glucuronosyltransferase)', '6TK1G07BHZ (posaconazole)', 'EC 2.4.1.17 (Glucuronosyltransferase)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Alleles', 'Antifungal Agents/administration & dosage/*blood/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/genetics', 'Female', 'Glucuronosyltransferase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Polymorphism, Genetic/*genetics', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Triazoles/administration & dosage/*blood/therapeutic use']",['NOTNLM'],"['*UGT1A4', '*fungal prophylaxis', '*genetic polymorphisms', '*low posaconazole plasma concentration', '*posaconazole']",2018/04/18 06:00,2019/09/03 06:00,['2018/04/18 06:00'],"['2017/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/03 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['AAC.02230-17 [pii]', '10.1128/AAC.02230-17 [doi]']",epublish,Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2018 Jun 26;62(7). pii: AAC.02230-17. doi: 10.1128/AAC.02230-17.

However, the mechanisms by which adrenergic neurotransmitters are delivered to the tumor microenvironment are not well understood. Here we present evidence for a feed-forward loop whereby adrenergic signaling leads to increased tumoral innervation. In response to catecholamines, tumor cells produced brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in an ADRB3/cAMP/Epac/JNK-dependent manner. Elevated BDNF levels in the tumor microenvironment increased innervation by signaling through host neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase 2 receptors. In patients with cancer, high tumor nerve counts were significantly associated with increased BDNF and norepinephrine levels and decreased overall survival. Collectively, these data describe a novel pathway for tumor innervation, with resultant biological and clinical implications.Significance: Sustained adrenergic signaling promotes tumor growth and metastasis through BDNF-mediated tumoral innervation.

However, there is little information regarding the risk of late mortality. We examined all-cause mortality, relapse-related mortality (RRM), and nonrelapse-related mortality (NRM) in 2-year survivors of autologous BMT performed before age 22 between 1980 and 2010 at 1 of 2 US transplant centers. Vital status information was collected using medical records, National Death Index, and Accurint databases. Overall survival was calculated using Kaplan-Meier techniques. Cumulative incidence of mortality used competing risk methods. Standardized mortality ratio (SMR) was calculated using age-, sex-, and calendar-specific mortality rates from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Cox regression analysis was used to determine predictors of all-cause late mortality. Among the 345 2-year survivors, 103 deaths were observed, yielding an overall survival of 70.3% 15 years post-BMT. The leading causes of death included primary disease (50.0%), subsequent neoplasm (21.4%), and infection (18.2%). Overall, the cohort was at a 22-fold increased risk of late mortality (SMR, 21.8; 95% CI, 17.9-26.3), compared with the general population. Mortality rates remained elevated among the 10-year survivors (SMR, 20.6; 95% CI, 9.9-37.2) but approached those of the general population >/=15 years post-BMT. The 10-year cumulative incidence of RRM (14.3%) exceeded that of NRM (10.4%). The 10-year cumulative mortality rate declined over time (<1990, 35.1%; 1990-1999, 25.6%; 2000-2010, 21.8%; P = .05). In conclusion, childhood autologous BMT recipients have an increased risk of late mortality, compared with the general population. The late mortality rates have declined over the past 3 decades.","['Holmqvist, Anna Sallfors', 'Chen, Yanjun', 'Wu, Jessica', 'Battles, Kevin', 'Bhatia, Ravi', 'Francisco, Liton', 'Hageman, Lindsey', 'Kung, Michelle', 'Ness, Emily', 'Parman, Mariel', 'Salzman, Donna', 'Winther, Jeanette Falck', 'Rosenthal, Joseph', 'Forman, Stephen J', 'Weisdorf, Daniel J', 'Arora, Mukta', 'Armenian, Saro H', 'Bhatia, Smita']","['Holmqvist AS', 'Chen Y', 'Wu J', 'Battles K', 'Bhatia R', 'Francisco L', 'Hageman L', 'Kung M', 'Ness E', 'Parman M', 'Salzman D', 'Winther JF', 'Rosenthal J', 'Forman SJ', 'Weisdorf DJ', 'Arora M', 'Armenian SH', 'Bhatia S']","['Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Skane University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Sciences, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Institute for Cancer Outcomes and Survivorship and.', 'Institute for Cancer Outcomes and Survivorship and.', 'Institute for Cancer Outcomes and Survivorship and.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL.', 'Institute for Cancer Outcomes and Survivorship and.', 'Institute for Cancer Outcomes and Survivorship and.', 'Institute for Cancer Outcomes and Survivorship and.', 'Institute for Cancer Outcomes and Survivorship and.', 'Institute for Cancer Outcomes and Survivorship and.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL.', 'Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Health, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, City of Hope, Duarte, CA; and.', 'Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, City of Hope, Duarte, CA; and.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology and Transplantation, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology and Transplantation, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN.', 'Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, City of Hope, Duarte, CA; and.', 'Institute for Cancer Outcomes and Survivorship and.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180416,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*mortality', 'Cause of Death', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/therapy', 'Lymphoma/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Neuroblastoma/mortality/therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/therapy', 'Sex Factors', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Autologous/mortality', 'Young Adult']",,,2018/04/18 06:00,2019/07/10 06:00,['2018/04/18 06:00'],"['2018/02/15 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/10 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)32166-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2018-02-831156 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2018 Jun 14;131(24):2720-2729. doi: 10.1182/blood-2018-02-831156.

We prospectively registered thromboembolic events during the treatment of 1772 consecutive Nordic/Baltic patients with ALL aged 1 to 45 years who were treated according to the Nordic Society of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology ALL2008 protocol (July 2008-April 2017). The 2.5-year cumulative incidence of thromboembolism (N = 137) was 7.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.6-9.1); it was higher in patients aged at least 10 years (P < .0001). Adjusted hazard ratios (HRas) were associated with greater age (range, 10.0-17.9 years: HRa, 4.9 [95% CI, 3.1-7.8; P < .0001]; 18.0-45.9 years: HRa, 6.06 [95% CI, 3.65-10.1; P < .0001]) and mediastinal mass at ALL diagnosis (HRa, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.0-4.3; P = .04). In a multiple absolute risk regression model addressing 3 thromboembolism risk factors, age at least 10 years had the largest absolute risk ratio (RRage, 4.7 [95% CI, 3.1-7.1]; RRenlarged lymph nodes, 2.0 [95% CI, 1.2-3.1]; RRmediastinal mass, 1.6 [95% CI, 1.0-2.6]). Patients aged 18.0 to 45.9 years had an increased hazard of pulmonary embolism (HRa, 11.6; 95% CI, 4.02-33.7; P < .0001), and patients aged 10.0 to 17.9 years had an increased hazard of cerebral sinus venous thrombosis (HRa, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.5-7.3; P = .003) compared with children younger than 10.0 years. Asparaginase was truncated in 38/128 patients with thromboembolism, whereas thromboembolism diagnosis was unassociated with increased hazard of relapse (P = .6). Five deaths were attributable to thromboembolism, and patients younger than 18.0 years with thromboembolism had increased hazard of dying compared with same-aged patients without thromboembolism (both P </= .01). In conclusion, patients aged at least 10 years could be candidates for preemptive antithrombotic prophylaxis. However, the predictive value of age 10 years or older, enlarged lymph nodes, and mediastinal mass remain to be validated in another cohort.","['Rank, Cecilie Utke', 'Toft, Nina', 'Tuckuviene, Ruta', 'Grell, Kathrine', 'Nielsen, Ove Juul', 'Frandsen, Thomas Leth', 'Marquart, Hanne Vibeke Hansen', 'Albertsen, Birgitte Klug', 'Tedgard, Ulf', 'Hallbook, Helene', 'Ruud, Ellen', 'Jarvis, Kirsten Brunsvig', 'Quist-Paulsen, Petter', 'Huttunen, Pasi', 'Wartiovaara-Kautto, Ulla', 'Jonsson, Olafur Gisli', 'Trakymiene, Sonata Saulyte', 'Griskevicius, Laimonas', 'Saks, Kadri', 'Punab, Mari', 'Schmiegelow, Kjeld']","['Rank CU', 'Toft N', 'Tuckuviene R', 'Grell K', 'Nielsen OJ', 'Frandsen TL', 'Marquart HVH', 'Albertsen BK', 'Tedgard U', 'Hallbook H', 'Ruud E', 'Jarvis KB', 'Quist-Paulsen P', 'Huttunen P', 'Wartiovaara-Kautto U', 'Jonsson OG', 'Trakymiene SS', 'Griskevicius L', 'Saks K', 'Punab M', 'Schmiegelow K']","['Pediatric Oncology Research Laboratory and.', 'Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark.', 'Pediatric Oncology Research Laboratory and.', 'Section of Biostatistics, Department of Public Health, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences.', 'Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Rigshospitalet, and.', 'Department of Clinical Immunology, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Coagulation Disorders, Lund University Hospital, Malmo, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Sciences (Hematology), Uppsala University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Paediatric Medicine, Rikshospitalet, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Paediatric Medicine, Rikshospitalet, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Hematology, St. Olavs Hospital, Trondheim University Hospital, Trondheim, Norway.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Children's Hospital, Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland."", 'Department of Hematology, Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki University Hospital and Helsinki University, Helsinki, Finland.', ""Children's Hospital, Landspitali, University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."", ""Center for Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Children's Hospital, Vilnius University Hospital Santaros Klinikos, Vilnius, Lithuania."", 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, and Transfusion Medicine Center, Vilnius University Hospital Santaros Klinikos and Vilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania.', ""Department of Oncohematology, Tallinn Children's Hospital, Tallinn, Estonia."", 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Tartu University Hospital, Tartu, Estonia; and.', 'Pediatric Oncology Research Laboratory and.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Rigshospitalet, and.', 'Institute of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-0578-3887'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180416,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications', 'Risk Factors', 'Thromboembolism/*chemically induced/*prevention & control', 'Young Adult']",,,2018/04/18 06:00,2019/07/02 06:00,['2018/04/18 06:00'],"['2018/01/17 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/02 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)32192-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2018-01-827949 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2018 May 31;131(22):2475-2484. doi: 10.1182/blood-2018-01-827949.

We have previously shown that PR1 is cross-presented by solid tumors, leukemia, and antigen-presenting cells, including B cells. We have also shown that cross-presentation of PR1 by solid tumors renders them susceptible to killing by PR1-targeting immunotherapies. As multiple myeloma is derived from B cells, we investigated whether multiple myeloma is also capable of PR1 cross-presentation and subsequently capable of being targeted by using PR1 immunotherapies.Experimental Design: We tested whether multiple myeloma is capable of cross-presenting PR1 and subsequently becomes susceptible to PR1-targeting immunotherapies, using multiple myeloma cell lines, a xenograft mouse model, and primary multiple myeloma patient samples.Results: Here we show that multiple myeloma cells lack endogenous NE and P3, are able to take up exogenous NE and P3, and cross-present PR1 on HLA-A2. Cross-presentation by multiple myeloma utilizes the conventional antigen processing machinery, including the proteasome and Golgi, and is not affected by immunomodulating drugs (IMiD). Following PR1 cross-presentation, we are able to target multiple myeloma with PR1-CTL and anti-PR1/HLA-A2 antibody both in vitro and in vivoConclusions: Collectively, our data demonstrate that PR1 is a novel tumor-associated antigen target in multiple myeloma and that multiple myeloma is susceptible to immunotherapies that target cross-presented antigens.

Thus there exists an urgent need for more effective agents to treat AML that confer high therapeutic indices and favorable tolerability profiles. Because of its high expression on leukemic blast and stem cells compared with normal hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors, CD123 has emerged as a rational candidate for molecularly targeted therapeutic approaches in this disease. Here we describe the development and preclinical characterization of a CD123-targeting antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), IMGN632, that comprises a novel humanized anti-CD123 antibody G4723A linked to a recently reported DNA mono-alkylating payload of the indolinobenzodiazepine pseudodimer (IGN) class of cytotoxic compounds. The activity of IMGN632 was compared with X-ADC, the ADC utilizing the G4723A antibody linked to a DNA crosslinking IGN payload. With low picomolar potency, both ADCs reduced viability in AML cell lines and patient-derived samples in culture, irrespective of their multidrug resistance or disease status. However, X-ADC exposure was >40-fold more cytotoxic to the normal myeloid progenitors than IMGN632. Of particular note, IMGN632 demonstrated potent activity in all AML samples at concentrations well below levels that impacted normal bone marrow progenitors, suggesting the potential for efficacy in AML patients in the absence of or with limited myelosuppression. Furthermore, IMGN632 demonstrated robust antitumor efficacy in multiple AML xenograft models. Overall, these findings identify IMGN632 as a promising candidate for evaluation as a novel therapy in AML.","['Kovtun, Yelena', 'Jones, Gregory E', 'Adams, Sharlene', 'Harvey, Lauren', 'Audette, Charlene A', 'Wilhelm, Alan', 'Bai, Chen', 'Rui, Lingyun', 'Laleau, Rassol', 'Liu, Fenghua', 'Ab, Olga', 'Setiady, Yulius', 'Yoder, Nicholas C', 'Goldmacher, Victor S', 'Chari, Ravi V J', 'Pinkas, Jan', 'Chittenden, Thomas']","['Kovtun Y', 'Jones GE', 'Adams S', 'Harvey L', 'Audette CA', 'Wilhelm A', 'Bai C', 'Rui L', 'Laleau R', 'Liu F', 'Ab O', 'Setiady Y', 'Yoder NC', 'Goldmacher VS', 'Chari RVJ', 'Pinkas J', 'Chittenden T']","['Science, Technology, and Translation, ImmunoGen, Inc, Waltham MA.', 'Science, Technology, and Translation, ImmunoGen, Inc, Waltham MA.', 'Science, Technology, and Translation, ImmunoGen, Inc, Waltham MA.', 'Science, Technology, and Translation, ImmunoGen, Inc, Waltham MA.', 'Science, Technology, and Translation, ImmunoGen, Inc, Waltham MA.', 'Science, Technology, and Translation, ImmunoGen, Inc, Waltham MA.', 'Science, Technology, and Translation, ImmunoGen, Inc, Waltham MA.', 'Science, Technology, and Translation, ImmunoGen, Inc, Waltham MA.', 'Science, Technology, and Translation, ImmunoGen, Inc, Waltham MA.', 'Science, Technology, and Translation, ImmunoGen, Inc, Waltham MA.', 'Science, Technology, and Translation, ImmunoGen, Inc, Waltham MA.', 'Science, Technology, and Translation, ImmunoGen, Inc, Waltham MA.', 'Science, Technology, and Translation, ImmunoGen, Inc, Waltham MA.', 'Science, Technology, and Translation, ImmunoGen, Inc, Waltham MA.', 'Science, Technology, and Translation, ImmunoGen, Inc, Waltham MA.', 'Science, Technology, and Translation, ImmunoGen, Inc, Waltham MA.', 'Science, Technology, and Translation, ImmunoGen, Inc, Waltham MA.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,"['0 (IL3RA protein, human)', '0 (Immunoconjugates)', '0 (Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Immunoconjugates/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,2018/04/18 06:00,2019/03/09 06:00,['2018/04/18 06:00'],"['2018/02/16 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/09 06:00 [medline]']","['bloodadvances.2018017517 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2018017517 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2018 Apr 24;2(8):848-858. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2018017517.,['(c) 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,PMC5916008,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AIM: To describe skin lesions in ATLL. METHODS: A descriptive, retrospective study between 1996 and 2016, including all patients diagnosed with ATLL at Saint-Louis Hospital (Paris, France). RESULTS: Thirty-seven ATLL patients were included. Fifteen patients (41%) had a cutaneous localization of the disease, which was present from the beginning of the disease for two thirds of them. ATLL types in patients with cutaneous localization of the disease were as follows: lymphoma, n=5, chronic, n=4, smoldering, n=4, acute, n=2. Half the patients had 2 or more cutaneous manifestations. The cutaneous localizations observed were as follows: nodulotumoral (n=8), plaques (n=7), multipapular (n=6), macular (n=4), purpuric (n=2). Among the 15 patients with cutaneous localization, median overall survival was significantly shorter in the acute and lymphoma types compared to the smoldering and chronic types (8.7 months vs. 79 months, P=0.003). DISCUSSION: ATLL is a hematologic malignancy with variable expression that is diagnosed only very rarely in metropolitan France, but that should be sought in patients from countries with high HTLV-1 prevalence in the event of a chronic eruption with patches, papules, plaques and/or tumors. The chronic and smoldering types are relatively indolent, whereas the acute and lymphoma forms have a poor prognosis.","['Hurabielle, C', 'Battistella, M', 'Ram-Wolff, C', 'Fite, C', 'Meignin, V', 'Rivet, J', 'Vignon-Pennamen, M-D', 'de Risi-Pugliese, T', 'Raffoux, E', 'Arnulf, B', 'Oksenhendler, E', 'Sicre de Fontbrune, F', 'Peffault de Latour, R', 'Socie, G', 'Bouaziz, J-D', 'Lebbe, C', 'Bensussan, A', 'Bagot, M']","['Hurabielle C', 'Battistella M', 'Ram-Wolff C', 'Fite C', 'Meignin V', 'Rivet J', 'Vignon-Pennamen MD', 'de Risi-Pugliese T', 'Raffoux E', 'Arnulf B', 'Oksenhendler E', 'Sicre de Fontbrune F', 'Peffault de Latour R', 'Socie G', 'Bouaziz JD', 'Lebbe C', 'Bensussan A', 'Bagot M']","['Dermatology department, hopital Saint-Louis, AP-HP, 1, avenue Claude-Vellefaux, 75010 Paris, France; Inserm Unite 976, hopital Saint-Louis, 1, avenue Claude-Vellefaux, 75010 Paris, France.', 'Histopathology department, hopital Saint-Louis, France Inserm Unit 976, AP-HP, 1, avenue Claude-Vellefaux, 75010 Paris, France; Universite Paris-Diderot, Sorbonne-Paris-Cite, 75000 Paris, France.

Until now, ten-eleven translocation 2 (TET2) and isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) mutations were reported to be mutually exclusive in AML patients. Similarly, nucleophosmin (NPM1) and additional sex comb-like 1 (ASXL1) mutations were rarely coexisted in AML. A 47-year-old man diagnosed with high-risk AML presented simultaneous mutations of TET2-IDH2 and NPM1-ASXL1 revealed by next-generation sequencing. After successful treatment with chemotherapy followed by HLA haploidentical transplantation, he achieved a clinical complete remission without evidence of overt graft-versus-host disease. This case highlights that HLA haploidentical transplantation might be a safe and feasible therapy for AML patients who are characterized by TET2-IDH2 and NPM1-ASXL1 co-mutations.","['Liu, Y', 'Cao, Y', 'Lin, Y', 'Dong, W-M', 'Lin, R-R', 'Gu, Q', 'Xie, X-B', 'Gu, W-Y']","['Liu Y', 'Cao Y', 'Lin Y', 'Dong WM', 'Lin RR', 'Gu Q', 'Xie XB', 'Gu WY']","[""Department of Hematology, The First People's Hospital of Changzhou, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Changzhou, Jiangsu, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First People's Hospital of Changzhou, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Changzhou, Jiangsu, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First People's Hospital of Changzhou, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Changzhou, Jiangsu, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First People's Hospital of Changzhou, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Changzhou, Jiangsu, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First People's Hospital of Changzhou, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Changzhou, Jiangsu, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First People's Hospital of Changzhou, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Changzhou, Jiangsu, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First People's Hospital of Changzhou, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Changzhou, Jiangsu, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First People's Hospital of Changzhou, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Changzhou, Jiangsu, China.

Allogenic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) is the best treatment option in fit patients. Either HLA-matched unrelated donor (MUD) or haploidentical (Haplo) donor are possible alternative for patients in need. METHODS: We retrospectively compared non-T-cell-depleted Haplo (n = 250) to 10/10 MUD (n = 2589) in AML patients >/= 60 years. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 23 months. Disease status at transplant differs significantly between the two groups (p < 10(-4)). Reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) was administrated to 73 and 77% of Haplo and MUD, respectively (p = 0.23). Stem cell source was the bone marrow (BM) in 52% of the Haplo and 6% of MUD (p < 10(-4)). Anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) was most frequently used in MUD (p < 10(-4)) while post-Tx cyclophosphamide (PT-Cy) was given in 62% of Haplo. Engraftment was achieved in 90% of the Haplo vs 97% of MUD (p < 10(-4)). In multivariate analysis, no significant difference was found between Haplo and MUD for acute (a)graft versus host disease (GVHD) grade II-IV, relapse incidence (RI), non-relapse mortality (NRM), leukemia free survival (LFS), graft-versus-host-free-relapse free survival (GRFS), and overall survival (OS). Extensive chronic (c)GVHD was significantly higher for MUD as compared to Haplo (HR 2, p = 0.01, 95% CI 1.17-3.47). A propensity score analysis confirmed the higher risk of extensive cGVHD for MUD without differences for other outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Allo-SCT from both Haplo and MUD are valid option for AML patients >/= 60 years of age with similar results. Transplantation from MUD was associated with higher extensive cGVHD. Our findings suggest that Haplo is a suitable and attractive graft source for patients>/= 60 with AML in need of allo-SCT.","['Santoro, Nicole', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Giannotti, Federica', 'Ehninger, Gerard', 'Niederwieser, Dietger', 'Brecht, Arne', 'Stelljes, Matthias', 'Kroger, Nicolaus', 'Einsele, Herman', 'Eder, Matthias', 'Hallek, Michael', 'Glass, Bertram', 'Finke, Jurgen', 'Ciceri, Fabio', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Ruggeri, Annalisa', 'Nagler, Arnon']","['Santoro N', 'Labopin M', 'Giannotti F', 'Ehninger G', 'Niederwieser D', 'Brecht A', 'Stelljes M', 'Kroger N', 'Einsele H', 'Eder M', 'Hallek M', 'Glass B', 'Finke J', 'Ciceri F', 'Mohty M', 'Ruggeri A', 'Nagler A']","['Department of Hematology and Cell Therapy, Saint-Antoine Hospital, Paris, France. nicole.santoro24@gmail.com.', 'Section of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Perugia, Centro Ricerche Emato-Oncologiche (CREO), Perugia, Italy. nicole.santoro24@gmail.com.', 'Department of Hematology and Cell Therapy, Saint-Antoine Hospital, Paris, France.', 'ALWP office, Hopital Saint-Antoine, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology and Cell Therapy, Saint-Antoine Hospital, Paris, France.', 'Medical Clinic and Policlinic I, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Technical University Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Center for Blood Stem Cell and Bone Marrow Transplant, DKD Helios Clinic Wiesbaden, Wiesbaden, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A/Hematology and Oncology, University of Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, University Hospital Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department I of Internal Medicine and Center of Integrated Oncology Cologne-Bonn, German CLL Study Group, University Hospital of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Asklepios Klinik St. Georg Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine-Hematology, Oncology, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology and Cell Therapy, Saint-Antoine Hospital, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology and Cell Therapy, Saint-Antoine Hospital, Paris, France.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, IRCCS Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital, Piazza S Onofrio, 4, 00165, Rome, Italy."", 'ALWP office, Hopital Saint-Antoine, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel.']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-5705-8084'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180416,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Unrelated Donors']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Allogeneic stem cell transplantation', '*Elderly', '*Haploidentical', '*MUD']",2018/04/18 06:00,2019/10/28 06:00,['2018/04/18 06:00'],"['2018/02/16 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13045-018-0598-0 [doi]', '10.1186/s13045-018-0598-0 [pii]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2018 Apr 16;11(1):55. doi: 10.1186/s13045-018-0598-0.,,,,PMC5902953,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As in other cancers, the loss of cell cycle control plays a prominent role in the pathogenesis in these malignancies that is primarily attributed to loss of CDKN2A (encoding protein p16INK4A). However, the impact of the deregulation of other genes such as CDKN1C, E2F1, and TP53 remains to be clarified. Interestingly, experiments in mouse models have proven that conditional T-cell specific deletion of Cdkn1c gene may induce a differentiation block at the DN3 to DN4 transition, and that the loss of this gene in the absence of Tp53 led to aggressive thymic lymphomas. RESULTS: In this manuscript, we demonstrated that the simultaneous deregulation of CDKN1C, E2F1, and TP53 genes by epigenetic mechanisms and/or the deregulation of specific microRNAs, together with additional impairing of TP53 function by the expression of dominant-negative isoforms are common features in primary human T-LBLs. CONCLUSIONS: Previous experimental work in mice revealed that T-cell specific deletion of Cdkn1c accelerates lymphomagenesis in the absence of Tp53. If, as expected, the consequences of the deregulation of the CDKN1C-E2F1-TP53 axis were the same as those experimentally demonstrated in mouse models, the disruption of this axis might be useful to predict tumor aggressiveness, and to provide the basis towards the development of potential therapeutic strategiesin human T-LBL.","['Lopez-Nieva, Pilar', 'Fernandez-Navarro, Pablo', 'Vaquero-Lorenzo,

Indisulam exhibits synergy with nucleoside analogs and topoisomerase inhibitors. METHODS: The authors designed a phase 2 study of indisulam in combination with idarubicin and cytarabine in patients who had relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia AML and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome. In stage 1, patients received intravenous indisulam at 400 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 8 of a 28-day cycle. If they had no response, then patients received same dose schedule of indisulam followed by intravenous idarubicin 8 mg/m(2) daily for 3 days and cytarabine 1.0 g/m(2) over 24 hours daily on days 9 through 12 (for those aged < 60 years) or days 9 through 11 (for those aged > 60 years) of a 28-day cycle. Primary endpoints included the overall response rate, and secondary objectives included overall survival. RESULTS: Forty patients were enrolled. Of the 37 evaluable patients, 31 received indisulam with chemotherapy. Of these, 11 (35%) responded for a median duration of 5.3 months. The estimated 1-year overall survival rate was 51% for responders compared with 8 % for nonresponders (P < .001). The most common grade >/=3 nonhematologic toxicities were electrolyte abnormalities (50%) and febrile neutropenia (28%). CONCLUSIONS: The combination of indisulam with idarubicin and cytarabine yielded a 35% response rate in heavily pretreated patients with AML. With emerging data identifying the expression of DCAF15 (DDB1 and CUL4-associated factor 15) as a potential biomarker for activity, the combination of indisulam with idarubicin and cytarabine should be studied in a biomarker-driven trial or in patients who have splicing factor mutations.

Objective of this study is to evaluate the ABL kinase inhibitory activity of derivatives of Gallic acid fused with 1,3,4-Oxadiazole moieties. Attempts have been made to identify the key structural features responsible for drug likeness of the Gallic acid and the 1,3,4-Oxadiazole ring using molecular electrostatic potential maps (MESP). To investigate the inhibitory activity of Gallic acid derivatives towards the ABL receptor, we have applied molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation approaches. A comparative study was performed using Bosutinib as the standard which is an approved CML drug acting on the same receptor. Furthermore, the novel compounds designed and reported here in were evaluated for ADME properties and the results indicate that they show acceptable pharmacokinetic properties. Accordingly these compounds are predicted to be drug like with low toxicity potential.","['Raghi, K R', 'Sherin, D R', 'Saumya, M J', 'Arun, P S', 'Sobha, V N', 'Manojkumar, T K']","['Raghi KR', 'Sherin DR', 'Saumya MJ', 'Arun PS', 'Sobha VN', 'Manojkumar TK']","['School of Chemical Sciences, Kannur University, Edat, Kannur, 670327, Kerala, India; Indian Institute of Information Technology and Management-Kerala, Trivandrum, 695581, Kerala, India.', 'Indian Institute of Information Technology and Management-Kerala, Trivandrum, 695581, Kerala, India.', 'School of Chemical Sciences, Kannur University, Edat, Kannur, 670327, Kerala, India; Indian Institute of Information Technology and Management-Kerala, Trivandrum, 695581, Kerala, India.', ""St John's College, Anchal, Kollam, 691306, Kerala, India."", 'School of Biotechnology, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Amritapuri, Kollam, 690525, Kerala, India.', 'School of Chemical Sciences, Kannur University, Edat, Kannur, 670327, Kerala, India; Indian Institute of Information Technology and Management-Kerala, Trivandrum, 695581, Kerala, India.

To further analyze the Vwa8 gene in mouse, gene structure, protein homology modeling, and gene expression patterns were examined throughout mouse development. Our analyses indicate that the mouse Vwa8 gene produces two transcripts; the full-length Vwa8a is highly expressed relative to the truncated Vwa8b transcript across all developmental time points and tissues analyzed.

As a natural antiviral agent, betulinic acid is a pentacyclic triterpenoid that can be found in the bark of several species of plants (particularly the white birch). One of the hurdles for betulinic acid to release its antiviral potency is its poor water solubility. In this study, we synthesized more water-soluble ionic derivatives of betulinic acid, and examined their activities against Moloney MuLV (M-MuLV). The mouse fibroblast cells stably infected with M-MuLV, 43D cells, were treated with various doses of betulinic acids and its derivatives, and the viral structural protein Gag in cells and media were detected by western blots. Two ionic derivatives containing the benzalkonium cation were found to inhibit the virus production into media and decreased Gag in cells. However, a cell proliferation assay showed that the benzalkonium cation inhibited the growth of 43D cells, suggesting that our ionic derivatives limited virus production through the inhibition of metabolism in 43D cells. Interestingly, all of these betulinic acid compounds exhibited a minimum impact on the processing and release of Gag from 43D cells, which outlines the differences of viral maturation between MuLV and human immunodeficiency virus.","['Phillips, Jasmine', 'Phillips, Iesha', 'Enya, Blessing', 'Zhao, Hua', 'Nitta, Takayuki']","['Phillips J', 'Phillips I', 'Enya B', 'Zhao H', 'Nitta T']","['Department of Chemistry and Forensic Science, Savannah State University, 3219 College St., Savannah, GA 31404, USA.', 'Department of Biology, Savannah State University, 3219 College St., Savannah, GA 31404, USA.', 'Department of Biology, Savannah State University, 3219 College St., Savannah, GA 31404, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Northern Colorado, Greeley, CO 80639, USA.

METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 450 patients with CML-CP who received TKIs between 2004 and 2014. RESULTS: The 5-year overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) rates were 95.1% and 89.0%, respectively. Patients with comorbidities (46.4%) and aged >/=60 years (50.4%) at diagnosis had significantly inferior OS to those without comorbidities and aged <60. Patients achieved higher rates of major molecular response (MMR) at 6 and 12 months after initial treatment with dasatinib or nilotinib compared to imatinib, but final MMR rates were almost the same. Sixty-six percent of patients required treatment modifications from first-line TKI therapy; the main reasons were AEs (48.4%) and failure (18%). Grade III-IV AEs in first-line TKI therapy were significantly correlated to inferior OS/EFS compared to grade 0-II AEs. CONCLUSION: Although long-term outcomes were similar in CML-CP patients treated with each TKI regardless of first-line TKI selection, severe AEs in first-line TKI therapy decreased their survival rates. Early change in TKIs is recommended, when faced with severe AEs of specific TKIs.","['Ota, Shuichi', 'Matsukawa, Toshihiro', 'Yamamoto, Satoshi', 'Ito, Shinichi', 'Shindo, Motohiro', 'Sato, Kazuya', 'Kondo, Takeshi', 'Kohda, Kyuhei', 'Sakai, Hajime', 'Mori, Akio', 'Takahashi, Tohru', 'Ikeda, Hiroshi', 'Kuroda, Hiroyuki', 'Haseyama, Yoshihito', 'Yamamoto, Masaki', 'Sarashina, Takeo', 'Yoshida, Makoto', 'Kobayashi, Ryoji', 'Nishio, Mitsufumi', 'Ishihara, Toshimichi', 'Hirayama, Yasuo', 'Kakinoki, Yasutaka', 'Kobayashi, Hajime', 'Fukuhara, Takashi', 'Imamura, Masahiro', 'Kurosawa, Mitsutoshi']","['Ota S', 'Matsukawa T', 'Yamamoto S', 'Ito S', 'Shindo M', 'Sato K', 'Kondo T', 'Kohda K', 'Sakai H', 'Mori A', 'Takahashi T', 'Ikeda H', 'Kuroda H', 'Haseyama Y', 'Yamamoto M', 'Sarashina T', 'Yoshida M', 'Kobayashi R', 'Nishio M', 'Ishihara T', 'Hirayama Y', 'Kakinoki Y', 'Kobayashi H', 'Fukuhara T', 'Imamura M', 'Kurosawa M']","['Department of Hematology, Sapporo Hokuyu Hospital, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Kushiro Rosai Hospital, Kushiro, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Sapporo City General Hospital, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Hakodate Municipal Hospital, Hakodate, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Asahikawa Medical University, Asahikawa, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Asahikawa Kosei Hospital, Asahikawa, Japan.', 'Faculty of Medicine and Graduate School of Medicine, Department of Hematology, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Japanese Red Cross Asahikawa Hospital, Asahikawa, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Teine Keijinkai Hospital, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Aiiku Hospital, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Tenshi Hospital, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Sapporo Medical University, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Steel Memorial Muroran Hospital, Muroran, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Tonan Hospital, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Sapporo Medical University, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Asahikawa Medical University, Asahikawa, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Japanese Red Cross Asahikawa Hospital, Asahikawa, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology for Children and Adolescent, Sapporo Hokuyu Hospital, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, NTT East Japan Sapporo Hospital, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Kin-ikyo Chuo Hospital, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Higashisapporo Hospital, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Asahikawa City Hospital, Asahikawa, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Obihiro Kosei Hospital, Obihiro, Japan.', 'Palliative Care Center, Sapporo Kosei Hospital, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Sapporo Hokuyu Hospital, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Hokkaido Cancer Center, Sapporo, Japan.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3631-244X'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20180523,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dasatinib/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*diagnosis/drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['adverse events', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'dasatinib', 'imatinib', 'nilotinib', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",2018/04/17 06:00,2018/10/12 06:00,['2018/04/17 06:00'],"['2018/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/12 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ejh.13081 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2018 Jul;101(1):95-105. doi: 10.1111/ejh.13081.

Aims: To assess the relevance of work-related conditions on the aetiology of human ill-health in different health domains. Methods: We extracted the risk estimates associated with heritability and with occupational risk factors for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), major depressive disorder (MDD) and long QT syndrome (LQTS) from 13 published international reports. The selection criteria for the eligible studies were: genome-wide studies, or studies of the occupational risk factors associated with one of the three diseases of interest. We calculated and compared the respective population attributable fraction for the combined occupational risk factors, and for heritability. Results: We estimated that occupational risk factors would account for 12% (95% confidence interval (CI) 4-19) of CLL, 11% (95% CI 7-15) of MDD and 10% (95% CI 2-13) of LQTS burden in the general population. The corresponding figures for heritability would be 16% (95% CI 11-22), 28% (95% CI 20-5) and 17% (95% CI 7-27).

This study quantifies risk for developing CM after specific LNs and, conversely, for developing specific LNs after CM, as well as assessing clinical impact. Methods: We identified a cohort of Caucasian adults (age 20-83 years) initially diagnosed with CM or LN, as reported to 17 US population-based cancer registries, 2000-2014. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) quantified second cancer risk. We assessed impact of second cancer development on risk of all-cause mortality using Cox regression. Results: Among 151 949 one-or-more-year survivors of first primary LN, second primary CM risk was statistically significantly elevated after chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SIR = 1.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.74 to 2.21), follicular lymphoma (SIR = 1.32, 95% CI = 1.09 to 1.58), and plasma cell neoplasms (SIR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.07 to 1.63). Risks for these same subtypes were statistically significantly elevated among 148 336 survivors of first primary CM (SIR = 1.44, 95% CI = 1.25 to 1.66; SIR = 1.47, 95% CI = 1.21 to 1.77; SIR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.06 to 1.47; respectively). Risk for CM was statistically significantly elevated after diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (SIR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.02 to 1.45) and Hodgkin lymphoma (SIR = 1.75, 95% CI = 1.33 to 2.26), but the reciprocal relationship was not observed. There were no statistically significant associations between marginal zone lymphoma and CM. Among survivors of most LN subtypes, CM statistically significantly increased risk of death (hazard ratio [HR] range = 1.52, 95% CI = 1.25 to 1.85, to 2.46, 95% CI = 1.45 to 4.16). Among survivors of CM, LN statistically significantly increased risk of death (HR range = 1.75, 95% CI = 1.15 to 2.65, to 6.28, 95% CI = 5.00 to 7.88), with the highest risks observed for the most aggressive LN subtypes. Conclusions: Heterogeneous associations between CM and specific LN subtypes provide novel insights into the etiology of these malignancies, with the mutual association between CM and certain LN suggesting shared etiology. Development of second primary CM or LN substantially reduces overall survival.","['Herr, Megan M', 'Schonfeld, Sara J', 'Dores, Graca M', 'Withrow, Diana R', 'Tucker, Margaret A', 'Curtis, Rochelle E', 'Morton, Lindsay M']","['Herr MM', 'Schonfeld SJ', 'Dores GM', 'Withrow DR', 'Tucker MA', 'Curtis RE', 'Morton LM']","['Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, Bethesda, MD.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, Bethesda, MD.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, Bethesda, MD.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, Bethesda, MD.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, Bethesda, MD.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, Bethesda, MD.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, Bethesda, MD.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",,United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['Melanoma, Cutaneous Malignant']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Lymphoma/*epidemiology/etiology/mortality', 'Male', 'Melanoma/*epidemiology/etiology/mortality', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'SEER Program', 'Skin Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology/mortality', 'Young Adult']",,,2018/04/17 06:00,2019/10/01 06:00,['2018/04/17 06:00'],"['2017/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/01 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['4963737 [pii]', '10.1093/jnci/djy052 [doi]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 2018 Nov 1;110(11):1248-1258. doi: 10.1093/jnci/djy052.,,,,PMC6454551,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the past few decades, the incidence of invasive fungal infection has increased dramatically. Its management has been further complicated by the increasing frequency of infection by non-Aspergillus molds (e.g. Mucorales). Neutropenic patients are at a high risk of developing an invasive mucormycosis with fulminant course and high mortality rate (35-100%). Case Outline: We are presenting the case of a 72-year-old male with an acute monoblastic leukemia. The patient was treated during five days with hydroxycarbamide 2 x 500 mg/day, followed by cytarabine 2 x 20 mg/sc over the next 10 days. He developed febrile neutropenia, headache, and edema of the right orbital region of the face. Computed tomography of the sinuses revealed shadow in sinuses with thickening of mucosa of the right paranasal sinuses. Lavage and aspirate from the sinuses revealed Rhizopus oryzae. Mucormycosis was successfully treated with amphotericin B (5 mg/kg/day) followed by ketoconazole (400 mg/day). Two months later the patient died from primary disease. Conclusion: In patients with acute leukemia who developed aplasia, febrile neutropenia, and pain in paranasal sinuses, fungal infection should be taken into consideration. New and non-invasive methods for taking samples from sinuses should be standardized in order to establish an early and accurate diagnosis of mucormycosis with the source in paranasal sinuses, and to start early treatment by a proper antifungal drug. Clear communication between physician and mycologist is critical to ensure proper and timely sampling of lavage and aspirate from sinuses and correct specimen processing when mucormycosis is suspected clinically.","['Colovic, Natasa', 'Arsic-Arsenijevic, Valentina', 'Barac, Aleksandra', 'Suvajdzic, Nada', 'Lekovic, Danijela', 'Tomin, Dragica']","['Colovic N', 'Arsic-Arsenijevic V', 'Barac A', 'Suvajdzic N', 'Lekovic D', 'Tomin D']",,,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Serbia,Srp Arh Celok Lek,Srpski arhiv za celokupno lekarstvo,0027440,['0 (Antifungal Agents)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Antifungal Agents/therapeutic use', 'Chemotherapy-Induced Febrile Neutropenia/*complications', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mucormycosis/drug therapy/*microbiology', 'Paranasal Sinuses', '*Rhizopus']",,,2016/11/01 00:00,2018/05/11 06:00,['2018/04/17 06:00'],"['2018/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/11 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Srp Arh Celok Lek. 2016 Nov-Dec;144(11-12):657-60.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The MK was present in 66 out of 405 (16.3%) patients, most of whom had complex karyotype (CK). MK was strongly associated with CK and the cytogenetic risk defined according to IPSS-R, as well as with high-risk disease, according to IPSS (P = .029), IPSS-R (P < .001), and WPSS (P < .001) classification systems. The overall response rate (ORR) was not different between MK+ and MK- patients (46.6% vs. 46.2%). At 28 months median follow-up, the median duration of response was 11 months in the entire cohort, 9.5 months in MK+ patients and 11 months in MK-patients (P = .024). The estimated median time to transformation to acute myeloid leukemia for MK+ patients was 17 months vs. 23 months for MK- patients (P = .025). The estimated median OS for MK+ patients was 12 months vs. 18 months for MK- patients (P < .001). Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that performance status (P < .001), IPSS-R (P < .001), and MK (P = .002) were independently associated with overall survival (OS). In a subgroup consisting of high and very-high risk patients according to IPSS-R, MK- patients showed better OS rates compared to MK+ patients (estimated median OS: 17 months vs. 12 months, P = .002). In conclusion, we found that MK is associated with reduced OS in patients with higher-risk MDS treated with 5-AZA. Furthermore, we showed that in MDS with high or very-high IPSS-R risk score, MK can further distinguish patients with worse outcome.","['Papageorgiou, Sotirios G', 'Vasilatou, Diamantina', 'Kontos, Christos K', 'Kotsianidis, Ioannis', 'Symeonidis, Argiris', 'Galanopoulos, Athanasios G', 'Hatzimichael, Eleftheria', 'Megalakaki, Aekaterini', 'Poulakidas, Elias', 'Diamantopoulos, Panagiotis', 'Vassilakopoulos, Theodoros P', 'Zikos, Panagiotis', 'Papadaki, Helen', 'Mparmparousi, Despoina', 'Bouronikou, Eleni', 'Panayiotidis, Panayiotis', 'Viniou, Nora-Athina', 'Pappa, Vassiliki']","['Papageorgiou SG', 'Vasilatou D', 'Kontos CK', 'Kotsianidis I', 'Symeonidis A', 'Galanopoulos AG', 'Hatzimichael E', 'Megalakaki A', 'Poulakidas E', 'Diamantopoulos P', 'Vassilakopoulos TP', 'Zikos P', 'Papadaki H', 'Mparmparousi D', 'Bouronikou E', 'Panayiotidis P', 'Viniou NA', 'Pappa V']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine and Research Unit, University General Hospital ""Attikon"", 1 Rimini St., Haidari, Athens, 12462, Greece.', 'Second Department of Internal Medicine and Research Unit, University General Hospital ""Attikon"", 1 Rimini St., Haidari, Athens, 12462, Greece.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Panepistimiopolis, Athens, 15701, Greece.', 'Department of Hematology, Democritus University of Thrace Medical School, University Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Alexandroupolis, Greece.', 'The Hellenic (Greek) MDS Study Group.', 'The Hellenic (Greek) MDS Study Group.', 'General University Hospital of Patras, Rio Patron, Patras, 26500, Greece.', 'The Hellenic (Greek) MDS Study Group.', 'General Hospital of Athens ""G.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common chronic lymphoproliferative disorder. Twenty CLL patients from 2010 to 2011 were recruited in the study. Expression and phosphorylation of transcription factor STAT3 and differential microRNAs (miRs) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from CLL patient samples were analyzed. In a previous study, we found a high level of IL9 in CLL patients. Concomitantly, overexpression of pSTAT3, miR155, and miR21 were observed in PBMCs from CLL patients in the present study. To elucidate whether there was interaction among IL9, STAT3, miR155, and miR21, MEC1 cells were used for further study. Our results revealed that there was no detectable IL9 in the culture medium of MEC1 cells. However, the IL9 protein could be detected using western blotting in MEC1 cells. Notably, when recombinant human IL9 (rIL9) was added to the medium of culturing MEC1 cells, the expression levels of pSTAT3 and IL9 in MEC1 cells were increased in a timedependent manner, which could be blocked by STAT3 inhibitor. Both miR155 and miR21 could increase IL9 expression, which could also be suppressed by the inhibitor of STAT3. Our data indicated that the existence of the novel 'extracellular IL9/pSTAT3/miR155/miR21/intracellular IL9' positive feedback system in CLL cells, provides a novel insight in the pathogenesis and possible therapeutic strategy of CLL.","['Chen, Na', 'Feng, Lili', 'Qu, Huiting', 'Lu, Kang', 'Li, Peipei', 'Lv, Xiao', 'Wang, Xin']","['Chen N', 'Feng L', 'Qu H', 'Lu K', 'Li P', 'Lv X', 'Wang X']","['Department of Hematology, Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong 250021, P.R.

Surgical intervention was performed to alleviate the mass effect on the brain, and obtain a tissue sample for diagnosis. Histopathological report confirmed brain infiltration with myeloid leukemic cells.Expert commentary: Despite its rarity, cerebral dissemination should be considered even in patients with CMML. A multidisciplinary approach, lead by a hematologist, is mandatory in order to correct the underlying haematological disorder, with specific attention to the coagulation profile. Surgical intervention is necessary for symptomatic patients, and should be performed once an improvement of clinical conditions has been achieved. Despite appropriate surgical and medical therapy, the prognosis remains poor with high risk of perioperative complications, such as rebleeding, and progressive systemic involvement.","['Bernat, Anne-Laure', 'Priola, Stefano Maria', 'Elsawy, Ahmad', 'Farrash, Faisal', 'Taslimi, Shervin', 'Gentili, Fred']","['Bernat AL', 'Priola SM', 'Elsawy A', 'Farrash F', 'Taslimi S', 'Gentili F']","['Department of Neurosurgery, Toronto Western Hospital, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Toronto Western Hospital, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Toronto Western Hospital, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Toronto Western Hospital, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Toronto Western Hospital, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Toronto Western Hospital, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180419,England,Expert Rev Neurother,Expert review of neurotherapeutics,101129944,,IM,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia', 'central nervous system blast crisis', 'dural infiltration', 'hemorrhagic brain lesion', 'subdural collection']",2018/04/17 06:00,2018/04/17 06:01,['2018/04/17 06:00'],"['2018/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/17 06:01 [medline]', '2018/04/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/14737175.2018.1464391 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Neurother. 2018 May;18(5):371-377. doi: 10.1080/14737175.2018.1464391.

We examined whether self-reported maternal residential pesticide use and nearby pesticide applications-before and after child's birth-were associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in the Costa Rican Childhood Leukemia Study (CRCLS), a population-based case-control study (2001-2003). Cases (n = 251 ALL) were diagnosed between 1995 and 2000 (age <15 years at diagnosis) and were identified through the Costa Rican Cancer Registry and National Children's Hospital. Population controls (n = 577) were drawn from the National Birth Registry. We fitted unconditional logistic regression models adjusted for child sex, birth year, and socioeconomic status to estimate the exposure-outcome associations and also stratified by child sex. We observed that self-reported maternal insecticide use inside the home in the year before pregnancy, during pregnancy, and while breastfeeding was associated with increased odds of ALL among boys [adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) = 1.63 (95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 1.05-2.53), 1.75 (1.13-2.73), and 1.75 (1.12-2.73), respectively. We also found evidence of exposure-response relationships between more frequent maternal insecticide use inside the home and increased odds of ALL among boys and girls combined. Maternal report of pesticide applications on farms or companies near the home during pregnancy and at any time period were also associated with ALL. Our study in Costa Rica highlights the need for education to minimize pesticide exposures inside and around the home, particularly during pregnancy and breastfeeding.","['Hyland, Carly', 'Gunier, Robert B', 'Metayer, Catherine', 'Bates, Michael N', 'Wesseling, Catharina', 'Mora, Ana M']","['Hyland C', 'Gunier RB', 'Metayer C', 'Bates MN', 'Wesseling C', 'Mora AM']","['Central American Institute for Studies on Toxic Substances (IRET), Universidad Nacional, Heredia, Costa Rica.', ""Center for Environmental Research and Children's Health (CERCH), School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, CA."", ""Center for Environmental Research and Children's Health (CERCH), School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, CA."", 'Division of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, CA.', 'Division of Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, CA.', 'Department of Occupational Medicine, Institute of Environmental Medicine (IMM), Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Central American Institute for Studies on Toxic Substances (IRET), Universidad Nacional, Heredia, Costa Rica.', ""Center for Environmental Research and Children's Health (CERCH), School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, CA.""]","['ORCID: 0000-0002-6840-2351', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2008-9714']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180426,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,['0 (Pesticides)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Costa Rica/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Maternal Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Pesticides/*adverse effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects/chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Social Class']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Costa Rica', '*childhood cancer', '*leukemia', '*pesticides']",2018/04/17 06:00,2019/02/05 06:00,['2018/04/17 06:00'],"['2017/10/12 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/22 00:00 [revised]', '2018/03/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/05 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.31522 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2018 Sep 15;143(6):1295-1304. doi: 10.1002/ijc.31522.

METHODS: A consecutive series of 93 patients with a type II fracture of the odontoid process was retrospectively identified. Data collected included patient demographics, co-morbidities, associated injuries, neurological injury, date of death and cause of death. Mean patient age was 81. Five patients (5%) were treated operatively while the rest were treated in a hard cervical collar. Five patients (5%) had an incomplete cervical cord injury secondary to the fracture. RESULTS: The rate of mortality at 30 days was 10% (9 patients) and at 90 days it was 16% (15 patients). Following multivariate analysis, the factors found to significantly increase the risk of 30-day mortality included increasing age, increasing injury severity score and leukaemia. Following univariate analysis the only factor found to increase the risk of 90-day mortality was advancing age. The commonest causes of death were pneumonia and ischaemic coronary disease. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that this patient cohort is frail and at risk of early mortality. We suggest that their inpatient care be provided in close conjunction with elderly care physicians.","['Sheikh, Hassaan Q', 'Athanassacopoulos, Michael', 'Doshi, Arpan B', 'Breakwell, Lee', 'Cole, Ashley', 'Rex Michael, Antony Louis', 'Chiverton, Neil']","['Sheikh HQ', 'Athanassacopoulos M', 'Doshi AB', 'Breakwell L', 'Cole A', 'Rex Michael AL', 'Chiverton N']","['Sheffield Teaching Hospitals, Trauma and Orthopaedic, Herries Road, Sheffield, S5 7AU, UK.

Patients with MDS are prone to infectious complications, in part due to the presence of severe neutropenia and/or neutrophil dysfunction. However, not all patients with neutropenia become infected, suggesting that other immune cells may compensate in these patients. Monocytes are also integral to immunologic defense; however, much less is known about monocyte function in patients with MDS. In the current study, we monitor the composition of peripheral blood monocytes and several aspects of monocyte function in MDS patients, including HLA-DR expression, LPS-induced inflammatory cytokine production, and phagocytosis. We find that monocytes from MDS patients exhibit relatively normal innate immune functions compared to monocytes from healthy control subjects. We also find that HLA-DR expression is moderately increased in monocytes from MDS patients. These results suggest that monocytes could compensate for other immune deficits in MDS patients to help fight infection. We also find that the range of immune functions in monocytes from MDS patients correlates with several key clinical parameters, including blast cell count, monocyte count, and revised International Prognostic Scoring System score, suggesting that disease severity impacts monocyte function in MDS patients.","['Pollyea, Daniel A', 'Hedin, Brenna R', ""O'Connor, Brian P"", 'Alper, Scott']","['Pollyea DA', 'Hedin BR', ""O'Connor BP"", 'Alper S']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, Colorado, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Research, National Jewish Health, Denver, Colorado, USA.', 'Center for Genes, Environment and Health, National Jewish Health, Denver, Colorado, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Research, National Jewish Health, Denver, Colorado, USA.', 'Center for Genes, Environment and Health, National Jewish Health, Denver, Colorado, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, National Jewish Health, Denver, Colorado, USA.', 'Department of Immunology and Microbiology, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, Colorado, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Research, National Jewish Health, Denver, Colorado, USA.', 'Center for Genes, Environment and Health, National Jewish Health, Denver, Colorado, USA.', 'Department of Immunology and Microbiology, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, Colorado, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180414,United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,['0 (HLA-DR Antigens)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'HLA-DR Antigens/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/*immunology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*immunology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*LPS', '*PBMC', '*human leukocyte antigen-antigen D related', '*myelodysplastic syndrome', '*phagocytosis']",2018/04/16 06:00,2019/05/09 06:00,['2018/04/16 06:00'],"['2017/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2018/02/14 00:00 [revised]', '2018/03/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/09 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/JLB.5AB1017-419RR [doi]'],ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2018 Sep;104(3):641-647. doi: 10.1002/JLB.5AB1017-419RR.

This study was conducted to explore the influence of Treponema pallidum (T. pallidum) treatment on macrophage polarization and the Akt-mTOR-NFkappaB signaling pathway mechanism involved in this process. M0 macrophages derived from the phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate-induced human acute monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 were cultured with T. pallidum. T. pallidum induced inflammatory cytokine (IL-1beta and TNF-alpha) expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner. However IL-10 cytokine expression decreased at the mRNA and protein levels. Additionally, the expression of the M1 surface marker iNOS was up-regulated with incubation time, and the expression of the M2 surface marker CD206 was low (vs. PBS treated macrophages, P<0.001) and did not fluctuate over 12h. Further studies revealed that Akt-mTOR-NFkappaB pathway proteins, including p-Akt, p-mTOR, p-S6, p-p65, and p-IkappaBalpha, were significantly higher in the T. pallidum-treated macrophages than in the PBS-treated macrophages (P<0.05). In addition, inflammatory cytokine expression was suppressed in T. pallidum-induced M1 macrophages pretreated with LY294002 (an Akt-specific inhibitor) or PDTC (an NF-kappaB inhibitor), while inflammatory cytokine levels increased in T. pallidum-induced M1 macrophages pretreated with rapamycin (an mTOR inhibitor).

Little is known of HEV infection among cancer patients in China. This study provides new epidemiological data for the prevalence of HEV co-infection in cancer patients, indicating that HEV infection is common in this group. METHODS: A total of 950 cancer patients and 950 control volunteers from Shandong Province, eastern China, were recruited to participate in this investigation. Blood samples from patients and controls were examined for anti-HEV IgG and IgM antibodies using ELISAs. RESULTS: The overall seroprevalence of IgG and IgM antibodies to HEV was significantly higher in cancer patients (247/950, 26.0%) than in controls (123/950, 13.0%) (p<0.001). In cancer patients, 22.7% of serum samples were anti-HEV IgG-positive, and in control subjects, 11.0% were anti-HEV IgG-positive (p<0.001). For IgM antibodies, seroprevalence was 4.2% in cancer patients (n=40) and 2.1% in controls (n=20) (p=0.009). The seroprevalence of HEV was higher in cancer patients who had dogs in their home (31.7%) when compared to other cancer patients. The highest seroprevalence of HEV infection was found in leukemia patients (32.3%), followed by liver cancer patients (31.1%); the lowest HEV seroprevalence was detected in patients with gastric cancer (18.9%). CONCLUSIONS: This investigation revealed that the seroprevalence of HEV was significantly higher in cancer patients than in controls in eastern China. Therefore, cancer patients are a high-risk population and should be kept away from sources of HEV infection.","['Bai, Meng-Jie', 'Zhou, Na', 'Dong, Wei', 'Li, Guang-Xing', 'Cong, Wei', 'Zhu, Xing-Quan']","['Bai MJ', 'Zhou N', 'Dong W', 'Li GX', 'Cong W', 'Zhu XQ']","['State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Etiological Biology, Lanzhou Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Lanzhou, Gansu Province, PR China.', 'Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, Qingdao, Shandong Province, PR China.', ""Weihaiwei People's Hospital, Weihai, Shandong Province, PR China."", 'State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Etiological Biology, Lanzhou Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Lanzhou, Gansu Province, PR China; Holistic Integrative Pharmacy Institutes (HIPI), Hangzhou Normal University, Hangzhou, PR China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Etiological Biology, Lanzhou Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Lanzhou, Gansu Province, PR China; Marine College, Shandong University, Weihai, Shandong Province, PR China.

Here, we show that the dual combination of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1)/IGF1 receptor (IGF1/R) and mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK) inhibition using AG1024+U0126 can sensitize apoptosis-resistant ALL cells to ionizing radiation-induced DNA damage irrespective of effect of single pathway inhibition in vitro. This AG1024+U0126 combination also significantly potentiates the ability of the core chemotherapy compounds vincristine, dexamethasone, and daunorubicin to kill ALL cells in vitro. Evidence of the synergistic action of AG1024+U0126 in samples with variable basal levels of phosphorylated IGF1/Rbeta and ERK1/2 suggested additional targets of this drug combination. Consistent with this, gene expression profiling identified 32 ""synergy genes"" differentially targeted by IGF1/R+MEK inhibition and, among these, Signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) and platelet-derived growth factor-associated protein 1 (PDAP1) were the most differentially downregulated cluster. Pearson correlation analysesrevealed that STAT6 and PDAP1 display significant expression codependency and a common expression pattern linked with other key ""synergy"" genes, supporting their predicted role in an STAT6-ERK-nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-kappaB) network. Knockdown studies revealed that loss of STAT6, but not PDAP1, impinges on the cell cycle, causing reduced numbers of viable cells. In combination with daunorubicin, STAT6 loss has an additive effect on cell killing, whereas PDAP1 loss is synergistic, indicating an important role of PDAP1 in the cellular response to this anthracycline. Inhibition of STAT6 or PDAP1 may therefore represent a potential novel therapeutic strategy for resistant ALL by enhancing sensitivity to chemotherapy.","['Weston, Victoria J', 'Wei, Wenbin', 'Stankovic, Tatjana', 'Kearns, Pamela']","['Weston VJ', 'Wei W', 'Stankovic T', 'Kearns P']","['Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK.

Germacrone is a terpenoid compound and has been reported to reverse MDR in breast cancer cells. However, the effect of germacrone on MDR in CML cells was unknown. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of germacrone on MDR in adriamycin resistance of CML cells. Treatment with a combination of germacrone and adriamycin synergistically inhibited the viability and increased LDH release in K562/ADM cells. Adriamycin induced the apoptosis and caspase-3 activity of K562/ADM cells, and the germacrone treatment significantly enhanced the induction. Adriamycin treatment inhibited the expression of Bcl-2 and induced the expression of Bax, and germacrone enhanced the effect of adriamycin. Germacrone decreased adriamycin-induced expression of MDR1 mRNA and P-gp protein. Overexpression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) reversed the effect of germacrone on adriamycin resistance in K562/ADM cells. In conclusion, germacrone reversed adriamycin resistance in human chronic myelogenous leukemia K562/ADM cells by suppressing MDR1 gene/P-gp expression. The results indicated that germacrone might be a new MDR reversal agent for CML chemotherapy.","['Pan, Jia', 'Miao, Dong', 'Chen, Li']","['Pan J', 'Miao D', 'Chen L']","['Department of Hematology, Huaihe Hospital of Henan University, Kaifeng, PR China.

The role of LGALS3 derived from mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) in the AML microenvironment is unclear; however, we have recently found high LGALS3 expression in MSC derived from AML patients is associated with relapse. In this study, we used reverse phase protein analysis (RPPA) to correlate LGALS3 expression in AML MSC with 119 other proteins including variants of these proteins such as phosphorylated forms or cleaved forms to identify biologically relevant pathways. RPPA revealed that LGALS3 protein was positively correlated with expression of thirteen proteins including MYC, phosphorylated beta-Catenin (p-CTNNB1), and AKT2 and negatively correlated with expression of six proteins including integrin beta 3 (ITGB3). String analysis revealed that proteins positively correlated with LGALS3 showed strong interconnectivity. Consistent with the RPPA results, LGALS3 suppression by shRNA in MSC resulted in decreased MYC and AKT expression while ITGB3 was induced. In co-culture, the ability of AML cell to adhere to MSC LGALS3 shRNA transductants was reduced compared to AML cell adhesion to MSC control shRNA transductants. Finally, use of novel specific LGALS3 inhibitor CBP.001 in co-culture of AML cells with MSC reduced viable leukemia cell populations with induced apoptosis and augmented the chemotherapeutic effect of AraC. In summary, the current study demonstrates that MSC-derived LGALS3 may be critical for important biological pathways for MSC homeostasis and for regulating AML cell localization and survival in the leukemia microenvironmental niche.","['Ruvolo, Peter P', 'Ruvolo, Vivian R', 'Burks, Jared K', 'Qiu, YiHua', 'Wang, Rui-Yu', 'Shpall, Elizabeth J', 'Mirandola, Leonardo', 'Hail, Numsen Jr', 'Zeng, Zhihong', 'McQueen, Teresa', 'Daver, Naval', 'Post, Sean M', 'Chiriva-Internati, Maurizio', 'Kornblau, Steven M', 'Andreeff, Michael']","['Ruvolo PP', 'Ruvolo VR', 'Burks JK', 'Qiu Y', 'Wang RY', 'Shpall EJ', 'Mirandola L', 'Hail N Jr', 'Zeng Z', 'McQueen T', 'Daver N', 'Post SM', 'Chiriva-Internati M', 'Kornblau SM', 'Andreeff M']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States; Section of Molecular Hematology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.

Using the ""connectivity"" framework, we compared signatures across cell types and integrated data across assays, including a transcriptional assay (L1000). Consistent connectivity among cell types revealed cellular responses that transcended lineage, and consistent connectivity among assays revealed unexpected associations between drugs.

Tanaka (synonym Tupistra chinensis Baker) (Convallariaceae) (a reputed folk medicine) exhibited potent antiproliferative activity. However, the underlying mechanism of purified saponins remains unclear. More studies are necessary to assess the apoptosis and autophagy activities of the saponins from R. chinensis and clarify their antiproliferative mechanisms. PURPOSE: The present study certificated the potential antiproliferative activity and mechanism of 5beta-spirost-25(27)-en-1beta,3beta-diol-1-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1-->2)- beta-D-xylopyranosyl-3-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranoside (SPD), a spirostanol saponin from R. chinensis, against human acute promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60). METHODS: The antiproliferative activity of SPD in vitro was evaluated by MTT assay compared with cis-dichlorodiammineplatinum (II). The autophagic activity was assessed using MDC staining and western blot, cell apoptosis inspection was detected by Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining and the mitochondrial membrane potential was detected by JC-1 fluorescence dye combined with flow cytometry. The potential mechanisms for protein levels of apoptosis and autophagy were evaluated by western blot. RESULTS: Treatment of HL-60 cells with SPD resulted in growth inhibition (IC50 value of 2.0 +/- 0.2 microM, after 48 h treatment) and induction of apoptosis and autophagy. Results from Annexin V-FITC/PI double-staining assay and mitochondrial membrane potential detection showed that apoptosis was happened after SPD treatment. The regulation of caspase-3, Bax, Bcl-2, PARP following SPD treatment contributed to the induction of mitochondria-dependent apoptosis. Meanwhile, SPD induced autophagy related with Akt/mTOR/p70S6K signaling and activated of AMPK signaling pathway. Furthermore, blocking autophagy with bafilomycin A1 reduced the cytotoxicity of SPD in HL-60 cells. CONCLUSION: The antiproliferative, apoptosis and pro-death autophagy activities of SPD suggested that spirostanol saponins from R. chinensis would be a potential cytotoxic candidate against acute promyelocytic leukemia.","['Yi, Xiaomin', 'Xiang, Limin', 'Huang, Yuying', 'Wang, Yihai', 'He, Xiangjiu']","['Yi X', 'Xiang L', 'Huang Y', 'Wang Y', 'He X']","['School of Pharmacy, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Guangzhou 510006, China; Guangdong Engineering Research Center for Lead Compounds & Drug Discovery, Guangzhou 510006, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Guangzhou 510006, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Guangzhou 510006, China; Guangdong Engineering Research Center for Lead Compounds & Drug Discovery, Guangzhou 510006, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Guangzhou 510006, China; Guangdong Engineering Research Center for Lead Compounds & Drug Discovery, Guangzhou 510006, China.

The aim of the present study was to validate a low-cost quantitative real-time PCR. Interestingly, by using SYBR Green detection dye, we were able to reduce the cost of a single reaction by a factor of 5 compared with most common assays based on the use of fluorogenic probes (i.e., TaqMan technology). This approach allowed a highly sensitive and specific detection and quantification of BLV proviral DNA from purified peripheral blood leukocytes and a milk matrix. Due to its simplicity and low cost, our in-house BLV SYBR quantitative real-time PCR might be used either as a screening or as a confirmatory test in BLV control programs.","['Petersen, M I', 'Alvarez, I', 'Trono, K G', 'Jaworski, J P']","['Petersen MI', 'Alvarez I', 'Trono KG', 'Jaworski JP']","['Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnologicas, Buenos Aires, Argentina, 1425.', 'Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnologicas, Buenos Aires, Argentina, 1425; Instituto Nacional de Tecnologia Agropecuaria, Instituto de Virologia, Buenos Aires, Argentina, 1686.', 'Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnologicas, Buenos Aires, Argentina, 1425; Instituto Nacional de Tecnologia Agropecuaria, Instituto de Virologia, Buenos Aires, Argentina, 1686.', 'Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnologicas, Buenos Aires, Argentina, 1425; Instituto Nacional de Tecnologia Agropecuaria, Instituto de Virologia, Buenos Aires, Argentina, 1686.

Therefore, many researchers are looking for novel substances to overcome drug resistance in cancer. Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) is a superantigen (SAg) and a promising compound which has lethal effects on malignant cells. In this unprecedented study, SEB was used against U937 cells in a co-culture system in the presence of human bone marrow-mesenchymal stem cells (hBM-MSCs). The effects of hBM-MSCs on the proliferation and survival of U937 cell line with SEB was assessed using MTT assay and AnnexinV/PI flowcytometry, respectively. Moreover, the expression of IL-6, IL-10, TGF-beta, and inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase (IKKb) was evaluated by real-time PCR technique. The same experiments were also carried out using hBM-MSCs-conditioned medium (hBM-MSCs-CM). The results showed that SEB reduced the proliferation and survival of U937 cell line, but hBM-MSCs or hBM-MSCs-CM suppressed the effects of SEB. Furthermore, real-timePCR demonstrated that SEB could decrease the expression of IL-6, IL-10, and TGF-beta in hBM-MSCs (P < .05), while the production of IKKb was increased in comparison with the control group. These findings help us to have a broader understanding ofthe usage of SEB in the treatment of haematological malignancies, especially if it is targeted against hBM-MSCs to disrupt their supportive effects on malignant cells.","['Ejtehadifar, Mostafa', 'Halabian, Raheleh', 'Ghazavi, Ali', 'Khansarinejad, Behzad', 'Mosayebi, Ghasem', 'Imani Fooladi, Abbas Ali']","['Ejtehadifar M', 'Halabian R', 'Ghazavi A', 'Khansarinejad B', 'Mosayebi G', 'Imani Fooladi AA']","['Applied Microbiology Research Center, Systems Biology and Poisonings Institute, Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Applied Microbiology Research Center, Systems Biology and Poisonings Institute, Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Traditional and Complementary Medicine Research Center (TCMRC), Arak University of Medical Sciences, Arak, Iran.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, School of Medicine, Arak University of Medical Sciences, Arak, Iran.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, School of Medicine, Arak University of Medical Sciences, Arak, Iran.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, School of Medicine, Arak University of Medical Sciences, Arak, Iran.', 'Molecular and Medicine Research Center, Arak University of Medical Sciences, Arak, Iran.', 'Applied Microbiology Research Center, Systems Biology and Poisonings Institute, Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-7339-8257'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180510,Australia,Clin Exp Pharmacol Physiol,Clinical and experimental pharmacology & physiology,0425076,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Enterotoxins)', '39424-53-8 (enterotoxin B, staphylococcal)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/immunology', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/immunology', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Cytokines/genetics', 'Enterotoxins/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects', 'U937 Cells']",['NOTNLM'],"['*IKKb', '*IL-10', '*IL-6', '*TGF-beta', '*U937 cell', '*mesenchymal stem cell', '*staphylococcal enterotoxin B']",2018/04/15 06:00,2019/11/15 06:00,['2018/04/15 06:00'],"['2017/12/01 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/21 00:00 [revised]', '2018/03/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/15 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/1440-1681.12945 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Pharmacol Physiol. 2018 Aug;45(8):849-858. doi: 10.1111/1440-1681.12945.

More convenient methods are needed for quickly detection of the BCR-ABL fusion genes. Multiplex fluorescent reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR (Multiplex RT-qPCR) methods are developed for detection of the at least 14 subtypes of BCR-ABL fusion genes in one tube at a time by using patients' bone marrow samples. The new Multiplex RT-qPCR method could quickly detect BCR-ABL fusion genes with sensitivity up to 10-10(6) copies. It can detect the fusion genes in patients' bone marrow samples containing any subtypes of the major bcr (M-bcr) e13a2, e14a2, e13a3 and e14a3, the minor bcr (m-bcr) e1a2 and e1a3, the micro bcr (mu-bcr) e19a2 and e19a3, and the nano bcr (n-bcr) e6a2 and e6a3. The specificity is comparable to the FISH methods. The cutoff for clinical diagnosis of BCR-ABL(+) is also determined by testing in clinical chronic myeloid leukemia samples. This is a new fast method with high sensitivity and specificity for clinical detection of BCR-ABL fusion genes.

We show that eight different disordered BH3 proteins all bind to their BCL-2 partner (MCL-1) very rapidly, and that the differences in sequences result in different dissociation rates. Similarly, mutation of the binding surface of MCL-1 generally affects association kinetics in the same way for all BH3 peptides but has significantly different effects on the dissociation rates.

This meta-analysis explores to evaluate the prognostic value of miR-155 for survival in patients with leukemia. METHODS: Eligible studies were searched from PubMed and EMBASE databases. Hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for overall survival (OS), disease-free survival, event-free survival, progression-free survival and treatment-free survival were extracted, if available. Pooled HRs and 95% CIs were used to study any correlation between miR-155 and survival. RESULTS: 11 studies from 10 articles containing 1718 leukemia patients were included. Data showed that the pooled HR for OS was 1.67 (95% CI: 1.44-1.95, P<0.01). Subgroup analyses for OS showed that the pooled HRs and their 95% CIs were 1.68, 1.41-2.00 (P<0.01) and 1.73, 1.25-2.41 (P<0.01) for acute myeloid leukemia and chronic lymphoblastic leukemia, respectively. Furthermore, there was no significant heterogeneity or publication bias among the enrolled datasets. CONCLUSION: We conclude that high miR-155 expression was associated with shorter OS for leukemia patients, and that miR-155 might be a promising prognostic biomarker for this patient population.","['Zhang, Xiaoyu', 'Wang, Yong', 'Guo, Qiang', 'Diao, Yutao', 'Liu, Hongyan', 'Song, Guanhua', 'Wang, Wei', 'Zhang, Zhiyong', 'Yin, Haipeng', 'Li, Lianlian']","['Zhang X', 'Wang Y', 'Guo Q', 'Diao Y', 'Liu H', 'Song G', 'Wang W', 'Zhang Z', 'Yin H', 'Li L']","['Institute of Basic Medicine, Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Jinan 250062, China.', 'Shandong Xinchuang Biotechnology Co., LTD, Jinan 250102, China.', 'Institute of Basic Medicine, Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Jinan 250062, China.', 'Institute of Basic Medicine, Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Jinan 250062, China.', 'Institute of Basic Medicine, Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Jinan 250062, China.', 'Institute of Basic Medicine, Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Jinan 250062, China.', 'Institute of Basic Medicine, Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Jinan 250062, China.', 'Institute of Basic Medicine, Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Jinan 250062, China.', 'Institute of Basic Medicine, Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Jinan 250062, China.', 'Institute of Basic Medicine, Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Jinan 250062, China.

Hematologic malignancy cases (Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), multiple myeloma (MM), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)) were reported to one of 18 SEER registries.

It is a challenging issue to segment leukocytes under uneven imaging conditions since features of microscopic leukocyte images change in different laboratories. Therefore, this paper introduces an automatic robust method to segment leukocyte from blood microscopic images. The proposed robust segmentation technique was designed based on the fact that if background and erythrocytes could be removed from the blood microscopic image, the remainder area will indicate leukocyte candidate regions. A new set of features based on hematologist visual criteria for the recognition of malignant leukocytes in blood samples comprising shape, color, and LBP-based texture features are extracted. Two new ensemble classifiers are proposed for healthy and malignant leukocytes classification which each of them is highly effective in different levels of analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively segments leukocytes from various types of blood microscopic images. The proposed method performs better than other available methods in terms of robustness and accuracy. The final accuracy rate achieved by the proposed method is 98.10% in cell level. To the best of our knowledge, the image level test for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) recognition was performed on the proposed system for the first time that achieves the best accuracy rate of 89.81%.","['Moshavash, Zeinab', 'Danyali, Habibollah', 'Helfroush, Mohammad Sadegh']","['Moshavash Z', 'Danyali H', 'Helfroush MS']","['Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Shiraz University of Technology, P.O.

LncRNA TUG1 expression was detected in bone marrow samples from 186 AML patients and 62 controls. Blank mimic, lncRNA TUG1 mimic, blank inhibitor, and lncRNA TUG1 inhibitor lentivirus vectors were transfected in KG-1 cells. Rescue experiment was performed by transfection of lncRNA TUG1 inhibitor and aurora kinase A (AURKA) mimic lentivirus vectors. Cell proliferation, apoptosis, RNA, and protein expressions were determined by CKK-8, annexin V-FITC-propidium iodide, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and western blot assays. LncRNA TUG1 expression was higher in AML patients compared to controls and correlated with higher white blood cell counts, monosomal karyotype, FLT3-ITD mutation, poor-risk stratification, and poor prognosis, which independently predicted worse event-free survival and overall survival. In vitro, lncRNA TUG1 expression was higher in AML cell lines (KG-1, MOLM-14, HL-60, NB-4, and THP-1 cells) compared to controls. LncRNA TUG1 mimic promoted cell proliferation and decreased cell apoptosis rate, while lncRNA TUG1 inhibitor repressed cell proliferation and increased cell apoptosis rate. Rescue experiment showed that AURKA attenuated the influence of lncRNA TUG1 on AML cell proliferation and apoptosis. In conclusion, lncRNA TUG1 associates with advanced disease and worse prognosis in adult AML patients, and it induces AML cell proliferation and represses cell apoptosis via targeting AURKA.","['Wang, Xinfeng', 'Zhang, Lina', 'Zhao, Fan', 'Xu, Ruirong', 'Jiang, Jie', 'Zhang, Chenglu', 'Liu, Hong', 'Huang, Hongming']","['Wang X', 'Zhang L', 'Zhao F', 'Xu R', 'Jiang J', 'Zhang C', 'Liu H', 'Huang H']","['Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University, 20 Xisi Road, Nantong, 226001, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University, 20 Xisi Road, Nantong, 226001, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University, 20 Xisi Road, Nantong, 226001, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University, 20 Xisi Road, Nantong, 226001, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University, 20 Xisi Road, Nantong, 226001, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University, 20 Xisi Road, Nantong, 226001, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University, 20 Xisi Road, Nantong, 226001, China. hongliu63@outlook.com.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University, 20 Xisi Road, Nantong, 226001, China. huanghongmingc@163.com.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5139-5722'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180413,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (TUG1 long noncoding RNA, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinase A)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Aurora Kinase A/*genetics', '*Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', '*RNA Interference', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['AURKA', 'Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', 'Cell apoptosis', 'Cell proliferation', 'LncRNA TUG1']",2018/04/15 06:00,2018/07/04 06:00,['2018/04/15 06:00'],"['2018/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/04 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-018-3315-8 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-018-3315-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2018 Aug;97(8):1375-1389. doi: 10.1007/s00277-018-3315-8.

Therefore, it is important to understand how antibody-mediated effector functions of myeloma-associated macrophages (MAMs) are regulated. Here, we focused on the effects of vitamin D, a known regulator of macrophage effector functions. Consequently, it was the aim of this study to assess whether modulation of the vitamin D pathway alters the tumoricidal activity of MAMs. Here, we demonstrate that MAMs display a defective vitamin D pathway with reduced expression level of CYP27B1 and limited tumoricidal activity which can be restored by the IMiD lenalidomide in vitro. Furthermore, our data indicate that the vitamin D pathway of MAMs from MM patients does recover during an IMiD-containing therapy shown by an improved MOR202-mediated cytotoxic activity of these MAMs against primary MM cells ex vivo. Here, the ex vivo cytotoxic activity could be further enhanced by vitamin D supplementation. These data suggest that vitamin D holds a key role for the effector functions of MAMs and that vitamin D supplementation in IMiD combination trials could further increase the therapeutic efficacy of anti-CD38 antibodies such as MOR202, which remains to be investigated in clinical studies.","['Busch, Leonhard', 'Mougiakakos, Dimitrios', 'Buttner-Herold, Maike', 'Muller, Miriam J', 'Volmer, Dietrich A', 'Bach, Christian', 'Fabri, Mario', 'Bittenbring, Jorg T', 'Neumann, Frank', 'Boxhammer, Rainer', 'Nolting, Jens', 'Bisht, Savita', 'Bottcher, Martin', 'Jitschin, Simon', 'Hoffmann, Markus H', 'Balzer, Heidi', 'Beier, Fabian', 'Gezer, Deniz', 'Dudziak, Diana', 'Gelse, Kolja', 'Hennig, Friedrich F', 'Pallasch, Christian P', 'Spriewald, Bernd', 'Mackensen, Andreas', 'Bruns, Heiko']","['Busch L', 'Mougiakakos D', 'Buttner-Herold M', 'Muller MJ', 'Volmer DA', 'Bach C', 'Fabri M', 'Bittenbring JT', 'Neumann F', 'Boxhammer R', 'Nolting J', 'Bisht S', 'Bottcher M', 'Jitschin S', 'Hoffmann MH', 'Balzer H', 'Beier F', 'Gezer D', 'Dudziak D', 'Gelse K', 'Hennig FF', 'Pallasch CP', 'Spriewald B', 'Mackensen A', 'Bruns H']","['Department of Internal Medicine 5-Hematology/Oncology, Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nurnberg (FAU), Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 5-Hematology/Oncology, Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nurnberg (FAU), Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Nephropathology, Institute of Pathology, Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nurnberg (FAU), Erlangen, Germany.', 'Institute of Bioanalytical Chemistry, Saarland University, Saarbrucken, Germany.', 'Institute of Bioanalytical Chemistry, Saarland University, Saarbrucken, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 5-Hematology/Oncology, Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nurnberg (FAU), Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik I, Saarland University Medical School, Homburg/Saar, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik I, Saarland University Medical School, Homburg/Saar, Germany.', 'MorphoSys AG, Planegg, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology and Rheumatology, University Hospital Bonn, Bonn, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology and Rheumatology, University Hospital Bonn, Bonn, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 5-Hematology/Oncology, Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nurnberg (FAU), Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 5-Hematology/Oncology, Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nurnberg (FAU), Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 3, Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nurnberg (FAU), Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 5-Hematology/Oncology, Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nurnberg (FAU), Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, RWTH Medical School, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, RWTH Medical School, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology, Laboratory of Dendritic Cell Biology, Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nurnberg (FAU), Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Trauma Surgery, Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nurnberg (FAU), Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Trauma Surgery, Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nurnberg (FAU), Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department I of Internal Medicine, University Hospital of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 5-Hematology/Oncology, Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nurnberg (FAU), Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 5-Hematology/Oncology, Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nurnberg (FAU), Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 5-Hematology/Oncology, Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nurnberg (FAU), Erlangen, Germany. heiko.bruns@uk-erlangen.de.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0685-4483'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180328,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Cytotoxins)', '1406-16-2 (Vitamin D)', 'EC 1.14.15.18 (25-Hydroxyvitamin D3 1-alpha-Hydroxylase)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)', 'F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide)']",IM,"['25-Hydroxyvitamin D3 1-alpha-Hydroxylase/metabolism', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/metabolism', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytotoxins/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Lenalidomide/*pharmacology', 'Macrophages/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Vitamin D/*metabolism']",,,2018/04/15 06:00,2019/06/14 06:00,['2018/04/15 06:00'],"['2017/11/21 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/02/15 00:00 [revised]', '2018/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-018-0114-0 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-018-0114-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2018 Nov;32(11):2445-2458. doi: 10.1038/s41375-018-0114-0.

However, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulated by these factors are largely unknown. Here we established a bioinformatics pipeline and analyzed RNA-seq datasets with deep coverage to identify lncRNAs regulated by TAL1 in T-ALL cells. Our analysis predicted 57 putative lncRNAs that are activated by TAL1. Many of these transcripts were regulated by GATA3, RUNX1, and MYB in a coordinated manner. We identified two novel transcripts that were activated in multiple T-ALL cell samples but were downregulated in normal thymocytes. One transcript near the ARID5B gene locus was specifically expressed in TAL1-positive T-ALL cases. The other transcript located between the FAM49A and MYCN gene locus was also expressed in normal hematopoietic stem cells and T-cell progenitor cells. In addition, we identified a subset of lncRNAs that were negatively regulated by TAL1 and positively regulated by E-proteins in T-ALL cells.

We report an analysis of the whole-genome sequencing of 765 MM patients from CoMMpass. By employing promoter capture Hi-C in naive B-cells, we identify cis-regulatory elements (CREs) that represent a highly enriched subset of the non-coding genome in which to search for driver mutations. We identify regulatory regions whose mutation significantly alters the expression of genes as candidate non-coding drivers, including copy number variation (CNV) at CREs of MYC and single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in a PAX5 enhancer. To better inform the interplay between non-coding driver mutations with other driver mechanisms, and their respective roles in oncogenic pathways, we extended our analysis identifying coding drivers in 40 genes, including 11 novel candidates. We demonstrate the same pathways can be targeted by coding and non-coding mutations; exemplified by IRF4 and PRDM1, along with BCL6 and PAX5, genes that are central to plasma cell differentiation. This study reveals new insights into the complex genetic alterations driving MM development and an enhanced understanding of oncogenic pathways.","['Hoang, Phuc H', 'Dobbins, Sara E', 'Cornish, Alex J', 'Chubb, Daniel', 'Law, Philip J', 'Kaiser, Martin', 'Houlston, Richard S']","['Hoang PH', 'Dobbins SE', 'Cornish AJ', 'Chubb D', 'Law PJ', 'Kaiser M', 'Houlston RS']","['Division of Genetics and Epidemiology, The Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK.', 'Division of Molecular Pathology, The Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK.', 'Division of Genetics and Epidemiology, The Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK.', 'Division of Genetics and Epidemiology, The Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK.', 'Division of Genetics and Epidemiology, The Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK.', 'Division of Genetics and Epidemiology, The Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK.', 'Division of Molecular Pathology, The Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK.', 'Division of Genetics and Epidemiology, The Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK.

Here we analyzed 1421 samples from 958 myeloma patients using a targeted assay and detected fusion genes in 1.5% of patients. These fusion genes were in-frame and the majority of them contained kinase domains from either receptor tyrosine kinases (ALK, ROS1, NTRK3, and FGFR1) or cytoplasmic kinases (BRAF, MAP3K14, and MAPK14), which would result in the activation of MEK/ERK, NF-kappaB, or inflammatory signaling pathways. Fusion genes were present in smoldering MM, newly diagnosed MM, and relapse patient samples indicating they are not solely late events. Most fusion genes were subclonal in nature, but one EML4-ALK fusion was clonal indicating it is a driver of disease pathogenesis. Samples with fusions of receptor tyrosine kinases were not found in conjunction with clonal Ras/Raf mutations indicating a parallel mechanism of MEK/ERK pathway activation. Fusion genes involving MAP3K14 (NIK), which regulates the NF-kappaB pathway, were detected as were t(14;17) rearrangements involving NIK in 2% of MM samples. Activation of kinases in myeloma through rearrangements presents an opportunity to use treatments existing in other cancers.","['Morgan, Gareth J', 'He, Jie', 'Tytarenko, Ruslana', 'Patel, Purvi', 'Stephens, Owen W', 'Zhong, Shan', 'Deshpande, Shayu', 'Bauer, Michael', 'Weinhold, Niels', 'Schinke, Carolina', 'Rasche, Leo', 'Bailey, Mark', 'Ali, Siraj', 'Ross, Jeff', 'Miller, Vincent A', 'Stephens, Phillip', 'Thanendrarajan, Sharmilan', 'Zangari, Maurizio', 'van Rhee, Frits', 'Mughal, Tariq', 'Davies, Faith E', 'Walker, Brian A']","['Morgan GJ', 'He J', 'Tytarenko R', 'Patel P', 'Stephens OW', 'Zhong S', 'Deshpande S', 'Bauer M', 'Weinhold N', 'Schinke C', 'Rasche L', 'Bailey M', 'Ali S', 'Ross J', 'Miller VA', 'Stephens P', 'Thanendrarajan S', 'Zangari M', 'van Rhee F', 'Mughal T', 'Davies FE', 'Walker BA']","['The Myeloma Institute, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR, USA.', 'Foundation Medicine Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'The Myeloma Institute, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR, USA.', 'The Myeloma Institute, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR, USA.', 'The Myeloma Institute, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR, USA.', 'Foundation Medicine Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'The Myeloma Institute, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR, USA.', 'The Myeloma Institute, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR, USA.', 'The Myeloma Institute, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR, USA.', 'The Myeloma Institute, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR, USA.', 'The Myeloma Institute, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR, USA.', 'Foundation Medicine Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Foundation Medicine Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Foundation Medicine Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Albany Medical College, Albany, NY, USA.', 'Foundation Medicine Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Foundation Medicine Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'The Myeloma Institute, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR, USA.', 'The Myeloma Institute, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR, USA.', 'The Myeloma Institute, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR, USA.', 'Foundation Medicine Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Tufts University Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA.', 'The Myeloma Institute, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR, USA.', 'The Myeloma Institute, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR, USA.

In the current study, we considered the feasibility of a genetically inspired prognostic scoring system (GIPSS) that is exclusively based on genetic markers. Among 641 cytogenetically annotated patients with PMF and informative for previously recognized adverse mutations, multivariable analysis identified ""VHR"" karyotype, ""unfavorable"" karyotype, absence of type 1/like CALR mutation and presence of ASXL1, SRSF2, or U2AF1Q157 mutation, as inter-independent predictors of inferior survival; the respective HRs (95% CI) were 3.1 (2.1-4.3), 2.1 (1.6-2.7), 2.1 (1.6-2.9), 1.8 (1.5-2.3), 2.4 (1.9-3.2), and 2.4 (1.7-3.3). Based on HR-weighted risk points, a four-tiered GIPSS model was devised: low (zero points; n = 58), intermediate-1 (1 point; n = 260), intermediate-2 (2 points; n = 192), and high (>/=3 points; n = 131); the respective median (5-year) survivals were 26.4 (94%), 8.0 (73%), 4.2 (40%), and 2 (14%) years; the model was internally validated by bootstrapping and its predictive accuracy was shown to be comparable to that of MIPSS70-plus. GIPPS offers a low-complexity prognostic tool for PMF that is solely dependent on genetic risk factors and, thus, forward-looking in its essence.","['Tefferi, Ayalew', 'Guglielmelli, Paola', 'Nicolosi, Maura', 'Mannelli, Francesco', 'Mudireddy, Mythri', 'Bartalucci, Niccolo', 'Finke, Christy M', 'Lasho, Terra L', 'Hanson, Curtis A', 'Ketterling, Rhett P', 'Begna, Kebede H', 'Naseema Gangat', 'Pardanani, Animesh', 'Vannucchi, Alessandro M']","['Tefferi A', 'Guglielmelli P', 'Nicolosi M', 'Mannelli F', 'Mudireddy M', 'Bartalucci N', 'Finke CM', 'Lasho TL', 'Hanson CA', 'Ketterling RP', 'Begna KH', 'Naseema Gangat', 'Pardanani A', 'Vannucchi AM']","['Divisions of Hematology, Departments of Internal Medicine and Laboratory Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA. tefferi.ayalew@mayo.edu.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, CRIMM, Center Research and Innovation of Myeloproliferative Neoplasms, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Careggi, University of Florence, Florence, Italy.', 'Divisions of Hematology, Departments of Internal Medicine and Laboratory Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, CRIMM, Center Research and Innovation of Myeloproliferative Neoplasms, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Careggi, University of Florence, Florence, Italy.', 'Divisions of Hematology, Departments of Internal Medicine and Laboratory Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, CRIMM, Center Research and Innovation of Myeloproliferative Neoplasms, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Careggi, University of Florence, Florence, Italy.', 'Divisions of Hematology, Departments of Internal Medicine and Laboratory Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Divisions of Hematology, Departments of Internal Medicine and Laboratory Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Divisions of Hematopathology, Departments of Internal Medicine and Laboratory Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Divisions of Laboratory Genetics and Genomics, Departments of Internal Medicine and Laboratory Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Divisions of Hematology, Departments of Internal Medicine and Laboratory Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Divisions of Hematology, Departments of Internal Medicine and Laboratory Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Divisions of Hematology, Departments of Internal Medicine and Laboratory Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, CRIMM, Center Research and Innovation of Myeloproliferative Neoplasms, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Careggi, University of Florence, Florence, Italy.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1809-284X'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180323,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Epistasis, Genetic', 'Female', '*Genetic Association Studies', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*diagnosis/*genetics/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis']",,,2018/04/15 06:00,2019/04/17 06:00,['2018/04/15 06:00'],"['2018/01/25 00:00 [received]', '2018/02/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/02/15 00:00 [revised]', '2018/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/17 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-018-0107-z [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-018-0107-z [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2018 Jul;32(7):1631-1642. doi: 10.1038/s41375-018-0107-z.

Third-generation, self-inactivating lentiviral vectors have recently been used in multiple clinical trials to introduce genes into hematopoietic stem cells to correct primary immunodeficiencies and hemoglobinopathies. These vectors have also been used to introduce genes into mature T cells to generate immunity to cancer through the delivery of chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) or cloned T-cell receptors. CAR T-cell therapies engineered using lentiviral vectors have demonstrated noteworthy clinical success in patients with B-cell malignancies leading to regulatory approval of the first genetically engineered cellular therapy using lentiviral vectors.

However, RTK inhibitors have limited clinical efficacy as single agents, indicating that AML is driven by concomitant activation of different signaling molecules. We used a functional genomic approach to identify RET, encoding an RTK, as an essential gene in multiple subtypes of AML, and observed that AML cells show activation of RET signaling via ARTN/GFRA3 and NRTN/GFRA2 ligand/co-receptor complexes. Interrogation of downstream pathways identified mTORC1-mediated suppression of autophagy and subsequent stabilization of leukemogenic drivers such as mutant FLT3 as important RET effectors. Accordingly, genetic or pharmacologic RET inhibition impaired the growth of FLT3-dependent AML cell lines and was accompanied by upregulation of autophagy and FLT3 depletion. RET dependence was also evident in mouse models of AML and primary AML patient samples, and transcriptome and immunohistochemistry analyses identified elevated RET mRNA levels and co-expression of RET and FLT3 proteins in a substantial proportion of AML patients. Our results indicate that RET-mTORC1 signaling promotes AML through autophagy suppression, suggesting that targeting RET or, more broadly, depletion of leukemogenic drivers via autophagy induction provides a therapeutic opportunity in a relevant subset of AML patients.","['Rudat, S', 'Pfaus, A', 'Cheng, Y Y', 'Holtmann, J', 'Ellegast, J M', 'Buhler, C', 'Marcantonio, D Di', 'Martinez, E', 'Gollner, S', 'Wickenhauser, C', 'Muller-Tidow, C', 'Lutz, C', 'Bullinger, L', 'Milsom, M D', 'Sykes, S M', 'Frohling, S', 'Scholl, C']","['Rudat S', 'Pfaus A', 'Cheng YY', 'Holtmann J', 'Ellegast JM', 'Buhler C', 'Marcantonio DD', 'Martinez E', 'Gollner S', 'Wickenhauser C', 'Muller-Tidow C', 'Lutz C', 'Bullinger L', 'Milsom MD', 'Sykes SM', 'Frohling S', 'Scholl C']","['Division of Translational Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT) Heidelberg and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Faculty of Biosciences, Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Translational Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT) Heidelberg and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Translational Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT) Heidelberg and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Faculty of Biosciences, Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Translational Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT) Heidelberg and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA."", 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany.', 'Blood Cell Development and Function Program, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Blood Cell Development and Function Program, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine IV, University Hospital of Halle, Halle (Saale), Germany.', 'Department of Pathology, University Hospital of Halle, Halle (Saale), Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine IV, University Hospital of Halle, Halle (Saale), Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany.', 'Experimental Hematology Group, Heidelberg Institute for Stem Cell Technology and Experimental Medicine and DKFZ, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Blood Cell Development and Function Program, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Division of Translational Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT) Heidelberg and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany. stefan.froehling@nct-heidelberg.de.', 'German Cancer Consortium, Heidelberg, Germany. stefan.froehling@nct-heidelberg.de.', 'Section for Personalized Oncology, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany. stefan.froehling@nct-heidelberg.de.', 'German Cancer Consortium, Heidelberg, Germany. claudia.scholl@nct-heidelberg.de.', 'Division of Applied Functional Genomics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) and National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT) Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany. claudia.scholl@nct-heidelberg.de.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180322,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor Receptors)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (RET protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Autophagy/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor Receptors/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry/methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Transcriptome/genetics', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",,,2018/04/15 06:00,2019/06/14 06:00,['2018/04/15 06:00'],"['2017/10/16 00:00 [received]', '2018/02/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/20 00:00 [revised]', '2018/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-018-0102-4 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-018-0102-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2018 Oct;32(10):2189-2202. doi: 10.1038/s41375-018-0102-4.

In this study, we sought to answer these questions by utilizing the National Cancer Database plasmacytoma data from 2000 to 2011. A total of 5056 patients were included in the study (median age 62 years; range 52-72). To obtain a pure plasmacytoma cohort, potential multiple myeloma patients were excluded from the study (bone marrow involvement, systemic chemotherapy use). P-bone constituted 70% of the patients. The median overall survival (OS) of P-EM was significantly longer than P-bone (132 vs. 85 months), and for soft/connective tissue it was worse than remainder of P-EM (82 vs. 148 months). On multivariable analysis, factors associated with worse OS included older age (>/=65), presence of P-bone, and treatment with a radiation dose <40 Gy.","['Goyal, Gaurav', 'Bartley, Adam C', 'Funni, Shealeigh', 'Inselman, Jonathan', 'Shah, Nilay D', 'Marshall, Ariela L', 'Ashrani, Aneel A', 'Kapoor, Prashant', 'Durani, Urshila', 'Hashmi, Shahrukh K', 'Siddiqui, Mustaqeem A', 'Buadi, Francis K', 'Go, Ronald S', 'Kyle, Robert A', 'Kumar, Shaji', 'Gonsalves, Wilson I']","['Goyal G', 'Bartley AC', 'Funni S', 'Inselman J', 'Shah ND', 'Marshall AL', 'Ashrani AA', 'Kapoor P', 'Durani U', 'Hashmi SK', 'Siddiqui MA', 'Buadi FK', 'Go RS', 'Kyle RA', 'Kumar S', 'Gonsalves WI']","['Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA. goyal.gaurav@mayo.edu.', 'Division of Biomedical Statistics and Informatics, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Health Care Policy and Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Health Care Policy and Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Health Care Policy and Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6148-5177', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1860-2424', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8284-3495', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5392-9284']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180321,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Aged', 'Datasets as Topic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Plasmacytoma/mortality/*radiotherapy', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,2018/04/15 06:00,2019/04/02 06:00,['2018/04/15 06:00'],"['2017/12/04 00:00 [received]', '2018/02/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/26 00:00 [revised]', '2018/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/02 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-018-0099-8 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-018-0099-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2018 Jun;32(6):1414-1420. doi: 10.1038/s41375-018-0099-8.

Recently, Hedgehog pathway mutations have been described in T-ALL, but whether mutational activation of Hedgehog signaling drives T-cell transformation is unknown, hindering the rationale for therapeutic intervention. Here, we show that Hedgehog pathway mutations predict chemotherapy resistance in human T-ALL, and drive oncogenic transformation in a zebrafish model of the disease. We found Hedgehog pathway mutations in 16% of 109 childhood T-ALL cases, most commonly affecting its negative regulator PTCH1. Hedgehog mutations were associated with resistance to induction chemotherapy (P = 0.009). Transduction of wild-type PTCH1 into PTCH1-mutant T-ALL cells induced apoptosis (P = 0.005), a phenotype that was reversed by downstream Hedgehog pathway activation (P = 0.007). Transduction of most mutant PTCH1, SUFU, and GLI alleles into mammalian cells induced aberrant regulation of Hedgehog signaling, indicating that these mutations are pathogenic. Using a CRISPR/Cas9 system for lineage-restricted gene disruption in transgenic zebrafish, we found that ptch1 mutations accelerated the onset of notch1-induced T-ALL (P = 0.0001), and pharmacologic Hedgehog pathway inhibition had therapeutic activity. Thus, Hedgehog-activating mutations are driver oncogenic alterations in high-risk T-ALL, providing a molecular rationale for targeted therapy in this disease.","['Burns, Melissa A', 'Liao, Zi Wei', 'Yamagata, Natsuko', 'Pouliot, Gayle P', 'Stevenson, Kristen E', 'Neuberg, Donna S', 'Thorner, Aaron R', 'Ducar, Matthew', 'Silverman, Emily A', 'Hunger, Stephen P', 'Loh, Mignon L', 'Winter, Stuart S', 'Dunsmore, Kimberly P', 'Wood, Brent', 'Devidas, Meenakshi', 'Harris, Marian H', 'Silverman, Lewis B', 'Sallan, Stephen E', 'Gutierrez, Alejandro']","['Burns MA', 'Liao ZW', 'Yamagata N', 'Pouliot GP', 'Stevenson KE', 'Neuberg DS', 'Thorner AR', 'Ducar M', 'Silverman EA', 'Hunger SP', 'Loh ML', 'Winter SS', 'Dunsmore KP', 'Wood B', 'Devidas M', 'Harris MH', 'Silverman LB', 'Sallan SE', 'Gutierrez A']","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, 02115, USA."", 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, 02215, USA.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, 02115, USA."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, 02115, USA."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, 02115, USA."", 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, 02215, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, 02215, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, 02215, USA.', 'Center for Cancer Genome Discovery, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, 02215, USA.', 'Center for Cancer Genome Discovery, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, 02215, USA.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, 02115, USA."", ""Division of Oncology and the Center for Childhood Cancer Research, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and the Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, 94158, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, Albuquerque, NM, 87131, USA.', ""Division of Oncology, University of Virginia Children's Hospital, Charlottesville, VA, 22903, USA."", 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, 98195, WA, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, 32611, USA.', ""Department of Pathology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, 02115, USA."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, 02115, USA."", 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, 02215, USA.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, 02115, USA."", 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, 02215, USA.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, 02115, USA. alejandro.gutierrez@childrens.harvard.edu."", 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, 02215, USA. alejandro.gutierrez@childrens.harvard.edu.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2566-3145'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180320,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (Hedgehog Proteins)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Animals', 'Carcinogenesis/*genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hedgehog Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Oncogenes/genetics', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/physiology', 'Zebrafish']",,,2018/04/15 06:00,2019/06/14 06:00,['2018/04/15 06:00'],"['2017/08/18 00:00 [received]', '2018/02/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/01/16 00:00 [revised]', '2018/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-018-0097-x [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-018-0097-x [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2018 Oct;32(10):2126-2137. doi: 10.1038/s41375-018-0097-x.

Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at CDKN2A locus were identified to impact on ALL susceptibility via genome wide association studies, and followed by multiple subsequent replication studies at the specific hits. Here, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to re-evaluate the association of both SNPs (rs3731217 and rs3731249) with ALL susceptibility by gathering the data from 24 independent studies, totally containing 7922 cases/21503 controls for rs3731217 and 6295 cases/24191 controls for rs3731249. Both SNPs were significantly associated with ALL risk (odds ratio [OR] = 0.72 and 2.26 respectively), however, exhibit race-specific pattern. In summary, our meta-analysis indicated that two SNPs at CDKN2A locus are associated with ALL susceptibility independently mainly in Caucasians.

Intratumoral heterogeneity poses challenges for cancer treatment, motivating the need for combination therapies. Single-cell technologies are now available to guide effective drug combinations by accounting for intratumoral heterogeneity through the analysis of the signaling perturbations of an individual tumor sample screened by a drug panel. In particular, Mass Cytometry Time-of-Flight (CyTOF) is a high-throughput single-cell technology that enables the simultaneous measurements of multiple ([Formula: see text]40) intracellular and surface markers at the level of single cells for hundreds of thousands of cells in a sample. We developed a computational framework, entitled Drug Nested Effects Models (DRUG-NEM), to analyze CyTOF single-drug perturbation data for the purpose of individualizing drug combinations. DRUG-NEM optimizes drug combinations by choosing the minimum number of drugs that produce the maximal desired intracellular effects based on nested effects modeling. We demonstrate the performance of DRUG-NEM using single-cell drug perturbation data from tumor cell lines and primary leukemia samples.","['Anchang, Benedict', 'Davis, Kara L', 'Fienberg, Harris G', 'Williamson, Brian D', 'Bendall, Sean C', 'Karacosta, Loukia G', 'Tibshirani, Robert', 'Nolan, Garry P', 'Plevritis, Sylvia K']","['Anchang B', 'Davis KL', 'Fienberg HG', 'Williamson BD', 'Bendall SC', 'Karacosta LG', 'Tibshirani R', 'Nolan GP', 'Plevritis SK']","['Department of Radiology, Center for Cancer Systems Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305.', 'Department of Radiology, Center for Cancer Systems Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305.', 'Department of Radiology, Center for Cancer Systems Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305.', 'Department of Biomedical Data Science, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305.', 'Department of Statistics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305.', 'Department of Radiology, Center for Cancer Systems Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305; sylvia.plevritis@stanford.edu.', 'Department of Biomedical Data Science, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-7024-548X'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20180413,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', '*Computer Simulation', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*combination therapy', '*intratumor heterogeneity', '*leukemia', '*nested effects models', '*single-cell analysis']",2018/04/15 06:00,2018/08/16 06:00,['2018/04/15 06:00'],"['2018/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/16 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['1711365115 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1711365115 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2018 May 1;115(18):E4294-E4303. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1711365115.

The evaluation of minimal residual disease currently represents the most important prognostic indicator, which drives treatment algorithms, which include allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) allocation. Indeed, for high-risk patients, allo-SCT should be pursued as soon as possible, whereas in standard-risk patients this procedure should be avoided also in light of related toxicity and because there are no significant benefits. Furthermore, better characterization of the molecular genetic events can drive therapeutic decisions: a historical example in this respect is represented by the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL; in the upcoming future, TKIs might be used also in other subgroups, such as breakpoint cluster region/Abelson 1-like cases and others with deregulated tyrosine kinases. Finally, the greatest progress is currently achieved with new immunotherapies targeting frequently expressed surface antigens in ALL. It is also a new chance for elderly ALL patients, so far spared from intensive chemotherapy and allo-SCT. These targeted therapies will substantially change this treatment algorithm and the great challenge is to find optimal sequence of the extended therapy options in an individual patient.","['Chiaretti, Sabina', 'Jabbour, Elias', 'Hoelzer, Dieter']","['Chiaretti S', 'Jabbour E', 'Hoelzer D']","['Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, ""Sapienza"" University, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Onkologikum, Frankfurt am Museumsufer, Frankfurt, Germany.

Cancer cells are highly dependent on NAD for energy and DNA repair processes and are assumed to be more susceptible to an inhibition of NAD synthesis than non-transformed cells. We aimed to investigate whether or not inhibition of NAMPT with its specific inhibitor FK866 can sensitize leukemia cells for chemotherapeutic agents. NAMPT protein abundance, enzymatic activity and NAD concentrations were significantly higher in Jurkat and Molt-4 leukemia cell lines compared to normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Combination of etoposide and FK866 caused increased cell death in leukemia cell lines compared to etoposide alone. Etoposide decreased protein abundance of NAD-dependent deacetylases SIRTUIN1. After combining etoposide and FK866 treatment SIRTUIN2 was further decreased and accumulation and acetylation of the downstream target p53 was further enhanced in MOLT4 cells. Concomitantly, protein abundance of p21 and cleaved BAX was increased. Targeting NAMPT could be a novel therapeutic strategy to enhance the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents such as etoposide against leukemia.","['Grohmann, Theresa', 'Penke, Melanie', 'Petzold-Quinque, Stefanie', 'Schuster, Susanne', 'Richter, Sandy', 'Kiess, Wieland', 'Garten, Antje']","['Grohmann T', 'Penke M', 'Petzold-Quinque S', 'Schuster S', 'Richter S', 'Kiess W', 'Garten A']","['Hospital for Children & Adolescents, Center for Pediatric Research Leipzig, University of Leipzig, Germany.', 'Hospital for Children & Adolescents, Center for Pediatric Research Leipzig, University of Leipzig, Germany.', 'Hospital for Children & Adolescents, Center for Pediatric Research Leipzig, University of Leipzig, Germany.', 'Hospital for Children & Adolescents, Center for Pediatric Research Leipzig, University of Leipzig, Germany.', 'Hospital for Children & Adolescents, Center for Pediatric Research Leipzig, University of Leipzig, Germany.', 'Hospital for Children & Adolescents, Center for Pediatric Research Leipzig, University of Leipzig, Germany.', 'Hospital for Children & Adolescents, Center for Pediatric Research Leipzig, University of Leipzig, Germany; University of Birmingham, Institute of Metabolism and Systems Research (IMSR), Birmingham, UK.

This article reports the clinical presentation, serodiagnosis, pathology, and outcomes seen at the authors' institution. METHODS: The cases of patients with proven vascular pythiosis at Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand from January 2006 to December 2016 were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: Thirteen patients were analyzed, eight of whom had underlying thalassemias. Of the remaining five patients, one had aplastic anemia, one had myelodysplasia, one had acute leukemia, one had cirrhosis, and one had alcoholism. Neutropenic patients showed a rapid clinical deterioration. Atypical presentations including carotid arteritis, aneurysm, brain abscess, and stroke occurred in the non-thalassemic patients. Serology yielded positive results in all cases, with a rapid turnaround time. Serology has the advantage of providing a presurgical diagnosis, which allows prompt surgery and clinical cure to be achieved. Pathology revealed a neutrophilic response in the acute phase and a later shift to granuloma. Immunotherapy in combination with itraconazole and terbinafine was given. The amputation rate was 77%, and disease-free surgical margins were achieved in five cases (38%). The mortality rate was 31%. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights new aspects of pythiosis, such as the unusual host, clinical presentation, serology as a marker for rapid diagnosis, histopathology, and outcomes. Early recognition of the disease with prompt multimodality treatment may improve survival.","['Chitasombat, Maria Nina', 'Larbcharoensub, Noppadol', 'Chindamporn, Ariya', 'Krajaejun, Theerapong']","['Chitasombat MN', 'Larbcharoensub N', 'Chindamporn A', 'Krajaejun T']","['Division of Infectious Disease, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, 270 Rama VI Road, Ratchathewi, Bangkok 10400, Thailand.

METHODS: A MICM method (bone marrow morphology(M), immunophenotype(I), cytogenetics(C), and molecular biology(M)) was used for the diagnosis and classification of the disease at the time of onset and transformation. RESULTS: The patient was initially identified with typical morphology and immunophenotype of APL. She has carried t(15;17)(q22;q21) and PML-RARalpha fusion gene but was without t(11;17)(q23;q21) or MLL gene abnormalities. After 13 months of successful treatment, she has transformed to AML with typical morphology and immunophenotype. t(11;17)(q23;q21) and MLL-AF17q fusion gene were detected in her bone marrow sample, while no PLZF-RARalpha fusion gene was detected by real-time quantitative reverse-transcription PCR(RQ-PCR) and fluorescence in situ hybridization(FISH). CONCLUSION: t-AML is a serious complication after successful treatment of APL. t(11;17)(q23;q21) is not specific for the diagnosis of variant APL and can also be detected in t-AML.

Method A retrospective analysis in children who received PSC from January 2012 to October 2016, in the Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplant units at Hospital Calvo Mackenna was done Six patients with 78 DLs were reviewed (4 prophylaxis and 4 treatment). Median PSC dose was 12.5 and 18.8 mg/kg/d for prophylaxis and treatment, resulting in mean DLs of 0.97 and 1.8 mug/mL respectively. In prophylaxis 40/67 (60%) were recorded with DLs >/= 0.70 mug/mL receiving a median dose of 12.5 mg/kg/d. While for treatment: 5/11 (46%) presented DLs >/= 1.25 mug/mL, receiving a median dose of 18 mg/kg/d. Conclusion Our results are in line with the recommended for PSC dosage, but individualized monitoring is required to maintain adequate DLs.","['Valenzuela, Romina', 'Garcia, Patricio', 'Barraza, Marlon', 'Palma, Julia', 'Catalan, Paula', 'Santolaya, M Elena', 'Torres, J Pablo', 'Morales, Jorge']","['Valenzuela R', 'Garcia P', 'Barraza M', 'Palma J', 'Catalan P', 'Santolaya ME', 'Torres JP', 'Morales J']","['Departamento de Pediatria y Cirugia Infantil Oriente, Unidad de Investigacion, Facultad de Medicina, Hospital Dr. Luis Calvo Mackenna, Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile.', 'Unidad de Farmacia, Hospital Dr. Luis Calvo Mackenna, Santiago, Chile.', 'Unidad de Farmacia, Hospital Dr. Luis Calvo Mackenna, Santiago, Chile.', 'Unidad de Trasplante de Medula Osea, Hospital Dr. Luis Calvo Mackenna, Santiago, Chile.', 'Unidad de Trasplante de Medula Osea, Hospital Dr. Luis Calvo Mackenna, Santiago, Chile.', 'Departamento de Pediatria y Cirugia Infantil Oriente, Unidad de Investigacion, Facultad de Medicina, Hospital Dr. Luis Calvo Mackenna, Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile.', 'Departamento de Pediatria y Cirugia Infantil Oriente, Unidad de Investigacion, Facultad de Medicina, Hospital Dr. Luis Calvo Mackenna, Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile.', 'Unidad de Farmacia, Hospital Dr. Luis Calvo Mackenna, Santiago, Chile.']",,['spa'],['Journal Article'],,Chile,Rev Chilena Infectol,Revista chilena de infectologia : organo oficial de la Sociedad Chilena de Infectologia,9305754,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Triazoles)', '6TK1G07BHZ (posaconazole)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antifungal Agents/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Female', 'Hospitals, Pediatric', 'Humans', 'Immunocompetence/*drug effects', 'Immunocompromised Host/drug effects', 'Invasive Fungal Infections/*drug therapy/*prevention & control', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Triazoles/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics']",,,2018/04/14 06:00,2018/05/18 06:00,['2018/04/14 06:00'],"['2017/08/21 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S0716-10182018000100015 [pii]', '10.4067/s0716-10182018000100015 [doi]']",ppublish,Rev Chilena Infectol. 2018;35(1):15-21. doi: 10.4067/s0716-10182018000100015.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Farmacocinetica de posaconazol en la profilaxis y tratamiento de la infeccion fungica invasora en ninos inmunocomprometidos en un hospital pediatrico.,,,

The association between MG and lymphoid neoplasia seems to be less frequent. To analyze this association we reviewed the MG patients in the Department of Neurology, Hospital Salvador of Santiago, Chile. During a three-year period we identified four patients who developed different lymphoproliferative disorders: two with B-cell lymphoma, one with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and one plasmacytoma with an associated amyloidosis. The MG was generalized but mild, all cases classified as type IIa according to the definition proposed by the MG Foundation of America. The neoplasia appeared two to 36 years after the onset of MG.

We isolated 6 ALV strains from yellow feather broiler breeders in south China from 2014 to 2016. Their full genomes were sequenced, compared, and analyzed with other reference strains of ALV. The complete genomic nucleotide sequences of GD150509, GD160403, GD160607, GDFX0601, and GDFX0602 were 7482 bp in length, whereas GDFX0603 was 7480 bp. They shared 99.7% to 99.8% identity with each other. Homology analysis showed that the gag, pol, long terminal repeats (LTRs), and the transmembrane region (gp37) of the env genes of the 6 viruses were well conserved to endogenous counterpart sequences (>97.8%). However, the gp85 genes displayed high variability with any known chicken ALV strains. Growth kinetics of DF-1 cells infected with the isolated ALV showed viral titers that were lower than those infected with the GD13 (ALV-A), CD08 (ALV-B), and CHN06 (ALV-J) on day 7 post-infection. The infected Specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chickens could produce continuous viremia, atrophy of immune organs, growth retardation and no tumors were observed. These subgroup ALVs are unique and may be common in south China. The results suggested that updating the control and eradication program of exogenous ALV for yellow feather broiler breeders in south China needs to be considered because of the emergence of the new subgroup viruses.","['Zhao, Zijun', 'Rao, Mingzhang', 'Liao, Ming', 'Cao, Weisheng']","['Zhao Z', 'Rao M', 'Liao M', 'Cao W']","['College of Veterinary Medicine, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, China. zzj2017825@163.com.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, China. raomingzh@163.com.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, China. mliao@scau.edu.cn.', 'Key Laboratory of Veterinary Vaccine Innovation of the Ministry of Agriculture, Guangzhou 510642, China. mliao@scau.edu.cn.', 'South China Collaborative Innovation Center for Prevention and Control of Poultry Infectious Diseases and Safety of Poultry Products, Guangzhou 510642, China. mliao@scau.edu.cn.', 'National and Regional Joint Engineering Laboratory for Medicament of Zoonosis Prevention and Control, Guangzhou 510642, China. mliao@scau.edu.cn.', 'Key Laboratory of Zoonosis Prevention and Control of Guangdong Province, Guangzhou 510642, China. mliao@scau.edu.cn.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, China. caoweish@scau.edu.cn.', 'Key Laboratory of Veterinary Vaccine Innovation of the Ministry of Agriculture, Guangzhou 510642, China. caoweish@scau.edu.cn.', 'South China Collaborative Innovation Center for Prevention and Control of Poultry Infectious Diseases and Safety of Poultry Products, Guangzhou 510642, China. caoweish@scau.edu.cn.', 'National and Regional Joint Engineering Laboratory for Medicament of Zoonosis Prevention and Control, Guangzhou 510642, China. caoweish@scau.edu.cn.', 'Key Laboratory of Zoonosis Prevention and Control of Guangdong Province, Guangzhou 510642, China. caoweish@scau.edu.cn.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180413,Switzerland,Viruses,Viruses,101509722,['0 (Viral Proteins)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/pathology/*virology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/classification/*genetics/isolation & purification/*pathogenicity', 'Chickens', 'China', '*Genetic Variation', 'Genome, Viral', '*Phylogeny', '*Recombination, Genetic', 'Sequence Homology', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Viral Proteins/genetics', 'Whole Genome Sequencing']",['NOTNLM'],"['*avian leukosis virus subgroup K', '*complete genome', '*pathogenicity assessment', '*phylogenetic analysis']",2018/04/14 06:00,2018/09/18 06:00,['2018/04/14 06:00'],"['2018/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/07 00:00 [revised]', '2018/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/18 06:00 [medline]']","['v10040194 [pii]', '10.3390/v10040194 [doi]']",epublish,Viruses. 2018 Apr 13;10(4). pii: v10040194. doi: 10.3390/v10040194.,,,,PMC5923488,,,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,

The present study was undertaken to explore the mechanisms that calreticulin (CRT) promoted anti-apoptosis of RA FLS. METHODS: The expression of CRT and anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-XL and Mcl-1 in RA synovium were detected by immunohistochemistry. The expression of Bcl-XL and Mcl-1 in RA FLS by CRT were determined. The phosphorylation of Akt and STAT3 was detected by western blot. The effect of CRT on proliferation of RA FLS was examined by MTT assay. The ability of CRT to inhibit RA FLS apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Increased expressions of CRT, Bcl-XL and Mcl-1 were detected in RA synovium compared with osteoarthritis (OA). Moreover, CRT expression correlated positively with Bcl-XL and Mcl-1 in RA, respectively. In vitro, CRT induced upregulation of Bcl-XL and Mcl-1 protein levels in RA FLS, in dose/time dependent manners. Upregulated expression of Bcl-XL and Mcl-1 induced by CRT were inhibited by PI3K/Akt or STAT3 pathways inhibitors in RA FLS, respectively. The increased phosphorylation levels of Akt and STAT3 were also detected with CRT incubation, in dose/time dependent manners. Additionally, CRT rescued apoptosis of RA FLS mediated by FasL. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that upregulation of Bcl-XL and Mcl-1 expression in RA FLS by CRT were PI3K/Akt and STAT3 signal pathways dependent, and promoted the anti-apoptosis of RA FLS. Therefore, this may represent a therapeutic target for the treatment of RA.","['Jiao, Yachong', 'Ding, Hongmei', 'Huang, Shanshan', 'Liu, Yixin', 'Sun, Xuguo', 'Wei, Wei', 'Ma, Jun', 'Zheng, Fang']","['Jiao Y', 'Ding H', 'Huang S', 'Liu Y', 'Sun X', 'Wei W', 'Ma J', 'Zheng F']","['Department of Clinical Immunology, School of Medical Laboratory, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, The Second Hospital of Tangshan, Tangshan, Hebei, China.', ""Department of Laboratory Medicine, Children's Hospital of Hebei Province, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China."", 'Department of Clinical Immunology, School of Medical Laboratory, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Laboratory science, School of Laboratory Medicine, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Rheumatology, General Hospital, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Health Statistics, College of Public Health, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Clinical Immunology, School of Medical Laboratory, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China. fangzheng@tmu.edu.cn.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180413,Italy,Clin Exp Rheumatol,Clinical and experimental rheumatology,8308521,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (CALR protein, human)', '0 (Calreticulin)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Calreticulin/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fibroblasts/*drug effects/enzymology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Synovial Membrane/*drug effects/enzymology/pathology', 'Synoviocytes/*drug effects/enzymology/pathology', 'Up-Regulation', 'bcl-X Protein/*metabolism']",,,2018/04/14 06:00,2019/01/08 06:00,['2018/04/14 06:00'],"['2017/10/26 00:00 [received]', '2018/02/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/08 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['12378 [pii]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Rheumatol. 2018 Sep-Oct;36(5):841-849.

The 1b subtype comprises the minority of cases, with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 500,000 children. Patients with glycogen storage disease type 1b are often treated with granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) for prolonged periods to improve symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and in the face of severe neutropenia to decrease risk of infection. Long-term G-CSF treatment may result in an increased risk of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) possibly due to increased marrow stress resulting in telomere shortening. To our knowledge, there have been two published cases of AML in GSD type 1b patients following long-term G-CSF exposure. Here, we report two further cases of AML/MDS-related changes in patients GSD type 1b treated with G-CSF. One patient developed AML with complex karyotype after 20 years of G-CSF treatment. The second patient was found to have short telomeres after 10 years of G-CSF exposure, but no evidence of acute leukemia at present. The third patient developed AML/MDS after 25 years of G-CSF use, with short telomeres prior to bone marrow transplant. Together these cases suggest that GSD type 1b patients with prolonged G-CSF exposure may be at an increased risk of MDS/AML states associated with G-CSF-induced shortened telomeres. We recommend that any GSD1b patients with prolonged G-CSF should have routine telomere assessments with monitoring for MDS if telomere shortening is observed, and with particular attention warranted if there is unexplained loss of G-CSF responsiveness.","['Li, Amanda M', 'Thyagu, Santhosh', 'Maze, Dawn', 'Schreiber, Richard', 'Sirrs, Sandra', 'Stockler-Ipsiroglu, Sylvia', 'Sutherland, Heather', 'Vercauteren, Suzanne', 'Schultz, Kirk R']","['Li AM', 'Thyagu S', 'Maze D', 'Schreiber R', 'Sirrs S', 'Stockler-Ipsiroglu S', 'Sutherland H', 'Vercauteren S', 'Schultz KR']","[""a Children's Hospital of Philadelphia , Philadelphia , PA , USA."", 'b Division of Medical Oncology and Hematology , Princess Margaret Cancer Centre , Toronto , ON , Canada.', 'b Division of Medical Oncology and Hematology , Princess Margaret Cancer Centre , Toronto , ON , Canada.', ""c Department of Pediatrics , University of British Columbia, BC Children's Hospital , Vancouver , BC .

However, the efficacy of fetal stem cell transplantation is unrecognizable when the indications are psychomotor retardation and epilepsy. Case Outline: With the exception of neurological psychiatric problems, a boy aged 9.5 years was in good general health before transplantation with allogeneic fetal stem cells. The main aim of allogeneic fetal stem cell transplantation was treatment of psychomotor retardation and epilepsy. After 13 months of treatment, he was admitted to hospital in a very serious, life-threatening condition due to sepsis and severe pleuropneumonia. The humoral immunity in the boy was adequate, unlike cellular immunity. The immune imbalance in terms of predominance of T-suppressor lymphocytes contributes to delayed and late development of sepsis and severe pleuropneumonia. The boy still shows the same severity of psychomotor retardation, dyslalia, epilepsy, strabismus and amblyopia. Conclusion: Implementation of fetal stem cell therapy for unconfirmed indications abuses the therapeutic approach, harms patients, misleads parents, and brings financial harm to the healthcare system of any country, including Serbia.","['Dajic, Katerina', 'Velickovic, Vesna', 'Djurdjevic, Predrag', 'Simovic, Aleksandra M', 'Stojkovic, Andjelka K']","['Dajic K', 'Velickovic V', 'Djurdjevic P', 'Simovic AM', 'Stojkovic AK']",,,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Serbia,Srp Arh Celok Lek,Srpski arhiv za celokupno lekarstvo,0027440,,IM,"['Child', 'Epilepsy/therapy', 'Fetal Stem Cells/*transplantation', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Male', 'Pneumonia/etiology', 'Psychomotor Disorders/*therapy', 'Sepsis/etiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects']",,,2016/07/01 00:00,2018/05/09 06:00,['2018/04/14 06:00'],"['2018/04/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/09 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Srp Arh Celok Lek. 2016 Jul-Aug;144(7-8):446-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: A retrospective analysis of patient records at UCH from 1997 to 2015 was carried out in patients aged 0-18 years, in whom the diagnosis of LBL had been established. Twenty-two children were included in the analysis. Results: Mean age at diagnosis was 10 years, with preponderance of male patients.

The absolute concentrations of the components of this regulatory system in hematopoietic cells and the ability of the endogenous IRP to regulate exogenous IRE have been measured. The IRP concentration is in the low muM (10-6 M) range, whereas the most abundant IRE-containing messenger RNA (mRNA), i.e. those of the ferritin subunits, do not exceed 100 nM (10-7 M). Most other IRP mRNA targets are around or below 1 nM. The distribution of the mRNA belonging to the cellular iron network is similar in human leukemic cell lines and in normal cord blood progenitors, with differences among the cellular models only associated with their different propensities to synthesize hemoglobin. Thus, the IRP regulator is in large excess over its presently identified regulated mRNA targets. Yet, despite this excess, endogenous IRP poorly represses translation of transfected luciferase cDNA engineered with a series of IRE sequences in the 5' UTR. The cellular concentrations of the central hubs of the mammalian translational iron network will have to be included in the description of the proliferative phenotype of leukemic cells and in assessing any therapeutic action targeting iron provision.","['Pourcelot, Emmanuel', 'Lenon, Marine', 'Charbonnier, Peggy', 'Louis, Fiona', 'Mossuz, Pascal', 'Moulis, Jean-Marc']","['Pourcelot E', 'Lenon M', 'Charbonnier P', 'Louis F', 'Mossuz P', 'Moulis JM']","['Univ.

In the United States, it was estimated that 21.380 individuals would be diagnosed with AML and 49.5% of patients would die in 2017. Therefore, the search for novel compounds capable of increasing the overall survival rate to the treatment of AML cells is urgent. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the cytotoxicity effect of the natural compound pomolic acid (PA) and to explore the mechanism of action of PA in AML cell lines with different phenotypes. METHODS: Three different AML cell lines, HL60, U937 and Kasumi-1 cells with different mechanisms of resistance were used to analyze the effect of PA on the cell cycle progression, on DNA intercalation and on human DNA topoisomerases (hTopo I and IIalpha) in vitro studies. Theoretical experiments of the inhibition of hTopo I and IIalpha were done to explore the binding modes of PA. RESULTS: PA reduced cell viability, induced cell death, increased sub-G0/G1 accumulation and activated caspases pathway in all cell lines, altered the cell cycle distribution and inhibited the catalytic activity of both human DNA topoisomerases. CONCLUSION: Finally, this study showed that PA has powerful antitumor activity against AML cells, suggesting that this natural compound might be a potent antineoplastic agent to improve the treatment scheme of this neoplasm.","['Pereira, Michelle X G', 'Hammes, Amanda S O', 'Vasconcelos, Flavia C', 'Pozzo, Aline R', 'Pereira, Thais H', 'Caffarena, Ernesto R', 'Gattass, Cerli R', 'Maia, Raquel C']","['Pereira MXG', 'Hammes ASO', 'Vasconcelos FC', 'Pozzo AR', 'Pereira TH', 'Caffarena ER', 'Gattass CR', 'Maia RC']","['Laboratorio de Hemato-Oncologia Celular e Molecular, Programa de Pesquisa em Hemato-Oncologia Molecular, Instituto Nacional de Cancer (INCA), Rio de Janeiro, (RJ), Brazil.', 'Programa de Pos-Graduacao Stricto Sensu em Oncologia, INCA, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Grupo de Biofisica Computacional e Modelagem Molecular, Programa de Computacao Cientifica, FIOCRUZ, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Hemato-Oncologia Celular e Molecular, Programa de Pesquisa em Hemato-Oncologia Molecular, Instituto Nacional de Cancer (INCA), Rio de Janeiro, (RJ), Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Hemato-Oncologia Celular e Molecular, Programa de Pesquisa em Hemato-Oncologia Molecular, Instituto Nacional de Cancer (INCA), Rio de Janeiro, (RJ), Brazil.', 'Programa de Pos-Graduacao Stricto Sensu em Oncologia, INCA, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Hemato-Oncologia Celular e Molecular, Programa de Pesquisa em Hemato-Oncologia Molecular, Instituto Nacional de Cancer (INCA), Rio de Janeiro, (RJ), Brazil.', 'Grupo de Biofisica Computacional e Modelagem Molecular, Programa de Computacao Cientifica, FIOCRUZ, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Imunologia Celular, Instituto de Biofisica Carlos Chagas Filho, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Hemato-Oncologia Celular e Molecular, Programa de Pesquisa em Hemato-Oncologia Molecular, Instituto Nacional de Cancer (INCA), Rio de Janeiro, (RJ), Brazil.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Anticancer Agents Med Chem,Anti-cancer agents in medicinal chemistry,101265649,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Topoisomerase Inhibitors)', '60HAB1ZK1T (pomolic acid)', '6SMK8R7TGJ (Oleanolic Acid)', 'EC 5.99.1.- (DNA Topoisomerases)']",,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Cleavage', 'DNA Topoisomerases/*metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Oleanolic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Topoisomerase Inhibitors/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'U937 Cells']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Topo I', '*Topo IIalpha', '*anticancer agent', '*drug discovery', '*human DNA topoisomerases', '*natural compound', '*pomolic acid.']",2018/04/14 06:00,2019/08/06 06:00,['2018/04/14 06:00'],"['2017/09/12 00:00 [received]', '2018/02/13 00:00 [revised]', '2018/04/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/06 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['ACAMC-EPUB-89671 [pii]', '10.2174/1871520618666180412120128 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Agents Med Chem. 2018;18(10):1457-1468. doi: 10.2174/1871520618666180412120128.,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The covalent linkages between DNA and protein are induced by chemical reactions catalyzed by the endogenous metabolic intermediates and exogenous agents, such as aldehydes, chemotherapeutic agents, and ionizing radiation. Formaldehyde has been classified as a genotoxic carcinogen. In addition, endogenous formaldehyde-induced DPCs may increase the risks of bone marrow toxicity and leukemia. There is a need to develop an effective detection method for DPC analysis, including the structural differentiation of endogenous and exogenous formaldehyde-induced DPCs. To this end, our group previously reported a useful liquid chromatography-selected reaction monitoring (LC-SRM) approach coupled with stable isotope labeling and low mass resolution-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. In the present work, we further demonstrate an accurate quantification method using a high-resolution, accurate-mass Orbitrap mass spectrometer for the measurement of the covalent linkage between 2'-deoxyguanosine (dG) and cysteine (Cys), specifically termed dG-Me-Cys, one kind of linkages derived from the formaldehyde-induced DPCs. This quantification method with a wide dynamic range of at least 3 orders generates an interference-free spectrum for unbiased and unambiguous quantification, resulting in good intra- and interday precisions and accuracies with less than 10% variations. The endogenous and exogenous amounts of dG-Me-Cys in a human cell line treated with formaldehyde are analyzed by our new methodology. The quantification strategy demonstrated in this study can be widely applied to characterize and quantify other DPC linkages induced by formaldehyde or other chemical agents.","['Liu, Chih-Wei', 'Tian, Xu', 'Hartwell, Hadley J', 'Leng, Jiapeng', 'Chi, Liang', 'Lu, Kun', 'Swenberg, James A']","['Liu CW', 'Tian X', 'Hartwell HJ', 'Leng J', 'Chi L', 'Lu K', 'Swenberg JA']","['Department of Environmental Sciences and Engineering , University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill , Chapel Hill , North Carolina 27599 , United States.', 'Department of Environmental Sciences and Engineering , University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill , Chapel Hill , North Carolina 27599 , United States.', 'Department of Environmental Sciences and Engineering , University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill , Chapel Hill , North Carolina 27599 , United States.', 'Department of Environmental Sciences and Engineering , University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill , Chapel Hill , North Carolina 27599 , United States.', 'Department of Environmental Sciences and Engineering , University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill , Chapel Hill , North Carolina 27599 , United States.', 'Department of Environmental Sciences and Engineering , University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill , Chapel Hill , North Carolina 27599 , United States.', 'Department of Environmental Sciences and Engineering , University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill , Chapel Hill , North Carolina 27599 , United States.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-0823-0252', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8174-5669', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4453-3266', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8125-2394']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180420,United States,Chem Res Toxicol,Chemical research in toxicology,8807448,"['0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Proteins)', '1HG84L3525 (Formaldehyde)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'G9481N71RO (Deoxyguanosine)', 'K848JZ4886 (Cysteine)']",IM,"['Cross-Linking Reagents/*chemistry', 'Cysteine/chemistry', 'DNA/chemistry/*drug effects', 'DNA Damage', 'Deoxyguanosine/chemistry', 'Formaldehyde/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry']",,,2018/04/14 06:00,2019/04/17 06:00,['2018/04/14 06:00'],"['2018/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/17 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.chemrestox.8b00040 [doi]'],ppublish,Chem Res Toxicol. 2018 May 21;31(5):350-357. doi: 10.1021/acs.chemrestox.8b00040.

In the present study, the mitogenic activity of Artocarpus lingnanensis lectin (ALL) and its apoptosis induction in Jurkat T cells were explored. MTT assay revealed strong mitogenic potential of ALL. Meanwhile, the anti-cancer activity of ALL was also explored using the human leukemic Jurkat T cell line. ALL exhibited strong binding affinity (97%) to the cell membrane, which could be effectively inhibited by N-acetyl-D-galactosaminide (NAD). ALL induced time- and dose-dependent growth inhibition in Jurkat T cells. ALL could induce morphologic change and increase the hypodiploid cell population with the decreased population of S and G2/M phases. The induction of phosphatidylserine externalization and PARP cleavage further confirmed its apoptosis-inducing activity due to the activation of caspase-8 and -9. The inhibition of caspase-9 but not caspase-8 could rescue ALL-induced apoptotic cells. Further studies showed that ALL enhanced the cleavage of Bid, the release of cytochrome C, the depolarization of mitochondria and the activation of caspase-3. ALL downregulated the expression of Bcl-xl and Bcl-2 without impact on Bax and Bad. In addition, the activation of p38/JNK MAPK signaling pathways was observed to be a requisite for ALL apoptotic activity. In contrast, ALL could not induce apoptosis of normal T cells. These findings present the differential effect of ALL on Jurkat and normal T lymphocytes, suggesting its therapeutic value in leukemia.","['Zeng, Linjie', 'Li, Lu', 'Zeng, Qiyan', 'Deng, Yong', 'Yin, Lijun', 'Liao, Liejun']","['Zeng L', 'Li L', 'Zeng Q', 'Deng Y', 'Yin L', 'Liao L']","[""Department of Orthopaedics, Chinese and Western, Orthopaedics Hospital of Guigang, Guigang, Guangxi, 537100, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Guangxi Medical University, 22 Shuangyong Road, Nanning, Guangxi, 530021, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Guangxi Medical University, 22 Shuangyong Road, Nanning, Guangxi, 530021, People's Republic of China. zengnn6@hotmail.com."", ""Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Guangxi Medical University, 22 Shuangyong Road, Nanning, Guangxi, 530021, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Guangxi Medical University, 22 Shuangyong Road, Nanning, Guangxi, 530021, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Guangxi Medical University, 22 Shuangyong Road, Nanning, Guangxi, 530021, People's Republic of China.""]",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180412,Japan,J Nat Med,Journal of natural medicines,101518405,"['0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Lectins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Artocarpus/*chemistry', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells/*metabolism', 'Lectins/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Signal Transduction']",['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Glycoprotein', 'Lectin', 'Leukemia', 'Mitogenic activity']",2018/04/14 06:00,2018/06/21 06:00,['2018/04/14 06:00'],"['2018/01/13 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/21 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11418-018-1212-z [doi]', '10.1007/s11418-018-1212-z [pii]']",ppublish,J Nat Med. 2018 Jun;72(3):745-756. doi: 10.1007/s11418-018-1212-z.

However, in some patients, TKI discontinuation leads to anxiety and depression. Here, we analysed the incidence of anxiety and depression in patients who stop TKI therapy. METHODS: Anxiety and depression were evaluated using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) in 32 patients with CML. The survey periods were at TKI discontinuation, at 1, 6, 12, and 24 months and at reintroduction of TKIs. The HADS score at the initial TKI discontinuation was compared between patients within and outside clinical trials. Treatment-free remission (TFR) rates outside clinical trials were evaluated. RESULTS: The HADS scores were significantly higher at TKI reintroduction after molecular relapse than at the initial TKI discontinuation (at the initiation of stopping TKIs vs. at reintroduction of TKIs, 8.47 +/- 5.53 vs. 1.67 +/- 2.26; p = 0.0003). The TFR rate at 12 months after stopping TKIs outside clinical trials was 55.6%. The HADS score at the initial TKI discontinuation did not differ between patients within and outside clinical trials. CONCLUSION: Stopping TKIs outside clinical trials is feasible if the guidelines for stopping are followed and an adequate monitoring system is available. Discontinuation of TKIs requires adequate management of anxiety and depression.","['Sogawa, Rintaro', 'Kimura, Sakiko', 'Yakabe, Ryota', 'Mizokami, Yasuhito', 'Tasaki, Masanobu', 'Sueoka-Aragane, Naoko', 'Narisawa, Yutaka', 'Kimura, Shinya']","['Sogawa R', 'Kimura S', 'Yakabe R', 'Mizokami Y', 'Tasaki M', 'Sueoka-Aragane N', 'Narisawa Y', 'Kimura S']","['Department of Pharmacy, Saga University Hospital, Saga, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Saga University Hospital, Saga, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Saga University Hospital, Saga, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Saga University Hospital, Saga, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Saga University Hospital, Saga, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Saga University Hospital, Saga, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, 5-1-1 Nabeshima, Saga, 849-8501, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Saga University Hospital, Saga, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, 5-1-1 Nabeshima, Saga, 849-8501, Japan. shkimu@cc.saga-u.ac.jp.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180412,Japan,Int J Clin Oncol,International journal of clinical oncology,9616295,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Anxiety Disorders/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Depressive Disorder/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*adverse effects', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Withholding Treatment']",['NOTNLM'],"['ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Discontinuation of treatment', 'The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale']",2018/04/14 06:00,2018/11/09 06:00,['2018/04/14 06:00'],"['2018/01/10 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/09 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10147-018-1275-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s10147-018-1275-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Clin Oncol. 2018 Oct;23(5):974-979. doi: 10.1007/s10147-018-1275-6.

Enhanced Toll-like receptor (TLR) 5 expression and signaling were reported to be associated with acute myeloid leukemia. In the present study, we investigated the possible modulatory effects of Hsp90 inhibitors on TLR5 expression and signaling in the human myeloid leukemia cell line THP-1. Cells were pretreated with various concentrations of the Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin (GA) or the Hsp70 inhibitor VER155008, followed by stimulation with bacterial flagellin. Flagellin-induced nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation was significantly reduced by treatment with GA or VER155008. To elucidate the underlying mechanism of this effect, mRNA and cell surface expression of TLR5 was examined. TLR5 mRNA expression was enhanced by both GA and VER155008, whereas cell surface expression of TLR5 was reduced by three different Hsp90 inhibitors, including GA, 17-(allylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin, and radicicol, and an Hsp70 inhibitor. The inhibitory effect of Hsp90 inhibitors was much higher than that of Hsp70 inhibitor. Our results suggest that Hsp90 inhibitors suppress TLR5 surface expression and activation of NF-kappaB in THP-1 cells in response to TLR5 ligand, and these inhibitory effects may be associated with the possible mechanisms by which Hsp90 inhibitors suppress myeloid leukemia.","['Na, Bon Hyang', 'Hoang, Thi Xoan', 'Kim, Jae Young']","['Na BH', 'Hoang TX', 'Kim JY']","['Department of Life Science, Gachon University, Seongnam, Gyeonggi-do 461-701, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Life Science, Gachon University, Seongnam, Gyeonggi-do 461-701, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Life Science, Gachon University, Seongnam, Gyeonggi-do 461-701, Republic of Korea.']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-0401-5843', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9323-3580']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180214,United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,"['0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Purine Nucleosides)', '0 (TLR5 protein, human)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 5)', '0 (VER 155008)', 'Z3K3VJ16KU (geldanamycin)']",IM,"['Benzoquinones/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Purine Nucleosides/pharmacology', 'THP-1 Cells', 'Toll-Like Receptor 5/*biosynthesis/genetics']",,,2018/04/14 06:00,2018/09/12 06:00,['2018/04/14 06:00'],"['2017/10/02 00:00 [received]', '2018/01/07 00:00 [revised]', '2018/01/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2018/4319369 [doi]'],epublish,Biomed Res Int. 2018 Feb 14;2018:4319369. doi: 10.1155/2018/4319369. eCollection 2018.,,,,PMC5832108,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukemic involvement of the nervous system from CLL causing neurologic symptoms is reported in only about one percent of patients. Unfortunately, there is no current standard therapy for the treatment of CLL leptomeningeal disease. In this case, we discuss an unusual presentation of CLL leptomeningeal disease misdiagnosed as chronic rebound headache. A 61-year-old female was diagnosed with Rai stage I CLL in 2002. She presented at that time with peripheral blood lymphocytosis and subsequent flow cytometry revealed a mature B cell population consistent with CLL. She was monitored clinically as there were no indications for therapy. In 2006, she developed B symptoms along with hemolytic anemia refractory to steroids and was initiated on chemotherapy with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR). She had a complete response after six cycles. The patient was in her usual state of health until 2016, when she complained of chronic headaches. She took acetaminophen and ibuprofen regularly and was diagnosed with rebound headaches by neurology. These symptoms progressed and the patient developed encephalopathy requiring inpatient admission. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed abnormal enhancement in the cerebellar peduncles and dentate nuclei symmetrically; a lumbar puncture performed revealed evidence of CLL consistent with leptomeningeal disease. Therapy was started with oral ibrutinib at 560 mg daily for better central nervous system (CNS) penetration. After three months of therapy, she had complete resolution of symptoms and MRI abnormalities. Leptomeningeal disease is a rare complication of CLL that clinicians should be aware of and ibrutinib can be an effective, tolerable therapy for this debilitating disease.","['Rizvi, Wajeeha', 'Truong, Quoc']","['Rizvi W', 'Truong Q']","['Internal Medicine, University of Kansas School of Medicine - Wichita.', 'Internal Medicine, University of Kansas School of Medicine - Wichita.']",,['eng'],['Case Reports'],20180209,United States,Cureus,Cureus,101596737,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['cancer relapse', 'cll-chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'cns malignancies', 'ibrutinib', 'leptomeningeal disease']",2018/04/14 06:00,2018/04/14 06:01,['2018/04/14 06:00'],"['2018/04/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/14 06:01 [medline]']",['10.7759/cureus.2176 [doi]'],epublish,Cureus. 2018 Feb 9;10(2):e2176. doi: 10.7759/cureus.2176.,,,,PMC5890962,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,

GFI1 deletion causes hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation, for which the molecular mechanism remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that GFI1 is required in T cells for the regulation of key DNA damage signaling and repair proteins. Specifically, GFI1 interacts with the arginine methyltransferase PRMT1 and its substrates MRE11 and 53BP1. We demonstrate that GFI1 enables PRMT1 to bind and methylate MRE11 and 53BP1, which is necessary for their function in the DNA damage response. Thus, our results provide evidence that GFI1 can adopt non-transcriptional roles, mediating the post-translational modification of proteins involved in DNA repair. These findings have direct implications for treatment responses in tumors overexpressing GFI1 and suggest that GFI1's activity may be a therapeutic target in these malignancies.","['Vadnais, Charles', 'Chen, Riyan', 'Fraszczak, Jennifer', 'Yu, Zhenbao', 'Boulais, Jonathan', 'Pinder, Jordan', 'Frank, Daria', 'Khandanpour, Cyrus', 'Hebert, Josee', 'Dellaire, Graham', 'Cote, Jean-Francois', 'Richard, Stephane', 'Orthwein, Alexandre', 'Drobetsky, Elliot', 'Moroy, Tarik']","['Vadnais C', 'Chen R', 'Fraszczak J', 'Yu Z', 'Boulais J', 'Pinder J', 'Frank D', 'Khandanpour C', 'Hebert J', 'Dellaire G', 'Cote JF', 'Richard S', 'Orthwein A', 'Drobetsky E', 'Moroy T']","['Institut de Recherches Cliniques de Montreal, IRCM, Montreal, QC, H2W 1R7, Canada.', 'Institut de Recherches Cliniques de Montreal, IRCM, Montreal, QC, H2W 1R7, Canada.', 'Institut de Recherches Cliniques de Montreal, IRCM, Montreal, QC, H2W 1R7, Canada.', 'Segal Cancer Centre, Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, Jewish General Hospital, Montreal, QC, H3T 1E2, Canada.', 'Institut de Recherches Cliniques de Montreal, IRCM, Montreal, QC, H2W 1R7, Canada.', 'Departments of Pathology and Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, B3H 4R2, Canada.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital, Essen, 45147, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital, Essen, 45147, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, H3T 1J4, QC, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, Montreal, H1T 2M4, QC, Canada.', 'Quebec Leukemia Cell Bank, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, Montreal, H1T 2M4, QC, Canada.', 'Departments of Pathology and Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, B3H 4R2, Canada.', 'Institut de Recherches Cliniques de Montreal, IRCM, Montreal, QC, H2W 1R7, Canada.', 'Departement de Medecine, Universite de Montreal and Centre de Recherche, Hopital Maisonneuve Rosemont, Montreal, QC, H1T 2M4, Canada.', 'Segal Cancer Centre, Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, Jewish General Hospital, Montreal, QC, H3T 1E2, Canada.', 'Deparment of Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, H4A 3J1, QC, Canada.', 'Department of Oncology, McGill University, Montreal, QC, H4A 3T2, Canada.', 'Division of Experimental Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, QC, H3A 1A3, Canada.', 'Segal Cancer Centre, Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, Jewish General Hospital, Montreal, QC, H3T 1E2, Canada.', 'Department of Oncology, McGill University, Montreal, QC, H4A 3T2, Canada.', 'Division of Experimental Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, QC, H3A 1A3, Canada.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, McGill University, Montreal, QC, H3A 2B4, Canada.', 'Departement de Medecine, Universite de Montreal and Centre de Recherche, Hopital Maisonneuve Rosemont, Montreal, QC, H1T 2M4, Canada.', 'Institut de Recherches Cliniques de Montreal, IRCM, Montreal, QC, H2W 1R7, Canada.

Extramedullary involvement by APL has been reported in between 3-5% of cases, mainly associated with cases of relapse. A rare case of relapse of APL in a 9-year-old child is presented with skin involvement with myeloid sarcoma. CASE REPORT A 9-year-old male child was admitted to the Oncology Service of the hospital complaining of fever, progressive fatigue, oral petechiae with severe bleeding in the oral cavity. Bone marrow examination showed some promyelocytes. Flow cytometry showed 86% immature myeloid cells with the t(15;17) translocation, and molecular analysis showed expression of the PML/RARa fusion protein, which confirmed the diagnosis of APL. The patient completed a course of daunorubicin, cytarabine, and AII trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) with complete remission. After six months, the patient was re-admitted to hospital with a violaceous lesion on the scalp, with relapse of APL. Histological and immunohistochemistry of the lesion involving the skin of the scalp showed a myeloid sarcoma invading the dermis. CONCLUSIONS Myeloid sarcoma, also called granulocytic sarcoma, is an extramedullary tumor of immature myeloid cells, which very rarely presents in children with APL. The mechanisms that lead to myeloid sarcoma in children with APL and the possible association with ATRA therapy remain to be investigated.","['Araujo, Nathalia Silva', 'Dos Santos Junior, Claudio Jose', 'Gomes, Vitoria Mikaelly da Silva', 'Calheiros Leite, Luiz Arthur', 'Bomfim, Luana Novaes', 'Gusmao, Amanda Katielly Firmino da Silva', 'Alves, Maria Jordana Rocha Gomes', 'Romao, Cyndi Myrelle da Silva Barros', 'Batinga, Arthur Moacir Costa Sampaio', 'da Silva, Maria Rosa', 'de Sousa Rodrigues, Celio Fernando']","['Araujo NS', 'Dos Santos Junior CJ', 'Gomes VMDS', 'Calheiros Leite LA', 'Bomfim LN', 'Gusmao AKFDS', 'Alves MJRG', 'Romao CMDSB', 'Batinga AMCS', 'da Silva MR', 'de Sousa Rodrigues CF']","['Center for Oncology, Santa Casa de Misericordia de Maceio, Maceio, AL, Brazil.', 'State University of Health Sciences of Alagoas (UNCISAL), Maceio, AL, Brazil.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Federal University of Alagoas (UFAL), Maceio, AL, Brazil.', 'State University of Health Sciences of Alagoas (UNCISAL), Maceio, AL, Brazil.', 'Center for Oncology, Santa Casa de Misericordia de Maceio, Maceio, AL, Brazil.', 'Center for Oncology, Santa Casa de Misericordia de Maceio, Maceio, AL, Brazil.', 'State University of Health Sciences of Alagoas (UNCISAL), Maceio, AL, Brazil.', 'State University of Health Sciences of Alagoas (UNCISAL), Maceio, AL, Brazil.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Federal University of Alagoas (UFAL), Maceio, AL, Brazil.', 'State University of Health Sciences of Alagoas (UNCISAL), Maceio, AL, Brazil.', 'Department of Anatomy, State University of Health Sciences of Alagoas (UNCISAL), Maceio, AL, Brazil.']",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20180413,United States,Am J Case Rep,The American journal of case reports,101489566,,IM,"['Biopsy', 'Child', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Myeloid Cells/pathology', '*Rare Diseases', 'Sarcoma, Myeloid/*diagnosis', '*Scalp', 'Skin Neoplasms/*diagnosis']",,,2018/04/14 06:00,2018/10/20 06:00,['2018/04/14 06:00'],"['2018/04/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/20 06:00 [medline]']","['907847 [pii]', '10.12659/ajcr.907847 [doi]']",epublish,Am J Case Rep. 2018 Apr 13;19:438-441. doi: 10.12659/ajcr.907847.,,,,PMC5912010,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, very low efficiency of translocations and lack of markers for translocated cells serve as barriers to their characterization and model development. Here, we used transcription activator-like effector nucleases to generate t(9;11) chromosomal translocations encoding MLL-AF9 and reciprocal AF9-MLL fusion products in CD34(+) human cord blood cells. Selected cytokine combinations enabled monoclonal outgrowth and immortalization of initially rare translocated cells, which were distinguished by elevated MLL target gene expression, high surface CD9 expression, and increased colony-forming ability. Subsequent transplantation into immune-compromised mice induced myeloid leukemias within 48 weeks, whose pathologic and molecular features extensively overlap with de novo patient MLL-rearranged leukemias. No secondary pathogenic mutations were revealed by targeted exome sequencing and whole genome RNA-sequencing analyses, suggesting the genetic sufficiency of t(9;11) translocation for leukemia development from human HSPCs. Thus, genome editing enables modeling of human acute MLL-rearranged leukemia in vivo, reflecting the genetic simplicity of this disease, and provides an experimental platform for biological and disease-modeling applications.","['Schneidawind, Corina', 'Jeong, Johan', 'Schneidawind, Dominik', 'Kim, In-Suk', 'Duque-Afonso, Jesus', 'Wong, Stephen Hon Kit', 'Iwasaki, Masayuki', 'Breese, Erin H', 'Zehnder, James L', 'Porteus, Matthew', 'Cleary, Michael L']","['Schneidawind C', 'Jeong J', 'Schneidawind D', 'Kim IS', 'Duque-Afonso J', 'Wong SHK', 'Iwasaki M', 'Breese EH', 'Zehnder JL', 'Porteus M', 'Cleary ML']","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Department of Pathology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Department of Pathology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Pusan National University Yangsan Hospital, Yangsan, Korea.', 'Department of Pathology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Pathology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA.', 'Department of Pathology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA.', ""Cancer and Blood Diseases Institute, Division of Oncology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH; and."", 'Department of Pathology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, and.', 'Division of Stem Cell Transplantation and Regenerative Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA.', 'Department of Pathology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,"['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (MLL-AF9 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinogenesis', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', '*Gene Editing', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/etiology/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,,2018/04/14 06:00,2019/03/09 06:00,['2018/04/14 06:00'],"['2017/10/28 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/09 06:00 [medline]']","['bloodadvances.2017013748 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2017013748 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2018 Apr 24;2(8):832-845. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2017013748.,['(c) 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,['R01 CA116606/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC5916000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Approval was based on data from the NOVA trial comparing niraparib with placebo in two independent cohorts, based on germline BRCA mutation status (gBRCAm vs. non-gBRCAm). Progression-free survival (PFS) in each cohort was the primary endpoint. In the gBRCAm cohort, estimated median PFS on niraparib was 21 months versus 5.5 months on placebo [HR, 0.26; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.17-0.41; P < 0.0001]. In the non-gBRCAm cohort, estimated median PFS for niraparib and placebo was 9.3 and 3.9 months, respectively (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.34-0.61; P < 0.0001). Common adverse reactions (>20% and higher incidence in the niraparib arm) with niraparib included thrombocytopenia, anemia, neutropenia, nausea, constipation, vomiting, mucositis, fatigue, decreased appetite, headache, insomnia, nasopharyngitis, dyspnea, rash, and hypertension. There were five cases of myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia (1.4%) in patients treated with niraparib compared with two cases (1.1%) on placebo. Niraparib is the first PARP inhibitor approved as maintenance therapy for patients with ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer, with improvement in PFS, regardless of gBRCAm status.

GO is a CD33-directed antibody drug conjugate linked to the cytotoxic antibiotic calicheamicin. It originally received accelerated approval for treatment of older patients with relapsed CD33-positive AML in 2000, but it was withdrawn from the market in 2010 when the confirmatory trial failed to demonstrate clinical benefit among safety concerns, such as a higher rate of induction fatalities on the GO combination arm compared with chemotherapy alone. In addition, GO was associated with hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD), which has substantial morbidity and mortality. Pharmacokinetic analyses suggested a lower maximum concentration of GO would result in less VOD without affecting target saturation or efficacy. A meta-analysis across dose schedules of GO in patients with R/R AML showed that a lower-dose ""fractionated"" schedule of 3 mg/m(2) days 1, 4, and 7 was associated with less early mortality, hemorrhage, and VOD, without an apparent decrease in complete remission (CR) rate. MyloFrance 1 was a single-arm study evaluating response rates in patients with relapsed CD33-positive AML treated with the lower-dose fractionated GO regimen. The CR rate was 26% (95% confidence interval 16%-40%). Common adverse reactions were fever, infections, nausea, vomiting, constipation, bleeding, increased liver enzymes, and mucositis. There were no cases of VOD. These results supported the approval of GO as monotherapy for R/R CD33-positive AML using the lower-dose fractionated regimen. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) 3 mg/m(2) days 1, 4, and 7 is an active regimen for induction of remission when used to treat patients with relapsed or refractory CD33-positive acute myeloid leukemia without curative intent. The risks of hepatic veno-occlusive disease and early mortality with this regimen appear to be lower than reported previously for GO 9 mg/m(2) days 1 and 15. The data were not sufficient to enable conclusions about the safety of GO in children younger than 2 years of age.","['Norsworthy, Kelly J', 'Ko, Chia-Wen', 'Lee, Jee Eun', 'Liu, Jiang', 'John, Christy S', 'Przepiorka, Donna', 'Farrell, Ann T', 'Pazdur, Richard']","['Norsworthy KJ', 'Ko CW', 'Lee JE', 'Liu J', 'John CS', 'Przepiorka D', 'Farrell AT', 'Pazdur R']","['Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, Maryland, USA kelly.norsworthy@fda.hhs.gov.', 'Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, Maryland, USA.', 'Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, Maryland, USA.', 'Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, Maryland, USA.', 'Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, Maryland, USA.', 'Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, Maryland, USA.', 'Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, Maryland, USA.', 'Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, Maryland, USA.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180412,United States,Oncologist,The oncologist,9607837,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aminoglycosides/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Gemtuzumab', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3/*genetics/metabolism', 'United States', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Gemtuzumab ozogamicin', '*Mylotarg', '*U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval']",2018/04/14 06:00,2019/09/20 06:00,['2018/04/14 06:00'],"['2017/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2018/02/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/20 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['theoncologist.2017-0604 [pii]', '10.1634/theoncologist.2017-0604 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncologist. 2018 Sep;23(9):1103-1108. doi: 10.1634/theoncologist.2017-0604.

However, it is not clear whether secretory IgM (sIgM) plays a role in disease progression. We crossed the Emu-TCL1 mouse model of CLL, in which the expression of human TCL1 oncogene was driven by the V(H) promoter-Ig(H)-Emu enhancer, with MD4 mice whose B cells produced B-cell receptor (membrane-bound IgM) and sIgM with specificity for hen egg lysozyme (HEL). CLL cells that developed in these MD4/Emu-TCL1 mice reactivated a parental Ig gene allele and secreted IgM, and did not recognize HEL. The MD4/Emu-TCL1 mice had reduced survival, increased myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), and decreased numbers of T cells. We tested whether sIgM could contribute to the accumulation of MDSCs by crossing muS(-/-) mice, which could not produce sIgM, with Emu-TCL1 mice. The muS(-/-)/Emu-TCL1 mice survived longer than Emu-TCL1 mice and developed decreased numbers of MDSCs which were less able to suppress proliferation of T cells. We targeted the synthesis of sIgM by deleting the function of XBP-1s and showed that targeting XBP-1s genetically or pharmacologically could lead to decreased sIgM, accompanied by decreased numbers and reduced functions of MDSCs in MD4/Emu-TCL1 mice. Additionally, MDSCs from muS(-/-) mice grafted with Lewis lung carcinoma were inefficient suppressors of T cells, resulting in slower tumor growth. These results demonstrate that sIgM produced by B cells can upregulate the functions of MDSCs in tumor-bearing mice to aggravate cancer progression. In a mouse model of CLL, production of secretory IgM led to more MDSCs, fewer T cells, and shorter survival times for the mice. Thus, secretory IgM may aggravate the progression of this cancer.

Unfortunately, the treatment associated dyslipidemia, either acute or chronic, is very prevalent and a cause for decreased quality of life in the surviving patients. To overcome this hurdle, we tested a series of cylopropanecarboxamides, a family demonstrated to target lipid metabolism, for their anti-leukemic activity in ALL. Several of the compounds tested showed anti-proliferative activity, with one, compound 22, inhibiting both Philadelphia chromosome negative REH and Philadelphia chromosome positive SupB15 ALL cell division. The novel advantage of these compounds is the potential synergy with standard chemotherapeutic agents, while concomitantly blunting the emergence of dyslipidemia. Thus, the cylopropanecarboxamides represent a novel class of compounds that can be potentially used in combination with the present standard-of-care to limit treatment associated dyslipidemia in ALL patients.","['Nair, Rajesh R', 'Geldenhuys, Werner J', 'Piktel, Debbie', 'Sadana, Prabodh', 'Gibson, Laura F']","['Nair RR', 'Geldenhuys WJ', 'Piktel D', 'Sadana P', 'Gibson LF']","['Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Cell Biology, School of Medicine, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV 26506, USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV 26506, USA.', 'West Virginia University Cancer Institute, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV 26506, USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Northeast Ohio Medical University, Rootstown, OH 44272, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Cell Biology, School of Medicine, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV 26506, USA; West Virginia University Cancer Institute, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV 26506, USA.

TRIM5alpha and TRIM19 (i.e. promyelocytic leukemia, PML) are among the best-characterized family members; however, in this review we will focus on the potential role of another family member, i.e. TRIM22, a factor strongly induced by interferon stimulation, in HIV infection in vivo and in vitro in the context of its broader antiviral effects. We will also focus on the potential role of TRIM22 in HIV-1-infected individuals speculating on its dual role in controlling virus replication and more complex role in chronic infection. At the molecular levels, we will review the evidence in favor of a relevant role of TRIM22 as epigenetic inhibitor of HIV-1 transcription acting by preventing the binding of the host cell transcription factor Sp1 to the viral promoter. These evidences suggest that TRIM22 should be considered a potential new player in either the establishment or maintenance of HIV-1 reservoirs of latently infected cells unaffected by combination antiretroviral therapy.","['Vicenzi, Elisa', 'Poli, Guido']","['Vicenzi E', 'Poli G']","['Viral Pathogens and Biosafety Unit, P2-P3 Laboratories, DIBIT, Via Olgettina n. 58, 20132, Milano, Italy.

Bile acid (BA), the component of gastric duodenal contents, has been recognised as a carcinogen. BA-induced apoptosis was suggested to be involved in human malignancies. Cells have the potential and tendency to survive apoptosis. However, cells that evade apoptosis upon erroneous DNA repair may carry chromosome rearrangements. Apoptotic nuclease, caspase-activated deoxyribonuclease (CAD) has been implicated in mediating translocation in leukaemia. We hypothesised that BA-induced apoptosis may cause chromosome breaks mediated by CAD leading to chromosome rearrangement in NPC. This study targeted the AF9 gene located at 9p22 because 9p22 is one of the most common deletion sites in NPC. METHODS: We tested the ability of BA at neutral and acidic pH in inducing phosphatidylserine (PS) externalisation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) disruption, and caspase 3/7 activity in normal nasopharyngeal epithelial (NP69) and NPC (TWO4) cells. Inverse-PCR (IPCR) was employed to detect AF9 gene cleavages. To investigate the role of CAD in mediating these cleavages, caspase inhibition was performed. IPCR bands representing AF9 cleaved fragments were sequenced. RESULTS: BA-treated cells showed higher levels of PS externalisation, ROS production, MMP loss and caspase 3/7 activity than untreated control cells. The effect of BA in the induction of these intracellular events was enhanced by acid. BA at neutral and acidic pH also induced significant cleavage of the AF9 gene. These BA-induced gene cleavages were inhibited by Z-DEVD-FMK, a caspase-3 inhibitor. Intriguingly, a few chromosome breaks were identified within the AF9 region that was previously reported to participate in reciprocal translocation between the mixed lineage leukaemia (MLL) and AF9 genes in an acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) patient. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a role for BA-induced apoptosis in mediating chromosome rearrangements in NPC. In addition, CAD may be a key player in chromosome cleavages mediated by BA-induced apoptosis. Persistent exposure of sinonasal tract to gastric duodenal refluxate may increase genomic instability in surviving cells.","['Tan, Sang-Nee', 'Sim, Sai-Peng']","['Tan SN', 'Sim SP']","['Department of Paraclinical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universiti Malaysia Sarawak, Sarawak, Malaysia.', 'Department of Paraclinical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universiti Malaysia Sarawak, Sarawak, Malaysia. spsim@unimas.my.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180412,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Bile Acids and Salts)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/*genetics', 'Bile Acids and Salts/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Biomarkers', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Epithelial Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Space/metabolism', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial', 'Nasal Mucosa/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Nasopharynx/*metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Respiratory Mucosa/drug effects/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*AF9', '*Apoptosis', '*BA', '*CAD', '*CRS', '*NPC', '*Nasopharyngeal reflux']",2018/04/14 06:00,2018/12/12 06:00,['2018/04/14 06:00'],"['2016/12/05 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-018-4327-4 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-018-4327-4 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2018 Apr 12;18(1):409. doi: 10.1186/s12885-018-4327-4.,,,['E14099/F05/69/977/2013 (18)/Ministry of Higher Education/International'],PMC5898073,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Pre-diagnosis treatment-naive adults with >/=2 CLL diagnoses initiated on an antineoplastic agent (index date) after their first CLL diagnosis with >/=12 and >/=6 months of continuous observation pre- and post-index, respectively, were selected from the Truven Health MarketScan Research Databases. Patients had no solid malignancies in the pre-index period nor selected blood malignancies at any time. Initial therapy included antineoplastic agents initiated in the first 30 days post-index. TF occurred at the earliest of: initiation of a new antineoplastic agent, treatment resumption following a >/=3 month break, non-chemotherapy intervention (stem cell transplant or radiotherapy), hospice care or hospital mortality. The cost of TF was evaluated as the healthcare cost difference between patients with and without first-line TF using ordinary least square regressions adjusted for baseline characteristics. Non-parametric bootstrap was used to evaluate statistical significance. RESULTS: Among 2226 patients identified (mean age: 68 years; female: 41%), 46% experienced first-line TF. The average TF cost was $3011 per patient per month (p < .001). When stratifying patients by event indicating TF and by most common therapies, non-chemotherapy intervention ($7582 per patient per month; p < .0001) and fludarabine/cyclophosphamide/rituximab ($4758; p < .001) were associated with the highest TF cost, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The cost of first-line TF is high and varies across first-line therapies. This should be considered when selecting the initial therapy in these patients.","['Wang, Song', 'Lafeuille, Marie-Helene', 'Lefebvre, Patrick', 'Romdhani, Hela', 'Emond, Bruno', 'Senbetta, Mekre']","['Wang S', 'Lafeuille MH', 'Lefebvre P', 'Romdhani H', 'Emond B', 'Senbetta M']","['a Janssen Scientific Affairs LLC , Horsham , PA , USA.', 'b Analysis Group Inc , Montreal , Quebec , Canada.', 'b Analysis Group Inc , Montreal , Quebec , Canada.', 'b Analysis Group Inc , Montreal , Quebec , Canada.', 'b Analysis Group Inc , Montreal , Quebec , Canada.', 'a Janssen Scientific Affairs LLC , Horsham , PA , USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180425,England,Curr Med Res Opin,Current medical research and opinion,0351014,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['*Antineoplastic Agents/economics/therapeutic use', '*Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/economics/therapeutic use', '*Cost of Illness', 'Female', 'Health Care Costs/*statistics & numerical data', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/economics/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Failure', 'United States/epidemiology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*healthcare costs', '*treatment failure']",2018/04/14 06:00,2019/09/17 06:00,['2018/04/14 06:00'],"['2018/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/17 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/03007995.2018.1464904 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Med Res Opin. 2018 Jun;34(6):1135-1142. doi: 10.1080/03007995.2018.1464904.

While the median OS for the entire cohort of patients was 15.3 months (95% CI 9.5 - 21.7 months), OS reached 29.7 months (95% CI 7.01 - not-reached) for patients who achieved a complete remission (CR) to HMA and no intervening therapies between HMA therapy and HSCT.

However, the mechanism of an effective antileukemic response following DLI in AML relapse remains elusive. Here, we investigated the role of T cell exhaustion in AML relapse after allo-HSCT in prospective cohorts of 41 patients with the first AML relapse and 41 nonrelapsed AML control subjects after allo-HSCT and determined whether DLI exerts effective antileukemic effects by reversing T cell exhaustion in the relapsed cohorts by detecting the phenotypes and functions of T cells using flow cytometry. We found that both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells experienced exhaustion with upregulated coexpression of PD-1 and Tim-3, and functional impairments in cytokine production, proliferation, and cytotoxic potentials. The reversal of T cell exhaustion by the first DLI is associated with persistent complete remission in relapsed AML patients. In addition, the reversal of T cell-exhausted status after successful DLI in bone marrow was concurrent with the mitigated inversion of CD4/CD8 T cell ratio. In conclusion, our study shows a clinical correlation between T cell exhaustion and AML relapse after allo-HSCT, and uncovers the role of reversing T cell exhaustion in the antileukemic response by DLI and identifies possible immunological markers to evaluate and predict the graft-versus-leukemia effects induced by DLI.","['Liu, Long', 'Chang, Ying-Jun', 'Xu, Lan-Ping', 'Zhang, Xiao-Hui', 'Wang, Yu', 'Liu, Kai-Yan', 'Huang, Xiao-Jun']","['Liu L', 'Chang YJ', 'Xu LP', 'Zhang XH', 'Wang Y', 'Liu KY', 'Huang XJ']","[""Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Peking University People's Hospital & Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing, China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Peking University People's Hospital & Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing, China; Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Peking University, Beijing, China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Peking University People's Hospital & Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing, China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Peking University People's Hospital & Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing, China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Peking University People's Hospital & Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing, China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Peking University People's Hospital & Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing, China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Peking University People's Hospital & Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing, China; Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Peking University, Beijing, China; Peking-Tsinghua Center for Life Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China.

The delicate balance between self-renewal and differentiation is of great importance. In mice, SSCs exist as a subpopulation of undifferentiated spermatogonia. SSCs are controlled by intrinsic molecular pathways that can be activated by extrinsic signals. Our results here first show that the expression of forkhead box C2 (FOXC2) is restricted to GFRalpha1-positive spermatogonia in the testis. Whole-mount immunofluorescence results reveal that FOXC2 is expressed predominately in As and Apr spermatogonia. Reduction of Foxc2 gene expression by shRNA lentivirus treatment significantly impairs the maintenance of SSCs in vitro. Furthermore, knock-down of Foxc2 decreases SSC colonization to only 10.42% compared to the control by transplantation. Reverse transcription and real-time quantitative PCR gene analyses following knock-down of Foxc2 indicate that Foxc2 may act as a suppressor for SSC differentiation. Extrinsic stimuli treatments show that glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor and retinoic acid act in opposite ways to regulate FOXC2 expression and subsequent SSC property. These results suggest that FOXC2 is a critical intrinsic regulator of SSC self-renewal and differentiation.","['Wei, Chao', 'Lin, Hao', 'Cui, Sheng']","['Wei C', 'Lin H', 'Cui S']","[""State Key Laboratory of Agrobiotechnology, College of Biological Sciences, China Agricultural University , Beijing, People's Republic of China ."", ""State Key Laboratory of Agrobiotechnology, College of Biological Sciences, China Agricultural University , Beijing, People's Republic of China ."", ""State Key Laboratory of Agrobiotechnology, College of Biological Sciences, China Agricultural University , Beijing, People's Republic of China .""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180426,United States,Stem Cells Dev,Stem cells and development,101197107,"['0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Gfra1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor Receptors)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Zbtb16 protein, mouse)', '0 (mesenchyme fork head 1 protein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/metabolism', 'Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor Receptors/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Spermatogonia/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Testis/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*FOXC2', '*differentiation', '*gene expression', '*spermatogonial stem cells', '*transplantation']",2018/04/13 06:00,2019/08/10 06:00,['2018/04/13 06:00'],"['2018/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/10 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/scd.2017.0233 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells Dev. 2018 May 1;27(9):624-636. doi: 10.1089/scd.2017.0233.

Pituitary tumor-transforming gene 1 (PTTG1), an oncoprotein that regulates cell proliferation, is highly expressed in several types of cancer cells including leukemia. In this study, we aim to investigate the anti-cancer effects of luteolin on cells with differential PTTG1 expression and their underlying mechanisms in human myeloid leukemia cells. Methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay data showed that luteolin (25-100 muM) significantly reduced cell viability in THP-1, HL-60 and K562 cells but did not affect normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Flow cytometric analysis and Western blot data demonstrated that luteolin induced a stronger apoptosis on undifferentiated myeloid leukemia cells with higher PTTG1 protein levels than on 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)- or all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA)-differentiated cells with lower PTTG1 expression. Furthermore, PTTG1 knockdown by shRNA in leukemia cells suppressed cell proliferation, arrested cell-cycle progression and impaired the effectiveness of luteolin on cell-cycle regulation. Moreover, PTTG1-knockdown cells with luteolin exposure presented a reduction of the apoptotic proteins and maintained higher levels of the anti-apoptotic proteins such as Mcl-1, Bcl-2 and p21, which exhibited greater resistance to apoptosis. Finally, microarray analysis showed that 20 genes associated with cell proliferation, such as CXCL10, VEGFA, TNF, TP63 and FGFR1, were dramatically down-regulated in PTTG1-knockdown cells. Our current findings clearly demonstrate that luteolin-triggered leukemic cell apoptosis is modulated by the differential expression of the PTTG1. PTTG1 oncoprotein overexpression may modulate cell proliferation-related regulators and enhance the response of myeloid leukemia cells to luteolin. Luteolin is beneficial for the treatment of cancer cells with highly expressed PTTG1 oncoprotein.","['Chen, Pei-Yi', 'Tien, Hsin-Jung', 'Chen, Shih-Fen', 'Horng, Chi-Ting', 'Tang, Huei-Lin', 'Jung, Hui-Ling', 'Wu, Ming-Jiuan', 'Yen, Jui-Hung']","['Chen PY', 'Tien HJ', 'Chen SF', 'Horng CT', 'Tang HL', 'Jung HL', 'Wu MJ', 'Yen JH']","['Center of Medical Genetics, Buddhist Tzu Chi General Hospital, Hualien 970, Taiwan. pyc571@gmail.com.', 'Department of Molecular Biology and Human Genetics, Tzu Chi University, Hualien 970, Taiwan. tiencelia@gmail.com.', 'Department of Molecular Biology and Human Genetics, Tzu Chi University, Hualien 970, Taiwan. damaruco.csf@gmail.com.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Kaohsiung Armed Force General Hospital, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan. h56041@gmail.com.', 'Department of Molecular Biology and Human Genetics, Tzu Chi University, Hualien 970, Taiwan. sophiatang0205@gms.tcu.edu.tw.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Kaohsiung Armed Force General Hospital, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan. tracy530917@gmail.com.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Chia Nan University of Pharmacy and Science, Tainan 717, Taiwan. mingjiuanwu@gmail.com.', 'Department of Molecular Biology and Human Genetics, Tzu Chi University, Hualien 970, Taiwan. imyenjh@mail.tcu.edu.tw.']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-3327-828X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2551-350X']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180412,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Securin)', '0 (pituitary tumor-transforming protein 1, human)', 'KUX1ZNC9J2 (Luteolin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Luteolin/*pharmacology', 'Securin/*genetics/metabolism', 'THP-1 Cells']",['NOTNLM'],"['PTTG1', 'apoptosis', 'cell proliferation', 'luteolin', 'myeloid leukemia cells']",2018/04/13 06:00,2018/09/12 06:00,['2018/04/13 06:00'],"['2018/03/21 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/08 00:00 [revised]', '2018/04/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/12 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms19041173 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms19041173 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2018 Apr 12;19(4). pii: ijms19041173. doi: 10.3390/ijms19041173.,,,,PMC5979486,,,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) results from the expansion of a population of mature B cells that progressively occupies the bone marrow (BM), the blood, and peripheral lymphoid organs. Notwithstanding significant progress in the treatment of these patients, the cure remains an unmet clinical need, suggesting that novel drugs or drug combinations are needed. A unique feature of CLL is its reliance on micro-environmental signals for proliferation and cell survival. We and others have shown that the lymphoid niche, an area of intense interactions between leukemic and bystander non-tumor cells, is a typically hypoxic environment. Here adenosine is generated by leukemic cells, as well as by cells of myeloid origin, acting through autocrine and paracrine mechanisms, ultimately affecting tumor growth, limiting drug responses, and skewing the immune cells towards a tolerant phenotype. Hence, understanding the mechanisms through which this complex network of enzymes, receptors, and metabolites functions in CLL, will pave the way to the use of pharmacological agents targeting the system, which, in combination with drugs targeting leukemic cells, may get us one step closer to curing these patients.","['Vaisitti, Tiziana', 'Arruga, Francesca', 'Deaglio, Silvia']","['Vaisitti T', 'Arruga F', 'Deaglio S']","['Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin School of Medicine & Italian Institute for Genomic Medicine (IIGM), via Nizza, 52, 10126 Torino, Italy. tiziana.vaisitti@unito.it.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin School of Medicine & Italian Institute for Genomic Medicine (IIGM), via Nizza, 52, 10126 Torino, Italy. francesca.arruga@iigm.it.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin School of Medicine & Italian Institute for Genomic Medicine (IIGM), via Nizza, 52, 10126 Torino, Italy. silvia.deaglio@unito.it.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180412,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",IM,"['Adenosine/*metabolism', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Gene Regulatory Networks/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/*methods', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Stem Cell Niche', 'Tumor Microenvironment']",['NOTNLM'],"['ATP', 'adenosine', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'immunosuppression', 'tumor niche']",2018/04/13 06:00,2018/09/12 06:00,['2018/04/13 06:00'],"['2018/03/21 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/06 00:00 [revised]', '2018/04/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/12 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms19041167 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms19041167 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2018 Apr 12;19(4). pii: ijms19041167. doi: 10.3390/ijms19041167.,,,,PMC5979564,,,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,

We examined their out-of-pocket (OOP) cost patterns under the existing Part D cost-sharing policies and proposed changes to these policies. METHODS: Using 100% Medicare claims data from 2012, we examined mean annual and monthly OOP drug costs for Medicare Part D patients who were full-year users of Part D specialty drugs for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (n = 1063), multiple sclerosis (MS) (n = 2256), or chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) (n = 1135) under existing policy. Using the same data, we simulated costs under both proposed Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) policy recommendations and our own recommendations. RESULTS: In 2012, our sample faced mean annual cumulative OOP drug costs (for all medications) of $3949 (RA), $5238 (MS), and $6322 (CML). Mean OOP costs were $977 (RA), $1613 (MS), and $2456 (CML) in January alone. A substantial proportion of total annual OOP prescription spending also occurred during the catastrophic coverage phase (RA: $1229 [31%]; MS: $2456 [47%]; CML: $3546 [56%]). Under proposed MedPAC changes, patients would have faced maximum annual OOP spending of $4700, but mean OOP costs in January and February would have been higher compared with the existing policy. Under our proposed strategy, OOP costs would have been spread evenly over 12 months (</=$392 per month). The potential incremental costs of our proposed strategy would have been $23.55 per non-LIS Part D beneficiary per year. CONCLUSIONS: The existing Part D cost-sharing structure creates a substantial financial burden for specialty drug users, especially early in the year. Implementing both annual and monthly OOP maximum spending limits would result in lower, more consistent OOP costs, potentially increasing patients' ability to access treatments for life-threatening, chronic, and rare diseases.","['Doshi, Jalpa A', 'Li, Pengxiang', 'Pettit, Amy R', 'Dougherty, J Samantha', 'Flint, Ashley', 'Ladage, Vrushabh P']","['Doshi JA', 'Li P', 'Pettit AR', 'Dougherty JS', 'Flint A', 'Ladage VP']","['University of Pennsylvania, 1223 Blockley Hall, Philadelphia, PA 19104.

The JAK1/2 inhibitor Ruxolitinib has remarkable clinical efficacy, including spleen reduction, improvement of constitutional symptoms, and bone marrow (BM) fibrosis reversal. Whether this is due to inhibition of JAK2-mutated HSC only, or whether Ruxolitinib also affects BM stroma is not known. METHODS: This study investigated potential effects of Ruxolitinib on BM mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC), which are not only major regulators of hematopoiesis but also contribute to fibrosis, from 10 healthy donors and 7 JAK2(V617F) -positive MPN patients. RESULTS: Ruxolitinib moderately inhibited the growth of healthy donor MSC (HD-MSC) and MSC from JAK2(V617F+) MPN patients (P-MSC) in short- and long-term assays. The clonogenic potential of HD-MSC was not affected by Ruxolitinib. JAK-STAT signaling, however, was markedly inhibited in both HD-MSC and P-MSC, the latter of which showed higher expression of fibrosis-associated and hematopoiesis-maintenance genes. Moreover, Ruxolitinib reduced MSC secretion of MCP-1 and IL-6. CONCLUSION: Ruxolitinib affected JAK2 signaling in MSC at clinically relevant doses, which is likely to contribute to the normalization of the inflammatory milieu in MPNs. Thus, combined HSC and stroma-directed interventions have the potential to improve constitutional symptoms and reduce stromal proliferation in MPNs.","['Zacharaki, Dimitra', 'Ghazanfari, Roshanak', 'Li, Hongzhe', 'Lim, Hooi Ching', 'Scheding, Stefan']","['Zacharaki D', 'Ghazanfari R', 'Li H', 'Lim HC', 'Scheding S']","['Division of Molecular Hematology & Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Molecular Hematology & Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Molecular Hematology & Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Molecular Hematology & Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Molecular Hematology & Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology, Skane University Hospital Lund, Lund, Sweden.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4954-233X'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180430,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CCL2 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CCL2)', '0 (IL6 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '82S8X8XX8H (ruxolitinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow/enzymology/immunology/pathology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Chemokine CCL2/genetics/immunology', 'Female', 'Fibrosis', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/enzymology/immunology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/genetics/immunology', 'Janus Kinase 1/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/immunology', 'Janus Kinase 2/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic, Atypical, BCR-ABL Negative/enzymology/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/enzymology/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Nitriles', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Pyrazoles/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines', 'Signal Transduction']",['NOTNLM'],"['JAK2 inhibition', 'bone marrow', 'mesenchymal stromal cells', 'myeloproliferative neoplasm', 'ruxolitinib']",2018/04/13 06:00,2018/10/12 06:00,['2018/04/13 06:00'],"['2018/03/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/12 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ejh.13079 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2018 Jul;101(1):57-67. doi: 10.1111/ejh.13079.

The median follow-up is 4.5 years (range 1-16 years). The cumulative 5 year survival is 86.2% (95% confidence interval 81.9-90.5%). No deaths from GTT occurred later than 2 years after starting EMA/CO. In a multivariate analysis, adverse prognostic factors were the presence of liver metastases (p < 0.0001), interval from antecedent pregnancy > 24 months (p < 0.0001), brain metastases (p = 0.0008) and term delivery of antecedent pregnancy (p = 0.045). There were 11 (4%) early deaths while 213 (78%) achieved complete remission. 47 (17%) developed drug resistance to EMA/CO of whom 33 (70%) were salvaged by further cisplatinum based chemotherapy and sugery. 2 women developed acute myeloid leukaemia after treatment with EMA/CO. 56% of women who have been in remission for at least 2 years and had fertility conserving surgery have achieved pregnancy since completing EMA/CO and there have been 112 live births including 3 babies with congenital abnormalities.

Most published reports analyzed results from therapies in first-salvage AML or in studies that were conducted before 2000. Several novel agents and strategies are being tested for potential approval as treatment for patients with relapsed-refractory AML in second salvage. Therefore, it is important to establish the historic results of anti-AML therapies in this setting in the modern era. The objective of the current study was to analyze the results from second salvage therapies in patients with AML since 2000 with regard to response and survival. METHODS: In total, 673 patients who received second salvage therapies for AML since 2000 were analyzed. Their median age was 60 years (range, 18-89 years). Salvage therapy consisted of cytarabine-based regimens in 267 patients, noncytarabine combinations in 37, hypomethylating agent-based regimens in 136, and phase 1 and 2 single agents in 233. RESULTS: Eighty-six of the 673 patients (13%) achieved a complete response (CR) or a CR with low platelet count (CRp). The median duration of CR-CRp was 7.2 months. The median survival was 4.4 months (95% confidence interval, 4.0-4.8 months), and the 1-year survival rate was 16% (95% confidence interval, 14%-19%). Multivariate analysis identified the following as independent adverse factors for achievement of CR-CRp: platelets < 50 x 10(9) /L (P < .001), complex karyotype with >/=3 chromosomal abnormalities (P = .02), regimens that did not include cytarabine or hypomethylating agents (P = .014), and no prior CR lasting >/=12 months with frontline or salvage 1 therapies (P < .001). The independent adverse factors associated with worse survival were age >/=60 years (P = .01), platelets < 50 x 10(9) /L (P = .02), peripheral blasts >/= 20% (P = .03), albumin </= 3 g/dL (P = .04), and complex karyotype (P = .003). The authors also applied and validated, in the current population, the 2 multivariate-derived prognostic models for CR and survival developed in their previous study of 594 patients who received treatment for second salvage AML from the previous 2 decades. CONCLUSIONS: This large-scale analysis establishes the modern historic results of second salvage therapy in AML and validates the prognostic models associated with outcome. These data could be used to analyze the differential benefits of current or future investigational strategies under evaluation in this setting and for the purpose of potential approval of new agents in the United States and the world.

We previously reported that the polyamine regulator AMD1 is critical for embryonic stem cell self-renewal. The polyamines putrescine, spermidine, and spermine are essential organic cations that play a role in a wide array of cellular processes. Here, we explore the essential role of the polyamines in the promotion of self-renewal and identify a new stem cell regulator that acts downstream of the polyamines: MINDY1. MINDY1 protein levels are high in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and are dependent on high polyamine levels. Overexpression of MINDY1 can promote ESC self-renewal in the absence of the usually essential cytokine Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF). MINDY1 protein is prenylated and this modification is required for its ability to promote self-renewal. We go on to show that Mindy1 RNA is targeted for repression by mir-710 during Neural Precursor cell differentiation. Taken together, these data demonstrate that high polyamine levels are required for ESC self-renewal and that they function, in part, through promotion of high MINDY1 levels.

METHODS: Non-interventional, prospective French cross-sectional study. RESULTS: The analysis included 231 patients (66 +/- 12 years old) suffering from multiple myeloma (MM) (N = 64), chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL) (N = 84), aggressive non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma (aNHL) (N = 32), indolent NHL (N = 39), acute leukemia (N = 6), and Hodgkin disease (N = 6). Of the HM, 47% were currently treated, 42% were relapsing or refractory, 23% of patients had received an autologous hematopoietic stem-cell transplant, and 1% had received an allograft. Serum immunoglobulin trough levels in 195 individuals were less than 5 g/L in 68.7% of cases. Most patients had a history of recurrent infections. Immunoglobulin dose was about 400 mg/kg/mo. Half of patients started with subcutaneous infusion. When starting IgRT, physicians mainly expected to prevent severe and moderate infections. They also anticipated improvement in quality of life and survival which is beyond evidence-based medicine. CONCLUSION: NHL is a frequent condition motivating IgRT besides well-recognized indications. Physicians mainly based the decision of starting IgRT on hypogammaglobulinemia and recurrence of infections but, irrespective of current recommendations, were also prepared to start IgRT prophylactically even in the absence of a history of infections.","['Benbrahim, Omar', 'Viallard, Jean-Francois', 'Choquet, Sylvain', 'Royer, Bruno', 'Bauduer, Frederic', 'Decaux, Olivier', 'Crave, Jean-Charles', 'Fardini, Yann', 'Clerson, Pierre', 'Levy, Vincent']","['Benbrahim O', 'Viallard JF', 'Choquet S', 'Royer B', 'Bauduer F', 'Decaux O', 'Crave JC', 'Fardini Y', 'Clerson P', 'Levy V']","['Hematologie, Hopital de La Source, CHR Orleans, Orleans, France.', 'Medecine Interne, Hopital Haut Leveque, Pessac, France.', 'Hematologie, GH Pitie Salpetriere, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France.', 'Hematologie Clinique, CHU Amiens - Sud, Amiens, France.', 'Hematologie, CH Cote Basque, Bayonne, France.', 'Medecine Interne, CHU Rennes - Sud, Rennes, France.', 'Octapharma France, Boulogne-Billancourt, France.', 'Soladis Clinical Studies, Roubaix, France.', 'Soladis Clinical Studies, Roubaix, France.', 'URC/CRC Groupe Hospitalier Paris Seine Saint Denis, APHP, Hopital Avicenne, Bobigny, France.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6800-1777'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Observational Study']",20180517,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunoglobulins, Intravenous)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'France', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/immunology/mortality/pathology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins, Intravenous/*therapeutic use', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Quality of Life', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",['NOTNLM'],"['evidence-based medicine', 'hematological malignancies', 'hypogammaglobulinemia', 'immunoglobulins', 'intravenous Infusions', 'secondary immunodeficiency', 'subcutaneous infusions']",2018/04/13 06:00,2018/10/12 06:00,['2018/04/13 06:00'],"['2018/03/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/12 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ejh.13078 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2018 Jul;101(1):48-56. doi: 10.1111/ejh.13078.

In a small cohort of patients, we have previously shown better outcomes following Busulfan and Melphalan (BUMEL) over Busulfan and Cyclophosphamide (BUCY). To identify the subpopulations that might get the highest benefit with BUMEL, we designed a larger study. All adult patients with primary AML and available cytogenetics, autografted from January 2000 to December 2016 in CR1, were included: 1137 patients received BUCY and 512 BUMEL. All factors differing in distribution between the 2 conditioning groups were introduced in multivariate analyzes. In a primary analysis, we found an interaction between conditioning and the poor risk group defined as poor cytogenetics and/or presence of the FLT3-ITD mutation. During analysis of the poor risk group, 176 patients received BUCY and 62 BUMEL. BUMEL was associated with a lower RI at 5 years (53% versus 69%, HR: 0.52, P = .002), a better Leukaemia-free survival (LFS) (42% versus 25%, HR: 0.54, P = .002) and a better OS (54% versus 36%, HR: 0.61, P = .02). During analysis of the non poor risk group, 961 patients received BUCY and 450 BUMEL. At 5 years, the RI was 50% and 47%, the LFS 45% and 48% and the OS 56% and 60% respectively, with no significant difference. We conclude that BUMEL is the preferable conditioning regimen for the poor risk leukemic patients, while in AML patients without poor risk cytogenetics or FLT3 both conditioning regimens are valid.","['Gorin, Norbert Claude', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Blaise, Didier', 'Dumas, Pierre-Yves', 'Pabst, Thomas', 'Trisolini, Silvia Maria', 'Arcese, William', 'Houhou, Mohamed', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Nagler, Arnon']","['Gorin NC', 'Labopin M', 'Blaise D', 'Dumas PY', 'Pabst T', 'Trisolini SM', 'Arcese W', 'Houhou M', 'Mohty M', 'Nagler A']","['Department of Hematology and Cell Therapy and EBMT Office, Hopital Saint-Antoine APHP, INSERM U 938, Universite Pierre et Marie Curie UPMC, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology and Cell Therapy and EBMT Office, Hopital Saint-Antoine APHP, INSERM U 938, Universite Pierre et Marie Curie UPMC, Paris, France.', 'Institut Paoli Calmettes, Marseille, France.', ""CHU Bordeaux, Service d'hematologie clinique et therapie cellulaire, Bordeaux, F 33000, France."", 'Department of Medical Oncology, Inselspital, University Hospital Bern, Bern, CH-3010, Switzerland.', 'Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Policlinico Umberto 1, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Rome Transplant Network, Tor Vergata University of Rome, Stem Cell Transplant Unit, Policlinico Universitario Tor Vergata, Rome, 00133, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology and Cell Therapy and EBMT Office, Hopital Saint-Antoine APHP, INSERM U 938, Universite Pierre et Marie Curie UPMC, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology and Cell Therapy and EBMT Office, Hopital Saint-Antoine APHP, INSERM U 938, Universite Pierre et Marie Curie UPMC, Paris, France.', 'Chaim Sheba Medical Center, EBMT ALWP Chair, Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Tel Hashomer, Israel.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-0108-5769'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180428,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Myeloablative Agonists)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Busulfan/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Melphalan/therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloablative Agonists/therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,2018/04/13 06:00,2019/07/11 06:00,['2018/04/13 06:00'],"['2018/03/05 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/27 00:00 [revised]', '2018/04/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/11 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.25105 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2018 Jul;93(7):859-866. doi: 10.1002/ajh.25105.

We evaluated the inhalation risks of working in a printing room. Eight units with centralized printing rooms were randomly selected. Formaldehyde, ozone, benzene, toluene, xylene, and fine particulate matter were detected by spectrophotometry, gas chromatography, and direct reading instruments, respectively. The U.S. EPA inhalation risk assessment model was used to assess cancer and non-cancer risks. The formaldehyde inhalation cancer risk value was 1.35-3.45 x 10(-6), which is greater than the limit of 1 x 10(-6), suggesting a risk of squamous cell carcinoma. The benzene inhalation cancer risk in five of the rooms was 1.09-4.65 x 10(-6), which is greater than the limit of 1 x 10(-6), suggesting a risk of leukemia.

However, the potential role of H19 and its clinical significance in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remain largely elusive. Methods: H19 expression was detected by qPCR, and clinical significance in AML patients was further analyzed. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data for AML were used as validation cohorts. The roles of H19 in cell proliferation and apoptosis were determined by cell proliferation assay and flow cytometry analysis. Results: H19 expression was significantly increased in AML patients but not associated with embedded miR-675 expression. Moreover, H19 overexpression was not dependent on the methylation pattern in H19 differentially methylated region/imprinting control region. Strong association was observed between H19 overexpression and patients' characteristics including sex, higher white blood cells, older age, and intermediate karyotype, FLT3-ITD, and DNMT3A mutations. In addition, H19 overexpression correlated with lower complete remission (CR) rate and shorter overall survival, and further confirmed by multivariate analyses. Importantly, the prognostic effect of H19 expression was validated by TCGA and GEO data. In the follow-up of patients, H19 expression in CR phase was lower than diagnosis time and returned at relapse time. Loss-of-function experiments showed that H19 exhibited anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects in leukemic cell HL60. Furthermore, H19 expression was positively correlated with potential downstream gene ID2 in AML. Conclusions: Our findings revealed that methylation-independent H19 was a prognostic and predictive biomarker in AML, and H19/ID2 played crucial roles in leukemogenesis with potential therapeutic target value.","['Zhang, Ting-Juan', 'Zhou, Jing-Dong', 'Zhang, Wei', 'Lin, Jiang', 'Ma, Ji-Chun', 'Wen, Xiang-Mei', 'Yuan, Qian', 'Li, Xi-Xi', 'Xu, Zi-Jun', 'Qian, Jun']","['Zhang TJ', 'Zhou JD',

ATL leukemogenesis remains enigmatic. In the era of precision medicine in oncology, mouse models offer one of the most efficient in vivo tools for the understanding of the disease biology and developing novel targeted therapies. This review provides an up-to-date and comprehensive account of mouse models developed in the context of ATL and HTLV-I infection. Murine ATL models include transgenic animals for the viral proteins Tax and HBZ, knock-outs for key cellular regulators, xenografts and humanized immune-deficient mice. The first two groups provide a key understanding of the role of viral and host genes in the development of ATL, as well as their relationship with the immunopathogenic processes. The third group represents a valuable platform to test new targeted therapies against ATL.","['Moodad, Sara', 'Akkouche, Abdou', 'Hleihel, Rita', 'Darwiche, Nadine', 'El-Sabban, Marwan', 'Bazarbachi, Ali', 'El Hajj, Hiba']","['Moodad S', 'Akkouche A', 'Hleihel R', 'Darwiche N', 'El-Sabban M', 'Bazarbachi A', 'El Hajj H']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Anatomy, Cell Biology and Physiological Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Anatomy, Cell Biology and Physiological Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Anatomy, Cell Biology and Physiological Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Experimental Pathology, Immunology and Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180328,Switzerland,Front Microbiol,Frontiers in microbiology,101548977,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['HBZ', 'HTLV-I', 'Tax', 'adult T cell leukemia', 'mouse models']",2018/04/13 06:00,2018/04/13 06:01,['2018/04/13 06:00'],"['2018/01/16 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/13 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fmicb.2018.00558 [doi]'],epublish,Front Microbiol. 2018 Mar 28;9:558. doi: 10.3389/fmicb.2018.00558. eCollection 2018.,,,,PMC5882783,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, whether this highly dynamic physiologic process can be exploited to counteract dysregulated Notch signaling in cancer cells remains unknown. T-ALL is a malignancy characterized by aberrant Notch signaling, sustained by activating mutations in Notch1 as well as overexpression of Notch3, a Notch paralog physiologically subjected to lysosome-dependent degradation in human cancer cells. Here we show that treatment with the pan-HDAC inhibitor Trichostatin A (TSA) strongly decreases Notch3 full-length protein levels in T-ALL cell lines and primary human T-ALL cells xenografted in mice without substantially reducing NOTCH3 mRNA levels. Moreover, TSA markedly reduced the levels of Notch target genes, including pTalpha, CR2, and DTX-1, and induced apoptosis of T-ALL cells. We further observed that Notch3 was post-translationally regulated following TSA treatment, with reduced Notch3 surface levels and increased accumulation of Notch3 protein in the lysosomal compartment. Surface Notch3 levels were rescued by inhibition of dynein with ciliobrevin D. Pharmacologic studies with HDAC1, 6, and 8-specific inhibitors disclosed that these effects were largely due to inhibition of HDAC6 in T-ALL cells. HDAC6 silencing by specific shRNA was followed by reduced Notch3 expression and increased apoptosis of T-ALL cells. Finally, HDAC6 silencing impaired leukemia outgrowth in mice, associated with reduction of Notch3 full-length protein in vivo. These results connect HDAC6 activity to regulation of total and surface Notch3 levels and suggest HDAC6 as a potential novel therapeutic target to lower Notch signaling in T-ALL and other Notch3-addicted tumors.","['Pinazza, Marica', 'Ghisi, Margherita', 'Minuzzo, Sonia', 'Agnusdei, Valentina', 'Fossati, Gianluca', 'Ciminale, Vincenzo', 'Pezze, Laura', 'Ciribilli, Yari', 'Pilotto, Giorgia', 'Venturoli, Carolina', 'Amadori, Alberto', 'Indraccolo, Stefano']","['Pinazza M', 'Ghisi M', 'Minuzzo S', 'Agnusdei V', 'Fossati G', 'Ciminale V', 'Pezze L', 'Ciribilli Y', 'Pilotto G', 'Venturoli C', 'Amadori A', 'Indraccolo S']","['Istituto Oncologico Veneto IOV-IRCCS, Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Surgery, Oncology and Gastroenterological Sciences, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'CRCT, Toulouse, France.', 'Department of Surgery, Oncology and Gastroenterological Sciences, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Istituto Oncologico Veneto IOV-IRCCS, Padova, Italy.', 'Italfarmaco S.P.A, Milan, Italy.', 'Istituto Oncologico Veneto IOV-IRCCS, Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Surgery, Oncology and Gastroenterological Sciences, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Cancer Genetics, CIBIO, University of Trento, Trento, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Cancer Genetics, CIBIO, University of Trento, Trento, Italy.', 'Department of Surgery, Oncology and Gastroenterological Sciences, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Istituto Oncologico Veneto IOV-IRCCS, Padova, Italy.', 'Istituto Oncologico Veneto IOV-IRCCS, Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Surgery, Oncology and Gastroenterological Sciences, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Istituto Oncologico Veneto IOV-IRCCS, Padova, Italy. stefano.indraccolo@unipd.it.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6197-1802', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9231-379X']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180412,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (NOTCH3 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptor, Notch3)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (HDAC6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylase 6)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects/physiology', 'Histone Deacetylase 6/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lysosomes/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Protein Transport/drug effects/*physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Receptor, Notch3/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology']",,,2018/04/13 06:00,2019/02/26 06:00,['2018/04/13 06:00'],"['2017/08/07 00:00 [received]', '2018/02/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/30 00:00 [revised]', '2018/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/26 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41388-018-0234-z [doi]', '10.1038/s41388-018-0234-z [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2018 Jul;37(28):3839-3851. doi: 10.1038/s41388-018-0234-z.

The nuclear membrane-imbedded protein SUN2 was recently reported to be involved in the nuclear import of HIV-1. Whether SUN1, which shares many functional similarities with SUN2, is involved in this process remained to be explored. Here we report that overexpression of SUN1 specifically inhibited infection by HIV-1 but not that by simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) or murine leukemia virus (MLV). Overexpression of SUN1 did not affect reverse transcription but led to reduced accumulation of the 2-long-terminal-repeat (2-LTR) circular DNA and integrated viral DNA, suggesting a block in the process of nuclear import. HIV-1 CA was mapped as a determinant for viral sensitivity to SUN1. Treatment of SUN1-expressing cells with cyclosporine (CsA) significantly reduced the sensitivity of the virus to SUN1, and an HIV-1 mutant containing CA-G89A, which does not interact with cyclophilin A (CypA), was resistant to SUN1 overexpression. Downregulation of endogenous SUN1 inhibited the nuclear entry of the wild-type virus but not that of the G89A mutant. These results indicate that SUN1 participates in the HIV-1 nuclear entry process in a manner dependent on the interaction of CA with CypA.IMPORTANCE HIV-1 infects both dividing and nondividing cells. The viral preintegration complex (PIC) can enter the nucleus through the nuclear pore complex. It has been well known that the viral protein CA plays an important role in determining the pathways by which the PIC enters the nucleus. In addition, the interaction between CA and the cellular protein CypA has been reported to be important in the selection of nuclear entry pathways, though the underlying mechanisms are not very clear. Here we show that both SUN1 overexpression and downregulation inhibited HIV-1 nuclear entry. CA played an important role in determining the sensitivity of the virus to SUN1: the regulatory activity of SUN1 toward HIV-1 relied on the interaction between CA and CypA. These results help to explain how SUN1 is involved in the HIV-1 nuclear entry process.","['Luo, Xinlong', 'Yang, Wei', 'Gao, Guangxia']","['Luo X', 'Yang W', 'Gao G']","['CAS Key Laboratory of Infection and Immunity, CAS Center for Excellence in Biomacromolecules, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'CAS Key Laboratory of Infection and Immunity, CAS Center for Excellence in Biomacromolecules, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'CAS Key Laboratory of Infection and Immunity, CAS Center for Excellence in Biomacromolecules, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China gaogx@moon.ibp.ac.cn.', 'University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180613,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (SUN1 protein, human)', 'EC 5.2.1.- (Cyclophilin A)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Capsid/*metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Cyclophilin A/*metabolism', 'HIV Infections/*virology', 'HIV-1/*pathogenicity', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Virus Integration']",['NOTNLM'],"['*HIV-1', '*SUN1', '*capsid', '*cyclophilin A', '*nuclear entry']",2018/04/13 06:00,2018/07/31 06:00,['2018/04/13 06:00'],"['2018/02/09 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/31 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.00229-18 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00229-18 [doi]']",epublish,J Virol. 2018 Jun 13;92(13). pii: JVI.00229-18. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00229-18.

Pharmacological disruption of both of these interactions has long been sought after as an attractive strategy to fully restore p53-dependent tumor suppressor activity in cancers with wild-type p53. Selective targeting of this pathway has thus far been limited to MDM2-only small-molecule inhibitors, which lack affinity for MDMX. We demonstrate that dual MDMX/MDM2 inhibition with a stapled alpha-helical peptide (ALRN-6924), which has recently entered phase I clinical testing, produces marked antileukemic effects. ALRN-6924 robustly activates p53-dependent transcription at the single-cell and single-molecule levels and exhibits biochemical and molecular biological on-target activity in leukemia cells in vitro and in vivo. Dual MDMX/MDM2 inhibition by ALRN-6924 inhibits cellular proliferation by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in cell lines and primary AML patient cells, including leukemic stem cell-enriched populations, and disrupts functional clonogenic and serial replating capacity.

Although loss of ASXL1 promotes hematopoietic transformation, there is growing evidence that ASXL1 mutations might confer an alteration of function. In this study, we identify that physiological expression of a C-terminal truncated Asxl1 mutant in vivo using conditional knock-in (KI) results in myeloid skewing, age-dependent anemia, thrombocytosis, and morphological dysplasia. Although expression of mutant Asxl1 altered the functions of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), it maintained their survival in competitive transplantation assays and increased susceptibility to leukemic transformation by co-occurring RUNX1 mutation or viral insertional mutagenesis. KI mice displayed substantial reductions in H3K4me3 and H2AK119Ub without significant reductions in H3K27me3, distinct from the effects of Asxl1 loss. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by next-generation sequencing analysis demonstrated opposing effects of wild-type and mutant Asxl1 on H3K4me3. These findings reveal that ASXL1 mutations confer HSCs with an altered epigenome and increase susceptibility for leukemic transformation, presenting a novel model for CHIP.","['Nagase, Reina', 'Inoue, Daichi', 'Pastore, Alessandro', 'Fujino, Takeshi', 'Hou, Hsin-An', 'Yamasaki, Norimasa', 'Goyama, Susumu', 'Saika, Makoto', 'Kanai, Akinori', 'Sera, Yasuyuki', 'Horikawa, Sayuri', 'Ota, Yasunori', 'Asada, Shuhei', 'Hayashi, Yasutaka', 'Kawabata, Kimihito Cojin', 'Takeda, Reina', 'Tien, Hwei-Fang', 'Honda, Hiroaki', 'Abdel-Wahab, Omar', 'Kitamura, Toshio']","['Nagase R', 'Inoue D', 'Pastore A', 'Fujino T', 'Hou HA', 'Yamasaki N', 'Goyama S', 'Saika M', 'Kanai A', 'Sera Y', 'Horikawa S', 'Ota Y', 'Asada S', 'Hayashi Y', 'Kawabata KC', 'Takeda R', 'Tien HF', 'Honda H', 'Abdel-Wahab O', 'Kitamura T']","['Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan inoued@mskcc.org.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Disease Model, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology and Leukemia Program Project, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Department of Disease Model, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Research Hospital, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Disease Model, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.', ""Field of Human Disease Models, Major in Advanced Life Sciences and Medicine, Tokyo Women's Medical University, Tokyo, Japan."", 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan kitamura@ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-3621-4807', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7855-1767']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20180411,United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (ASXL1 protein, human)', '0 (Asxl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics/*pathology', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Knock-In Techniques', 'Genome, Human', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis/genetics', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Protein Binding', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",,,2018/04/13 06:00,2019/06/18 06:00,['2018/04/13 06:00'],"['2017/06/27 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/24 00:00 [revised]', '2018/03/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/18 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['jem.20171151 [pii]', '10.1084/jem.20171151 [doi]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2018 Jun 4;215(6):1729-1747. doi: 10.1084/jem.20171151.

A sensitive and specific assay for the detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) in FLT3-ITD mutated AML could guide therapy decisions. Existing assays for MRD in FLT3-ITD AML have not been particularly useful because of limited sensitivity. We developed a sensitive and specific MRD assay for FLT3-ITD mutations using next-generation sequencing. The initial validation of this assay was performed by spiking fixed amounts of mutant DNA into wild-type DNA to establish a sensitivity of detection equivalent to >/=1 FLT3-ITD-containing cell in 10 000, with a minimum input of 100 000 cell equivalents of DNA. We subsequently validated the assay in bone marrow samples from patients with FLT3-ITD AML in remission. Finally, we analyzed bone marrow samples from 80 patients with FLT3-ITD relapsed/refractory AML participating in a trial of a novel FLT3 inhibitor, gilteritinib, and demonstrated a relationship between the mutation burden, as detected by the assay, and overall survival. This novel MRD assay is specific and 2 orders of magnitude more sensitive than currently available polymerase chain reaction- or next-generation sequencing-based FLT3-ITD assays. The assay is being prospectively validated in ongoing randomized clinical trials.","['Levis, Mark J', 'Perl, Alexander E', 'Altman, Jessica K', 'Gocke, Christopher D', 'Bahceci, Erkut', 'Hill, Jason', 'Liu, Chaofeng', 'Xie, Zhiyi', 'Carson, Andrew R', 'McClain, Valerie', 'Stenzel, Timothy T', 'Miller, Jeffrey E']","['Levis MJ', 'Perl AE', 'Altman JK', 'Gocke CD', 'Bahceci E', 'Hill J', 'Liu C', 'Xie Z', 'Carson AR', 'McClain V', 'Stenzel TT', 'Miller JE']","['Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD.', 'University of Pennsylvania-Abramson Comprehensive Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Robert H.

We aimed to test the feasibility of measuring sleep quality in AML inpatients using a wearable actigraphy device. METHODS: Using the Actigraph GT3X 'watch', we assessed the total sleep time, sleep onset latency, wake after sleep onset, number of awakenings after sleep onset and sleep e ffi ciency for inpatients with AML receiving induction chemotherapy. We assessed patient self-reported sleep quality using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). RESULTS: Of the 12 patients enrolled, 11 completed all actigraphy and PSQI assessments, demonstrating feasibility. Patients wore the Actigraph device for a mean (SD) of 15.92 (8.3) days, and actigraphy measures suggested poor sleep. Patients had a median average awakening length of 6.92 min, a median number of awakenings after sleep onset of 4 and a median sleep onset latency of 10.8 min. Actual median sleep efficiency (0.91) was high, suggesting that patients' poor sleep was not due to insomnia but perhaps due to interruptions, such as administration of medications, lab draws and vital sign measurements. CONCLUSIONS: Collection of sleep quality data among inpatients with AML via a wearable actigraphy device is feasible. AML inpatients appear to have poor sleep quality and quantity, suggesting that sleep issues represent an area of unmet supportive care needs in AML. Further research in this areas is needed to inform the development of interventions to improve sleep duration and quality in hospitalised patients with AML.","['Yang, Chi-Fu Jeffrey', 'Aibel, Kelli', 'Meyerhoff, Ryan', 'Wang, Frances', 'Harpole, David', 'Abernethy, Amy P', 'LeBlanc, Thomas W']","['Yang CJ', 'Aibel K', 'Meyerhoff R', 'Wang F', 'Harpole D', 'Abernethy AP', 'LeBlanc TW']","['Duke Cancer Institute, Durham, North Carolina, USA.', 'Duke Cancer Institute, Durham, North Carolina, USA.', 'Duke Cancer Institute, Durham, North Carolina, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, USA.', 'Duke Cancer Institute, Durham, North Carolina, USA.', 'Duke Cancer Institute, Durham, North Carolina, USA.', 'Flatiron Health, Inc, New York City, New York, USA.', 'Duke Cancer Institute, Durham, North Carolina, USA.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0546-7895'],['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",20180411,England,BMJ Support Palliat Care,BMJ supportive & palliative care,101565123,,IM,"['Actigraphy/*instrumentation/methods', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Wake Disorders/chemically induced/*diagnosis', 'Time Factors', '*Wearable Electronic Devices', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['Psqi', 'actigraphy', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'leukemia', 'sleep', 'supportive care']",2018/04/13 06:00,2019/06/04 06:00,['2018/04/13 06:00'],"['2018/01/25 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/27 00:00 [revised]', '2018/03/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/04 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['bmjspcare-2018-001509 [pii]', '10.1136/bmjspcare-2018-001509 [doi]']",ppublish,BMJ Support Palliat Care. 2018 Sep;8(3):274-277. doi: 10.1136/bmjspcare-2018-001509.

METHODS: The gene expression profiles of GSE14317 were obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus database. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in T-ALL were analyzed using R package Limma. The online analysis tool DAVID was used to perform the functional and pathway enrichment analysis. The protein-protein interaction network was constructed by STRING and visualized by Cytoscape. Based on the JASPAR database, the transcription factors (TFs) of the hub genes were obtained. RT-PCR was used to test the mRNA expression level of the key genes. RESULTS: A total of 1443 DEGs were identified, including 800 up-regulated genes and 643 down-regulated genes. These DEGs were significantly enriched in the cell cycle, hematopoietic cell lineage, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and T cell receptor signaling pathway. The top 10 hub genes identified from the PPI networks included CDK1, PIK3R1, CCNB1, CCNA2, CDC20, JUN, GNG11, PLK1, PCNA and CCNB2, which were enriched in chemokine signaling pathway, ubiquition mediated proteolysis and cell cycle. In the TF-target gene network, 42 differentially expressed TFs were identified, among which ELF5, HIC2 and MEISI had binding sites with 9 of the candidate hub genes. RT-PCR showed that the mRNA expression level of all the candidate hub genes except for GNG11 were consistent with the gene expression profiles. CONCLUSION: The hub genes CDK1, PIK3R1, CCNB1, CCNA2, CDC20, JUN, PLK1, PCNA, CCNB2, ELF5, HIC2 and MEISI participate in the occurrence of T-ALL.

The clinical spectrum of these diseases extends from benign dermal lesions to visceral forms. In the Mediterranean region, zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis (ZVL) is caused by L. infantum. If untreated within two years, the disease usually leads to death. In Morocco, ZVL is endemic in the north, with a hundred cases notified each year, mostly in children aged below five years. Here, we report on two clinical observations in infants presenting unusual concomitant VL and cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in Morocco. CASE PRESENTATION: In this case study, we report on two infants aged nine and 12 months old. They both have a history of febrile splenomegaly, anemia, and pallor of mucous membranes. Visceral leishmaniasis was confirmed by parasitological diagnosis (positive bone marrow smear and screening of anti-L. infantum antibodies). However, the clinical examination also showed cutaneous lesions that suggested the presence of CL. This was reinforced by the patients having a history of living or traveling to endemic foci. Thus, direct examination, culture, and PCR-RFLP (ITS1-Hae 3) were carried out on the patients' dermal exudates. In one of the infants, CL was associated with L. infantum, while in the other it was associated with L. tropica. The infants were treated as according to the recommendations of the Ministry of Health. Both patients were cured in two months; defervescence, reduction of splenomegaly, and healing of cutaneous lesions were all observed. CONCLUSIONS: These singular patients illustrate the clinical polymorphism of CL and the necessity of updating the differential diagnosis of leukemia-like syndromes, including VL, in children living in or travelling to known endemic areas. These observations suggest a change in the Mediterranean VL phenotype that may be associated with CL.","['Mouttaki, Tarik', 'Maksouri, Hasnaa', 'El Mabrouki, Jilali', 'Merino-Espinosa, Gema', 'Fellah, Hassan', 'Itri, Mohamed', 'Martin-Sanchez, Joaquina', 'Soussi-Abdallaoui, Maha', 'Chiheb, Soumiya', 'Riyad, Myriam']","['Mouttaki T', 'Maksouri H', 'El Mabrouki J', 'Merino-Espinosa G', 'Fellah H', 'Itri M', 'Martin-Sanchez J', 'Soussi-Abdallaoui M', 'Chiheb S', 'Riyad M']","['Centre of Doctoral Studies on Health Sciences (CED. des Sciences de la Sante), Doctoral School of Immunopathology, Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy, Hassan II University of Casablanca, Casablanca, Morocco.', 'Research Team on Immunopathology of Infectious and Systemic Diseases, Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy, Hassan II University of Casablanca, Casablanca, Morocco.', 'Centre of Doctoral Studies on Health Sciences (CED. des Sciences de la Sante), Doctoral School of Immunopathology, Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy, Hassan II University of Casablanca, Casablanca, Morocco.', 'Research Team on Immunopathology of Infectious and Systemic Diseases, Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy, Hassan II University of Casablanca, Casablanca, Morocco.', 'Laboratory of Parasitology and Mycology, University Hospital Ibn Rochd of Casablanca, Casablanca, Morocco.', 'Department of Parasitology, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Granada, Granada, Spain.', 'Research Team on Immunopathology of Infectious and Systemic Diseases, Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy, Hassan II University of Casablanca, Casablanca, Morocco.', ""Children's Hospital, University Hospital Ibn Rochd of Casablanca, Casablanca, Morocco."", 'Department of Parasitology, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Granada, Granada, Spain.', 'Laboratory of Parasitology and Mycology, University Hospital Ibn Rochd of Casablanca, Casablanca, Morocco.', 'Laboratory of Parasitology, Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy, Hassan II University of Casablanca, 19 rue Tarik Ibn Ziad, BP. 9154, Casablanca, Morocco.', 'Research Team on Immunopathology of Infectious and Systemic Diseases, Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy, Hassan II University of Casablanca, Casablanca, Morocco.', 'Department of Dermatology, University Hospital Ibn Rochd of Casablanca, Casablanca, Morocco.', 'Research Team on Immunopathology of Infectious and Systemic Diseases, Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy, Hassan II University of Casablanca, Casablanca, Morocco. myriamriyad@gmail.com.', 'Laboratory of Parasitology, Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy, Hassan II University of Casablanca, 19 rue Tarik Ibn Ziad, BP. 9154, Casablanca, Morocco. myriamriyad@gmail.com.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6718-9843'],['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20180412,England,Infect Dis Poverty,Infectious diseases of poverty,101606645,,IM,"['Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leishmaniasis, Cutaneous/*diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Leishmaniasis, Visceral/*diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Morocco']",['NOTNLM'],"['Cutaneous leishmaniasis', 'Infants', 'Leishmania infantum', 'Leishmania tropica', 'Morocco', 'Visceral leishmaniasis']",2018/04/13 06:00,2018/09/05 06:00,['2018/04/13 06:00'],"['2017/06/21 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40249-018-0413-8 [doi]', '10.1186/s40249-018-0413-8 [pii]']",epublish,Infect Dis Poverty. 2018 Apr 12;7(1):32. doi: 10.1186/s40249-018-0413-8.,,,,PMC5896130,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Holotoxin A(1) is a triterpene glycoside found in the edible sea cucumber, Apostichopus (Stichopus) japonicus. We previously showed that cladoloside C(2), the 25(26)-dihydro derivative of holotoxin A(1) induced apoptosis in human leukemia cells by activating ceramide synthase 6. Thus, we hypothesized that holotoxin A(1), which is structurally similar to cladoloside C(2), might induce apoptosis in human leukemia cells through the same molecular mechanism. In this paper, we compared holotoxin A(1) and cladoloside C(2) for killing potency and mechanism of action. We found that holotoxin A(1) induced apoptosis more potently than cladoloside C(2). Moreover, holotoxin A(1)-induced apoptosis in K562 cells by activating caspase-8 and caspase-3, but not by activating caspase-9. During holotoxin A(1)-induced apoptosis, acid sphingomyelinase (SMase) and neutral SMase were activated in both K562 cells and human primary leukemia cells. Specifically inhibiting acid SMase and neutral SMsmall a, Cyrillicse with chemical inhibitors or siRNAs significantly inhibited holotoxin A(1)-induced apoptosis. These results indicated that holotoxin A(1) might induce apoptosis by activating acid SMase and neutral SMase. In conclusion, holotoxin A(1) represents a potential anticancer agent for treating leukemia. Moreover, the aglycone structure of marine triterpene glycosides might affect the mechanism involved in inducing apoptosis.","['Yun, Seong-Hoon', 'Sim, Eun-Hye', 'Han, Sang-Heum', 'Han, Jin-Yeong', 'Kim, Sung-Hyun', 'Silchenko, Alexandra S', 'Stonik, Valentin A', 'Park, Joo-In']","['Yun SH', 'Sim EH', 'Han SH', 'Han JY', 'Kim SH', 'Silchenko AS', 'Stonik VA', 'Park JI']","['Department of Biochemistry, Dong-A University College of Medicine, Busan 49201, Korea. tpohot10@nate.com.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Dong-A University College of Medicine, Busan 49201, Korea. ehsim@dau.ac.kr.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Dong-A University College of Medicine, Busan 49201, Korea. idhsh371@naver.com.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Dong-A University College of Medicine, Busan 49201, Korea. jyhan@dau.ac.kr.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Dong-A University College of Medicine, Busan 49201, Korea. kskmoon@dau.ac.kr.', 'G.B.

The present review describes the main deletions, amplifications, sequence mutations, epigenetic lesions, and new structural DNA rearrangements detected by NGS in B-ALL and T-ALL and their clinical importance for therapeutic procedures. We reviewed the molecular basis of pathways including transcriptional regulation, lymphoid differentiation and development, TP53 and the cell cycle, RAS signaling, JAK/STAT, NOTCH, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, chromatin structure modifiers, and epigenetic regulators. The implementation of NGS strategies has enabled important mutated genes in each pathway, their associations with the genetic subtypes of ALL, and their outcomes, which will be described further. We also discuss classic and new cryptic DNA rearrangements in ALL identified by mRNA-seq strategies. Novel cooperative abnormalities in ALL could be key prognostic and/or predictive biomarkers for selecting the best frontline treatment and for developing therapies after the first relapse or refractory disease.","['Montano, Adrian', 'Forero-Castro, Maribel', 'Marchena-Mendoza, Darnel', 'Benito, Rocio', 'Hernandez-Rivas, Jesus Maria']","['Montano A', 'Forero-Castro M', 'Marchena-Mendoza D', 'Benito R', 'Hernandez-Rivas JM']","['IBSAL, IBMCC, Universidad de Salamanca-CSIC, Cancer Research Center, 37007 Salamanca, Spain. adrianmo18@gmail.com.', 'Escuela de Ciencias Biologicas, Grupo de investigacion en Ciencias Biomedicas (GICBUPTC), Universidad Pedagogica y Tecnologica de Colombia, Tunja 150001, Colombia. maribel.forero@uptc.edu.co.', 'IBSAL, IBMCC, Universidad de Salamanca-CSIC, Cancer Research Center, 37007 Salamanca, Spain. darnelmarchena@hotmail.com.', 'Escuela de Ciencias Biologicas, Grupo de investigacion en Ciencias Biomedicas (GICBUPTC), Universidad Pedagogica y Tecnologica de Colombia, Tunja 150001, Colombia. darnelmarchena@hotmail.com.', 'IBSAL, IBMCC, Universidad de Salamanca-CSIC, Cancer Research Center, 37007 Salamanca, Spain. beniroc@usal.es.', 'Universidad de Salamanca-CSIC, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, 37007 Salamanca, Spain. jmhr@usal.es.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-3178-6726', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5205-8891', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6789-473X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9781-4198']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180407,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['NGS', 'fusion genes', 'mutations', 'pathways']",2018/04/13 06:00,2018/04/13 06:01,['2018/04/13 06:00'],"['2018/03/02 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/03 00:00 [revised]', '2018/04/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/13 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers10040110 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers10040110 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2018 Apr 7;10(4). pii: cancers10040110. doi: 10.3390/cancers10040110.,,,,PMC5923365,,,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,

Acquired or intrinsic drug resistance is responsible for almost 90% of treatment failure. For this reason, there is an urgent need for new anticancer drugs with improved efficacy against cancer cells, and with less toxicity on normal cells. There are impressive examples demonstrating the success of natural plant compounds to fight cancer, such as Vinca alkaloids, taxanes, and anthracyclines. Artesunic acid (ARTA), a drug for malaria treatment, also exerts cytotoxic activity towards cancer cells. Multidrug resistance often results from drug efflux pumps (ABC-transporters) that reduce intracellular drug levels. Hence, it would be interesting to know, whether ARTA could overcome drug resistance of tumor cells, and in what way ABC-transporters are involved. Different derivatives showing improved features concerning cytotoxicity and pharmacokinetic behavior have been developed. Considering both drug sensitivity and resistance, we chose a sensitive and a doxorubicin-resistant leukemia cell line and determined the killing effect of ARTA on these cells. Molecular docking and doxorubicin efflux assays were performed to investigate the interaction of the derivatives with P-glycoprotein. Using single-cell gel electrophoresis (alkaline comet assay), we showed that the derivatives of ARTA induce DNA breakage and accordingly programmed cell death, which represents a promising strategy in cancer treatment. ARTA activated apoptosis in cancer cells by the iron-mediated generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In conclusion, ARTA derivatives may bear the potential to be further developed as anticancer drugs.","['Gruber, Lisa', 'Abdelfatah, Sara', 'Frohlich, Tony', 'Reiter, Christoph', 'Klein, Volker', 'Tsogoeva, Svetlana B', 'Efferth, Thomas']","['Gruber L', 'Abdelfatah S', 'Frohlich T', 'Reiter C', 'Klein V', 'Tsogoeva SB', 'Efferth T']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Institute of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, Johannes Gutenberg University, 55128 Mainz, Germany. gruber.lisa@googlemail.com.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Institute of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, Johannes Gutenberg University, 55128 Mainz, Germany. saabdelf@uni-mainz.de.', 'Department of Chemistry and Pharmacy, Organic Chemistry Chair I and Interdisciplinary Center for Molecular Materials (ICMM), University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, 91058 Erlangen, Germany. tony.froehlich@fau.de.', 'Department of Chemistry and Pharmacy, Organic Chemistry Chair I and Interdisciplinary Center for Molecular Materials (ICMM), University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, 91058 Erlangen, Germany. christoph.reiter@fau.de.', 'Department of Chemistry and Pharmacy, Organic Chemistry Chair I and Interdisciplinary Center for Molecular Materials (ICMM), University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, 91058 Erlangen, Germany. volker.klein@fau.de.', 'Department of Chemistry and Pharmacy, Organic Chemistry Chair I and Interdisciplinary Center for Molecular Materials (ICMM), University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, 91058 Erlangen, Germany. svetlana.tsogoeva@fau.de.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Institute of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, Johannes Gutenberg University, 55128 Mainz, Germany. efferth@uni-mainz.de.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9186-2516', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1681-866X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4845-0951']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180406,Switzerland,Molecules,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",100964009,"['0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Artemisinins)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (Succinates)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '88495-63-0 (artesunic acid)']",IM,"['ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Artemisinins/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Benzoquinones/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Succinates/chemistry/*pharmacology']",['NOTNLM'],"['artemisinin, egonol, thymoquinone, hybrids', 'chemotherapy', 'multi-drug resistance']",2018/04/13 06:00,2018/09/11 06:00,['2018/04/13 06:00'],"['2017/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/28 00:00 [revised]', '2018/04/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/11 06:00 [medline]']","['molecules23040841 [pii]', '10.3390/molecules23040841 [doi]']",epublish,Molecules. 2018 Apr 6;23(4). pii: molecules23040841. doi: 10.3390/molecules23040841.,,,,PMC6017613,,,['The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,

Although most ERVs have lost their viral productivity, a few ERVs retain their replication capacity. In addition, partially inactivated ERVs can present a potential risk to the host via their encoded virulence factors or the generation of novel viruses by viral recombination. ERVs can also eventually acquire a biological function, and this ability has been a driving force of host evolution. Therefore, the presence of an ERV can be harmful or beneficial to the host. Various reports about paleovirology have revealed each event in ERV evolution, but the continuous processes of ERV evolution over millions of years are mainly unknown. A unique ERV family, ERV-DC, is present in the domestic cat (Felis silvestriscatus) genome. ERV-DC proviruses are phylogenetically classified into three genotypes, and the specific characteristics of each genotype have been clarified: their capacity to produce infectious viruses; their recombination with other retroviruses, such as feline leukemia virus or RD-114; and their biological functions as host antiviral factors.

INTERVENTIONS: Surgery was the initial treatment option. Chemotherapy including idarubicin (70 mg, D1-D3) and cytosine arabinoside (100 mg, D1-D7) and radiotherapy of total 3,060 cGy were then administered but failed to control the disease. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was finally administered. OUTCOMES: No evidence of disease progression or spread according to the latest follow-up. LESSONS: The etiology of nonleukemic granulocytic still remains unclear, though trauma seems to be a potential predisposing factor and deserves more attention for early diagnosis and timely and proper treatment. Systemic chemotherapy is more effective than radiotherapy or surgery. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is an alternative choice after the failure of chemotherapy.","['Cheng, Yuan', ""Yu, Chun'e"", 'Zhu, Sha', 'Guo, Linghong', 'Zhang, Yi', 'Zhang, Yiwen', 'Ma, Xuelei']","['Cheng Y', 'Yu C', 'Zhu S', 'Guo L', 'Zhang Y', 'Zhang Y', 'Ma X']","[""State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University and Collaborative Innovation Center, Chengdu, People's Republic of China.""]",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Causality', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage', 'Early Detection of Cancer/methods', 'Eye Injuries/*epidemiology', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/*administration & dosage', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods', 'Ophthalmologic Surgical Procedures/*methods', 'Orbit/diagnostic imaging/surgery', '*Orbital Neoplasms/epidemiology/pathology/physiopathology/therapy', 'Radiotherapy/*methods', '*Sarcoma, Myeloid/epidemiology/pathology/physiopathology/therapy', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed/methods', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Wounds, Nonpenetrating/epidemiology']",,,2018/04/12 06:00,2018/04/24 06:00,['2018/04/12 06:00'],"['2018/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000010373 [doi]', '00005792-201804130-00052 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2018 Apr;97(15):e0373. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000010373.,,,,PMC5908642,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENT CONCERNS: Here we describe the case of a 56-year-old man presented with melena and epigastric dull pain for 2 weeks. DIAGNOSIS: Primary gastric epithelioid angiosarcomas: the definitive diagnosis was provided by immunohistochemical analysis with endothelial markers such as cluster of differentiation 31 (CD31), ether-a-go-go-related gene (ERG), and Freund leukemia integration (FLI-1). INTERVENTIONS: After gastroscopic biopsy was performed at the bleeding fundus and the results suggested malignant tumor, radical gastrectomy was performed. OUTCOMES: Unfortunately, regional lymph node enlargement and distant metastases occurred about 1 month later. The patient did not have the opportunity to undergo chemotherapy or other treatment and died from multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. LESSONS: Primary gastric epithelioid angiosarcomas are rare tumors with a high rate of lymph nodes and peripheral organs metastasis. The strong cytokeratin expression in epithelioid angiosarcomas represents a diagnostic pitfall for pathologists. Their clinical behaviors are unpredictable and results with surgical excision alone have been disappointing. Thus, the prognosis is generally considered poor and patients seldom can survive over 1 year after diagnosis.","['Xia, Jie', 'Shi, DiKe', 'Wu, ZhiWei', 'Chen, Yang', 'Liu, BaoQing', 'Chen, Li', 'Metta, Wongkamchai', 'Zheng, YiXiong']","['Xia J', 'Shi D', 'Wu Z', 'Chen Y', 'Liu B', 'Chen L', 'Metta W', 'Zheng Y']","['Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.']",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Ether-A-Go-Go Potassium Channels)', '0 (FLII protein, human)', '0 (Microfilament Proteins)', '0 (Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Vimentin)']",IM,"['Abdominal Pain/*diagnosis/etiology', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Biopsy/methods', 'Ether-A-Go-Go Potassium Channels/analysis', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Gastroscopy/*methods', 'Hemangioendothelioma, Epithelioid/diagnosis/pathology/surgery', '*Hemangiosarcoma/diagnosis/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods', 'Male', 'Microfilament Proteins/analysis', 'Middle Aged', '*Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/diagnosis/pathology', 'Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/analysis', '*Stomach Neoplasms/diagnosis/pathology/surgery', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed/methods', 'Trans-Activators', 'Vimentin/analysis']",,,2018/04/12 06:00,2018/04/18 06:00,['2018/04/12 06:00'],"['2018/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000010287 [doi]', '00005792-201804130-00013 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2018 Apr;97(15):e0287. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000010287.,,,,PMC5908581,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirteen CLL patients and 20 controls (10 with pancreatic adenocarcinoma and 10 with mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma) with histologically proven cancer underwent [Ga]Ga-Pentixafor positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging. Standardized [Ga]Ga-Pentixafor uptake values (SUVmax, SUVmean) were measured in the bone marrow of the pelvis, the lumbar vertebra L4, and the bony structure with the visually highest tracer uptake (""hottest lesion""). Mean apparent diffusion coefficient values were also measured in the pelvis. Serum leukocyte count (gram per liter), lymphocyte percentage (percent), lactate dehydrogenase (unit per liter), beta2-microglobulin (milligram per deciliter), and C-reactive protein (milligram per deciliter) were measured. Statistical analyses comprised analysis of variance with Games-Howell post hoc tests and Spearman correlation coefficients. RESULTS: SUVmax and SUVmean differed significantly between CLL and pancreatic adenocarcinoma in the pelvis (P = 0.032 and P = 0.008) and lumbar vertebra L4 (both P < 0.001). SUVmean also differed in the pelvis (P = 0.020) and L4 (P = 0.041), and SUVmax in L4 (P = 0.019), between CLL and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. Receiver operating characteristic-based areas under the curve for separation of CLL from the control groups were greatest for the SUVmax of the bony structure with the strongest [Ga]Ga-Pentixafor uptake (0.94) and the SUVmax of L4 (0.92). There was no significant correlation between [Ga]Ga-Pentixafor uptake and pelvic apparent diffusion coefficients or serum parameters. CONCLUSIONS: [Ga]Ga-Pentixafor positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging may possibly be useful for CXCR4-based CLL imaging.","['Mayerhoefer, Marius E', 'Jaeger, Ulrich', 'Staber, Philipp', 'Raderer, Markus', 'Wadsak, Wolfgang', 'Pfaff, Sarah', 'Kornauth, Christoph', 'Senn, Daniela', 'Weber, Michael', 'Wester, Hans-Juergen', 'Skrabs, Cathrin', 'Haug, Alexander']","['Mayerhoefer ME', 'Jaeger U', 'Staber P', 'Raderer M', 'Wadsak W', 'Pfaff S', 'Kornauth C', 'Senn D', 'Weber M', 'Wester HJ', 'Skrabs C', 'Haug A']","['From the Division of General and Pediatric Radiology, Department of Biomedical Imaging and Image-Guided Therapy.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, and.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, and.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, and.', 'Division of Nuclear Medicine, Department of Biomedical Imaging and Image-Guided Therapy, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, and.', 'Division of Nuclear Medicine, Department of Biomedical Imaging and Image-Guided Therapy, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna.', 'From the Division of General and Pediatric Radiology, Department of Biomedical Imaging and Image-Guided Therapy.', 'Pharmaceutical Radiochemistry, Technical University of Munich, Garching, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, and.', 'Division of Nuclear Medicine, Department of Biomedical Imaging and Image-Guided Therapy, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Invest Radiol,Investigative radiology,0045377,"['0 (68Ga-pentixafor)', '0 (CXCR4 protein, human)', '0 (Coordination Complexes)', '0 (Peptides, Cyclic)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Coordination Complexes', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnostic imaging/genetics', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging/*methods', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multimodal Imaging/methods', '*Peptides, Cyclic', 'Positron-Emission Tomography/*methods', 'Prospective Studies', 'Receptors, CXCR4/*genetics']",,,2018/04/12 06:00,2019/04/18 06:00,['2018/04/12 06:00'],"['2018/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/18 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/RLI.0000000000000469 [doi]'],ppublish,Invest Radiol. 2018 Jul;53(7):403-408. doi: 10.1097/RLI.0000000000000469.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite this, little is understood of the factors that enforce appropriate physiological levels of MSI2 in the blood system. Here, we define a promoter region that reports on endogenous expression of MSI2 and identify USF2 and PLAG1 as transcription factors whose promoter binding drives reporter activity. We show that these factors co-regulate, and are required for, efficient transactivation of endogenous MSI2. Coincident overexpression of USF2 and PLAG1 in primitive cord blood cells enhanced MSI2 transcription and yielded cellular phenotypes, including expansion of CD34+ cells in vitro, consistent with that achieved by direct MSI2 overexpression. Global chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing analyses confirm a preferential co-binding of PLAG1 and USF2 at the promoter of MSI2, as well as regulatory regions corresponding to genes with roles in HSPC homeostasis. PLAG1 and USF2 cooperation is thus an important contributor to stem cell-specific expression of MSI2 and HSPC-specific transcriptional circuitry.","['Belew, Muluken S', 'Bhatia, Sonam', 'Keyvani Chahi, Ava', 'Rentas, Stefan', 'Draper, Jonathan S', 'Hope, Kristin J']","['Belew MS', 'Bhatia S', 'Keyvani Chahi A', 'Rentas S', 'Draper JS', 'Hope KJ']","['Department of Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences, Stem Cell and Cancer Research Institute, McMaster University, 1280 Main Street West, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences, Stem Cell and Cancer Research Institute, McMaster University, 1280 Main Street West, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences, Stem Cell and Cancer Research Institute, McMaster University, 1280 Main Street West, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences, Stem Cell and Cancer Research Institute, McMaster University, 1280 Main Street West, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences, Stem Cell and Cancer Research Institute, McMaster University, 1280 Main Street West, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences, Stem Cell and Cancer Research Institute, McMaster University, 1280 Main Street West, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada.

Here, we report that MEIS2, an essential regulator of adult SVZ neurogenesis, is subject to posttranslational regulation in the SVZ olfactory bulb neurogenic system. Nuclear accumulation of MEIS2 in adult SVZ-derived progenitor cells follows downregulation of EGFR signaling and is modulated by methylation of MEIS2 on a conserved arginine, which lies in close proximity to nested binding sites for the nuclear export receptor CRM1 and the MEIS dimerization partner PBX1. Methylation impairs interaction with CRM1 without affecting PBX1 dimerization and thereby allows MEIS2 nuclear accumulation, a prerequisite for neuronal differentiation. Our results describe a form of posttranscriptional modulation of adult SVZ neurogenesis whereby an extrinsic signal fine-tunes neurogenesis through posttranslational modification of a transcriptional regulator of cell fate.","['Kolb, Jasmine', 'Anders-Maurer, Marie', 'Muller, Tanja', 'Hau, Ann-Christin', 'Grebbin, Britta Moyo', 'Kallenborn-Gerhardt, Wiebke', 'Behrends, Christian', 'Schulte, Dorothea']","['Kolb J', 'Anders-Maurer M', 'Muller T', 'Hau AC', 'Grebbin BM', 'Kallenborn-Gerhardt W', 'Behrends C', 'Schulte D']","['Institute of Neurology, Edinger Institute, University Hospital Frankfurt, 60528 Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute of Neurology, Edinger Institute, University Hospital Frankfurt, 60528 Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute of Neurology, Edinger Institute, University Hospital Frankfurt, 60528 Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute of Neurology, Edinger Institute, University Hospital Frankfurt, 60528 Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute of Neurology, Edinger Institute, University Hospital Frankfurt, 60528 Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy, Goethe University, 60438 Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute of Biochemistry II, University Hospital Frankfurt, 60528 Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute of Neurology, Edinger Institute, University Hospital Frankfurt, 60528 Frankfurt, Germany.

Four main SNPs (rs3780367, rs10974944, rs12343867, and rs1159782) generating a ""GGCC"" combination are more frequently indicated to represent the JAK2 haplotype.

METHODS: A total 50 survivors of ALL (median age: 10.5 years; post-treatment interval 4.54 +/- 2.48 years), and 20 healthy children (median age: 11 years) were included in the study. Anthropometric measurements were taken, and serum glucose, insulin, homeostasis model assessment and IR index (HOMA-IR index), lipoprotein, thyroid hormone levels, and OPN levels were measured. RESULTS: Twenty-one (42%) survivors were overweight/obese, 2 (5.1%) survivors had MetS, 7 (14%) survivors had IR, and 19 (38%) survivors had dyslipidemia. Fasting insulin levels and HOMA-IR of the overweight/obese survivors were significantly higher than those of the normal-weight survivors (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01) and control group (p < 0.01 and p < 0.01). The serum OPN level was significantly lower in the overweight/obese survivor than in the normal-weight survivor and control group (37.42 ng/mL [range, 27.32-62.07], 69.02 ng/mL [range, 40.29-88.21], and 85.7 ng/mL [range 67.7-102.3]; p < 0.01, p < 0.001, respectively). Serum OPN levels were inversely correlated with anthropometric measurements and HOMA-IR index in all the subjects. CONCLUSION: Our results showed that obesity and IR are associated with decreased serum OPN levels in childhood survivors of ALL.","['Ozdemir, Zeynep Canan', 'Duzenli Kar, Yeter', 'Demiral, Meliha', 'Sirmagul, Basar', 'Bor, Ozcan', 'Kirel, Birgul']","['Ozdemir ZC', 'Duzenli Kar Y', 'Demiral M', 'Sirmagul B', 'Bor O', 'Kirel B']","['1 Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Eskisehir Osmangazi University , Ekisehir, Turkey .', '1 Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Eskisehir Osmangazi University , Ekisehir, Turkey .', '2 Department of Pediatric Endocrinology, Eskisehir Osmangazi University , Ekisehir, Turkey .', '3 Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Eskisehir Osmangazi University , Ekisehir, Turkey .', '1 Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Eskisehir Osmangazi University , Ekisehir, Turkey .', '2 Department of Pediatric Endocrinology, Eskisehir Osmangazi University , Ekisehir, Turkey .']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180312,United States,J Adolesc Young Adult Oncol,Journal of adolescent and young adult oncology,101543508,['106441-73-0 (Osteopontin)'],IM,"['Cancer Survivors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Metabolic Syndrome', 'Osteopontin', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/*metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Survivors']",['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*childhood', '*metabolic syndrome', '*osteopontin', '*survivor']",2018/04/12 06:00,2019/09/19 06:00,['2018/04/12 06:00'],"['2018/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/19 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/jayao.2017.0129 [doi]'],ppublish,J Adolesc Young Adult Oncol. 2018 Aug;7(4):480-487. doi: 10.1089/jayao.2017.0129.

Here, we expand on those findings by providing a preclinical evaluation of allogeneic non-viral cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells transfected with the Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon CD19CAR (CARCIK-CD19). Specifically, thanks to a large-scale 18-day manufacturing process, it was possible to achieve stable CD19CAR expression (62.425 +/- 6.399%) and efficient T-cell expansion (23.36 +/- 3.00-fold). Frozen/thawed CARCIK-CD19 remained fully functional both in vitro and in an established patient-derived xenograft (PDX) of MLL-ENL rearranged acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). CARCIK-CD19 showed a dose-dependent antitumor response and prolonged persistence in a PDX, bearing the feature of a Philadelphia-like ALL with PAX5/AUTS2 translocation, and in a survival model of lymphoma, achieving complete eradication of disseminated tumors. Finally, the infusion of CARCIK-CD19 proved to be safe and well tolerated in a biodistribution and toxicity model. The infused cells persisted in the hematopoietic and post-injection perfused organs until the end of the study and consisted of CD8(+), CD56(+), and CAR(+) T cells. Overall, these findings provide important implications for non-viral technology and the proof-of-concept that donor-derived CARCIK-CD19 are indeed effective against relapsed ALL, a possibility that will be tested in Phase I/II clinical trials after allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation.","['Magnani, Chiara F', 'Mezzanotte, Claudia', 'Cappuzzello, Claudia', 'Bardini, Michela', 'Tettamanti, Sarah', 'Fazio, Grazia', 'Cooper, Laurence J N', 'Dastoli, Giuseppe', 'Cazzaniga, Giovanni', 'Biondi, Andrea', 'Biagi, Ettore']","['Magnani CF', 'Mezzanotte C', 'Cappuzzello C', 'Bardini M', 'Tettamanti S', 'Fazio G', 'Cooper LJN', 'Dastoli G', 'Cazzaniga G', 'Biondi A', 'Biagi E']","['1 Tettamanti Research Center, Department of Pediatrics, University of Milano-Bicocca , San Gerardo Hospital/Fondazione MBBM, Monza, Italy.', '1 Tettamanti Research Center, Department of Pediatrics, University of Milano-Bicocca , San Gerardo Hospital/Fondazione MBBM, Monza, Italy.', '1 Tettamanti Research Center, Department of Pediatrics, University of Milano-Bicocca , San Gerardo Hospital/Fondazione MBBM, Monza, Italy.', '1 Tettamanti Research Center, Department of Pediatrics, University of Milano-Bicocca , San Gerardo Hospital/Fondazione MBBM, Monza, Italy.', '1 Tettamanti Research Center, Department of Pediatrics, University of Milano-Bicocca , San Gerardo Hospital/Fondazione MBBM, Monza, Italy.', '1 Tettamanti Research Center, Department of Pediatrics, University of Milano-Bicocca , San Gerardo Hospital/Fondazione MBBM, Monza, Italy.', '2 University of Texas , MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', '1 Tettamanti Research Center, Department of Pediatrics, University of Milano-Bicocca , San Gerardo Hospital/Fondazione MBBM, Monza, Italy.', '1 Tettamanti Research Center, Department of Pediatrics, University of Milano-Bicocca , San Gerardo Hospital/Fondazione MBBM, Monza, Italy.', '1 Tettamanti Research Center, Department of Pediatrics, University of Milano-Bicocca , San Gerardo Hospital/Fondazione MBBM, Monza, Italy.', '1 Tettamanti Research Center, Department of Pediatrics, University of Milano-Bicocca , San Gerardo Hospital/Fondazione MBBM, Monza, Italy.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180416,United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (CD19-specific chimeric antigen receptor)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD19/genetics/immunology/therapeutic use', 'Cytokine-Induced Killer Cells/*immunology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics/therapeutic use', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Mice', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Transfection', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Sleeping Beauty transposon', '*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*chimeric antigen receptor', '*cytokine-induced killer cells']",2018/04/12 06:00,2019/05/18 06:00,['2018/04/12 06:00'],"['2018/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/18 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/hum.2017.207 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2018 May;29(5):602-613. doi: 10.1089/hum.2017.207.

Nearly all MM tumor cells express BCMA, while normal tissue expression is restricted to plasma cells and a subset of mature B cells. Consistent BCMA expression was confirmed on MM biopsies (29/29 BCMA+), and it was further demonstrated that BCMA is expressed in a substantial number of lymphoma samples, as well as primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia B cells. To target BCMA using redirected autologous T cells, lentiviral vectors (LVV) encoding chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) were constructed with four unique anti-BCMA single-chain variable fragments, fused to the CD137 (4-1BB) co-stimulatory and CD3zeta signaling domains. One LVV, BB2121, was studied in detail, and BB2121 CAR-transduced T cells (bb2121) exhibited a high frequency of CAR + T cells and robust in vitro activity against MM cell lines, lymphoma cell lines, and primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia peripheral blood. Based on receptor quantification, bb2121 recognized tumor cells expressing as little as 222 BCMA molecules per cell. The in vivo pharmacology of anti-BCMA CAR T cells was studied in NSG mouse models of human MM, Burkitt lymphoma, and mantle cell lymphoma, where mice received a single intravenous administration of vehicle, control vector-transduced T cells, or anti-BCMA CAR-transduced T cells. In all models, the vehicle and control CAR T cells failed to inhibit tumor growth. In contrast, treatment with bb2121 resulted in rapid and sustained elimination of the tumors and 100% survival in all treatment models. Together, these data support the further development of anti-BCMA CAR T cells as a potential treatment for not only MM but also some lymphomas.","['Friedman, Kevin M', 'Garrett, Tracy E', 'Evans, John W', 'Horton, Holly M', 'Latimer, Howard J', 'Seidel, Stacie L', 'Horvath, Christopher J', 'Morgan, Richard A']","['Friedman KM', 'Garrett TE', 'Evans JW', 'Horton HM', 'Latimer HJ', 'Seidel SL', 'Horvath CJ', 'Morgan RA']","['bluebird bio , Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'bluebird bio , Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'bluebird bio , Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'bluebird bio , Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'bluebird bio , Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'bluebird bio , Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'bluebird bio , Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'bluebird bio , Cambridge, Massachusetts.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (B-Cell Maturation Antigen)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (CD3 antigen, zeta chain)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 9)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Cell Maturation Antigen/*antagonists & inhibitors/immunology', 'CD3 Complex/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/genetics/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Lentivirus/genetics', 'Mice', 'Multiple Myeloma/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Receptors, Chimeric Antigen/*immunology/therapeutic use', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 9/genetics/immunology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",['NOTNLM'],"['*BCMA', '*CAR', '*adoptive cell therapy', '*gene therapy', '*immunotherapy', '*multiple myeloma']",2018/04/12 06:00,2019/05/18 06:00,['2018/04/12 06:00'],"['2018/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/18 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/hum.2018.001 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2018 May;29(5):585-601. doi: 10.1089/hum.2018.001.,,,,PMC5930946,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Herein, we describe the identification of a nature-product-derived micheliolide (MCL) that selectively activates PKM2 through the covalent binding at residue cysteine424 (C424), which is not contained in PKM1. This interaction promotes more tetramer formation, inhibits the lysine433 (K433) acetylation, and influences the translocation of PKM2 into the nucleus. In addition, the pro-drug dimethylaminomicheliolide (DMAMCL) with similar properties as MCL significantly suppresses the growth of leukemia cells and tumorigenesis in a zebrafish xenograft model. Cell-based assay with knock down PKM2 expression verifies that the effects of MCL are dependent on PKM2 expression. DMAMCL is currently in clinical trials in Australia. Our discovery may provide a valuable pharmacological mechanism for clinical treatment and benefit the development of new anticancer agents.","['Li, Jing', 'Li, Shanshan', 'Guo, Jianshuang', 'Li,

However, due to the size overlap between leukemia cells and the more abundant white blood cells (WBCs), the isolation and identification of leukemia cells individually from peripheral blood is extremely challenging and often requires immunolabeling or cytogenetic assays. Here we present a rapid and label-free single leukemia cell identification platform that combines: (1) high-throughput size-based separation of hemocytes via a single-cell trapping array, and (2) leukemia cell identification through phasor approach and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (phasor-FLIM), to quantify changes between free/bound nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) as an indirect measurement of metabolic alteration in living cells. The microfluidic trapping array designed with 1600 highly-packed addressable single-cell traps can simultaneously filter out red blood cells (RBCs) and trap WBCs/leukemia cells, and is compatible with low-magnification imaging and fast-speed fluorescence screening. The trapped single leukemia cells, e.g., THP-1, Jurkat and K562 cells, are distinguished from WBCs in the phasor-FLIM lifetime map, as they exhibit significant shift towards shorter fluorescence lifetime and a higher ratio of free/bound NADH compared to WBCs, because of their glycolysis-dominant metabolism for rapid proliferation. Based on a multiparametric scheme comparing the eight parameter-spectra of the phasor-FLIM signatures, spiked leukemia cells are quantitatively distinguished from normal WBCs with an area-under-the-curve (AUC) value of 1.00. Different leukemia cell lines are also quantitatively distinguished from each other with AUC values higher than 0.95, demonstrating high sensitivity and specificity for single cell analysis.

However, its role in characteristics of monocytic leukemia cells was rarely reported. In this study, we assessed the role of IL-4 in tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) sensitivity of human monocytes. After incubation with IL-4 for 24 h, death receptor 4 (DR4) was significantly increased without downregulation of TRAIL decoy receptors and antiapoptotic proteins in THP-1 monocytes, and human primary monocytes and U-937 cells also exhibited increased TRAIL-induced apoptosis compared with control. Enhancement of TRAIL-mediated apoptosis by IL-4 was blocked by anti-DR4-neutralizing antibodies. Both upregulation of DR4 and enhancement of TRAIL-mediated apoptosis by IL-4 could be blocked by inhibitors of Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT), phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase to varying degrees. Thus, our data demonstrated a novel effect on TRAIL sensitivity on monocytes and monocytic leukemia cells of IL-4 and suggested that it may be necessary to reconsider the impact of current therapies against IL-4, JAK/STAT, and PI3K/Akt pathways with regard to TRAIL sensitivity.","['Zhang, Shujun', 'Li, Zhuan', 'Huang, Wenxiang']","['Zhang S', 'Li Z', 'Huang W']","['1 Chongqing Key Laboratory of Infectious Diseases and Parasitic Diseases, Department of Infectious Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University , Chongqing, China .', '2 Liver Center, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Kansas Medical Center , Kansas City, Kansas.', '1 Chongqing Key Laboratory of Infectious Diseases and Parasitic Diseases, Department of Infectious Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University , Chongqing, China .']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180319,United States,J Interferon Cytokine Res,Journal of interferon & cytokine research : the official journal of the International Society for Interferon and Cytokine Research,9507088,"['0 (IL4 protein, human)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFRSF10A protein, human)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-4/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Monocytes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*metabolism', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation/*drug effects']",['NOTNLM'],"['*death receptor 4', '*interleukin-4', '*monocyte', '*tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand']",2018/04/12 06:00,2019/09/12 06:00,['2018/04/12 06:00'],"['2018/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/jir.2017.0103 [doi]'],ppublish,J Interferon Cytokine Res. 2018 Apr;38(4):186-194. doi: 10.1089/jir.2017.0103.

Etiology of MS is undiscovered but it is assumed that both genetic and environmental triggers play an important role in disease pathogenesis. Mitoxantrone (MTX) is an antracycline antibiotic that is used in oncologic treatment of breast, prostate, liver, ovarian and stomach cancer. MTX is also effective in treatment of primary and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis and in relapsing - remitting subtype of disease with no reaction for other drugs therapy. In treatment of MS drug is given intravenously in a dose of 12 mg/m2 in three months intervals to maximal dose of 120-140 mg/m(2) of body surface. MTX treatment can cause transient reduction of leukocyte, erythrocyte and thrombocyte number in blood but the most dangerous side effect of MTX treatment is therapy related acute leukemia (TRAL). The aim of this study was to evaluate influence of MTX treatment on complete blood count in multiple sclerosis patients. Seventy two patients with multiple sclerosis treated with mitoxantrone from 2002 to 2014 took part in this study. Control group comprised 60 patients with multiple sclerosis who weren't given immunomodulatory treatment. In this study, amount of leukocytes, erythrocytes and thrombocytes after MTX treatment was compared to those before treatment and in control group. Six patients were withdrawn from the study because of leucopenia. A decrease of leukocytes, erythrocytes and thrombocytes number after MTX treatment was observed in comparison to control group and value before treatment. The decrease of erythrocytes number after MTX treatment was statistically significant. The most frequent side effect of mitoxantrone treatment is transient, asymptomatic leucopenia. Therapy related acute leukemia and other life-threatening complications weren't observed in the study group.","['Pastuszak, Zanna', 'Stepien, Adam', 'Tomczykiewicz, Kazimierz', 'Piusinska-Macoch, Renata']","['Pastuszak Z', 'Stepien A', 'Tomczykiewicz K', 'Piusinska-Macoch R']",,,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Poland,Acta Pol Pharm,Acta poloniae pharmaceutica,2985167R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', '*Blood Cell Count', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Multiple Sclerosis/blood/*drug therapy']",,,2016/09/01 00:00,2016/09/01 00:01,['2018/04/12 06:00'],"['2018/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/01 00:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Acta Pol Pharm. 2016 Sep;73(5):1369-1373.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The human model included measurement of: viability of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), phytohemagglutinin A (PHA)-induced proliferation of PBMC, production of tumor necrosis factor a (TNF a) in whole blood cultures stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and growth of SW-948 and L1210 tumor cell lines. Experiments in mice encompassed the following tests: secondary, humoral immune response splenocytes to sheep erythrocytes (SRBC) in vitiv, delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) to ovalbumin (OVA) and carrageenan-induced foot edema. All compounds were non-toxic against PMBC and displayed differential, dose-dependent suppressive properties in the model of PHA- induced PMBC proliferation. They also exhibited differential, mostly inhibitory effects on TNF a production. The inhibitory actions on growth of tumor cell lines were moderate. M05 (5-amino-3-methyl-N-(4-methyl-benzyl)-4-isoxazolecarboxamide) was most suppressive in the proliferation and TNF a production tests, it was, therefore, selected for in vitro and in vivo studies in the mouse models. The compound inhibited the humoral immune response in vitro, stimulated the inductive phase of DTH in vivo, although it inhibited the eliciting phase of that response. The compound also inhibited the carrageenan skin reaction. M05 combines strong anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory activities, it is therefore attractive for further studies in more advanced animal models as a potential therapeutic.","['Maczynski, Marcin', 'Artym, Jolanta', 'Kocieba, Maja', 'Sockacka-Cwikla, Aleksandra', 'Drozd-Szczygiel, Ewa', 'Ryng, Stanislaw', 'Zimecki, Michal']","['Maczynski M', 'Artym J', 'Kocieba M', 'Sockacka-Cwikla A', 'Drozd-Szczygiel E', 'Ryng S', 'Zimecki M']",,,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Poland,Acta Pol Pharm,Acta poloniae pharmaceutica,2985167R,"['0 (Isoxazoles)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Humoral/drug effects', 'Isoxazoles/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis']",,,2016/09/01 00:00,2016/09/01 00:01,['2018/04/12 06:00'],"['2018/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/01 00:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Acta Pol Pharm. 2016 Sep;73(5):1201-1211.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: No excess deaths from lymphohematopoietic cancers (LHCs) were observed (SMR: 0.99, 95%CI: 0.74-1.30) when compared to the referent population; however, the relative risk increased with duration of employment in internal analyses. Conversely, lung cancer mortality was significantly elevated (SMR: 1.24, 95%CI: 1.08-1.41), but there was no evidence of a dose-response relationship. CONCLUSION: We found evidence that occupational exposure to styrene was associated with increased LHC risk, while no such association was observed for lung cancer.","['Bertke, Stephen J', 'Yiin, James H', 'Daniels, Robert D']","['Bertke SJ', 'Yiin JH', 'Daniels RD']","['National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Cincinnati, Ohio.', 'National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Cincinnati, Ohio.', 'National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Cincinnati, Ohio.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-3047-3816', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5935-1874', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3915-7991']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180411,United States,Am J Ind Med,American journal of industrial medicine,8101110,"['0 (Plastics)', '44LJ2U959V (Styrene)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Cohort Studies', 'Employment', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/mortality', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/mortality', 'Lung Neoplasms/mortality', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/mortality', 'Male', '*Manufacturing Industry', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/mortality', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Occupational Exposure/*statistics & numerical data', 'Plastics', 'Proportional Hazards Models', '*Ships', '*Styrene', 'Time Factors', 'Washington/epidemiology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Cox regression', '*exposure response', '*leukemia', '*reinforced plastics', '*styrene']",2018/04/12 06:00,2019/05/29 06:00,['2018/04/12 06:00'],"['2018/03/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/29 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajim.22853 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Ind Med. 2018 Jul;61(7):566-571. doi: 10.1002/ajim.22853.

PROCEDURE: The present study analyzed the data of 321 patients with B-NHL, enrolled in a pediatric clinical trial, comparing the treatment outcomes between adolescents (aged 15-18 years, n = 25) and children (</=15 years, n = 297), with a particular focus on the safety and tolerability of administering pediatric regimens to adolescents. RESULTS: The probability of event-free survival (EFS) at 4 years was 79.3 +/- 8.3% for the adolescents and 88.0 +/- 1.9% for the children (P = 0.236). After adjusting for treatment group and lactate dehydrogenase value at the time of diagnosis, the probability of 4-year EFS of adolescents was lower than that of children, but only in the patients with central nervous system positive lymphoma or Burkitt leukemia. The frequency of treatment-related mortalities, severe adverse events (SAEs), and SAEs leading to treatment discontinuation or treatment completion rate was similar in adolescent and pediatric patients. There was no difference in treatment duration between adolescent and pediatric patients. CONCLUSIONS: The treatment outcomes of adolescents with B-NHL were not statistically different from those of the pediatric patients and the safety of a pediatric regimen in adolescents was similar to that in the pediatric patients. A pediatric treatment foundation can be adopted for adolescents, although further prospective studies and biological investigations are required for treatment optimization.","['Sekimizu, Masahiro', 'Hashimoto, Hiroya', 'Mori, Tetsuya', 'Kobayashi, Ryoji', 'Horibe, Keizo', 'Tsurusawa, Masahito']","['Sekimizu M', 'Hashimoto H', 'Mori T', 'Kobayashi R', 'Horibe K', 'Tsurusawa M']","['Department of Pediatrics, National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center, Aichi, Japan.', 'Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center, Aichi, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, St. Marianna University, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology for Children and Adolescents, Sapporo Hokuyu Hospital, Hokkaido, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center, Aichi, Japan.', 'Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center, Aichi, Japan.', 'Advanced Medical Research Center, Aichi Medical University, Aichi, Japan.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9438-2673', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3937-0856']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20180410,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['*adolescent', '*efficacy', '*mature B-cell lymphoma', '*safety']",2018/04/11 06:00,2019/05/11 06:00,['2018/04/12 06:00'],"['2017/10/24 00:00 [received]', '2018/02/18 00:00 [revised]', '2018/03/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/11 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.27068 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2018 Aug;65(8):e27068. doi: 10.1002/pbc.27068.

Accordingly, this research address the rouleaux splitting problem in a realistic, efficient and automated way by considering the distance transform and local maxima of the rouleaux RBCs. Rouleaux RBCs are splitted by taking their local maxima as the centres to draw circles by mid-point circle algorithm. The resulting circles are further mapped with single RBC in Rouleaux to preserve its original shape.

However, its pharmacological research is restricted by low yields in submerged culture, which needs to be resolved immediately by biotechnology. In this work, a co-addition strategy was applied to promote CHA production based on related inhibitors' addition and precursors' addition, inspired by the biosynthetic pathway analysis of CHA. CHA production reached 53.87 mg/L by addition of 10 mM shikimate, 10 mM anthranilate, 20 mM tryptophan, and 10 mM alanine in shake flask. Compared to the control without addition of precursors, the activity of 3-deoxy-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phospahte (DAHP) synthase was significantly improved and the transcription levels of critical genes in shikimate pathway were up-regulated responded to the co-addition of precursors. The improvement of CHA production by co-addition of precursors was also successfully reproduced in the lab-scale bioreactor (5-L) system, in which CHA production reached 46.10 mg/L. This work demonstrated that precursors' co-addition was an effective strategy for increasing CHA production, and the information obtained might be useful to the further improvement of CHA on a large scale.","['Liu, Chang-Qing', 'Pan, Zheng-Hua', 'An, Fa-Liang', 'Lu, Yan-Hua']","['Liu CQ', 'Pan ZH', 'An FL', 'Lu YH']","[""State Key Laboratory of Bioreactor Engineering, East China University of Science and Technology, Box 283#, 130 Meilong Road, Shanghai, 200237, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Bioreactor Engineering, East China University of Science and Technology, Box 283#, 130 Meilong Road, Shanghai, 200237, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Bioreactor Engineering, East China University of Science and Technology, Box 283#, 130 Meilong Road, Shanghai, 200237, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Bioreactor Engineering, East China University of Science and Technology, Box 283#, 130 Meilong Road, Shanghai, 200237, People's Republic of China. luyanhua@ecust.edu.cn.""]",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180410,United States,Appl Biochem Biotechnol,Applied biochemistry and biotechnology,8208561,"['0 (Indole Alkaloids)', '0 (chaetominine)', '0 (ortho-Aminobenzoates)', '0YS975XI6W (anthranilic acid)', '29MS2WI2NU (Shikimic Acid)', '8DUH1N11BX (Tryptophan)', 'EC 2.5.1.54 (3-Deoxy-7-Phosphoheptulonate Synthase)', 'OF5P57N2ZX (Alanine)']",IM,"['3-Deoxy-7-Phosphoheptulonate Synthase/metabolism', 'Alanine/metabolism', 'Aspergillus fumigatus/*metabolism', 'Bioreactors', '*Fermentation', 'Humans', 'Indole Alkaloids/*metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Shikimic Acid/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tryptophan/metabolism', 'ortho-Aminobenzoates/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['Aspergillus fumigatus', 'Chaetominine', 'Co-addition strategy', 'Shikimate pathway', 'Submerged fermentation']",2018/04/11 06:00,2018/09/25 06:00,['2018/04/12 06:00'],"['2017/12/29 00:00 [received]', '2018/02/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/25 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12010-018-2714-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s12010-018-2714-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Appl Biochem Biotechnol. 2018 Oct;186(2):384-399. doi: 10.1007/s12010-018-2714-6.

Design setting participants: This study assessed ON in 3113 patients aged 1-24 years who participated in the UK national leukaemia study UKALL 2003. UKALL 2003 recruited patients in 40 UK hospitals between 2003 and 2011 and included patients between ages 1 and 25 diagnosed with ALL. Results: 170 patients were diagnosed with ON, giving a prevalence of 5.5%. The multivariable analysis showed that the risk of ON was highest for children aged between 10 and 20 years (ages 10-15 years, OR 23.7, 95% CI 14.8 to 38.0; ages 16-20 years, OR 22.5, 95% CI 12.7 to 39.8, compared with age <10 years). Among ethnic groups, Asian patients had the highest risk of ON (OR 1.92, 95% CI 1.1 to 3.6, compared with White patients). Eighty-five per cent of patients with ON had multifocal ON. Thirty-eight per cent of patients with ON required surgery and 19% of patients with ON required a hip replacement. Fifteen per cent of patients who had surgery still describe significant disability or use of a wheelchair. Conclusions: ON has considerable morbidity for patients being treated for ALL, with a high burden of surgery. Age and ethnicity were found to be the most significant risk factors for development of ON, with Asian patients and patients aged 10-20 years at diagnosis of ALL at greatest risk. These results will help risk stratify patients at diagnosis of ALL, and help tailor future prospective studies in this area.","['Amin, Nadia Laila', 'Feltbower, Richard', 'Kinsey, Sally', 'Vora, Ajay', 'James, Beki']","['Amin NL', 'Feltbower R', 'Kinsey S', 'Vora A', 'James B']","[""Paediatric haematology, Leeds Children's Hospital, Leeds, UK."", 'University of Leeds, Leeds, UK.', ""Paediatric haematology, Leeds Children's Hospital, Leeds, UK."", ""Paediatric haematology, Leeds Children's Hospital, Leeds, UK."", 'University of Leeds, Leeds, UK.', 'Paediatric haematology, Great Ormond Street Hospital, London, UK.', ""Paediatric haematology, Leeds Children's Hospital, Leeds, UK.""]",['ORCID: 0000-0002-7762-1521'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170911,England,BMJ Paediatr Open,BMJ paediatrics open,101715309,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['bone disease', 'haematology', 'musculoskeletal']",2018/04/11 06:00,2018/04/11 06:01,['2018/04/12 06:00'],"['2017/05/30 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/09 00:00 [revised]', '2017/08/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/11 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1136/bmjpo-2017-000122 [doi]', 'bmjpo-2017-000122 [pii]']",epublish,BMJ Paediatr Open. 2017 Sep 11;1(1):e000122. doi: 10.1136/bmjpo-2017-000122. eCollection 2017.,,,,PMC5862222,,,['Competing interests: None declared.'],,,,,,,,,,,

Immunohistochemistry (IHC)-based direct visualization of mutant clones of hematopoietic cells can be useful for rapid diagnostic screening and for monitoring treatment response. In this study, we first evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of the IDH1 p.R132H mutation-specific antibody by IHC. All IDH1 wild type cases (n=11) and IDH1 mutant cases with a non-p.R132H mutation (n=30) were negative by IHC, demonstrating 100% antibody specificity. All the initial diagnostic specimens with IDH1 p.R132H mutation including acute myeloid leukemia (n=30), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) (n=10), MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) (n=4), and MPN (n=5) were positive by IHC, demonstrating 100% antibody sensitivity. Both immature and mature myeloid cells showed immunoreactivity. Erythroid precursors, lymphoid cells, endothelial cells, and osteoblasts were consistently negative by IHC. We then evaluated the follow-up specimens with a known IDH1 mutation status including acute myeloid leukemia (n=23), MDS (n=2), MDS/MPN (n=2), and MPN (n=2). Thirty-three IDH1 p.R132H mutant cases were positive by IHC and 12 IDH1 mutation negative cases were negative by IHC. However, IHC reactivity in up to 25% of bone marrow cells was noted in 8 of 20 polymerase chain reaction-negative cases, all from patients with a known history of IDH1 p.R132H mutation indicating sampling error or a sensitivity issue with molecular tests. These data indicate that IHC is a highly specific and sensitive tool to detect IDH1 p.R132H mutation in bone marrow involved by myeloid neoplasms. In addition, IDH1 p.R132H IHC also allows localization and assessment of the maturation stage of the clones carrying the mutation.","['Kurt, Habibe', 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos E', 'Khoury, Joseph D', 'Routbort, Mark J', 'Kanagal-Shamanna, Rashmi', 'Patel, Umang V', 'Jorgensen, Jeffrey L', 'Wang, Sa A', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'DiNardo, Courtney', 'Luthra, Rajyalakshmi', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Patel, Keyur P']","['Kurt H', 'Bueso-Ramos CE', 'Khoury JD', 'Routbort MJ', 'Kanagal-Shamanna R', 'Patel UV', 'Jorgensen JL', 'Wang SA', 'Ravandi F', 'DiNardo C', 'Luthra R', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Patel KP']","['Departments of Hematopathology, Division of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine.', 'Departments of Hematopathology, Division of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine.', 'Departments of Hematopathology, Division of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine.', 'Departments of Hematopathology, Division of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine.', 'Departments of Hematopathology, Division of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine.', 'Departments of Hematopathology, Division of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine.', 'Departments of Hematopathology, Division of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine.', 'Departments of Hematopathology, Division of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine.', 'Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Departments of Hematopathology, Division of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine.', 'Departments of Hematopathology, Division of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine.', 'Departments of Hematopathology, Division of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.1.1.42.

Thus, PIM1 is regarded as a promising target for treatment of cancers. In the present paper, a three-dimensional quantitative structure activity relationship (3D-QSAR) and molecular docking were performed to investigate the binding between PIM1 and thiazolidine inhibitors in order to design potent inhibitors. The comparative molecular similarity indices analysis (CoMSIA) was developed using twenty-six molecules having pIC50 ranging from 8.854 to 6.011 (IC50 in nM). The best CoMSIA model gave significant statistical quality. The determination coefficient (R(2)) and Leave-One-Out cross-validation coefficient (Q(2)) are 0.85 and 0.58, respectively. Furthermore, the predictive ability of this model was evaluated by external validation((n=11, R(2)test=0.72, and MAE=0.170 log units). The graphical contour maps could provide structural features to improve inhibitory activity. Furthermore, a good consistency between contour maps and molecular docking strongly demonstrates that the molecular modeling is reliable. Based on these satisfactory results, we designed several new potent PIM1 inhibitors and their inhibitory activities were predicted by the molecular models. Additionally, those newly designed inhibitors, showed promising results in the preliminary in silico ADMET evaluations, compared to the best inhibitor from the studied dataset. The results expand our understanding of thiazolidines as inhibitors of PIM1 and could be of great help in lead optimization for early drug discovery of highly potent inhibitors.","['Aouidate, Adnane', 'Ghaleb, Adib', 'Ghamali, Mounir', 'Ousaa, Abdellah', ""Choukrad, M'barek"", 'Sbai, Abdelouahid', 'Bouachrine, Mohammed', 'Lakhlifi, Tahar']","['Aouidate A', 'Ghaleb A', 'Ghamali M', 'Ousaa A', 'Choukrad M', 'Sbai A', 'Bouachrine M', 'Lakhlifi T']","['MCNSL, School of Sciences, Moulay Ismail University, Meknes, Morocco.

Their antiproliferative activities were tested against five cancer cell lines (Bel-7402, MCF-7, SGC-7901, Caco-2 and HL-60) and human normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Among them, compound 12c showed the most potent inhibitory activities against human leukemia HL-60 and epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma Caco-2cells with IC50 values of 0.58 and 2.02muM, respectively. Additionally, high selectivity was also observed between human normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells and human leukemia HL-60cells. Further mechanism studies confirmed that 12c could induce apoptosis, arrest cell cycle at the G2/M phase and lead to mitochondrial dysfunction in HL-60cells. Furthermore, western blot assay demonstrated that 12c induced the intrinsic apoptotic mitochondrial pathway by upregulating protein expression of Bax, cytochrome c, caspase-3, -9 and p53, and downregulating the relative levels of Bcl-2. The levels of cell cycle related proteins cyclin B1 and cdc2 were also downregulated in which G2/M phase arrest was confirmed. Overall, 12c possessed immense potential for the discovery of antitumor candidates with high efficiency and selectivity.","['Hu, Xu', 'Jiao, Runwei', 'Li, Haonan', 'Wang, Xianhua', 'Lyu, Haoda', 'Gao, Xiang', 'Xu, Fanxing', 'Li, Zhanlin', 'Hua, Huiming', 'Li, Dahong']","['Hu X', 'Jiao R', 'Li H', 'Wang X', 'Lyu H', 'Gao X', 'Xu F', 'Li Z', 'Hua H', 'Li D']","['Key Laboratory of Structure-Based Drug Design & Discovery, Ministry of Education, School of Traditional Chinese Materia Medica, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, 103 Wenhua Road, Shenyang, 110016, PR China.', 'Key Laboratory of Structure-Based Drug Design & Discovery, Ministry of Education, School of Traditional Chinese Materia Medica, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, 103 Wenhua Road, Shenyang, 110016, PR China.', 'Key Laboratory of Structure-Based Drug Design & Discovery, Ministry of Education, School of Traditional Chinese Materia Medica, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, 103 Wenhua Road, Shenyang, 110016, PR China.', 'School of Public Health, Qingdao University, 38 Dengzhou Road, Qingdao, 266021, PR China.', 'Key Laboratory of Structure-Based Drug Design & Discovery, Ministry of Education, School of Traditional Chinese Materia Medica, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, 103 Wenhua Road, Shenyang, 110016, PR China.', 'Key Laboratory of Structure-Based Drug Design & Discovery, Ministry of Education, School of Traditional Chinese Materia Medica, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, 103 Wenhua Road, Shenyang, 110016, PR China.', 'Wuya College of Innovation, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, 103 Wenhua Road, Shenyang, 110016, PR China.', 'Key Laboratory of Structure-Based Drug Design & Discovery, Ministry of Education, School of Traditional Chinese Materia Medica, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, 103 Wenhua Road, Shenyang, 110016, PR China.', 'Key Laboratory of Structure-Based Drug Design & Discovery, Ministry of Education, School of Traditional Chinese Materia Medica, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, 103 Wenhua Road, Shenyang, 110016, PR China.', 'Key Laboratory of Structure-Based Drug Design & Discovery, Ministry of Education, School of Traditional Chinese Materia Medica, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, 103 Wenhua Road, Shenyang, 110016, PR China.

The close proximity of a tumor specific antigen and an effector cell antigen results in a targeted activation of effector cells. The mechanism is similar to the chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells, recently approved in two haematologic cancers. CAR T-cells and bsAb represent the most powerful tools for major-histocompatibility complex (MHC) independent T-cell immune response against cancer. In contrast to CAR T-cells, bsAbs are ""off the shelf"" drugs. As a drawback, the efficacy is dependent on a prolonged application. More than 40years of intensive research generate a plethora of bispecific constructs with a remarkable difference in manufacturability, stability, half-life time and receptor affinity. Blinatumomab was the first approved bsAb in relapsed and refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia. By the mature experience of blinatumomab in more than 10 clinical trials over more than one decade, we learned some lessons on how to use this new principle. The efficacy is higher in patients with less tumor burden, suggesting the use as consolidation more than for initial debulking. Main resistance mechanisms are extramedullary relapses and the expression of the inhibitory PD-L1 molecule, suggesting the value of combination with checkpoint inhibitors. CD19 loss is infrequent after blinatumomab, preserving the option for alternative CD19-direct treatments. New bsAbs in lymphoma, myeloma and acute myeloid leukemia enter phase-I trials, together with many new constructs in solid cancer.","['Viardot, Andreas', 'Bargou, Ralf']","['Viardot A', 'Bargou R']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Ulm, Ulm, Germany.

However, the expression pattern of IRAIN and its clinical implication in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression status of IRAIN and its clinical significance in non-M3 AML patients. METHODS: Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was performed to examine IRAIN transcript levels in 64 de novo non-M3 AML patients and 51 healthy controls. The association of IRAIN expression with clinicopathological factors was statistically analyzed. RESULTS: Compared with the controls, IRAIN was significantly downregulated in non-M3 AML patients (p < 0.001). The median of IRAIN expression divided the non-M3 AML patients into IRAIN low-expressing (IRAIN(low)) and IRAIN high-expressing (IRAIN(high)) groups. The IRAIN(low) group tended to have higher white blood cell count and blast counts and had markedly shorter overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) (p = 0.044 and 0.009, respectively). In addition, patients with refractory response to chemotherapies and those with subsequent relapse had lower initial IRAIN expression. Multivariate analysis further identified IRAIN transcript levels as an independent prognostic factor for both RFS and OS. CONCLUSIONS: Our finding suggests that IRAIN transcript levels may be a useful biomarker for the prognosis of non-M3 AML patients.","['Pashaiefar, Hossein', 'Izadifard, Marzieh', 'Yaghmaie, Marjan', 'Montazeri, Maryam', 'Gheisari, Elahe', 'Ahmadvand, Mohammad', 'Momeny, Majid', 'Ghaffari, Seyed Hamid', 'Kasaeian, Amir', 'Alimoghaddam, Kamran', 'Ghavamzadeh, Ardeshir']","['Pashaiefar H', 'Izadifard M', 'Yaghmaie M', 'Montazeri M', 'Gheisari E', 'Ahmadvand M', 'Momeny M', 'Ghaffari SH', 'Kasaeian A', 'Alimoghaddam K', 'Ghavamzadeh A']","['1 Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences , Tehran, Iran .', '2 Department of Genetics, Payame Noor University of Rey , Tehran, Iran .', '1 Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences , Tehran, Iran .', '1 Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences , Tehran, Iran .', '1 Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences , Tehran, Iran .', '1 Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences , Tehran, Iran .', '1 Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences , Tehran, Iran .', '1 Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences , Tehran, Iran .', '1 Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences , Tehran, Iran .', '1 Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences , Tehran, Iran .', '1 Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences , Tehran, Iran .']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180410,United States,Genet Test Mol Biomarkers,Genetic testing and molecular biomarkers,101494210,"['0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'IRAIN', 'long noncoding RNA', 'prognosis']",2018/04/11 06:00,2018/10/12 06:00,['2018/04/11 06:00'],"['2018/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/12 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/gtmb.2017.0281 [doi]'],ppublish,Genet Test Mol Biomarkers. 2018 May;22(5):288-294. doi: 10.1089/gtmb.2017.0281.

Numerous bioanalytical methods using high performance liquid chromatography coupled to ultraviolet detection point at the importance and necessity of the therapeutic drug monitoring of imatinib. Unfortunately, these methods are not optimized for single dose pharmacokinetic studies such as bioe- quivalence. In this study, attention was turned mostly to the analysis time, linearity range and interferences by endogenous components of the matrix and exogenous substances - especially metabolites. The method enables the quantification of imatinib in the presence of the main metabolite (N-desmethyl imatinib). Its potential back- conversion was examined during storage for 4 h at ambient temperature as well as for 239 days at -20(0)C. The sample preparation based on the liquid-liquid extraction was combined with a short analysis time of 7 min. Therefore, the method was suitable for analyzing large numbers of samples in a short time. The linearity range of 40-4000 ng/mL was optimized for human pharmacokinetic studies after a single 400 mg oral dose of ima- tinib. Successful application in a bioequivalence study confirmed the reliability of the method.","['Kaza, Michal', 'Piorkowska, Edyta', 'Filist, Monika', 'Rudzki, Piotr J']","['Kaza M', 'Piorkowska E', 'Filist M', 'Rudzki PJ']",,,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Validation Study']",,Poland,Acta Pol Pharm,Acta poloniae pharmaceutica,2985167R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*blood', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid/*methods', 'Drug Monitoring/*methods', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*blood', 'Liquid-Liquid Extraction', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Therapeutic Equivalency', 'Time Factors']",,,2016/11/01 00:00,2018/05/04 06:00,['2018/04/11 06:00'],"['2018/04/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/04 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Acta Pol Pharm. 2016 Nov;73(6):1495-1503.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the great majority of CML; BCR/ABL1 is cytogenetically visualized as t(9;22); giving rise to the Ph chromosome, harboring the chimeric gene. Cryptic or masked translocations occur in 2-10% patients with no evidence for the BCR/ABL rearrangement by conventional cytogenetics but are positive by Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization (FISH) and/or reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). These patients are described as Philadelphia negative (Ph negative) BCR/ABL1- positive CML with the chimeric gene present on the derivative chromosome 22, as in most CML cases, or alternatively on the derivative 9 in rare occasions. In the majority of cases, CML is diagnosed in the chronic phase; it is less frequently diagnosed in accelerated crises, and occasionally, its initial presentation is as acute leukemia. The prevalence of extramedullary blast phase (BP) has been reported to be 7-17% in patients with BP. Surprisingly, no extra-medullary blast crises of B- lymphoid lineage have been reported before among cases of CML as the initial presentation. We report an adult male diagnosed as CML- chronic phase when he was shortly presented with treatment-naive extramedullary B-lymphoid blast crises involving multiple lymph nodes, with no features of acceleration or blast crises in the peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM). In addition the patient had variant/cryptic Philadelphia translocation. This is the first report of CML, on the best of our knowledge, with extramedullary B-lymphoid blast phase, as initial presentation, that showed a cryptic Ph translocation.","['Soliman, Dina S', 'Amer, Aliaa M', 'Mudawi, Deena', 'Al-Sabbagh, Zafar', 'Alkuwari, Einas', 'Al-Sabbagh, Ahmad', 'Ibrahim, Feryal', 'Yassin, Mohamed A']","['Soliman DS', 'Amer AM', 'Mudawi D', 'Al-Sabbagh Z', 'Alkuwari E', 'Al-Sabbagh A', 'Ibrahim F', 'Yassin MA']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, National Center for Cancer Care and Research, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha,Qatar. yassinmoha@gmail.com.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, National Center for Cancer Care and Research, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha,Qatar. yassinmoha@gmail.com.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, National Center for Cancer Care and Research, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar. yassinmoha@gmail.com.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, National Center for Cancer Care and Research, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha,Qatar. yassinmoha@gmail.com.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, National Center for Cancer Care and Research, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha,Qatar. yassinmoha@gmail.com.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, National Center for Cancer Care and Research, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha,Qatar. yassinmoha@gmail.com.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, National Center for Cancer Care and Research, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha,Qatar. yassinmoha@gmail.com.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, National Center for Cancer Care and Research, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar. yassinmoha@gmail.com.']",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20180403,Italy,Acta Biomed,Acta bio-medica : Atenei Parmensis,101295064,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)', 'CVAD protocol']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Blast Crisis/*genetics/pathology', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Dasatinib/administration & dosage', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",,,2018/04/11 06:00,2019/11/12 06:00,['2018/04/11 06:00'],"['2018/04/03 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.23750/abm.v89i3-S.7219 [doi]'],epublish,Acta Biomed. 2018 Apr 3;89(3-S):38-44. doi: 10.23750/abm.v89i3-S.7219.,,,,PMC6179102,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These findings have led to the suggestion that iron overload is common and may have deleterious effects in these patients. However, the relationship between serum ferritin and parenchymal iron overload in such patients is unknown. Therefore, we measured the liver iron content (LIC) by the FerriScan(R) method and investigated the liver function and some endocrine tests in 27 patients with acute leukemia (AL) or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Using FerriScan(R) method, the normal mean LIC levels are: 4.3 +/- 2.9 mg Fe/g dry weight (d.w.). In our patients, the mean serum ferritin level was 1965 +/- 2428 ng/mL. In our patients, the mean total iron in the blood received by them was 7177 +/- 5009 mg. In 6 out of 27 patients LIC was > 7 mg Fe/g d.w. and in 11/27 serum ferritin was > 1000 ng/ml. Measuring fasting blood glucose revealed 3/27 with diabetes mellitus and 4/27 with impaired fasting glucose (IFG). All patients had normal serum concentrations of calcium, parathormone (PTH), free thyroxine (FT4) and thyrotropin (TSH). Four patients had elevated serum alanine transferase (ALT). LIC was correlated significantly with ferritin level (r = 0.5666; P < 0.001) and the cumulative amount of iron in the transfused blood (r = 0.523; P <0.001). LIC was correlated significantly with ALT (r = 0.277; P = 0.04) and fasting blood glucose (FBG) was correlated significantly with the amount of iron transfused (r = 0.52, p < 0.01) and ALT level (r = 0.44; P< 0.01). The age of patients did not correlate with LIC, FBG or ALT. In conclusions, these results contribute to our understanding of the prevalence of dysglycemia and hepatic dysfunction in relation to parenchymal iron overload in patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing chemotherapy and requiring blood transfusions.","['Yassin, Mohamed A', 'Soliman, Ashraf', 'De Sanctis, Vincenzo', 'Hmissi, Saloua M', 'Abdulla, Mohammad A J', 'Ekeibed, Yeslem', 'Ismail, Omer', 'Nashwan, Abdulqadir', 'Soliman, Dina', 'Almusharaf, Mohammed', 'Hussein, Redwa']","['Yassin MA', 'Soliman A', 'De Sanctis V', 'Hmissi SM', 'Abdulla MAJ', 'Ekeibed Y', 'Ismail O', 'Nashwan A', 'Soliman D', 'Almusharaf M', 'Hussein R']","['Hematology Section Medical Oncology NCCCR, Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC) Doha, Qatar. vdesanctis@libero.it.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC), Doha, Qatar. vdesanctis@libero.it.', 'Pediatric and Adolescent Outpatient Clinic, Quisisana Hospital, Ferrara, Italy. vdesanctis@libero.it.', 'Blood Bank, Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC), Doha, Qatar. vdesanctis@libero.it.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC), Doha, Qatar. vdesanctis@libero.it.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC), Doha, Qatar. vdesanctis@libero.it.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC), Doha, Qatar. vdesanctis@libero.it.', 'Hematology Section Medical Oncology NCCCR, Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC) Doha, Qatar. vdesanctis@libero.it.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, National Center for Cancer Care and Research, Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC) Doha, Qatar. vdesanctis@libero.it.', 'Department of Pharmacy NCCCR, Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC) Doha, Qatar. vdesanctis@libero.it.', 'Department of Pharmacy NCCCR, Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC) Doha, Qatar. vdesanctis@libero.it.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180403,Italy,Acta Biomed,Acta bio-medica : Atenei Parmensis,101295064,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Blood Glucose)', '0 (Hormones)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'EC 2.6.1.2 (Alanine Transaminase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Alanine Transaminase/blood', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers', 'Blood Glucose/analysis', '*Blood Transfusion', 'Diabetes Mellitus/blood/etiology', 'Endocrine System/*physiopathology', 'Ferritins/blood', 'Hormones/blood', 'Humans', 'Hypothyroidism/etiology', 'Iron/analysis', 'Iron Overload/etiology/*physiopathology', 'Leukemia/*complications/drug therapy/therapy', 'Liver/chemistry/*physiopathology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*complications/drug therapy/therapy']",,,2018/04/11 06:00,2019/11/12 06:00,['2018/04/11 06:00'],"['2018/04/03 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.23750/abm.v89i3-S.7213 [doi]'],epublish,Acta Biomed. 2018 Apr 3;89(3-S):18-22. doi: 10.23750/abm.v89i3-S.7213.,,,,PMC6179097,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the precise molecular mechanism of these events is still not clear. It has been recently shown that alternative non-homologous end-joining (alt-NHEJ), a newly described pathway for double-stranded DNA break repair, mediates the formation of chromosomal translocations. Here, we examined the expression levels of the main components of alt-NHEJ (PARP1 and LIG3) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients and assessed their potential correlation with the formation of chromosomal translocations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This experimental study used reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RTqPCR) to quantify the expression levels of PARP1 and LIG3 at the transcript level in AML patients (n=78) and healthy individuals (n=19). RESULTS: PARP1 was the only gene overexpressed in the AML group when compared with healthy individuals (P=0.0004), especially in the poor prognosis sub-group. Both genes were, however, found to be up-regulated in AML patients with chromosomal translocations (P=0.04 and 0.0004 respectively). Moreover, patients with one isolated translocation showed an over-expression of only LIG3 (P=0.005), whereas those with two or more translocations over-expressed both LIG3 (P=0.002) and PARP1 (P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: The significant correlations observed between PARP1 and LIG3 expression and the rate of chromosomal translocations in AML patients provides a molecular context for further studies to investigate the causality of this association.","['Pashaiefar, Hossein', 'Yaghmaie, Marjan', 'Tavakkoly-Bazzaz, Javad', 'Hamidollah Ghaffari, Seyed', 'Alimoghaddam, Kamran', 'Izadi, Pantea', 'Ghavamzadeh, Ardeshir']","['Pashaiefar H', 'Yaghmaie M', 'Tavakkoly-Bazzaz J', 'Hamidollah Ghaffari S', 'Alimoghaddam K', 'Izadi P', 'Ghavamzadeh A']","['Department of Medical Genetics, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.Electronic address: m-yaghmaie@sina.tums.ac.ir.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.Electronic address:tavakkolybazzazj@tums.ac.ir.', 'Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180318,Iran,Cell J,Cell journal,101566618,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute Myeloid Leukemia', 'Chromosomal Translocation', 'LIG3', 'PARP1']",2018/04/11 06:00,2018/04/11 06:01,['2018/04/11 06:00'],"['2017/05/13 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/11 06:01 [medline]']",['10.22074/cellj.2018.5210 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell J. 2018 Jul;20(2):204-210. doi: 10.22074/cellj.2018.5210.

Since the hypoxic situation and the various cells of bone marrow microenvironment, e.g. mesenchymal stem cells, play a role in the in vivo and in vitro biology of leukemic cells, we decided to study the effects of hypoxia and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on the promoter methylation pattern of BAX and BCL2 genes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this experimental study, the co-culture of MOLT-4 cells with MSCs and treatment with CoCl2 was done during 6, 12, and 24 hour periods. Total DNA was extracted using commercial DNA extraction kits, and sodium bisulfite (SBS) treatment was performed on the extracted DNA. Methylation specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) was used to evaluate the methylation status of the selected genes' promoter regions. RESULTS: The BAX and BCL2 promoters of untreated MOLT-4 cells were in partial methylated and fully unmethylated states, respectively. After incubating the cancer cells with CoCl2 and MSCs, the MSP results after 6, 12, and 24 hours were the same as untreated MOLT-4 cells. In other words, the exposure of MOLT-4 cells to the hypoxia-mimicry agent and MSCs in various modes and different time frames showed that these factors have exerted no change on the methylation signature of the studied fragments from the promoter region of the mentioned genes. CONCLUSIONS: Hypoxia and MSCs actually have no notable effect on the methylation status of the promoters of BAX and BCL2 in the specifically studied regions. DNA methylation is probably not the main process by which MSCs and CoCl2 induced hypoxia regulate the expression of these genes. Finally, we are still far from discovering the exact functional mechanisms of gene expression directors, but these investigations can provide new insights into this field for upcoming studies.","['Ahani-Nahayati, Milad', 'Solali, Saeed', 'Shams Asenjan, Karim', 'Movassaghpour Akbari, Ali Akbar', 'Talebi, Mehdi', 'Zadi Heydarabad, Milad', 'Baharaghdam, Sina', 'Farshdousti Hagh, Majid']","['Ahani-Nahayati M', 'Solali S', 'Shams Asenjan K', 'Movassaghpour Akbari AA', 'Talebi M', 'Zadi Heydarabad M', 'Baharaghdam S', 'Farshdousti Hagh M']","['Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Drug Applied Research Center (DARC), Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Drug Applied Research Center (DARC), Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.

The described phenotype included bone marrow, cerebral, and craniofacial abnormalities. The aim of this study was to further define the genetic and phenotypic spectrum of the disorder by summarizing the five published cases and an additional case that we identified through whole-exome sequencing performed at the University of Toronto. METHODS: Clinical data was extracted from the Canadian Inherited Marrow Failure Registry. Whole exome sequencing was performed to identify causative mutations. RESULTS: All six cases had homozygous truncating mutations either at or upstream of the helicase domain of ERCC6L2. All patients displayed bone marrow failure, learning or developmental delay and microcephaly. Our patient was unique in displaying features of cerebellar disease, including ataxia and dysmetria as well as an interval deterioration of the corpus callosum and generalized volume loss on MRI. Another unique feature of our patient was retinal dystrophy with macular involvement. Along with one other patient, our patient displayed craniofacial abnormalities by presenting with low-set prominent ears, a pointed prominent chin, and deep-set eyes. Leukemia is common among patients with inherited bone marrow failure, but thus far, none of the patients have developed this complication. CONCLUSIONS: ERCC6L2-associated disorder is a multisystem disorder. The phenotype spectrum includes bone marrow failure, cerebral, and craniofacial abnormalities, as well as cerebellar and retinal abnormalities.","['Shabanova, Iren', 'Cohen, Elisa', 'Cada, Michaela', 'Vincent, Ajoy', 'Cohn, Ronald D', 'Dror, Yigal']","['Shabanova I', 'Cohen E', 'Cada M', 'Vincent A', 'Cohn RD', 'Dror Y']","['Genetics and Genome Biology Program, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Marrow Failure and Myelodysplasia Program, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Genetics and Genome Biology Program, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Marrow Failure and Myelodysplasia Program, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Marrow Failure and Myelodysplasia Program, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Ophthalmology and Vision Sciences, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Division of Clinical and Metabolic Genetics, Department of Paediatrics, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Genetics and Genome Biology Program, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Marrow Failure and Myelodysplasia Program, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Institute of Medical Sciences, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-3953-1477'],['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20180406,United States,Mol Genet Genomic Med,Molecular genetics & genomic medicine,101603758,"['EC 3.6.4.- (DNA Helicases)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (ERCC6L2 protein, human)', 'Bone Marrow failure syndromes']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/*genetics/physiopathology', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/*genetics/physiopathology', 'Bone Marrow Failure Disorders', 'Canada', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities/genetics', 'DNA Helicases/*genetics/physiology', 'Developmental Disabilities/genetics', 'Exome', 'Female', 'Hemoglobinuria, Paroxysmal/*genetics/physiopathology', 'Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Intellectual Disability/genetics', 'Male', 'Microcephaly/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Nervous System Malformations/genetics', 'Pedigree', 'Phenotype']",['NOTNLM'],"['* ERCC6L2', '*bone marrow failure', '*developmental delay', '*microcephaly', '*thrombocytopenia']",2018/04/11 06:00,2018/10/18 06:00,['2018/04/11 06:00'],"['2017/11/06 00:00 [received]', '2018/01/17 00:00 [revised]', '2018/02/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/18 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mgg3.388 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Genet Genomic Med. 2018 May;6(3):463-468. doi: 10.1002/mgg3.388.

The immune response induced by murine single-chain variable fragment (scFv) of the CAR may limit CAR-T cell persistence and thus increases the risk of leukemia relapse. In this study, we developed a novel humanized scFv from the murine FMC63 antibody. A total of 18 R/R ALL patients with or without prior murine CD19 CAR-T therapy were treated with humanized CD19-targeted CAR-T cells (hCART19s). After lymphodepletion chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, the patients received a single dose (1 x 10(6) /kg) of autologous hCART19s infusion.

For children, only limited evidence about benzene and cancer exists. A few studies have indicated that benzene may increase risk for some subtypes of childhood cancer but not for others. We aimed to investigate if outdoor levels of benzene at the residence increase the risk for subtypes of leukemia, lymphoma and CNS tumor in children. We identified 1,989 children diagnosed with leukemia, lymphoma or CNS tumor during 1968-1991 in the Danish Cancer Registry and randomly selected 5,506 control children from the Danish population, matched on sex, age and calendar time. We traced residential history of all children from 9 months before birth to time of diagnosis, calculated outdoor benzene concentration at all addresses and summarized cumulative exposure over fetal and childhood periods separately. We used conditional logistic regression for the statistical analyses. Benzene exposure during childhood above the 90th percentile was associated with relative risks for acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) of 1.0 (95% confidence intervals (CI): 0.6-1.7) and 1.9 (95% CI: 0.3-11.1), respectively, when compared with exposure levels below the median. For CNS tumors, there was a tendency of lower risk for ependymoma and higher risk for medulloblastoma in association with higher exposure. In conclusion, benzene was associated with higher risk for childhood AML, but not ALL, which is consistent with the few previous studies.","['Raaschou-Nielsen, Ole', 'Hvidtfeldt, Ulla A', 'Roswall, Nina', 'Hertel, Ole', 'Poulsen, Aslak H', 'Sorensen, Mette']","['Raaschou-Nielsen O', 'Hvidtfeldt UA', 'Roswall N', 'Hertel O', 'Poulsen AH', 'Sorensen M']","['Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Strandboulevarden 49, DK-2100, Copenhagen O, Denmark.', 'Department of Environmental Science, Aarhus University, Frederiksborgvej 399, DK-4000, Roskilde, Denmark.', 'Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Strandboulevarden 49, DK-2100, Copenhagen O, Denmark.', 'Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Strandboulevarden 49, DK-2100, Copenhagen O, Denmark.', 'Department of Environmental Science, Aarhus University, Frederiksborgvej 399, DK-4000, Roskilde, Denmark.', 'Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Strandboulevarden 49, DK-2100, Copenhagen O, Denmark.', 'Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Strandboulevarden 49, DK-2100, Copenhagen O, Denmark.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-1223-0909', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3071-1658']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180418,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Air Pollutants)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Air Pollutants/*adverse effects', 'Benzene/*adverse effects', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/*etiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*etiology', 'Lymphoma/*etiology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*etiology', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors']",,,2018/04/11 06:00,2019/02/05 06:00,['2018/04/11 06:00'],"['2017/11/01 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/26 00:00 [revised]', '2018/03/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/05 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.31421 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2018 Sep 15;143(6):1367-1373. doi: 10.1002/ijc.31421.

TASP1 encodes taspase 1 which is responsible for cleaving, thus activating, a number of transcription factors including the mixed lineage leukemia 1 (MLL1). Taspase 1-deficient mice showed early lethality, skeletal abnormalities, and growth failure, which support a potentially causal role of TASP1 deletion in this infant. Furthermore, the infant reported here had many of the features seen in Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome which is caused by MLL1 defects. Such observation further supports that TASP1 is a novel disease-related gene that is associated with a disease phenotype overlapping with Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome as both are caused by defects in the same pathway.","['Suleiman, J', 'Mundt, M', 'Sampath, S', 'El-Hattab, A W']","['Suleiman J', 'Mundt M', 'Sampath S', 'El-Hattab AW']","['Division of Neurology, Department of Pediatrics, Tawam Hospital, and Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, United Arab Emirates University, Al Ain, United Arab Emirates.', 'PreventionGenetics, LLC, Marshfield, Wisconsin.', 'PreventionGenetics, LLC, Marshfield, Wisconsin.', 'Division of Genetic and Metabolic Disorders, Department of Pediatrics, Tawam Hospital, Al Ain, United Arab Emirates.']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-0914-7650', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5737-5271']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180510,Denmark,Clin Genet,Clinical genetics,0253664,"['EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (taspase1, human)']",IM,"['Comparative Genomic Hybridization', 'Congenital Abnormalities/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Developmental Disabilities/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Endopeptidases/*genetics', '*Facies', 'Female', '*Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Microcephaly/diagnosis/*genetics', '*Phenotype', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Syndrome']",['NOTNLM'],"['* TASP1', '*Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome', '*chromosomal microarray', '*novel gene', '*taspase 1', '*transcription factor']",2018/04/11 06:00,2019/10/28 06:00,['2018/04/11 06:00'],"['2018/03/01 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/21 00:00 [revised]', '2018/03/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/28 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cge.13258 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Genet. 2018 Jul;94(1):170-173. doi: 10.1111/cge.13258.

Intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy can be used to manage CSF involvement. METHODS: Here we evaluated the effectiveness of IT chemotherapy among 80 patients with haematological malignancies and CSF localization who were treated with IT chemotherapy from 2001 to 2012. RESULTS: The majority of patients was diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (26%) or acute lymphoblastic leukaemia/lymphoblastic lymphoma (19%). After first-line IT chemotherapy, which mainly consisted of methotrexate (MTX) and corticosteroids, CSF complete response (CSF CR) was achieved in 76% of patients. 91% reached CSF CR when including second-line IT-chemotherapy. Clinical response was documented in 75%. Although most patients were additionally treated with systemic chemotherapy, response rate did not differ between patients treated with CNS-penetrating and CNS-non-penetrating drugs. CNS progression/relapse occurred in 40% of patients with median progression-free survival of 12.2 months. The median overall survival was 18.3 months; 55% of the patients died during follow-up.

The potential of the immune system to address this is evident in the success of allogeneic transplantation, however this leads to considerable morbidity. Dendritic cell (DC) vaccination can generate leukemia-specific autologous immunity with little toxicity. Promising results have been achieved with vaccines developed in vitro from purified monocytes (Mo-DC). We now demonstrate that blood DC (BDC) have superior function to Mo-DC. Whilst BDC are reduced at diagnosis in AML, they recover following chemotherapy and allogeneic transplantation, can be purified using CMRF-56 antibody technology, and can stimulate functional T cell responses. While most AML patients in remission had a relatively normal T cell landscape, those who had received fludarabine as salvage therapy have persistent T cell abnormalities including reduced number, altered subset distribution, failure to expand, and increased activation-induced cell death. Furthermore, PD-1 and TIM-3 are increased on CD4T cells in AML patients in remission and their blockade enhances the expansion of leukemia-specific T cells. This confirms the feasibility of a BDC vaccine to consolidate remission in AML and suggests it should be tested in conjunction with checkpoint blockade.","['Hsu, Jennifer L', 'Bryant, Christian E', 'Papadimitrious, Michael S', 'Kong, Benjamin', 'Gasiorowski, Robin E', 'Orellana, Daniel', 'McGuire, Helen M', 'Groth, Barbara Fazekas de St', 'Joshua, Douglas E', 'Ho, P Joy', 'Larsen, Stephen', 'Iland, Harry J', 'Gibson, John', 'Clark, Georgina J', 'Fromm, Phillip D', 'Hart, Derek Nj']","['Hsu JL', 'Bryant CE', 'Papadimitrious MS', 'Kong B', 'Gasiorowski RE', 'Orellana D', 'McGuire HM', 'Groth BFS', 'Joshua DE', 'Ho PJ', 'Larsen S', 'Iland HJ', 'Gibson J', 'Clark GJ', 'Fromm PD', 'Hart DN']","['Dendritic Cell Research Group, ANZAC Research Institute, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Dendritic Cell Research Group, ANZAC Research Institute, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Institute of Haematology, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Dendritic Cell Research Group, ANZAC Research Institute, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Discipline of Internal Medicine, Sydney Medical School, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Dendritic Cell Research Group, ANZAC Research Institute, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Discipline of Internal Medicine, Sydney Medical School, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Dendritic Cell Research Group, ANZAC Research Institute, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Institute of Haematology, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Ramaciotti Facility for Human Systems Biology, Charles Perkins Centre, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Melanoma Immunology and Oncology Unit, Centenary Institute, The University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia.', 'Ramaciotti Facility for Human Systems Biology, Charles Perkins Centre, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Discipline of Pathology, Sydney Medical School, The University of Sydney, Sydney NSW, Australia.', 'Institute of Haematology, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Discipline of Internal Medicine, Sydney Medical School, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Institute of Haematology, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Discipline of Internal Medicine, Sydney Medical School, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Institute of Haematology, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Institute of Haematology, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Institute of Haematology, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Discipline of Internal Medicine, Sydney Medical School, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Dendritic Cell Research Group, ANZAC Research Institute, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Discipline of Internal Medicine, Sydney Medical School, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Dendritic Cell Research Group, ANZAC Research Institute, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Discipline of Internal Medicine, Sydney Medical School, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Dendritic Cell Research Group, ANZAC Research Institute, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Discipline of Internal Medicine, Sydney Medical School, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180125,United States,Oncoimmunology,Oncoimmunology,101570526,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute Myeloid Leukemia', '*Allogeneic Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', '*Blood Dendritic Cell', '*Checkpoint Inhibitor', '*Chemotherapy', '*Immunotherapy', '*T Cell Landscape']",2018/04/11 06:00,2018/04/11 06:01,['2018/04/11 06:00'],"['2017/09/01 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/11 00:00 [revised]', '2017/12/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/11 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1080/2162402X.2017.1419114 [doi]', '1419114 [pii]']",epublish,Oncoimmunology. 2018 Jan 25;7(4):e1419114. doi: 10.1080/2162402X.2017.1419114. eCollection 2018.,,,,PMC5889209,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During ibrutinib therapy, non-malignant B cell numbers declined, but patients maintained stable IGH diversity and constant fractions of IGH-mutated B cells. This indicates partial preservation of antigen-experienced B cells during ibrutinib therapy, but impaired replenishment of the normal B cell pool with naive B cells. In contrast, after FCR we noted a recovery of normal B cells with a marked predominance of B cells with unmutated IGH. This pattern is compatible with a deletion of pre-existing antigen-experienced B cells followed by repertoire renewal with antigen-naive B cells. These opposite patterns in B cell dynamics may result in different responses towards neoantigens versus recall antigens, which need to be further defined.","['Schliffke, Simon', 'Sivina, Mariela', 'Kim, Ekaterina', 'von Wenserski, Lisa', 'Thiele, Benjamin', 'Akyuz, Nuray', 'Falker-Gieske, Clemens', 'Statovci, Donjete', 'Oberle, Anna', 'Thenhausen, Toni', 'Krohn-Grimberghe, Artus', 'Bokemeyer, Carsten', 'Jain, Nitin', 'Estrov, Zeev', 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra', 'Wierda, William', 'Keating, Michael', 'Burger, Jan A', 'Binder, Mascha']","['Schliffke S', 'Sivina M', 'Kim E', 'von Wenserski L', 'Thiele B', 'Akyuz N', 'Falker-Gieske C', 'Statovci D', 'Oberle A', 'Thenhausen T', 'Krohn-Grimberghe A', 'Bokemeyer C', 'Jain N', 'Estrov Z', 'Ferrajoli A', 'Wierda W', 'Keating M', 'Burger JA', 'Binder M']","['Department of Oncology and Hematology, BMT with section Pneumology, Hubertus Wald Tumorzentrum / UCCH, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Martinistrasse, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Unit 0428, Houston, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Unit 0428, Houston, USA.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, BMT with section Pneumology, Hubertus Wald Tumorzentrum / UCCH, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Martinistrasse, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, BMT with section Pneumology, Hubertus Wald Tumorzentrum / UCCH, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Martinistrasse, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, BMT with section Pneumology, Hubertus Wald Tumorzentrum / UCCH, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Martinistrasse, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, BMT with section Pneumology, Hubertus Wald Tumorzentrum / UCCH, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Martinistrasse, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, BMT with section Pneumology, Hubertus Wald Tumorzentrum / UCCH, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Martinistrasse, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, BMT with section Pneumology, Hubertus Wald Tumorzentrum / UCCH, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Martinistrasse, Hamburg, Germany.', 'LYTIQ GmbH, Technologiepark, Paderborn, Germany.', 'Analytische Informationssysteme und Business Intelligence, Universitat Paderborn, Warburger Strasse, Paderborn, Germany.', 'LYTIQ GmbH, Technologiepark, Paderborn, Germany.', 'Analytische Informationssysteme und Business Intelligence, Universitat Paderborn, Warburger Strasse, Paderborn, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, BMT with section Pneumology, Hubertus Wald Tumorzentrum / UCCH, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Martinistrasse, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Unit 0428, Houston, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Unit 0428, Houston, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Unit 0428, Houston, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Unit 0428, Houston, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Unit 0428, Houston, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Unit 0428, Houston, USA.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, BMT with section Pneumology, Hubertus Wald Tumorzentrum / UCCH, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Martinistrasse, Hamburg, Germany.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180115,United States,Oncoimmunology,Oncoimmunology,101570526,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*B lymphocyte repertoire', '*Ibrutinib', '*Immunomonitoring', '*chemo-immunotherapy', '*chronic lymphocytic leukemia']",2018/04/11 06:00,2018/04/11 06:01,['2018/04/11 06:00'],"['2017/08/02 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/24 00:00 [revised]', '2017/12/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/11 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1080/2162402X.2017.1417720 [doi]', '1417720 [pii]']",epublish,Oncoimmunology. 2018 Jan 15;7(4):e1417720. doi: 10.1080/2162402X.2017.1417720. eCollection 2018.,,,['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC5889203,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Applications targeting M2-like tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) improve outcome in solid tumors. Considerable differences are detected between leukemia-associated macrophages (LAMs) and TAMs. However, application to induce M1 characteristics in heterogeneous LAMs has not been established. Here we analyzed clinical relevance of macrophage phenotypes in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML), studied phenotypic evolution of bone marrow (BM) and spleen (SP) LAMs in mouse AML and T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) models, explored mechanism leading to different LAM phenotypes and tried to eliminate pro-leukemic effects by inducing M1 characteristics. The results showed that more M2-like LAMs but not total LAMs correlated with worse prognosis in AML patients. Heterogeneity of LAM activation in tissue-specific leukemic microenvironments was observed in both AML and ALL models, i.e. SP LAMs evolved with more M2 characteristics while BM LAMs with more M1 characteristics. Furthermore, IRF7 contributed to M1 characteristics through the activation of SAPK/JNK pathway. Moreover, targeting IRF7-SAPK/JNK pathway to induce M1 characteristics in LAMs contributed to prolonged survival in leukemia mice. Our study provides the potential target for macrophage based immuno-therapy strategy against leukemia.","['Yang, Xiao', 'Feng, Wenli', 'Wang, Rong', 'Yang, Feifei', 'Wang, Lina', 'Chen, Shayan', 'Ru, Yongxin', 'Cheng, Tao', 'Zheng, Guoguang']","['Yang X', 'Feng W', 'Wang R', 'Yang F', 'Wang L', 'Chen S', 'Ru Y', 'Cheng T', 'Zheng G']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171226,United States,Oncoimmunology,Oncoimmunology,101570526,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*IRF7', '*Leukemia-associated macrophages', '*Phenotype conversion', '*Phenotypic heterogeneity', '*SAPK/JNK pathway']",2018/04/11 06:00,2018/04/11 06:01,['2018/04/11 06:00'],"['2017/10/26 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/22 00:00 [revised]', '2017/11/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/11 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1080/2162402X.2017.1412910 [doi]', '1412910 [pii]']",epublish,Oncoimmunology. 2017 Dec 26;7(4):e1412910. doi: 10.1080/2162402X.2017.1412910. eCollection 2018.,,,,PMC5889280,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We sought to determine whether exosomes from glioblastoma (GBM)-derived stem cells (GSCs) can induce immunosuppression. We report that GSC-derived exosomes (GDEs) have a predilection for monocytes, the precursor to macrophages. The GDEs traverse the monocyte cytoplasm, cause a reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, and skew monocytes toward the immune suppresive M2 phenotype, including programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression. Mass spectrometry analysis demonstrated that the GDEs contain a variety of components, including members of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway that functionally mediate this immune suppressive switch. Western blot analysis revealed that upregulation of PD-L1 in GSC exosome-treated monocytes and GBM-patient-infiltrating CD14(+) cells predominantly correlates with increased phosphorylation of STAT3, and in some cases, with phosphorylated p70S6 kinase and Erk1/2. Cumulatively, these data indicate that GDEs are secreted GBM-released factors that are potent modulators of the GBM-associated immunosuppressive microenvironment.","['Gabrusiewicz, Konrad', 'Li, Xu',

T-cell-directed killing of tumor cells using engineered T-cells or bispecific antibodies is a promising approach for the treatment of hematologic malignancies. We investigated the efficacy of CD19xCD3 DART bispecific antibody in a broad panel of human primary B-cell malignancies. The CD19xCD3 DART identified 2 distinct subsets of patients, in which the neoplastic lymphocytes were eliminated with rapid or slow kinetics. Delayed responses were always overcome by a prolonged or repeated DART exposure. Both CD4 and CD8 effector cytotoxic cells were generated, and DART-mediated killing of CD4(+) cells into cytotoxic effectors required the presence of CD8(+) cells. Serial exposures to DART led to the exponential expansion of CD4 (+) and CD8 (+) cells and to the sequential ablation of neoplastic cells in absence of a PD-L1-mediated exhaustion. Lastly, patient-derived neoplastic B-cells (B-Acute Lymphoblast Leukemia and Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma) could be proficiently eradicated in a xenograft mouse model by DART-armed cytokine induced killer (CIK) cells. Collectively, patient tailored DART exposures can result in the effective elimination of CD19 positive leukemia and B-cell lymphoma and the association of bispecific antibodies with unmatched CIK cells represents an effective modality for the treatment of CD19 positive leukemia/lymphoma.","['Circosta, Paola', 'Elia, Angela Rita', 'Landra, Indira', 'Machiorlatti, Rodolfo', 'Todaro, Maria', 'Aliberti, Sabrina', 'Brusa, Davide', 'Deaglio, Silvia', 'Chiaretti, Sabina', 'Bruna, Riccardo', 'Gottardi, Daniela', 'Massaia, Massimo', 'Giacomo, Filomena Di', 'Guarini, Anna Rita', 'Foa, Robin', 'Kyriakides, Peter W', 'Bareja, Rohan', 'Elemento, Olivier', 'Chichili, Gurunadh R', 'Monteleone, Emanuele', 'Moore, Paul A', 'Johnson, Syd', 'Bonvini, Ezio', 'Cignetti, Alessandro', 'Inghirami, Giorgio']","['Circosta P', 'Elia AR', 'Landra I', 'Machiorlatti R', 'Todaro M', 'Aliberti S', 'Brusa D', 'Deaglio S', 'Chiaretti S', 'Bruna R', 'Gottardi D', 'Massaia M', 'Giacomo FD', 'Guarini AR', 'Foa R', 'Kyriakides PW', 'Bareja R', 'Elemento O', 'Chichili GR', 'Monteleone E', 'Moore PA', 'Johnson S', 'Bonvini E', 'Cignetti A', 'Inghirami G']","['Molecular Biotechnology Center, University of Torino, Italy, and Center for Experimental Research and Medical Studies (CeRMS), University of Torino, Torino, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Science and Center for Experimental Research and Medical Studies (CeRMS), University of Torino, Torino, Italy.', 'Molecular Biotechnology Center, University of Torino, Italy, and Center for Experimental Research and Medical Studies (CeRMS), University of Torino, Torino, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Science and Center for Experimental Research and Medical Studies (CeRMS), University of Torino, Torino, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Science and Center for Experimental Research and Medical Studies (CeRMS), University of Torino, Torino, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Science and Center for Experimental Research and Medical Studies (CeRMS), University of Torino, Torino, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Science and Center for Experimental Research and Medical Studies (CeRMS), University of Torino, Torino, Italy.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Science and Center for Experimental Research and Medical Studies (CeRMS), University of Torino, Torino, Italy.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, University of Torino, Torino, Italy;

However, CLL is associated with a profound immune defect, which might represent a critical limitation for mounting clinically effective antitumor immune responses. As several studies have demonstrated that lenalidomide can reinforce effector T-cell responses in CLL, the combination of T-cell-based immunotherapy with the immunomodulatory drug lenalidomide represents a promising approach to overcome the immunosuppressive state in CLL. Antigen-specific immunotherapy also requires the robust presentation of tumor-associated HLA-presented antigens on target cells. We thus performed a longitudinal study of the effect of lenalidomide on the HLA ligandome of primary CLL cells in vitro. We showed that lenalidomide exposure does not affect absolute HLA class I and II surface expression levels on primary CLL cells. Importantly, semi-quantitative mass spectrometric analyses of the HLA peptidome of three CLL patient samples found only minor qualitative and quantitative effects of lenalidomide on HLA class I- and II-restricted peptide presentation. Furthermore, we confirmed stable presentation of previously described CLL-associated antigens under lenalidomide treatment. Strikingly, among the few HLA ligands showing significant modulation under lenalidomide treatment, we identified upregulated IKZF-derived peptides, which may represent a direct reflection of the cereblon-mediated effect of lenalidomide on CLL cells. Since we could not observe any relevant influence of lenalidomide on the established CLL-associated antigen targets of anticancer T-cell responses, this study validates the suitability of lenalidomide for the combination with antigen-specific T-cell-based immunotherapies.","['Nelde, Annika', 'Kowalewski, Daniel J', 'Backert, Linus', 'Schuster, Heiko', 'Werner, Jan-Ole', 'Klein, Reinhild', 'Kohlbacher, Oliver', 'Kanz, Lothar', 'Salih, Helmut R', 'Rammensee, Hans-Georg', 'Stevanovic, Stefan', 'Walz, Juliane S']","['Nelde A', 'Kowalewski DJ', 'Backert L', 'Schuster H', 'Werner JO', 'Klein R', 'Kohlbacher O', 'Kanz L', 'Salih HR', 'Rammensee HG', 'Stevanovic S', 'Walz JS']","['Institute for Cell Biology, Department of Immunology, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Institute for Cell Biology, Department of Immunology, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Immatics Biotechnologies GmbH, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Institute for Cell Biology, Department of Immunology, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Applied Bioinformatics, Center for Bioinformatics and Department of Computer Science, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Institute for Cell Biology, Department of Immunology, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Immatics Biotechnologies GmbH, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Applied Bioinformatics, Center for Bioinformatics and Department of Computer Science, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Quantitative Biology Center, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Biomolecular Interactions, Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Clinical Cooperation Unit Translational Immunology, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), DKFZ partner site Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Institute for Cell Biology, Department of Immunology, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), DKFZ partner site Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Institute for Cell Biology, Department of Immunology, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), DKFZ partner site Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180214,United States,Oncoimmunology,Oncoimmunology,101570526,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*HLA', '*T-cell-based immunotherapy', '*lenalidomide', '*mass spectrometry']",2018/04/11 06:00,2018/04/11 06:01,['2018/04/11 06:00'],"['2016/12/23 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/14 00:00 [revised]', '2017/03/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/11 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1080/2162402X.2017.1316438 [doi]', '1316438 [pii]']",epublish,Oncoimmunology. 2018 Feb 14;7(4):e1316438. doi: 10.1080/2162402X.2017.1316438. eCollection 2018.,,,,PMC5889201,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Decitabine (DAC) has been reported to enhance the immunogenicity of tumor cells, thereby reinstating endogenous immune recognition and tumor lysis. However, DAC has also been demonstrated to have direct effects on immune cells. In this study, we report that DAC inhibits gammadelta T cell proliferation. In addition, DAC increases the number of KIR2DL2/3-positive gammadelta T cells, which are less cytotoxic than the KIR2DL2/3-negative gammadelta T cells. We found that DAC upregulated KIR2DL2/3 expression in KIR2DL2/3-negative gammadelta T cells by inhibiting KIR2DL2/3 promoter methylation, which enhances the binding of KIR2DL2/3 promoter to Sp-1 and activates KIR2DL2/3 gene expression. Our data demonstrated that DAC can inhibit the function of human gammadelta T cells at both cellular and molecular levels, which confirms and extrapolates the results of previous studies showing that DAC can negatively regulate the function of NK cells and alphabeta T cells of the immune system.","['Niu, Chao', 'Li, Min', 'Zhu, Shan', 'Chen, Yongchong', 'Zhou, Lei', 'Xu, Dongsheng', 'Li, Wei', 'Cui, Jiuwei', 'Liu, Yongjun', 'Chen, Jingtao']","['Niu C', 'Li M', 'Zhu S', 'Chen Y', 'Zhou L', 'Xu D', 'Li W', 'Cui J', 'Liu Y', 'Chen J']","['Department of Translational Medicine, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Cancer Center, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Cancer Center, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Translational Medicine, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Cancer Center, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Cancer Center, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Cancer Center, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Cancer Center, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Cancer Center, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Translational Medicine, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Sanofi Research and Development, Cambridge, MA, United States.', 'Department of Translational Medicine, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180326,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (KIR2DL2 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)', '0 (Receptors, KIR2DL2)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Sp1 kinase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'DNA Methylation', 'Decitabine/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/immunology/*therapy', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/metabolism', 'Receptors, KIR2DL2/genetics/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology/transplantation']",['NOTNLM'],"['*DNA methylation', '*DNA methyltransferase inhibitor', '*adoptive cell immunotherapy', '*killer Ig-like receptors', '*myelodysplastic syndrome']",2018/04/11 06:00,2018/04/11 06:01,['2018/04/11 06:00'],"['2017/10/31 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/11 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2018.00617 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2018 Mar 26;9:617. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2018.00617. eCollection 2018.,,,,PMC5879086,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overexpression of MALAT1 has been demonstrated to related to poor prognosis of multiple myeloma (MM) patients. Here, we demonstrated that MALAT1 plays important roles in MM DNA repair and cell death. We found bone marrow plasma cells from patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and MM express elevated MALAT1 and involve in alternative non-homozygous end joining (A-NHEJ) pathway by binding to PARP1 and LIG3, two key components of the A-NHEJ protein complex. Degradation of the MALAT1 RNA by RNase H using antisense gapmer DNA oligos in MM cells stimulated poly-ADP-ribosylation of nuclear proteins, defected the DNA repair pathway, and further provoked apoptotic pathways. Anti-MALAT1 therapy combined with PARP1 inhibitor or proteasome inhibitor in MM cells showed a synergistic effect in vitro. Furthermore, using novel single-wall carbon nanotube (SWCNT) conjugated with anti-MALAT1 oligos, we successfully knocked-down MALAT1 RNA in cultured MM cell lines and xenograft murine models. Most importantly, anti-MALAT1 therapy induced DNA damage and cell apoptosis in vivo, indicating that MALAT1 could serve as a potential novel therapeutic target for MM treatment.","['Hu, Yi', 'Lin, Jianhong', 'Fang, Hua', 'Fang, Jing', 'Li, Chen', 'Chen, Wei', 'Liu, Shuang', 'Ondrejka, Sarah', 'Gong, Zihua', 'Reu, Frederic', 'Maciejewski, Jaroslaw', 'Yi, Qing', 'Zhao, Jian-Jun']","['Hu Y', 'Lin J', 'Fang H', 'Fang J', 'Li C', 'Chen W', 'Liu S', 'Ondrejka S', 'Gong Z', 'Reu F', 'Maciejewski J', 'Yi Q', 'Zhao JJ']","['Department of Cancer Biology, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, 44195, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, 44195, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02215, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, 44195, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, Fu Xing Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, 100038, China.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, 44195, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, 44195, USA.', 'College of Food Science and Technology, Agricultural University of Hebei, Baoding, Hebei, 071000, China.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, 44195, USA.', 'Department of Ultrasound, The Fourth Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, 050011, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Norman Bethune International Peace Hospital, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, 050082, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, 44195, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, 44195, USA.', 'Department of Translational Hematology & Oncology Research, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, 44195, USA.', 'Department of Translational Hematology & Oncology Research, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, 44195, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, 44195, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, 44195, USA. zhaoj4@ccf.org.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180322,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (MALAT1 long non-coding RNA, human)', '0 (Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (PARP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1)', 'EC 6.5.1.1 (DNA Ligase ATP)', 'EC 6.5.1.1 (LIG3 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Cell Death/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Damage/*genetics', 'DNA Ligase ATP/*genetics', 'DNA Repair/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance/genetics', 'Multiple Myeloma/*genetics', 'Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1/*genetics', 'Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'RNA Interference/physiology', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*genetics']",,,2018/04/11 06:00,2019/06/14 06:00,['2018/04/11 06:00'],"['2017/09/29 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/02/12 00:00 [revised]', '2018/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-018-0104-2 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-018-0104-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2018 Oct;32(10):2250-2262. doi: 10.1038/s41375-018-0104-2.

Platelet expression profiling of a patient with a heterozygous RUNX1 mutation (c.969-323G>T) revealed decreased RAB1B, which encodes a small G protein. RAB GTPases regulate vesicle trafficking, and RAB1B is implicated in endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-to-Golgi transport in nonhematopoietic cells, but its role in megakaryocytes (MK) is unknown. We addressed the hypothesis that RAB1B is a transcriptional target of RUNX1 and that RAB1B regulates ER-to-Golgi transport in MK cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies and electrophoretic mobility shift assay using phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-treated human erythroleukemia cells revealed RUNX1 binding to RAB1B promoter region RUNX1 consensus sites, and their mutation reduced the promoter activity. RAB1B promoter activity and protein expression were inhibited by RUNX1 siRNA and enhanced by RUNX1 overexpression. These indicate that RAB1B is a direct RUNX1 target, providing a mechanism for decreased RAB1B in patient platelets. Vesicle trafficking from ER to Golgi in PMA-treated human erythroleukemia cells was impaired along with Golgi disruption on siRNA downregulation of RUNX1 or RAB1B. The effects of RUNX1 knockdown were reversed by RAB1B reconstitution. Trafficking of von Willebrand factor (vWF), an alpha-granule MK synthesized protein, was impaired with RUNX1 or RAB1B downregulation and reconstituted by ectopic RAB1B expression. Platelet vWF was decreased in patients with RUNX1 mutations. Thus, ER-to-Golgi transport, an early critical step in protein trafficking to granules, is impaired in megakaryocytic cells on RUNX1 downregulation, secondary to decreased RAB1B expression. Impaired RAB1B mediated ER-to-Golgi transport contributes to platelet alpha-granule defects in RUNX1 haplodeficiency.","['Jalagadugula, Gauthami', 'Goldfinger, Lawrence E', 'Mao, Guangfen', 'Lambert, Michele P', 'Rao, A Koneti']","['Jalagadugula G', 'Goldfinger LE', 'Mao G', 'Lambert MP', 'Rao AK']","['Sol Sherry Thrombosis Research Center and.', 'Sol Sherry Thrombosis Research Center and.', 'Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Sol Sherry Thrombosis Research Center and.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA; and."", 'Sol Sherry Thrombosis Research Center and.', 'Department of Medicine, Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University, Philadelphia, PA.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-3078-7778'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (von Willebrand Factor)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Rab1B protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rab1 GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Blood Platelets/chemistry', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/metabolism', 'Female', 'Golgi Apparatus/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/*chemistry', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Transport', 'rab1 GTP-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'von Willebrand Factor/metabolism']",,,2018/04/11 06:00,2019/03/21 06:00,['2018/04/11 06:00'],"['2017/11/16 00:00 [received]', '2018/02/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/21 06:00 [medline]']","['bloodadvances.2017014274 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2017014274 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2018 Apr 10;2(7):797-806. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2017014274.,['(c) 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,"['R01 HL109568/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL137207/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL137376/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC5894258,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In our study, it was found that TW37 exerted a significant effect on the proliferation, apoptosis and migration of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer cells. Bcl-2 is also a key downstream factor of many signaling pathways such as Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR). TW37 enhanced the inhibition of tumorigenesis by gefitinib, an EGFR-Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor drug. Moreover, TW37 can promote apoptosis ability by inhibiting the phosphorylation level of EGFR protein in H1975 cells.

Genetic deletion or chronic pharmacological inhibition of mGluR5 by the negative allosteric modulator CTEP, rescues cognitive function and reduces Abeta aggregation in both APPswe/PS1DeltaE9 and 3xTg-AD mouse models of AD. In late onset neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD, defects arise at different stages of the autophagy pathway. Here, we show that mGluR5 cell surface expression is elevated in APPswe/PS1DeltaE9 and 3xTg-AD mice. This is accompanied by reduced autophagy (accumulation of p62) as the consequence of increased ZBTB16 expression and reduced ULK1 activity, as we have previously observed in Huntington's disease (HD). The chronic (12 week) inhibition of mGluR5 with CTEP in APPswe/PS1DeltaE9 and 3xTg-AD mice prevents the observed increase in mGluR5 surface expression. In addition, mGluR5 inactivation facilitates the loss of ZBTB16 expression and ULK1 activation as a consequence of ULK-Ser757 dephosphorylation, which promotes the loss of expression of the autophagy marker p62. Moreover, the genetic ablation of mGluR5 in APPswe/PS1DeltaE9 mice activated autophagy via similar mechanisms to pharmacological blockade. This study provides further evidence that mGluR5 overactivation contributes to inhibition of autophagy and can result in impaired clearance of neurotoxic aggregates in multiple neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, it provides additional support for the potential of mGluR5 inhibition as a general therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative diseases such as AD and HD.","['Abd-Elrahman, Khaled S', 'Hamilton, Alison', 'Vasefi, Maryam', 'Ferguson, Stephen S G']","['Abd-Elrahman KS', 'Hamilton A', 'Vasefi M', 'Ferguson SSG']","['University of Ottawa Brain and Mind Institute, University of Ottawa, 451 Smyth Road, Ottawa, ON, K1H 8M5, Canada.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Ottawa, 451 Smyth Road, Ottawa, ON, K1H 8M5, Canada.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Alexandria, Alexandria, 21521, Egypt.', 'University of Ottawa Brain and Mind Institute, University of Ottawa, 451 Smyth Road, Ottawa, ON, K1H 8M5, Canada.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Ottawa, 451 Smyth Road, Ottawa, ON, K1H 8M5, Canada.', 'Lamar University, Beaumont, TX, 77710, USA.', 'University of Ottawa Brain and Mind Institute, University of Ottawa, 451 Smyth Road, Ottawa, ON, K1H 8M5, Canada. sferguso@uottawa.ca.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Ottawa, 451 Smyth Road, Ottawa, ON, K1H 8M5, Canada. sferguso@uottawa.ca.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-0887-7312'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180410,England,Mol Brain,Molecular brain,101468876,"['0', '(2-chloro-4-((2,5-dimethyl-1-(4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl)-1H-imidazol-4-yl)ethyny', 'l)pyridine)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Receptor, Metabotropic Glutamate 5)', '0 (Zbtb16 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Autophagy-Related Protein-1 Homolog)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ulk1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Alzheimer Disease/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Animals', '*Autophagy/drug effects', 'Autophagy-Related Protein-1 Homolog/metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', '*Gene Silencing/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein/metabolism', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Receptor, Metabotropic Glutamate 5/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction']",['NOTNLM'],"['*3xTg-AD', '*APPswe/PS1DeltaE9', ""*Alzheimer's disease"", '*Autophagy', '*CTEP', '*GPCR', '*ULK1', '*ZBTB16', '*mGluR5']",2018/04/11 06:00,2018/10/23 06:00,['2018/04/11 06:00'],"['2018/03/08 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13041-018-0364-9 [doi]', '10.1186/s13041-018-0364-9 [pii]']",epublish,Mol Brain. 2018 Apr 10;11(1):19. doi: 10.1186/s13041-018-0364-9.,,,['119437/CIHR/Canada'],PMC5892040,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ara-C undergoes a three-step phosphorylation into the active metabolite Ara-C triphosphosphate (ara-CTP). Several enzymes are involved directly or indirectly in either the formation or detoxification of ara-CTP. METHODS: A total of 12 eQTL (expression Quantitative Trait Loci) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or tag SNPs in 7 genes including CMPK1, NME1, NME2, RRM1, RRM2, SAMHD1 and E2F1 were genotyped in 361 Chinese non-M3 AML patients by using the Sequenom Massarray system. Association of the SNPs with complete remission (CR) rate after Ara-C based induction therapy, relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed. RESULTS: Three SNPs were observed to be associated increased risk of chemoresistance indicated by CR rate (NME2 rs3744660, E2F1 rs3213150, and RRM2 rs1130609), among which two (rs3744660 and rs1130609) were eQTL. Combined genotypes based on E2F1 rs3213150 and RRM2 rs1130609 polymorphisms further increased the risk of non-CR. The SAMHD1 eQTL polymorphism rs6102991 showed decreased risk of non-CR marginally (P = 0.055). Three SNPs (NME1 rs3760468 and rs2302254, and NME2 rs3744660) were associated with worse RFS, and the RRM2 rs1130609 polymorphism was marginally associated with worse RFS (P = 0.085) and OS (P = 0.080). Three SNPs (NME1 rs3760468, NME2 rs3744660, and RRM1 rs183484) were associated with worse OS in AML patients. CONCLUSION: Data from our study demonstrated that SNPs in Ara-C and dNTP metabolic pathway predict chemosensitivity and prognosis of AML patients in China.","['Zhu, Ke-Wei', 'Chen, Peng', 'Zhang,

As anoikis sensitization may benefit for cancer therapy, this study demonstrated the potential of avicequinone B, a natural furanonaphthoquinone found in mangrove tree (Avicenniaceae) to sensitize anoikis in human lung cancer cells. METHODS: Anoikis inducing effect was investigated in human lung cancer H460, H292 and H23 cells that were cultured in ultra-low attachment plate with non-cytotoxic concentrations of avicequinone B. Viability of detached cells was evaluated by XTT assay at 0-24 h of incubation time. Soft agar assay was performed to investigate the inhibitory effect of avicequinone B on anchorage-independent growth. The alteration of anoikis regulating molecules including survival and apoptosis proteins were elucidated by western blot analysis. RESULTS: Avicequinone B at 4 muM significantly induced anoikis and inhibited proliferation under detachment condition in various human lung cancer cells. The reduction of anti-apoptotic proteins including anti-apoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1) associating with the diminution of integrin/focal adhesion kinase (FAK)/Proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase (Src) signals were detected in avicequinone B-treated cells. CONCLUSIONS: Avicequinone B sensitized anoikis in human lung cancer cells through down-regulation of anti-apoptosis proteins and integrin-mediated survival signaling.","['Prateep, Arisara', 'Sumkhemthong, Somruethai', 'Karnsomwan, Wiranpat', 'De-Eknamkul, Wanchai', 'Chamni, Supakarn', 'Chanvorachote, Pithi', 'Chaotham, Chatchai']","['Prateep A', 'Sumkhemthong S', 'Karnsomwan W', 'De-Eknamkul W', 'Chamni S', 'Chanvorachote P', 'Chaotham C']","['Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand.', 'Department of Pharmacognosy and Pharmaceutical Botany, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, 10330, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Department of Pharmacognosy and Pharmaceutical Botany, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, 10330, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Department of Pharmacognosy and Pharmaceutical Botany, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, 10330, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Physiology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand. pithi_chan@yahoo.com.', 'Cell-based Drug and Health Products Development Research Unit, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand. pithi_chan@yahoo.com.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand. cchoatham@gmail.com.', 'Cell-based Drug and Health Products Development Research Unit, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand. cchoatham@gmail.com.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180409,England,J Biomed Sci,Journal of biomedical science,9421567,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Naphthoquinones)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '5656-82-6 (naphtho(2,3-b)furan-4,9-dione)']",IM,"['Anoikis/*drug effects', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'Naphthoquinones/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",['NOTNLM'],"['Anoikis', 'Avicequinone B', 'Furanonaphthoquinone', 'Lung cancer', 'Survival pathway']",2018/04/11 06:00,2018/09/12 06:00,['2018/04/11 06:00'],"['2017/11/23 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12929-018-0435-3 [doi]', '10.1186/s12929-018-0435-3 [pii]']",epublish,J Biomed Sci. 2018 Apr 9;25(1):32. doi: 10.1186/s12929-018-0435-3.,,,"['90th Anniversary of Chulalongkorn University Ratchadaphiseksomphot Endowment', 'Fund/Chulalongkorn University', 'MRG5980143/Thailand Research Fund']",PMC5890350,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Secondary objective was to describe the interrater reliability of each SSPedi item. METHODS: Respondents were children aged eight to 18 years with cancer or HSCT recipients, and their parents or guardians. We enrolled two pediatric respondent groups. The more symptomatic group was receiving active treatment for cancer, admitted to hospital, and expected to be in a hospital three days later. The less symptomatic group either was in maintenance therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia or had completed cancer treatments. Convergent validity was evaluated by comparing proxy-reported mucositis, nausea and vomiting, pain, and total SSPedi scores, with child self-reported validated scales, and we hypothesized fair correlations. Discriminant validity was evaluated by comparing proxy-reported total SSPedi scores between groups. Interrater reliability of each SSPedi item was evaluated. RESULTS: Four hundred thirty-nine child and parent or guardian pairs were recruited. Mean difference in proxy-reported SSPedi scores between the more and less symptomatic groups was 8.2, 95% CI 6.6-9.8. All hypothesized relationships among measures were observed. Intraclass correlation coefficients for SSPedi items ranged from 0.34 (problems with thinking) to 0.80 (diarrhea). CONCLUSION: Proxy-report SSPedi is reliable and valid in children aged 8 years to 18 years with cancer and HSCT recipients. Future work should support proxy-reported symptom assessment in clinical settings where children are not able to self-report or communicate bothersome symptoms.","['Hyslop, Shannon', 'Dupuis, L Lee', 'Baggott, Christina', 'Dix, David', 'Gibson, Paul', 'Kuczynski, Susan', 'Johnston, Donna L', 'Orsey, Andrea', 'Portwine, Carol', 'Price, Vicky', 'Spiegler, Brenda', 'Tomlinson, Deborah', 'Vanan, Magimairajan', 'Tomlinson, George A', 'Sung, Lillian']","['Hyslop S', 'Dupuis LL', 'Baggott C', 'Dix D', 'Gibson P', 'Kuczynski S', 'Johnston DL', 'Orsey A', 'Portwine C', 'Price V', 'Spiegler B', 'Tomlinson D', 'Vanan M', 'Tomlinson GA', 'Sung L']","['Program in Child Health Evaluative Sciences, The Hospital for Sick Children, Peter Gilgan Centre for Research and Learning, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Program in Child Health Evaluative Sciences, The Hospital for Sick Children, Peter Gilgan Centre for Research and Learning, Toronto, Ontario, Canada; Department of Pharmacy, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada; Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Stanford University Cancer Clinical Trials Office, Palo Alto, California, USA.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology/BMT, Department of Pediatrics, BC Children's Hospital, Vancouver, Canada."", 'Haematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, London Health Sciences Centre, London, Ontario, Canada.', 'Ontario Parents Advocating for Children with Cancer (OPACC), Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada."", ""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Connecticut Children's Medical Center, Hartford, Connecticut, USA."", ""Division of Haematology/Oncology, McMaster Children's Hospital, Health Sciences Centre, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada."", 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, IWK Health Centre, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.', 'Department of Psychology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Program in Child Health Evaluative Sciences, The Hospital for Sick Children, Peter Gilgan Centre for Research and Learning, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Departments of Pediatrics & Child Health and Biochemistry & Medical Genetics, Pediatric Hematology/Oncology/BMT, CancerCare Manitoba, Research Institute in Oncology and Hematology, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, Toronto General Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Program in Child Health Evaluative Sciences, The Hospital for Sick Children, Peter Gilgan Centre for Research and Learning, Toronto, Ontario, Canada; Division of Haematology/Oncology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

The presence of minimal residual disease was studied using PCR-SSCP (single-strand conformation polymorphism) 1 year after treatment. The association between the miRNA expression and drug resistance was analyzed statistically. Results showed a significant down-regulation of both miR-326 and miR-200c expressions in ALL patients compared with non-cancer controls (P = 0.0002, AUC = 0.813 and P = 0.035, AUC = 0.79, respectively). A considerable negative association between miR-326 expression and MDR was identified which could raise the risk of chemoresistance by 4.8- fold. The expression profiles of miR-326 and ABCA2 transporter were inversely correlated. Data revealed, a novel diagnostic role for miR-326 and miR-200c as potential biomarkers of pediatric ALL. Down-regulation of miR-326 was introduced, for the first time, as a prognostic factor for drug resistance in childhood ALL. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that ABCA2 transporter is proposed as a target gene for miR-326, through which it can exert its impact on drug resistance. These data may provide novel approaches to new therapeutics and diagnostics.","['Ghodousi, Elaheh S', 'Rahgozar, Soheila']","['Ghodousi ES', 'Rahgozar S']","['Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, University of Isfahan, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, University of Isfahan, Isfahan, Iran.']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-1376-255X'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180406,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (ABCA2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (MIRN200 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN326 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/genetics/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*ABC transporters', '*childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*miR-200c', '*miR-326', '*multidrug resistance', '*relapse']",2018/04/10 06:00,2019/04/30 06:00,['2018/04/10 06:00'],"['2017/10/03 00:00 [received]', '2018/02/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/30 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.26800 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2018 Jul;119(7):6024-6032. doi: 10.1002/jcb.26800.

METHODS: Using microarrays and reverse-transcription quantitative-PCR, we analyzed microRNA (miRNA) expression in bone marrow CD34+ cells of 27 patients with higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes or acute myeloid leukemia with myelodysplasia-related changes before and during AZA treatment. RESULTS: At baseline, we found that future overall response rate was significantly higher in patients with upregulated miR-17-3p and downregulated miR-100-5p and miR-133b. Importantly, the high level of miR-100-5p at baseline was associated with shorter overall survival (HR = 4.066, P= 0.008). After AZA treatment, we observed deregulation of 30 miRNAs in responders (including downregulation of miR-10b-5p, miR-15a-5p/b-5p, miR-24-3p, and miR-148b-3p), while their levels remained unchanged in non-responders. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that responders and non-responders have distinct miRNA patterns and that the level of specific miRNAs before therapy may predict the efficacy of AZA treatment.","['Krejcik, Zdenek', 'Belickova, Monika', 'Hrustincova, Andrea', 'Votavova, Hana', 'Jonasova, Anna', 'Cermak, Jaroslav', 'Dyr, Jan E', 'Merkerova, Michaela Dostalova']","['Krejcik Z', 'Belickova M', 'Hrustincova A', 'Votavova H', 'Jonasova A', 'Cermak J', 'Dyr JE', 'Merkerova MD']","['Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'General University Hospital, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Cancer Biomark,Cancer biomarkers : section A of Disease markers,101256509,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology']",['NOTNLM'],"['Myelodysplastic syndromes', 'azacitidine', 'microRNA', 'response prediction']",2018/04/10 06:00,2018/10/03 06:00,['2018/04/10 06:00'],"['2018/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/03 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['CBM171029 [pii]', '10.3233/CBM-171029 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biomark. 2018;22(1):101-110. doi: 10.3233/CBM-171029.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Metformin is a widely used drug for type 2 DM that reduces the need for insulin in type 1 DM. However, whether metformin has an anti-inflammatory effect for treating DM is unknown. We investigated the anti-inflammatory mechanism of metformin in the human monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The human monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 was pretreated with metformin and stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The production of T-helper (Th)-1-related chemokines including interferon-gamma-induced protein-10 (IP-10) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), Th2-related chemokine macrophage-derived chemokine, and the proinflammatory chemokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha was measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Intracellular signaling pathways were investigated using Western blot analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. RESULTS: Metformin suppressed LPS-induced IP-10 and MCP-1 production as well as LPS-induced phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB). Moreover, metformin suppressed LPS-induced acetylation of histones H3 and H4 at the IP-10 promoter. CONCLUSIONS: Metformin suppressed the production of Th1-related chemokines IP-10 and MCP-1 in THP-1 cells. Suppressive effects of metformin on IP-10 production might be attributed at least partially to the JNK, p38, ERK, and NF-kappaB pathways as well as to epigenetic regulation through the acetylation of histones H3 and H4. These results indicated the therapeutic anti-inflammatory potential of metformin.","['Chen, Yen-Chun', 'Kuo, Chang-Hung', 'Tsai, Ying-Ming', 'Lin, Yi-Ching', 'Hsiao, Hui-Pin', 'Chen, Bai-Hsiun', 'Chen, Yi-Ting', 'Wang, Shih-Ling', 'Hung, Chih-Hsing']","['Chen YC', 'Kuo CH', 'Tsai YM', 'Lin YC', 'Hsiao HP', 'Chen BH', 'Chen YT', 'Wang SL', 'Hung CH']","['a Department of Pediatrics , Kaohsiung Municipal Hsiao-Kang Hospital , Kaohsiung , Taiwan.', 'b Department of Pediatrics, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital , Kaohsiung Medical University , Kaohsiung , Taiwan.', 'c Ta-Kuo Clinic , Kaohsiung , Taiwan.', 'd Department of Pediatrics , Kaohsiung Municipal Ta-Tung Hospital , Kaohsiung , Taiwan.', 'e Department of Internal Medicine , Kaohsiung Municipal Ta-Tung Hospital , Kaohsiung , Taiwan.', 'f Graduate Institute of Clinical Medicine, College of Medicine , Kaohsiung Medical University , Kaohsiung , Taiwan.', 'b Department of Pediatrics, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital , Kaohsiung Medical University , Kaohsiung , Taiwan.', 'f Graduate Institute of Clinical Medicine, College of Medicine , Kaohsiung Medical University , Kaohsiung , Taiwan.', 'g Department of Laboratory Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital , Kaohsiung Medical University , Kaohsiung , Taiwan.', 'a Department of Pediatrics , Kaohsiung Municipal Hsiao-Kang Hospital , Kaohsiung , Taiwan.', 'b Department of Pediatrics, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital , Kaohsiung Medical University , Kaohsiung , Taiwan.', 'h Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, College of Medicine , Kaohsiung Medical University , Kaohsiung , Taiwan.', 'b Department of Pediatrics, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital , Kaohsiung Medical University , Kaohsiung , Taiwan.', 'g Department of Laboratory Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital , Kaohsiung Medical University , Kaohsiung , Taiwan.', 'h Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, College of Medicine , Kaohsiung Medical University , Kaohsiung , Taiwan.', 'b Department of Pediatrics, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital , Kaohsiung Medical University , Kaohsiung , Taiwan.', 'b Department of Pediatrics, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital , Kaohsiung Medical University , Kaohsiung , Taiwan.', 'a Department of Pediatrics , Kaohsiung Municipal Hsiao-Kang Hospital , Kaohsiung , Taiwan.', 'b Department of Pediatrics, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital , Kaohsiung Medical University , Kaohsiung , Taiwan.', 'h Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, College of Medicine , Kaohsiung Medical University , Kaohsiung , Taiwan.', 'i Research Center for Environmental Medicine , Kaohsiung Medical University , Kaohsiung , Taiwan.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180409,England,Endocr Res,Endocrine research,8408548,"['0 (Chemokine CCL2)', '0 (Chemokines)', '0 (Hypoglycemic Agents)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '9100L32L2N (Metformin)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Chemokine CCL2/metabolism', 'Chemokines/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hypoglycemic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Metformin/*pharmacology', 'Monocytes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'THP-1 Cells', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['Diabetes mellitus', 'T-helper 1-related chemokine', 'interferon-gamma-induced protein-10', 'metformin', 'monocyte']",2018/04/10 06:00,2019/02/20 06:00,['2018/04/10 06:00'],"['2018/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/20 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/07435800.2018.1460605 [doi]'],ppublish,Endocr Res. 2018 Nov;43(4):228-234. doi: 10.1080/07435800.2018.1460605.

It is the most common cause of leukemia-associated mortality in adults. Initially, AML is a disease of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) characterized by arrest of differentiation, subsequent accumulation of leukemia blast cells, and reduced production of functional hematopoietic elements. Heterogeneity extends to the presence of leukemia stem cells (LSC), with this dynamic cell compartment evolving to overcome various selection pressures imposed upon during leukemia progression and treatment. To further define the LSC population, the addition of CD90 and CD45RA allows the discrimination of normal HSCs and multipotent progenitors within the CD34+CD38- cell compartment. Here, we outline a protocol to detect simultaneous expression of several putative LSC markers (CD34, CD38, CD45RA, CD90) on primary blast cells of human AML by multiparametric flow cytometry. Furthermore, we show how to quantify three progenitor populations and a putative LSC population with increasing degree of maturation. We confirmed the presence of these populations in corresponding patient-derived-xenografts. This method of detection and quantification of putative LSC may be used for clinical follow-up of chemotherapy response (i.e., minimal residual disease), as residual LSC may cause AML relapse.","['Boyer, Thomas', 'Gonzales, Fanny', 'Plesa, Adriana', 'Peyrouze, Pauline', 'Barthelemy, Adeline', 'Guihard, Soizic', 'Quesnel, Bruno', 'Roumier, Christophe', 'Preudhomme, Claude', 'Cheok, Meyling']","['Boyer T', 'Gonzales F', 'Plesa A', 'Peyrouze P', 'Barthelemy A', 'Guihard S', 'Quesnel B', 'Roumier C', 'Preudhomme C', 'Cheok M']","[""Laboratoire d'hematologie, CHU Lille; Univ.

Here, we demonstrate using MR1 tetramers that recipient MAIT cells are present in small but definable numbers in graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) target organs and protect from acute GVHD in the colon following bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Consistent with their preferential juxtaposition to microbial signals in the colon, recipient MAIT cells generate large amounts of IL-17A, promote gastrointestinal tract integrity, and limit the donor alloantigen presentation that in turn drives donor Th1 and Th17 expansion specifically in the colon after BMT. Allogeneic BMT recipients deficient in IL-17A also develop accelerated GVHD, suggesting MAIT cells likely regulate GVHD, at least in part, by the generation of this cytokine. Indeed, analysis of stool microbiota and colon tissue from IL-17A-/- and MR1-/- mice identified analogous shifts in microbiome operational taxonomic units (OTU) and mediators of barrier integrity that appear to represent pathways controlled by similar, IL-17A-dependent mechanisms. Thus, MAIT cells act to control barrier function to attenuate pathogenic T cell responses in the colon and, given their very high frequency in humans, likely represent an important population in clinical BMT.","['Varelias, Antiopi', 'Bunting, Mark D', 'Ormerod, Kate L', 'Koyama, Motoko', 'Olver, Stuart D', 'Straube, Jasmin', 'Kuns, Rachel D', 'Robb, Renee J', 'Henden, Andrea S', 'Cooper, Leanne', 'Lachner, Nancy', 'Gartlan, Kate H', 'Lantz, Olivier', 'Kjer-Nielsen, Lars', 'Mak, Jeffrey Yw', 'Fairlie, David P', 'Clouston, Andrew D', 'McCluskey, James', 'Rossjohn, Jamie', 'Lane, Steven W', 'Hugenholtz, Philip', 'Hill, Geoffrey R']","['Varelias A', 'Bunting MD', 'Ormerod KL', 'Koyama M', 'Olver SD', 'Straube J', 'Kuns RD', 'Robb RJ', 'Henden AS', 'Cooper L', 'Lachner N', 'Gartlan KH', 'Lantz O', 'Kjer-Nielsen L', 'Mak JY', 'Fairlie DP', 'Clouston AD', 'McCluskey J', 'Rossjohn J', 'Lane SW', 'Hugenholtz P', 'Hill GR']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Laboratory, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, Australia.', 'Faculty of Medicine, and.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Laboratory, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, Australia.', 'Australian Centre for Ecogenomics, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Laboratory, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, Australia.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Laboratory, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, Australia.', 'Gordon and Jessie Gilmour Leukaemia Research Laboratory, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, Australia.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Laboratory, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, Australia.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Laboratory, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, Australia.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Laboratory, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, Australia.', ""The Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital, Brisbane, Australia."", 'Gordon and Jessie Gilmour Leukaemia Research Laboratory, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, Australia.', 'Australian Centre for Ecogenomics, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Laboratory, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, Australia.', 'Faculty of Medicine, and.', ""INSERM U932 and Department de Biologie des Tumeurs, Institute Curie and Centre d'Investigation Clinique, CICBT507 IGR/Curie, Paris, France."", 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Australia.', 'Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence in Advanced Molecular Imaging, Institute for Molecular Bioscience, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia.', 'Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence in Advanced Molecular Imaging, Institute for Molecular Bioscience, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia.', 'Envoi Specialist Pathologists, Brisbane, Australia.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Australia.', 'Infection and Immunity Program and The Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Biomedicine Discovery Institute Monash University, Clayton, Australia.', 'Institute of Infection and Immunity, Cardiff University School of Medicine, Cardiff, United Kingdom.', 'Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence in Advanced Molecular Imaging, Monash University, Clayton, Australia.', 'Faculty of Medicine, and.', 'Gordon and Jessie Gilmour Leukaemia Research Laboratory, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, Australia.', ""The Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital, Brisbane, Australia."", 'Australian Centre for Ecogenomics, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Laboratory, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, Australia.', 'Faculty of Medicine, and.', ""The Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital, Brisbane, Australia.""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180409,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,,IM,"['Allografts', 'Animals', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Colon/*immunology/pathology', 'Colonic Diseases/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mucosal-Associated Invariant T Cells/*immunology/pathology', 'Th17 Cells/*immunology/pathology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Bone marrow transplantation', '*Immunology', '*Transplantation']",2018/04/10 06:00,2019/09/12 06:00,['2018/04/10 06:00'],"['2016/11/07 00:00 [received]', '2018/02/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/12 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['91646 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI91646 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2018 May 1;128(5):1919-1936. doi: 10.1172/JCI91646.

The objective of this study was to identify the clinical and electrophysiological features of neurolymphomatosis. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of 13 patients with neurolymphomatosis. Seven (54%) of the patients were men, and the median age at symptom onset was 60.0 years. RESULTS: The most common type of underlying malignancy was diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (69%). Twelve patients had painful asymmetric neuropathies. The median survival time after diagnosis was 7 months, and 12 patients died during the study period. Thirty-eight motor nerve conduction studies (NCSs) were performed in the affected nerves. Ten and 28 motor nerves were classified into the conduction-block and simple-axon-degeneration groups, respectively. The median time interval between symptom onset and the NCS was significantly shorter in the conduction-block group than in the simple-axon-degeneration group (p=0.032). However, no significant differences in the motor nerve conduction velocities, terminal latencies, and distal compound muscle action potential amplitudes were identified between the conduction-block and simple-axon-degeneration groups. The conduction-block group showed excessive temporal dispersion in only five of the ten NCSs (50%). Follow-up NCSs revealed that partial conduction blocks had changed into axonal degeneration patterns. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to analyze the electrophysiological features of patients with neurolymphomatosis. Our findings showed that a partial conduction block is not rare and is an early nerve conduction abnormality in neurolymphomatosis.","['Park, Hyung Jun', 'Shin, Ha Young', 'Kim, Se Hoon', 'Jeong, Ha Neul', 'Choi, Young Chul', 'Suh, Bum Chun', 'Park, Kee Duk', 'Kim, Seung Min']","['Park HJ', 'Shin HY', 'Kim SH', 'Jeong HN', 'Choi YC', 'Suh BC', 'Park KD', 'Kim SM']","['Department of Neurology, Mokdong Hospital, College of Medicine, Ewha Womans University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Neurology, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Neurology, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pathology, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Neurology, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Neurology, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Neurology, Kangbuk Samsung Hospital, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Neurology, Mokdong Hospital, College of Medicine, Ewha Womans University, Seoul, Korea. pkd1165@ewha.ac.kr.', 'Department of Neurology, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea. kimsm@yuhs.ac.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Korea (South),J Clin Neurol,"Journal of clinical neurology (Seoul, Korea)",101252374,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['conduction block', 'leukemia', 'lymphoma', 'nerve conduction study', 'neurolymphomatosis']",2018/04/10 06:00,2018/04/10 06:01,['2018/04/10 06:00'],"['2017/07/14 00:00 [received]', '2017/09/20 00:00 [revised]', '2017/09/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/10 06:01 [medline]']","['14.73 [pii]', '10.3988/jcn.2018.14.1.73 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Neurol. 2018 Jan;14(1):73-80. doi: 10.3988/jcn.2018.14.1.73.,['Copyright (c) 2018 Korean Neurological Association.'],,,PMC5765259,,,['The authors have no financial conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,

During the study period, 201,738 deliveries met the inclusion criteria. Of them, 16.3% (n = 32,804) occurred in mothers aged 35 years or more (35-39 years old n = 26,145, 79.7%; 40-50 years old n = 6659, 20.3%). In the Weibull regression model, advanced maternal age exhibited no association with general malignant morbidity in the offspring up to 18 years of age (mothers aged 35-39: adjusted HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.76-1.48, p = 0.727; mothers aged 40-50: adjusted HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.36-1.46, p = 0.373). For leukemia, the regression model exhibited an independent association in maternal ages of 35-39 (adjusted HR 2.23, 95% CI 1.34-3.69, p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: Advanced maternal age does not appear to raise the risk for future malignancy in the offspring up to the age 18 years. The specific nature of the association between maternal age and leukemia of the offspring necessitates further investigation. What is Known: * Advanced maternal age is associated with a marked elevation in the risk of different pregnancy complications and adverse pregnancy outcomes. What is New: * Advanced maternal age does not appear to raise the risk for future malignancy in the offspring up to the age 18 years. * Leukemia of the offspring may be associated with advanced maternal age although the specific nature of the association necessitates further investigation.","['Imterat, Majdi', 'Wainstock, Tamar', 'Sheiner, Eyal', 'Kapelushnik, Joseph', 'Fischer, Laura', 'Walfisch, Asnat']","['Imterat M', 'Wainstock T', 'Sheiner E', 'Kapelushnik J', 'Fischer L', 'Walfisch A']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Soroka University Medical Center, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel. magdi_333@hotmail.com.', 'Department of Public Health, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Soroka University Medical Center, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel.', 'Department of Pediatric Hemato-Oncology, Soroka University Medical Center, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel.', 'Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Soroka University Medical Center, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7174-8591'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180408,Germany,Eur J Pediatr,European journal of pediatrics,7603873,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', '*Maternal Age', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer', 'Elderly', 'Follow-up', 'Leukemia', 'Malignancy', 'Offspring', 'Pediatric morbidity']",2018/04/10 06:00,2018/09/01 06:00,['2018/04/10 06:00'],"['2018/01/02 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/03/07 00:00 [revised]', '2018/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/01 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00431-018-3136-8 [doi]', '10.1007/s00431-018-3136-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Eur J Pediatr. 2018 Jun;177(6):879-886. doi: 10.1007/s00431-018-3136-8.

ATO is a potent chemotherapeutic drug that can also be used to treat other diseases, such as autoimmune diseases, because it affects multiple pathways including apoptosis induction, differentiation stimulation, and proliferation inhibition. As inflammation is a critical component of disease progression, ATO is a feasible treatment option based on its ability to protect against inflammation. However, ATO is also a well-known carcinogen because of its pro-inflammatory effect. This review will focus on the double-sided effects of ATO on inflammation as well as the relevant mechanisms underlying these effects, aiming to provide a rational understanding of how ATO effects the immune system.

The objective of the current study was to evaluate the association of chemotherapy-induced leukopenia during the induction phase with the clinical outcome of adult B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Fifty-one cases of B-ALL, age >/=14 years, were reviewed. The variables under consideration included age, sex, the initial white blood cell (WBC) count (WBC-0), as well as the WBC counts on days 8 (WBC-8), 15 (WBC-15), and 22 (WBC-22) during induction therapy, early bone marrow responses on day 15 during induction therapy, immunophenotype, and cytogenetics. Univariate analysis revealed that WBC-15 >/=0.40x10(9)/L was significantly associated with inferior event-free survival (EFS) (hazard ratio [HR]=2.95, P=0.004) and overall survival (OS) (HR=2.92, P=0.015). On multivariate analysis, high WBC-15 (>/=0.40x10(9)/L) remained an independent prognostic factor for EFS (HR=3.29, P=0.014) and OS (HR=3.29, P=0.038).

We aimed to investigate the predictive value of both stored (MRI-derived liver iron content) and biologically active iron (enhanced labile plasma iron; eLPI) on post-transplantation outcomes in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia or myelodysplastic syndrome undergoing allogenic HCT. METHODS: The prospective, multicentre, observational, ALLogeneic Iron inVEstigators (ALLIVE) trial recruited patients at five centres in Germany. We enrolled patients with acute myeloid leukaemia or myelodysplastic syndrome undergoing allogeneic HCT. Patients underwent cytotoxic conditioning for a median of 6 days (IQR 6-7) before undergoing allogeneic HCT and were followed up for up to 1 year (+/-3 months) post-transplantation. eLPI was measured in serum samples with the FeROS eLPI kit (Aferrix, Tel-Aviv, Israel) and values greater than 0.4 mumol/L were considered to represent raised eLPI. Liver iron content was measured by MRI. The primary endpoints were the quantitative delineation of eLPI dynamics during allogeneic HCT and the correlation coefficient between liver iron content before HCT and dynamic eLPI (eLPIdyn; maximum eLPI minus baseline eLPI). All patients with available data were included in all analyses. This is the final analysis of this completed trial, which is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01746147. FINDINGS: Between Dec 13, 2012, and Dec 23, 2014, 112 patients underwent allogeneic HCT. Liver iron content before allogeneic HCT was not significantly correlated with eLPIdyn (rho=0.116, p=0.22). Serum eLPI concentrations rapidly increased during conditioning, and most (79 [73%] of 108) patients had raised eLPI by the day of transplantation. Patients with a pretransplant liver iron content greater than or equal to 125 mumol/g had an increased incidence of non-relapse mortality (20%, 95% CI 14-26) compared with those with lower concentrations (7%, 2-12; p=0.039) at day 100. Patients who had raised eLPI at baseline also had a significantly increased incidence of non-relapse mortality at day 100 (33%, 15-52) compared with those who had normal eLPI at baseline (7%, 2-13; p=0.00034). INTERPRETATION: eLPI is a possible biological mediator of iron-related toxicity. Peritransplantation eLPI-scavenging strategies could be explored in prospective interventional clinical trials for patients with systemic iron overload.

In this study, three PRMT5 inhibitors (9, 16, and 23) with novel scaffolds were identified by performing pharmacophore- and docking-based virtual screening combined with in vitro radiometric-based scintillation proximity assay (SPA). Substructure search based on the scaffold of the most active 9 afforded 26 additional analogues, and SPA results indicated that two analogues (9-1 and 9-2) showed increased PRMT5 inhibitory activity compared with the parental compound. Resynthesis of 9, 9-1, and 9-2 confirmed their PRMT5 enzymatic inhibition activity. In addition, compound 9-1 displayed selectivity against PRMT5 over other key homological members (PRMT1 and CARM1 (PRMT4)). While the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of this series of compounds was discussed to provide clues for further structure optimization, the probable binding modes of active compounds were also probed by molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations. Finally, the antiproliferative effect of 9-1 on MV4-11 leukemia cell line was confirmed and its impact on regulating the target gene of PRMT5 was also validated. The hit compounds identified in this work have provided more novel scaffolds for future hit-to-lead optimization of small-molecule PRMT5 inhibitors.","['Zhu, Kongkai', 'Jiang, Chengshi', 'Tao, Hongrui', 'Liu, Jingqiu', 'Zhang, Hua', 'Luo, Cheng']","['Zhu K', 'Jiang C', 'Tao H', 'Liu J', 'Zhang H', 'Luo C']","['School of Biological Science and Technology, University of Jinan, Jinan 250022, PR China.', 'School of Biological Science and Technology, University of Jinan, Jinan 250022, PR China.', 'School of Biological Science and Technology, University of Jinan, Jinan 250022, PR China.', 'Drug Discovery and Design Center, State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, PR China.', 'School of Biological Science and Technology, University of Jinan, Jinan 250022, PR China.

In the present study, benzylidene-2,4-thiazolidinedione derivatives (compounds 2-5) were synthesized and screened against cancer cell lines and the genotoxicity and cytotoxicity of the most active compound (5) was investigated on normal and lung cancer cell line. METHODS: For in vitro cytotoxic screening, the MTT assay was used for HL60 and K562 (leukemia), MCF-7 (breast adenocarcinoma), HT29 (colon adenocarcinoma), HEp-2 (cervix carcinoma) and NCI-H292 (lung carcinoma) tumor cell lines and Alamar-blue assay was used for non-tumor cells (PBMC, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells) were used. Cell morphology was visualized after Giemsa-May-Grunwald staining. DNA content, phosphatidylserine externalization and mitochondrial depolarization were measured by flow cytometry. Genotoxicity was assessed by Comet assay. RESULTS: 5-(2-Bromo-5-methoxybenzylidene)-thiazolidine-2,4-dione (5) presented the most potent cytotoxicity, especially against NCI-H292 lung cancer cell line, with IC50 value of 1.26mug/mL after 72h incubation. None of the compounds were cytotoxic to PBMC. After 48h incubation, externalization of phosphatidylserine, mitochondrial depolarization, internucleosomal DNA fragmentation and morphological alterations consistent with apoptosis were observed in NCI-H292 cells treated with compound (5). In addition, compound (5) also induced genotoxicity in NCI-H292 cells (2.8-fold increase in damage index compared to the negative control), but not in PBMC. CONCLUSION: Compound 5 presented selective cytotoxic and genotoxic activity against pulmonary carcinoma (NCI-H292 cells).","['Rodrigues, Maria do D', 'Santiago, Priscila B G S', 'Marques, Karla M R', 'Pereira, Valeria R A', 'de Castro, Maria C A B', 'Cantalice, Jeanne C L L', 'da Silva, Teresinha G', 'Adam, Monica L', 'do Nascimento, Silene C', 'de Albuquerque, Julianna F C', 'Militao, Gardenia C G']","['Rodrigues MDD', 'Santiago PBGS', 'Marques KMR', 'Pereira VRA', 'de Castro MCAB', 'Cantalice JCLL', 'da Silva TG', 'Adam ML', 'do Nascimento SC', 'de Albuquerque JFC', 'Militao GCG']","['Department of Antibiotics, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, PE, Brazil.', 'Department of Antibiotics, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, PE, Brazil.', 'Department of Antibiotics, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, PE, Brazil.', 'Department of Immunology, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Aggeu Magalhaes Research Center, Campus da UFPE, Recife, PE, Brazil.', 'Department of Immunology, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Aggeu Magalhaes Research Center, Campus da UFPE, Recife, PE, Brazil; Academic Center of Vitoria, Federal University of Pernambuco, Parasitology Laboratory, Recife, PE, Brazil.', 'Department of Antibiotics, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, PE, Brazil.', 'Department of Antibiotics, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, PE, Brazil.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Academic Center of Victoria, Federal University of Pernambuco, Receife, PE, Brazil.', 'Department of Antibiotics, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, PE, Brazil.', 'Department of Antibiotics, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, PE, Brazil.', 'Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, PE, Brazil.

We compared the characteristics and significance of KMT2D alterations in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with those in small cell lung cancer (SCLC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Tumors from 194 NSCLC patients with locally advanced or advanced disease and 64 SCLC patients underwent targeted-exome sequencing. The association of KMT2D mutation with overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) was measured using Kaplan-Meier methods and further evaluated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression model adjusting for known clinical prognostic features. RESULTS: The KMT2D mutation rate was 17.5% (34 of 194) in NSCLC. Patients with mutant KMT2D had significantly lower median OS (9.97 vs. 30.2 months; P < .0001) and median PFS (8.46 vs. 24.1 months; P = .0004) compared with patients with wild-type KMT2D. The KMT2D mutation was significantly more common in females (P = .017). Using a multivariate Cox regression model, KMT2D mutation was one of the most significant prognostic factors in NSCLC: hazard ratio (HR) for OS, 2.79 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8-4.33; P < .0001) and HR for PFS, 1.99 (95% CI, 1.32-3.01; P = .001). In contrast, the KMT2D mutation rate in SCLC was 32.8% (21 of 64) and showed no sex bias (P = .874). No significant change was found in survival in association with the KMT2D mutation in SCLC (OS, P = .952; PFS, P = .744). CONCLUSION: The KMT2D mutation was associated with reduced survival in NSCLC but not in SCLC.","['Ardeshir-Larijani, Fatemeh', 'Bhateja, Priyanka', 'Lipka, Mary Beth', 'Sharma, Neelesh', 'Fu, Pingfu', 'Dowlati, Afshin']","['Ardeshir-Larijani F', 'Bhateja P', 'Lipka MB', 'Sharma N', 'Fu P', 'Dowlati A']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Case Western Reserve University, University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center, Cleveland, OH.', 'Department of Population and Quantitative Health Sciences, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Case Western Reserve University, University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center, Cleveland, OH.

Recently, miR-122 was also found to be related to many other cancers besides HCC. However, less study determined miR-122 expression and its clinical significance in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). METHODS: Real-time quantitative PCR was performed to detect the level of bone marrow (BM) miR-122 in de novo AML patients. The clinical significance of miR-122 expression in AML was further investigated. RESULTS: Among whole-cohort AML, lower expression of BM miR-122 was associated with male patients, higher hemoglobin and favorable-karyotypes (P=0.038, 0.006, and 0.038, respectively). Among cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML), lower expression of BM miR-122 was correlated with DNMT3A wild type (P=0.043). Moreover, patients with lower expression of BM miR-122 presented lower complete remission (CR) rate and shorter overall survival (OS) than those with higher expression of BM miR-122 in CN-AML (P=0.025 and 0.013, respectively). Cox regression analyses further confirmed the prognostic value of BM miR-122 expression in CN-AML (P=0.024). In follow-up patients, BM miR-122 expression level in CR time was increased compared to diagnosis time, and was returned to primary level when in relapse time again (P=0.062 and 0.049, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicated that lower expression of BM miR-122 acted as an independent risk factor for OS in CN-AML.","['Zhang, Ting-Juan', 'Qian, Zhen', 'Wen, Xiang-Mei', 'Zhou, Jing-Dong', 'Li, Xi-Xi', 'Xu, Zi-Jun', 'Ma, Ji-Chun', 'Zhang, Zhi-Hui', 'Lin, Jiang', 'Qian, Jun']","['Zhang TJ', 'Qian Z', 'Wen XM', 'Zhou JD', 'Li XX', 'Xu ZJ', 'Ma JC', 'Zhang ZH', 'Lin J', 'Qian J']","[""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China; The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China; The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China; The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China; The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China; The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China; The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China; The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China; The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China; The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China.

Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO, an irreversible inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase) is reported to modulate polyamines to potentially attenuate proliferation of neuroblastoma cells. A clinical trial is being conducted to evaluate DFMO in various cancers. To determine the pharmacodynamics effect of DFMO, an analytical assay is needed to accurately measure the changes in polyamines in cancer cells. In this study, a novel pH gradient LC-ESI-MS/MS method was developed and validated for the quantitation of polyamines (putrescine, spermidine and spermine) in cancer cells. To separate polar and basic polyamines, a multi-mode column composed of ODS and weak ionic ligands was used. The pH gradient was generated from pH5.3 to pH2.7 with 2mM ammonium acetate and 0.4% acetic acid in 10% acetonitrile as mobile phase. The detection of polyamines was performed utilizing multiple reaction monitoring on electrospray ionization mass spectrometry operated in positive ion mode. A pH gradient method increased resolution and decreased peak width of conventional analytical assays, resulting in 10-250-fold higher detection limits. Mobile phases without ion-pairing reagents were LC-MS compatible and eliminated possible signal suppression and MS contamination. The developed method was successfully applied to the analysis of polyamines in neuroblastoma and leukemia cells treated with DFMO. Putrescine levels were significantly (p<0.001) decreased in CCRF-CEM (3.68 vs 1.23ng/mg protein), SK-N-BE(2) (1.98 vs 1.31ng/mg protein) and CHLA-20 (2.06 vs 0.90ng/mg protein) cells treated with DFMO relative to vehicle control.

Differential gene expression analysis identified a pharmacodynamic effect on MYC expression, as well as induction of DNA repair and stress response pathways. APTO-253 was found to elicit a concentration- and time-dependent reduction in MYC mRNA expression and protein levels. Gene ontogeny and structural informatic analyses suggested a mechanism involving G-quadruplex (G4) stabilization. Intracellular pharmacokinetic studies in AML cells revealed that APTO-253 is converted intracellularly from a monomer to a ferrous complex [Fe(253)3]. FRET assays demonstrated that both monomeric APTO-253 and Fe(253)3 stabilize G4 structures from telomeres, MYC, and KIT promoters but do not bind to non-G4 double-stranded DNA. Although APTO-253 exerts a host of mechanistic sequelae, the effect of APTO-253 on MYC expression and its downstream target genes, on cell-cycle arrest, DNA damage, and stress responses can be explained by the action of Fe(253)3 and APTO-253 on G-quadruplex DNA motifs.

However, lncRNA expression has not yet been comprehensively characterized in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here, we assess to what extent lncRNA expression is prognostic of AML patient overall survival (OS) and determine if there are indications of lncRNA-based molecular subtypes of AML. METHODS: We performed RNA sequencing of 274 intensively treated AML patients in a Swedish cohort and quantified lncRNA expression. Univariate and multivariate time-to-event analysis was applied to determine association between individual lncRNAs with OS. Unsupervised statistical learning was applied to ascertain if lncRNA-based molecular subtypes exist and are prognostic. RESULTS: Thirty-three individual lncRNAs were found to be associated with OS (adjusted p value < 0.05). We established four distinct molecular subtypes based on lncRNA expression using a consensus clustering approach. LncRNA-based subtypes were found to stratify patients into groups with prognostic information (p value < 0.05). Subsequently, lncRNA expression-based subtypes were validated in an independent patient cohort (TCGA-AML). LncRNA subtypes could not be directly explained by any of the recurrent cytogenetic or mutational aberrations, although associations with some of the established genetic and clinical factors were found, including mutations in NPM1, TP53, and FLT3. CONCLUSION: LncRNA expression-based four subtypes, discovered in this study, are reproducible and can effectively stratify AML patients. LncRNA expression profiling can provide valuable information for improved risk stratification of AML patients.","['Mer, Arvind Singh', 'Lindberg, Johan', 'Nilsson, Christer', 'Klevebring, Daniel', 'Wang, Mei', 'Gronberg, Henrik', 'Lehmann, Soren', 'Rantalainen, Mattias']","['Mer AS', 'Lindberg J', 'Nilsson C', 'Klevebring D', 'Wang M', 'Gronberg H', 'Lehmann S', 'Rantalainen M']","['Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet, Nobels Vag 12A, SE-17177, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Science for Life Laboratory, Karolinska Institutet, Nobels Vag 12A, SE-17177, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Hematology Centre, Karolinska University Hospital and Karolinska Institute, Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet, Nobels Vag 12A, SE-17177, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet, Nobels Vag 12A, SE-17177, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet, Nobels Vag 12A, SE-17177, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Hematology Centre, Karolinska University Hospital and Karolinska Institute, Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet, Nobels Vag 12A, SE-17177, Stockholm, Sweden.

At the same time, the role of post-translational control in adaptation to nutrient-poor environments is poorly understood. Previous studies demonstrate the ability of the glucosyltransferase UgtP to influence cell size in response to nutrient availability. Under nutrient-rich medium, interactions with its substrate UDP-glucose promote interactions between UgtP and the tubulin-like cell division protein FtsZ in Bacillus subtilis, inhibiting maturation of the cytokinetic ring and increasing cell size. In nutrient-poor medium, reductions in UDP-glucose availability favor UgtP oligomerization, sequestering it from FtsZ and allowing division to occur at a smaller cell mass. RESULTS: Intriguingly, in nutrient-poor conditions UgtP levels are reduced ~ 3-fold independent of UDP-glucose. B. subtilis cells cultured under different nutrient conditions indicate that UgtP accumulation is controlled through a nutrient-dependent post-translational mechanism dependent on the Clp proteases. Notably, all three B. subtilis Clp chaperones appeared able to target UgtP for degradation during growth in nutrient-poor conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Together these findings highlight conditional proteolysis as a mechanism for bacterial adaptation to a rapidly changing nutritional landscape.","['Hill, Norbert S', 'Zuke, Jason D', 'Buske, P J', 'Chien, An-Chun', 'Levin, Petra Anne']","['Hill NS', 'Zuke JD', 'Buske PJ', 'Chien AC', 'Levin PA']","['Department of Biology, Washington University, St. Louis, 63130, MO, USA.', 'Present address: Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, 94720, CA, USA.', 'Department of Biology, Washington University, St. Louis, 63130, MO, USA.', 'Present address: Department of Bacteriology, University of Wisconsin, Madison, 53706, WI, USA.', 'Department of Biology, Washington University, St. Louis, 63130, MO, USA.', 'Present address: Clinical Immunology and Bioanalysis, MedImmune LLC, South San Francisco, 94080, CA, USA.', 'Department of Biology, Washington University, St. Louis, 63130, MO, USA.', 'Leukaemia & Blood Cancer Research Unit, University of Auckland, Private Bag 92019, Auckland, 1142, New Zealand.', 'Department of Biology, Washington University, St. Louis, 63130, MO, USA. plevin@wustl.edu.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20180406,England,BMC Microbiol,BMC microbiology,100966981,"['0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (FtsZ protein, Bacteria)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', 'EC 3.4.21.92 (Endopeptidase Clp)', 'V50K1D7P4Y (Uridine Diphosphate Glucose)']",IM,"['Bacillus subtilis/genetics/growth & development/*metabolism', 'Bacterial Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cell Size', 'Culture Media/metabolism', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/metabolism', 'Endopeptidase Clp/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial', 'Molecular Chaperones/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Nutrients/*metabolism', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Uridine Diphosphate Glucose']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Cell cycle', '*Cell division', '*Cell size', '*ClpP', '*UDP-glucose', '*UgtP']",2018/04/08 06:00,2019/03/12 06:00,['2018/04/08 06:00'],"['2017/08/15 00:00 [received]', '2018/02/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12866-018-1155-2 [doi]', '10.1186/s12866-018-1155-2 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Microbiol. 2018 Apr 6;18(1):29. doi: 10.1186/s12866-018-1155-2.,,,['R01 GM064671/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],PMC5889556,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we investigated phagocytic plasticity of THP-1 (acute monocytic human leukemia) cells at different stages (days 1, 3, and 7) of phorbol ester (PMA)-induced macrophage differentiation. Analysis of cytokine profiles showed that PMA at a concentration of 100 nM induced development of the proinflammatory macrophage population. The functional activity of macrophages was assessed on days 3 and 7 of differentiation using unlabeled latex beads and latex beads conjugated with ligands (gelatin, mannan, and IgG Fc fragment) that bind to the corresponding specific receptors. The general phagocytic activity increased significantly (1.5-2.0-fold) in the course of differentiation; phagocytosis occurred mostly through the Fc receptors, as shown previously for M1 macrophages. On day 7, the levels of phagocytosis of gelatin- and Fc-covered beads were high; however, the intensity of ingestion of mannan-conjugated beads via mannose receptors increased 2.5-3.0-fold as well, which indicated formation of cells with an alternative phenotype similar to that of M2 macrophages. Thus, the type and the plasticity of phagocytic activity at certain stages of macrophage differentiation can be associated with the formation of functionally mature morphological phenotype. This allows macrophages to exhibit their phagocytic potential in response to specific ligands. These data are of fundamental importance and can be used to develop therapeutic methods for correcting the M1/M2 macrophage ratio in an organism.","['Kurynina, A V', 'Erokhina, M V', 'Makarevich, O A', 'Sysoeva, V Yu', 'Lepekha, L N', 'Kuznetsov, S A', 'Onishchenko, G E']","['Kurynina AV', 'Erokhina MV', 'Makarevich OA', 'Sysoeva VY', 'Lepekha LN', 'Kuznetsov SA', 'Onishchenko GE']","['Lomonosov Moscow State University, Faculty of Biology, Moscow, 119991, Russia. masha.erokhina@gmail.com.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Biochemistry (Mosc),Biochemistry.

Wnt signaling pathway aberrations are associated with both solid tumors and hematological malignancies. Unregulated Wnt signaling observed in malignancies may be due to a wide spectrum of abnormalities, from mutations in the genes of key players to epigenetic modifications of Wnt antagonists. Of these, Wnt antagonists are gaining significant attention for their potential of being targets for treatment and inhibition of Wnt signaling. In this review, we discuss and summarize the significance of Wnt signaling antagonists in the pathogenesis and treatment of hematological malignancies.","['Pehlivan, Melek', 'Caliskan, Ceyda', 'Yuce, Zeynep', 'Sercan, Hakki Ogun']","['Pehlivan M', 'Caliskan C', 'Yuce Z', 'Sercan HO']","['Vocational School of Health Services, Izmir Katip Celebi University, Izmir, Turkey.

In addition, compound 11 proved to be the most active against MCF-7 with GI% 62.5. The synthesized compounds were also evaluated for their inhibitory effects against EGFR kinase enzyme. Compound 9b proved to be the most active one among the synthesized series with inhibition % value of 81.72 at 25nM concentration and IC50 8.4nM which is very close to the reference drug Sorafenib. In vitro cytotoxicity test was also performed using the MCF-7 breast cell line.

Qualitative-PCR and real-time quantitative PCR are the currently used methods to monitor minimal residual disease (MRD) in Ph+ ALL patients; for the latter, full standardization and an international quality validation are lacking. Here, we developed a droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) assay for MRD monitoring in p190+ ALL cases. The analytical performance was assessed by the limit-of-detection determination, showing a reliability, sensitivity, and precision of the assay of up to 0.001%. Comparison of results obtained with qualitative PCR and ddPCR in 117 follow-up samples from 16 of 26 Ph+ ALL patients showed discordant results in 27% of cases (32 of 117). Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of 19 ddPCR-positive samples with a low tumor burden failed to provide quantitative results in 63% of cases (12 of 19). These results highlight that in p190+ ALL the ddPCR method has a sufficient analytical performance for very low MRD monitoring and for predicting molecular relapse several months before hematologic relapse. In conclusion, MRD monitoring by ddPCR may better stratify Ph+ ALL patients at risk of disease progression.","['Coccaro, Nicoletta', 'Anelli, Luisa', 'Zagaria, Antonella', 'Casieri, Paola', 'Tota, Giuseppina', 'Orsini, Paola', 'Impera, Luciana', 'Minervini, Angela', 'Minervini, Crescenzio F', 'Cumbo, Cosimo', 'Parciante, Elisa', 'Carluccio, Paola', 'Brunetti, Claudia', 'Specchia, Giorgina', 'Albano, Francesco']","['Coccaro N', 'Anelli L', 'Zagaria A', 'Casieri P', 'Tota G', 'Orsini P', 'Impera L', 'Minervini A', 'Minervini CF', 'Cumbo C', 'Parciante E', 'Carluccio P', 'Brunetti C', 'Specchia G', 'Albano F']","['Hematology Section, Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation, University of Bari, Bari, Italy.', 'Hematology Section, Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation, University of Bari, Bari, Italy.', 'Hematology Section, Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation, University of Bari, Bari, Italy.', 'Hematology Section, Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation, University of Bari, Bari, Italy.', 'Hematology Section, Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation, University of Bari, Bari, Italy.', 'Hematology Section, Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation, University of Bari, Bari, Italy.', 'Hematology Section, Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation, University of Bari, Bari, Italy.', 'Hematology Section, Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation, University of Bari, Bari, Italy.', 'Hematology Section, Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation, University of Bari, Bari, Italy.', 'Hematology Section, Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation, University of Bari, Bari, Italy.', 'Hematology Section, Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation, University of Bari, Bari, Italy.', 'Hematology Section, Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation, University of Bari, Bari, Italy.', 'Hematology Section, Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation, University of Bari, Bari, Italy.', 'Hematology Section, Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation, University of Bari, Bari, Italy.', 'Hematology Section, Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation, University of Bari, Bari, Italy.

However, comprehensive studies regarding the genetic landscape and clinical outcome in this group of patients are limited. METHODS: A total of 693 newly diagnosed de novo non-M3 AML patients were consecutively enrolled. We compared relevant mutations in 20 genes between AML patients with or without HL and exposed their prognostic implications. RESULTS: Hyperleukocytosis, defined as initial white blood cell counts above 50 000/muL, occurred in 28.9% of AML patients. HL patients had higher incidences of FLT3-ITD, NPM1, DNMT3A, CEBPA, and TET2 mutations. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that HL was an independent poor prognostic factor for overall survival and disease-free survival in total patients, those with intermediate-risk cytogenetics and normal karyotype irrespective of genetic alterations. Intriguingly, HL predicted poor survival in CEBPA double mutated, NPM1 + /FLT3-ITD- and NPM1-/FLT3-ITD- patients. Further, HL patients who received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) in first complete remission (CR) had a significantly longer overall survival and disease-free survival than those without allo-HSCT. CONCLUSIONS: Hyperleukocytosis is an independent poor prognostic factor irrespective of cytogenetics and mutation status. Allo-HSCT in first CR seems to ameliorate the poor prognostic impact of HL.","['Tien, Feng-Ming', 'Hou, Hsin-An', 'Tsai, Cheng-Hong', 'Tang, Jih-Luh', 'Chen, Chien-Yuan', 'Kuo, Yuan-Yeh', 'Li,

These cells normally are impervious to HIV-1. We report that coinfection of cells by HIV-1 and another sexually transmitted virus, human T-lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV-1), led to production of HIV-1 that had expanded cell tropism and was able to directly infect primary vaginal and cervical epithelial cells. HIV-1 infection of epithelial cells was blocked by neutralizing antibodies against the HTLV-1 envelope (Env) protein, indicating that the infection was mediated through HTLV-1 Env pseudotyping of HIV-1. Active replication of HIV-1 in epithelial cells was demonstrated by inhibition with anti-HIV-1 drugs. We demonstrated that HIV-1 derived from peripheral blood of HIV-1-HTLV-1-coinfected subjects could infect primary epithelial cells in an HTLV-1 Env-dependent manner. HIV-1 from subjects infected with HIV-1 alone was not able to infect epithelial cells. These results indicate that pseudotyping of HIV-1 with HTLV-1 Env can occur in vivo Our data further reveal that active replication of both HTLV-1 and HIV-1 is required for production of pseudotyped HIV-1. Our findings indicate that pseudotyping of HIV-1 with HTLV-1 Env in coinfected cells enabled HIV-1 to directly infect nonpermissive female genital epithelial cells. This phenomenon may represent a risk factor for enhanced sexual transmission of HIV-1 in regions where virus coinfection is common.IMPORTANCE Young women in certain regions of the world are at very high risk of acquiring HIV-1, and there is an urgent need to identify the factors that promote HIV-1 transmission. HIV-1 infection is frequently accompanied by infection with other pathogenic viruses. We demonstrate that coinfection of cells by HIV-1 and HTLV-1 can lead to production of HIV-1 pseudotyped with HTLV-1 Env that is able to directly infect female genital epithelial cells both in vitro and ex vivo Given the function of these epithelial cells as genital mucosal barriers to pathogenic virus transmission, the ability of HIV-1 pseudotyped with HTLV-1 Env to directly infect female genital epithelial cells represents a possible factor for increased risk of sexual transmission of HIV-1. This mechanism could be especially impactful in settings such as Sub-Saharan Africa and South America, where HIV-1 and HTLV-1 are both highly prevalent.","['Tang, Yuyang', 'George, Alvin M', 'Petrechko, Oksana', 'Nouvet, Franklin J', 'Sweet, Stephanie D', 'Tanaka, Yuetsu', 'Imbiakha, Brian S', 'Jiang, Guochun', 'Gao, Wei', 'Anastos, Kathryn', 'Hildreth, James E K']","['Tang Y', 'George AM', 'Petrechko O', 'Nouvet FJ', 'Sweet SD', 'Tanaka Y', 'Imbiakha BS', 'Jiang G', 'Gao W', 'Anastos K', 'Hildreth JEK']","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of California-Davis, Davis, California, USA.', 'Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, University of California-Davis, Davis, California, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of California-Davis, Davis, California, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of California-Davis, Davis, California, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of California-Davis, Davis, California, USA.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of California-Davis, Davis, California, USA.', 'Department of Immunology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Okinawa, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of California-Davis, Davis, California, USA.', 'Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, University of California-Davis, Davis, California, USA.', 'Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York, USA.', 'Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of California-Davis, Davis, California, USA jhildreth@mmc.edu.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20180404,United States,mSphere,mSphere,101674533,"['0 (Anti-HIV Agents)', '0 (Antibodies, Neutralizing)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Anti-HIV Agents/pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Neutralizing/immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*virology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cervix Uteri/cytology/virology', 'Coinfection/transmission/virology', 'Epithelial Cells/*virology', 'Female', 'Glycoproteins/*chemistry/genetics', 'HIV Infections/immunology/transmission', 'HIV-1/drug effects/*physiology', 'HTLV-I Infections/immunology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*chemistry/genetics', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Observational Studies as Topic', 'RNA, Viral/blood', 'Vagina/cytology/virology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*chemistry/genetics', 'Viral Tropism', 'Virus Replication/drug effects']",['NOTNLM'],"['*envelope glycoprotein', '*epithelial cells', '*human T-cell leukemia virus', '*human immunodeficiency virus', '*primary T-cells', '*pseudotype', '*retroviruses', '*sexual transmission', '*virus tropism']",2018/04/07 06:00,2019/03/13 06:00,['2018/04/07 06:00'],"['2018/01/19 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/13 06:00 [medline]']","['3/2/e00038-18 [pii]', '10.1128/mSphere.00038-18 [doi]']",epublish,mSphere. 2018 Apr 4;3(2). pii: 3/2/e00038-18. doi: 10.1128/mSphere.00038-18.

Early identification of some conditions may significantly affect patient care and alter outcomes. Early recognition of nonneoplastic hematologic disorders, such as thalassemia and sickle cell disease, may help initiate earlier treatment and prevent serious complications. The management of neoplastic diseases such as lymphoma, leukemia, or Langerhans cell histiocytosis may be different if diagnosed early, and metastases to the maxillofacial bones may be the first manifestation of an otherwise occult neoplasm. Endocrinologic and metabolic disorders also may manifest with maxillofacial conditions. Earlier recognition of osteoporosis may alter treatment and prevent complications such as insufficiency fractures, and identification of acromegaly may lead to surgical treatment if there is an underlying growth hormone-producing adenoma. Bone dysplasias sometimes are associated with skull base foraminal narrowing and subsequent involvement of the cranial nerves. Inflammatory processes such as rheumatoid arthritis and sarcoidosis may affect the maxillofacial bones, skull base, and temporomandibular joints. Radiologists should be familiar with the maxillofacial computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging findings of common systemic disorders because these may be the first manifestations of an otherwise unrevealed systemic process with potential for serious complications.

Adjuvant androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) may reduce this risk. We hypothesized that the addition of mitoxantrone and prednisone (MP) to adjuvant ADT could reduce mortality compared with adjuvant ADT alone. Methods Eligible patients had cT1-3N0 prostate cancer with one or more high-risk factors after radical prostatectomy (Gleason score [GS] >/= 8; pT3b, pT4, or pN+ disease; GS 7 and positive margins; or preoperative prostate-specific antigen [PSA] > 15 ng/mL, biopsy GS score > 7, or PSA > 10 ng/mL plus biopsy GS > 6. Patients with PSA </= 0.2 ng/mL after radical prostatectomy were stratified by pT/N stage, GS, and adjuvant radiation plan and randomly assigned to ADT (bicalutamide and goserelin for 2 years) or ADT plus six cycles of MP. The primary end point was overall survival (OS). Median OS was projected to be 10 years in the ADT arm, requiring 680 patients per arm to detect a hazard ratio of 1.30 with 92% power and one-sided alpha = .05. Results Nine hundred sixty-one eligible intent-to-treat patients were randomly assigned to ADT or ADT + MP from October 1999 to January 2007, when the Data Safety Monitoring Committee recommended stopping accrual as a result of higher leukemia incidence with ADT + MP. Median follow-up was 11.2 years. The 10-year OS estimates were 87% with ADT (expected 50%) and 86% with ADT + MP (hazard ratio, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.43). The 10-year estimate for disease-free survival was 72% for both arms. Prostate cancer was the cause of death in 18% of patients in the ADT arm and 22% in the ADT + MP arm. More patients in the MP arm died of other cancers (36% v 18% in ADT alone arm). Conclusion MP did not improve OS and increased deaths from other malignancies. The DFS and 10-year OS in these patients treated with 2 years of ADT were encouraging compared with historical estimates, although a definitive conclusion regarding value of ADT may not be made without a nontreatment control arm.","['Hussain, Maha', 'Tangen, Catherine M', 'Thompson, Ian M Jr', 'Swanson, Gregory P', 'Wood, David P', 'Sakr, Wael', 'Dawson, Nancy A', 'Haas, Naomi B', 'Flaig, Thomas W', 'Dorff, Tanya B', 'Lin, Daniel W', 'Crawford, E David', 'Quinn, David I', 'Vogelzang, Nicholas J', 'Glode, L Michael']","['Hussain M', 'Tangen CM', 'Thompson IM Jr', 'Swanson GP', 'Wood DP', 'Sakr W', 'Dawson NA', 'Haas NB', 'Flaig TW', 'Dorff TB', 'Lin DW', 'Crawford ED', 'Quinn DI', 'Vogelzang NJ', 'Glode LM']","['Maha Hussain, Robert H.

OBJECTIVE: - To assess the performance characteristics of cerebrospinal fluid cytology samples by evaluating participant interpretations within the College of American Pathologists Nongynecologic Cytopathology Education program. DESIGN: - Participant interpretations (N = 46 264) evaluated in the College of American Pathologists Nongynecologic Cytopathology Education Program were examined for concordance with the general category and with the reference diagnosis. Two nonlinear mixed models were used to analyze the concordance rates. RESULTS: - The overall concordance rates for the general category and reference diagnosis were 92.1% and 81.0%, respectively. In the malignant category, the concordance rates with the reference diagnosis were lowest for diagnoses of nonhematopoietic small blue round cell tumors (54.8%) and metastatic malignancy (77.5%); the concordance rate with the reference diagnosis was highest for leukemia/lymphoma (94.0%). In the benign category, the concordance rate was lowest for normal cerebrospinal fluid reference diagnoses (58.6%), followed by acute and chronic inflammation (64.6%), fungal infection (80.8%), and macrophages (85.3%). Significant differences in concordance were uncovered when performance was evaluated by participant type and stain technique. Leukemia/lymphoma was the most common diagnosis for misclassified nonhematopoietic small blue round cell tumor cases and negative or inflammatory cerebrospinal fluid cases. CONCLUSIONS: - This study illustrates the difficulties in achieving accurate diagnoses from cerebrospinal fluid specimens, particularly for nonhematopoietic small blue round cell tumors and normal and inflammatory cerebrospinal fluid specimens.","['Tabatabai, Z Laura', 'Auger, Manon', 'Souers, Rhona J', 'Teot, Lisa', 'Davey, Diane D']","['Tabatabai ZL', 'Auger M', 'Souers RJ', 'Teot L', 'Davey DD']","[""From the Department of Pathology, University of California, San Francisco (Dr Tabatabai); the Department of Pathology, McGill University Health Sciences Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada (Dr Auger); the Department of Biostatistics, College of American Pathologists, Northfield, Illinois (Ms. Souers); the Department of Pathology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts (Dr Teot); and the Department of Clinical Sciences, University of Central Florida, Orlando (Dr Davey).""]",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180406,United States,Arch Pathol Lab Med,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,7607091,,IM,"['Cytodiagnosis', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*cerebrospinal fluid/diagnosis/pathology', 'Pathology, Clinical/*education', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Staining and Labeling/methods', 'United States']",,,2018/04/07 06:00,2019/06/30 06:00,['2018/04/07 06:00'],"['2018/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/30 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/07 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.5858/arpa.2017-0167-CP [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2018 Jul;142(7):833-837. doi: 10.5858/arpa.2017-0167-CP.

High levels of Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity have been reported in primary brain tumors, ovarian, colon and lung tumors. OBJECTIVES: The role of cholinergic signaling needs to be clarified in in leukemia. METHOD: K562 cells were derived from a chronic myelogenous leukemia patient during blast crisis serving as pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells. K562 cells were incubated with various cholinergic agonists or antagonists to investigate the role of ACh in different differentiated cell lines. RESULTS: Our experiments showed that AChE activity was increased in response to ACh in undifferentiated K562 cells, but in the erythroid differentiated K562 cells a high concentration of ACh (1 mM) decreased the AChE activity. ACh failed to elevate the AChE activity in the megakaryocytic differentiated K562 cells. An AChE inhibitor, eserine, also suppressed the AChE activity in a concentration-dependent manner. Choline uptake inhibition by hemicholinium did increase the AChE activity but not in the erythroid differentiated K562 cell line. Likewise, megakaryocytic differentiated K562 cells also displayed a similar pattern. Vesamicole, a vesicular choline uptake inhibitor, produced similar results. Curare, a nicotinic antagonist, elevated the cell counts of the megakaryocytic differentiated cells. CONCLUSION: Our findings may suggest excess extracellular ACh will decrease the cell growth in undifferentiated and megakaryocytic differentiated K562 cell lines through nicotinic type cholinoceptors.","['Aydin, Banu', 'Cabadak, Hulya', 'Goren, M Zafer']","['Aydin B', 'Cabadak H', 'Goren MZ']","['Department of Biophysics, Marmara University, Medical School, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Biophysics, Marmara University, Medical School, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Medical Pharmacology, Marmara University, Medical School, Istanbul, Turkey.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Anticancer Agents Med Chem,Anti-cancer agents in medicinal chemistry,101265649,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'N9YNS0M02X (Acetylcholine)']",,"['Acetylcholine/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acetylcholinesterase', '*K562 cells', '*cholinergic', '*curare', '*hemicholinium 3', '*vesamicole.']",2018/04/07 06:00,2019/08/06 06:00,['2018/04/07 06:00'],"['2017/08/22 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/06 00:00 [revised]', '2018/04/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/06 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['ACAMC-EPUB-89577 [pii]', '10.2174/1871520618666180406123154 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Agents Med Chem. 2018;18(10):1440-1447. doi: 10.2174/1871520618666180406123154.,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: Chemotherapy has many limitations like host-tissue toxicity, drug resistance. Hence, it is imperative to unearth targets to better treat cancer. Here, we intend to repurpose a set of our previously synthesized difluorinated Propanediones (PR) as Histone lysine Methyltransferase inhibitors (HMTi). METHODS: The cell lines of leukemic origin viz. histiocytic lymphoma (U937) and acute T-cell leukemia (JURKAT) were treated with PR-1 to 7 after docking studies with active pocket of HMT. The cell cycle analysis, in vitro methylation and cell proliferation assays were carried out to delineate their physiological role. RESULTS: A small molecule PR-4, at 1 and 10microM, has shown to alter the methylation of histone H3 and H4 in both cell lines. Also, treatment shows an increase in G2/M population and a subsequent decrease in the G0/G1 population in U937. In JURKAT, an increase in both G2/M and S phase population was observed. The sub-G1 population showed a steady rise with increase in dose and prolonged time intervals in U937 and JURKAT cell lines. In SRB assay, the PR showed a cell growth of 42.6 and 53.4% comparable to adriamycin; 44.5 and 53.2% in U937 and JURKAT, respectively. The study suggests that PR-4 could emerge as a potential HMT inhibitor. CONCLUSION: The molecule PR-4 could be a lead in developing more histone lysine methyltransferases inhibitors with potential to be pro-apoptotic agents.","['Pal, Tanushree', 'Sharda, Asmita', 'Khade, Bharat', 'Ramaa, C Sinha', 'Gupta, Sanjay']","['Pal T', 'Sharda A', 'Khade B', 'Ramaa CS', 'Gupta S']","[""Bharati Vidyapeeth's College of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Sector-8, C.B.D., Belapur, Navi Mumbai-400614, Maharashtra, India."", 'Epigenetics and Chromatin Biology Group, Gupta Laboratory, Cancer Research Institute, Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research and Education in Cancer, Tata Memorial Centre, Kharghar-410210, Navi Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Homi Bhabha National Institute, BARC Training School Complex, Anushaktinagar, Mumbai, Maharashtra 400094.', 'Epigenetics and Chromatin Biology Group, Gupta Laboratory, Cancer Research Institute, Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research and Education in Cancer, Tata Memorial Centre, Kharghar-410210, Navi Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Homi Bhabha National Institute, BARC Training School Complex, Anushaktinagar, Mumbai, Maharashtra 400094.', ""Bharati Vidyapeeth's College of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Sector-8, C.B.D., Belapur, Navi Mumbai-400614, Maharashtra, India."", 'Epigenetics and Chromatin Biology Group, Gupta Laboratory, Cancer Research Institute, Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research and Education in Cancer, Tata Memorial Centre, Kharghar-410210, Navi Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Homi Bhabha National Institute, BARC Training School Complex, Anushaktinagar, Mumbai, Maharashtra 400094.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Anticancer Agents Med Chem,Anti-cancer agents in medicinal chemistry,101265649,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydrocarbons, Fluorinated)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Histone Methyltransferases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Drug Repositioning', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Halogenation', 'Histone Methyltransferases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrocarbons, Fluorinated/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Curcumin', '*anti-cancer', '*histone lysine methyltransferases', '*leukemia', '*lymphoma (U937)', '*propanediones.']",2018/04/07 06:00,2019/07/18 06:00,['2018/04/07 06:00'],"['2018/02/24 00:00 [received]', '2018/02/27 00:00 [revised]', '2018/03/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/18 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['ACAMC-EPUB-89515 [pii]', '10.2174/1871520618666180404125721 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Agents Med Chem. 2018;18(13):1892-1899. doi: 10.2174/1871520618666180404125721.,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whole-transcriptome analysis using RNA-seq is important, not only as a means of understanding the mechanisms responsible for complex diseases but also to efficiently identify novel genes/exons, splice isoforms, RNA editing, allele-specific mutations, differential gene expression and fusion-transcripts or chimeric RNA (chRNA). Methods: We used Crac, a tool that uses genomic locations and local coverage to classify biological events and directly infer splice and chimeric junctions within a single read. Crac's algorithm extracts transcriptional chimeric events irrespective of annotation with a high sensitivity, and CracTools was used to aggregate, annotate and filter the chRNA reads. The selected chRNA candidates were validated by real time PCR and sequencing. In order to check the tumor specific expression of chRNA, we analyzed a publicly available dataset using a new tag search approach. Results: We present data related to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) RNA-seq analysis. We highlight novel biological cases of chRNA, in addition to previously well characterized leukemia chRNA. We have identified and validated 17 chRNAs among 3 AML patients: 10 from an AML patient with a translocation between chromosomes 15 and 17 (AML-t(15;17), 4 from patient with normal karyotype (AML-NK) 3 from a patient with chromosomal 16 inversion (AML-inv16). The new fusion transcripts can be classified into four groups according to the exon organization. Conclusions: All groups suggest complex but distinct synthesis mechanisms involving either collinear exons of different genes, non-collinear exons, or exons of different chromosomes. Finally, we check tumor-specific expression in a larger RNA-seq AML cohort and identify new AML biomarkers that could improve diagnosis and prognosis of AML.","['Ruffle, Florence', 'Audoux, Jerome', 'Boureux, Anthony', 'Beaumeunier, Sacha', 'Gaillard, Jean-Baptiste', 'Bou Samra, Elias', 'Megarbane, Andre', 'Cassinat, Bruno', 'Chomienne, Christine', 'Alves, Ronnie', 'Riquier, Sebastien', 'Gilbert, Nicolas', 'Lemaitre, Jean-Marc', 'Bacq-Daian, Delphine', 'Bouge, Anne Laure', 'Philippe, Nicolas', 'Commes, Therese']","['Ruffle F', 'Audoux J', 'Boureux A', 'Beaumeunier S', 'Gaillard JB', 'Bou Samra E', 'Megarbane A', 'Cassinat B', 'Chomienne C', 'Alves R', 'Riquier S', 'Gilbert N', 'Lemaitre JM', 'Bacq-Daian D', 'Bouge AL', 'Philippe N', 'Commes T']","['Institut de Biologie Computationnelle, Universite Montpellier, Montpellier, France.', 'Institut de Medecine Regeneratrice et de Biotherapie, INSERM U1183, CHU Montpellier, Montpellier, France.', 'Institut de Biologie Computationnelle, Universite Montpellier, Montpellier, France.', 'Institut de Medecine Regeneratrice et de Biotherapie, INSERM U1183, CHU Montpellier, Montpellier, France.', 'Institut de Biologie Computationnelle, Universite Montpellier, Montpellier, France.', 'Institut de Medecine Regeneratrice et de Biotherapie, INSERM U1183, CHU Montpellier, Montpellier, France.', 'Institut de Biologie Computationnelle, Universite Montpellier, Montpellier, France.', 'Institut de Medecine Regeneratrice et de Biotherapie, INSERM U1183, CHU Montpellier, Montpellier, France.', 'Laboratoire de Cytologie et Cytogenetique, CHU Caremeau, Nimes, France.', 'Universite Paris Sud, Universite Paris-Saclay, Orsay, France.', 'Institut Curie, PSL Research University, Paris, France.', 'Institut Jerome Lejeune, Paris, France.', 'Laboratoire de Biologie Cellulaire, Hopital Saint-Louis, Assistance publique - Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Paris, France.', 'Laboratoire de Biologie Cellulaire, Hopital Saint-Louis, Assistance publique - Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Paris, France.', 'Hopital Saint-Louis, Universite Paris Diderot, INSERM UMRS 1131, Paris, France.', 'Institut de Biologie Computationnelle, Universite Montpellier, Montpellier, France.', 'Instituto Tecnologico Vale, Nazare, Belem, PA, Brazil.', 'Institut de Biologie Computationnelle, Universite Montpellier, Montpellier, France.', 'Institut de Medecine Regeneratrice et de Biotherapie, INSERM U1183, CHU Montpellier, Montpellier, France.', 'Institut de Medecine Regeneratrice et de Biotherapie, INSERM U1183, CHU Montpellier, Montpellier, France.', 'Institut de Medecine Regeneratrice et de Biotherapie, INSERM U1183, CHU Montpellier, Montpellier, France.', 'CEA Institut de Genomique, Centre National de Genotypage, Evry, France.', 'Institut de Biologie Computationnelle, Universite Montpellier, Montpellier, France.', 'Institut de Medecine Regeneratrice et de Biotherapie, INSERM U1183, CHU Montpellier, Montpellier, France.', 'Institut de Biologie Computationnelle, Universite Montpellier, Montpellier, France.', 'Institut de Medecine Regeneratrice et de Biotherapie, INSERM U1183, CHU Montpellier, Montpellier, France.', 'Institut de Biologie Computationnelle, Universite Montpellier, Montpellier, France.', 'Institut de Medecine Regeneratrice et de Biotherapie, INSERM U1183, CHU Montpellier, Montpellier, France.']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6514-3905', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4139-0562', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7918-0176']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170802,England,F1000Res,F1000Research,101594320,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Classification (CRAC)', 'Complex Read Analysis', 'PML-RARA', 'RNAseq', 'TRIM28', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'bioinformatics analysis', 'biomarkers', 'chimeric RNA']",2018/04/10 06:00,2018/04/10 06:01,['2018/04/10 06:00'],"['2017/12/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/10 06:01 [medline]']",['10.12688/f1000research.11352.2 [doi]'],epublish,F1000Res. 2017 Aug 2;6. doi: 10.12688/f1000research.11352.2. eCollection 2017.,,,,PMC5861515,,,['Competing interests: No competing interests were disclosed.'],,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed data of 94 patients of plasma cell dyscrasias who underwent 95 autologous transplants at our institute from October 2003 to Aug 2016. Other than 76 patients of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, we also transplanted two patients of POEMS syndrome, two patients of plasma cell leukemia, three patients of concurrent light chain deposition disease, three patients of multifocal plasmacytomas, and eight patients of isolated light chain myeloma. One patient underwent transplant twice. The median age of patients was 53 years (range 21-65). The average interval between diagnosis and transplant was 10.51 +/- 5.42 months. The predominant stage in the study cohort was ISS-III. IgG kappa was the commonest subtype of plasma cell dyscrasia (27.9%) followed by IgG lambda (16.27%). Renal involvement was seen in 25% patients at the time of transplantation. Following chemotherapy, 42% patients were in CR, 39% in VGPR, 5% had PR and 14% had progressive disease at the time of transplantation. All patients were conditioned with melphalan (dose 120-200 mg/m(2)) except for one who received an additional bortezomib for his second transplant. The mean time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment was 11.09 +/- 1.82 and 12.69 +/- 4.55 days respectively. Mucositis was noted in all patients (grade 3 in 37.5% patients). The median PFS (biochemical) was 55.8% and PFS (clinical) was 76.7% at 6.5 years. Thirteen percent of the transplanted patients succumbed to their illness of which three patients died within 30 days of transplant. Median OS was 76.7% at 6.5 years.

Novel components to help struggle aggressive malignancies and overcome some side effects of conventional treatments could be a promising strategy. Epigallocatechingallate (EGCG), have attracted the attention of scientists for prevention or treatment of some cancers. Jurkat cells were incubated with the different concentrations of EGCG (30-100 microm) for 24, 48, and 72 h and cell viability was investigated using MTS test. Apoptosis and the level of caspase 3 alterations were evaluated using flowcytometry and expression of Fas by Real Time PCR. EGCG decreased viability of cells with an inhibition concentration (IC50) of 82.8 +/- 3.1, 68.8 +/- 4 and 59.7 +/- 4.8 muM in 24,48 and 72 h. 50, 70 and 100 microM concentrations of EGCG induced apoptosis in about 31, 40 and 71% of the cells, respectively. The mean value of caspase 3 positive cells in the presence of 50, 70 and 100 microm concentrations of EGCG was 19.3 +/- 2.9, 29.5 +/- 3.1 and 61.2 +/- 3.4 respectively compared to 7.8 +/- 1.1 in control with a significant difference at 100 microm concentration.

AML can be assessed and differentiated by flowcytometry (FCM)/immunohistochemistry (IHC)/cytochemistry techniques. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is an unequivocal marker to differentiate AML from the acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Despite FCM popularity, it has its limitations, in form of 'dry-tap', cost, and inability of being performed by retrospective analysis. IHC, though an old technique has overcome these disadvantages of FCM. Cytochemistry, on the other hand has its own advantages in being cost-effective; technically easy to do while its disadvantages are its inability to be carried out in the old samples, 'dry-tap' conditions in aleukemic leukemia. There has been non-uniformity in the literature among these techniques especially concerning their sensitivity for MPO. A prospective study was done at All India Institute of Medical Sciences New Delhi from 01 July 2014 to 30 Nov 2015 to include 120 diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia cases. Myeloperoxidase stain was done by cytochemistry, immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry and results were compared. There were 28 cases which showed discrepancies. Out of these 28 cases immunohistochemistry showed positivity in majority (22 cases) followed by flow cytometry (14 cases). Therefore it is important to employ more than one technique and IHC must be included for detection of MPO in all suspected cases of AML especially when negative with FCM .","['Ahuja, Ankur', 'Tyagi, Seema', 'Seth, Tulika', 'Pati, Hara Prasad', 'Gahlot, Gps', 'Tripathi, Preeti', 'Somasundaram, Venkatesan', 'Saxena, Renu']","['Ahuja A', 'Tyagi S', 'Seth T', 'Pati HP', 'Gahlot G', 'Tripathi P', 'Somasundaram V', 'Saxena R']","['1Department of Lab Sciences and Molecular Medicine, Army Hospital (Research and Referral), New Delhi, India.grid.428097.0', '2Department of Haematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.0000 0004 1767 6103grid.413618.9', '2Department of Haematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.0000 0004 1767 6103grid.413618.9', '2Department of Haematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.0000 0004 1767 6103grid.413618.9', '1Department of Lab Sciences and Molecular Medicine, Army Hospital (Research and Referral), New Delhi, India.grid.428097.0', '2Department of Haematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.0000 0004 1767 6103grid.413618.9', '3Department of Pathology, Armed Forces Medical College, Pune, India.0000 0004 1766 9851grid.413909.6', '2Department of Haematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.0000 0004 1767 6103grid.413618.9']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170728,India,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus,Indian journal of hematology & blood transfusion : an official journal of Indian Society of Hematology and Blood Transfusion,9425818,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', 'Blasts', 'Bone marrow aspirate (BMA)', 'Bone marrow biopsy (BMB)', 'CD34', 'Cytochemistry', 'Flow cytometry (FMC)', 'Immunohistochemistry (IHC)', 'Myeloperoxidase (MPO)']",2018/04/07 06:00,2018/04/07 06:01,['2018/04/07 06:00'],"['2017/01/09 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/07 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12288-017-0849-1 [doi]', '849 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus. 2018 Apr;34(2):233-239. doi: 10.1007/s12288-017-0849-1.

In addition to morphological diagnosis of CML phase, it is essential to detect BCR-ABL1 fusion by either metaphase cytogenetics or reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction that also determines type of mRNA transcript. Once treatment begins, monitoring the response to Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) using standardized techniques and guidelines is important to check for failure of response and thus, plan timely intervention by increasing the dose of TKI or opting for second line TKIs. The goal is to stop evolution of CML to accelerated phase or blast crisis that has poor response to treatment. Also, it is desirable to achieve good outcomes and even treatment free remission in patients of CML on TKI. Thus, molecular monitoring by reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) is done at regular intervals. There are international recommendations and quality control measures to standardize the reporting of fusion gene transcript levels by quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) in CML to achieve and maintain sensitivity in molecular detection of CML disease burden. Various state-of-the-art molecular techniques have emerged to accurately determine the number of fusion-gene transcript levels. This review highlights various methodologies and their practical implications in management of CML patients on TKI.","['Chauhan, Richa', 'Sazawal, Sudha', 'Pati, H P']","['Chauhan R', 'Sazawal S', 'Pati HP']","['Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India.0000 0004 1767 6103grid.413618.9', 'Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India.0000 0004 1767 6103grid.413618.9', 'Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India.0000 0004 1767 6103grid.413618.9']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180313,India,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus,Indian journal of hematology & blood transfusion : an official journal of Indian Society of Hematology and Blood Transfusion,9425818,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic Myeloid Leukemia', 'Monitoring', 'Reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction', 'Tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",2018/04/07 06:00,2018/04/07 06:01,['2018/04/07 06:00'],"['2018/04/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/07 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12288-018-0933-1 [doi]', '933 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus. 2018 Apr;34(2):197-203. doi: 10.1007/s12288-018-0933-1.

In response to DNA damage, myeloid leukemia cells activate a poorly understood terminal differentiation process. Here, we show that the NFkappaB pathway directly activates expression of the proliferation inhibitor p21 in response to DNA damage in myeloid leukemia cells. In order to understand the role of this unexpected regulatory event, we ablated the NFkappaB binding site we identified in the p21 promoter, using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing. We found that NFkappaB-mediated p21 activation controls DNA damage-induced myeloid differentiation.

We found that BRD4 acts as general coactivator of RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription, which is broadly repressed upon high-dose BETi treatment. At doses triggering selective effects in leukemia, BETis deregulate a small set of hypersensitive targets including MYC. In contrast to BRD4, MYC primarily acts as a selective transcriptional activator controlling metabolic processes such as ribosome biogenesis and de novo purine synthesis.

Here, we show that tightly regulated FOXO1 activity is essential for maintenance of B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL). Genetic and pharmacological inactivation of FOXO1 in BCP-ALL cell lines produced a strong antileukemic effect associated with CCND3 downregulation. Moreover, we demonstrated that CCND3 expression is critical for BCP-ALL survival and that overexpression of CCND3 protected BCP-ALL cell lines from growth arrest and apoptosis induced by FOXO1 inactivation. Most importantly, pharmacological inhibition of FOXO1 showed antileukemia activity on several primary, patient-derived, pediatric ALL xenografts with effective leukemia reduction in the hematopoietic, lymphoid, and central nervous system organ compartments, ultimately leading to prolonged survival without leukemia reoccurrence in a preclinical in vivo model of BCP-ALL. These results suggest that repression of FOXO1 might be a feasible approach for the treatment of BCP-ALL.","['Wang, Fan', 'Demir, Salih', 'Gehringer, Franziska', 'Osswald, Clarissa D', 'Seyfried, Felix', 'Enzenmuller, Stefanie', 'Eckhoff, Sarah M', 'Maier, Thomas', 'Holzmann, Karlheinz', 'Debatin, Klaus-Michael', 'Wirth, Thomas', 'Meyer, Luder H', 'Ushmorov, Alexey']","['Wang F', 'Demir S', 'Gehringer F', 'Osswald CD', 'Seyfried F', 'Enzenmuller S', 'Eckhoff SM', 'Maier T', 'Holzmann K', 'Debatin KM', 'Wirth T', 'Meyer LH', 'Ushmorov A']","['Institute of Physiological Chemistry, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany; and.', 'Institute of Physiological Chemistry, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Physiological Chemistry, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany; and.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany; and.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany; and.', 'Institute of Physiological Chemistry, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Core Facility Genomics, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany; and.', 'Institute of Physiological Chemistry, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany; and.', 'Institute of Physiological Chemistry, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180405,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0', '(5-amino-7-(cyclohexylamino)-1-ethyl-6-fluoro-4-oxo-1,4-dihydroquinoline-3-carbox', 'ylic acid)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CCND3 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin D3)', '0 (Forkhead Box Protein O1)', '0 (Quinolones)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin D3/genetics', 'Forkhead Box Protein O1/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Quinolones/therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",,,2018/04/07 06:00,2019/07/16 06:00,['2018/04/07 06:00'],"['2017/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/16 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)32119-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2017-10-813576 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2018 Jun 28;131(26):2929-2942. doi: 10.1182/blood-2017-10-813576.

Our aims were to identify shared and unique molecular features, clinically significant subtypes, and potential therapeutic targets. We found 61 somatic copy-number alterations (SCNAs) and 46 significantly mutated genes (SMGs). Eleven SCNAs and 11 SMGs had not been identified in previous TCGA studies of the individual tumor types. We found functionally significant estrogen receptor-regulated long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and gene/lncRNA interaction networks. Pathway analysis identified subtypes with high leukocyte infiltration, raising potential implications for immunotherapy. Using 16 key molecular features, we identified five prognostic subtypes and developed a decision tree that classified patients into the subtypes based on just six features that are assessable in clinical laboratories.","['Berger, Ashton C', 'Korkut, Anil', 'Kanchi, Rupa S', 'Hegde, Apurva M', 'Lenoir, Walter', 'Liu, Wenbin', 'Liu, Yuexin', 'Fan, Huihui', 'Shen, Hui', 'Ravikumar, Visweswaran', 'Rao, Arvind', 'Schultz, Andre', 'Li, Xubin', 'Sumazin, Pavel', 'Williams, Cecilia', 'Mestdagh, Pieter', 'Gunaratne, Preethi H', 'Yau, Christina', 'Bowlby, Reanne', 'Robertson, A Gordon', 'Tiezzi, Daniel G', 'Wang, Chen', 'Cherniack, Andrew D', 'Godwin, Andrew K', 'Kuderer, Nicole M', 'Rader, Janet S', 'Zuna, Rosemary E', 'Sood, Anil K', 'Lazar, Alexander J', 'Ojesina, Akinyemi I', 'Adebamowo, Clement', 'Adebamowo, Sally N', 'Baggerly, Keith A', 'Chen, Ting-Wen', 'Chiu, Hua-Sheng', 'Lefever, Steve', 'Liu, Liang', 'MacKenzie, Karen', 'Orsulic, Sandra', 'Roszik, Jason', 'Shelley, Carl Simon', 'Song, Qianqian', 'Vellano, Christopher P', 'Wentzensen, Nicolas', 'Weinstein, John N', 'Mills, Gordon B', 'Levine, Douglas A', 'Akbani, Rehan']","['Berger AC', 'Korkut A', 'Kanchi RS', 'Hegde AM', 'Lenoir W', 'Liu W', 'Liu Y', 'Fan H', 'Shen H', 'Ravikumar V', 'Rao A', 'Schultz A', 'Li X', 'Sumazin P', 'Williams C', 'Mestdagh P', 'Gunaratne PH', 'Yau C', 'Bowlby R', 'Robertson AG', 'Tiezzi DG', 'Wang C', 'Cherniack AD', 'Godwin AK', 'Kuderer NM', 'Rader JS', 'Zuna RE', 'Sood AK', 'Lazar AJ', 'Ojesina AI', 'Adebamowo C', 'Adebamowo SN', 'Baggerly KA', 'Chen TW', 'Chiu HS', 'Lefever S', 'Liu L', 'MacKenzie K', 'Orsulic S', 'Roszik J', 'Shelley CS', 'Song Q', 'Vellano CP', 'Wentzensen N', 'Weinstein JN', 'Mills GB', 'Levine DA', 'Akbani R']","['The Eli and Edythe L.

We examined 12 different cell lines, including 5 human solid tumor cell lines, 2 human leukemia cell lines and 4 human non-cancer cell lines, as well as the Chinese hamster ovary cell line. Permanent magnets were used to provide 0.2-1 T SMFs with different magnetic field directions. We found that an upward magnetic field of 0.2-1 T could effectively reduce the cell numbers of all human solid tumor cell lines we tested, but a downward magnetic field mostly had no statistically significant effect. However, the leukemia cells in suspension, which do not have shape-induced anisotropy, were inhibited by both upward and downward magnetic fields. In contrast, the cell numbers of most non-cancer cells were not affected by magnetic fields of all directions. Moreover, the upward magnetic field inhibited GIST-T1 tumor growth in nude mice by 19.3% (p < 0.05) while the downward magnetic field did not produce significant effect. In conclusion, although still lack of mechanistical insights, our results show that different magnetic field directions produce divergent effects on cancer cell numbers as well as tumor growth in mice. This not only verified the safety of SMF exposure related to current MRI machines but also revealed the possible antitumor potential of magnetic field with an upward direction.","['Tian, Xiaofei', 'Wang, Dongmei', 'Zha, Meng', 'Yang, Xingxing', 'Ji, Xinmiao', 'Zhang, Lei', 'Zhang, Xin']","['Tian X', 'Wang D', 'Zha M', 'Yang X', 'Ji X', 'Zhang L', 'Zhang X']","['a High Magnetic Field Laboratory, Key Laboratory of High Magnetic Field and Ion Beam Physical Biology , Hefei Institutes of Physical Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei, Anhui, P.R.China.', 'b University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, P.R.China.', 'a High Magnetic Field Laboratory, Key Laboratory of High Magnetic Field and Ion Beam Physical Biology , Hefei Institutes of Physical Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei, Anhui, P.R.China.', 'b University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, P.R.China.', 'a High Magnetic Field Laboratory, Key Laboratory of High Magnetic Field and Ion Beam Physical Biology , Hefei Institutes of Physical Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei, Anhui, P.R.China.', 'a High Magnetic Field Laboratory, Key Laboratory of High Magnetic Field and Ion Beam Physical Biology , Hefei Institutes of Physical Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei, Anhui, P.R.China.', 'a High Magnetic Field Laboratory, Key Laboratory of High Magnetic Field and Ion Beam Physical Biology , Hefei Institutes of Physical Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei, Anhui, P.R.China.', 'a High Magnetic Field Laboratory, Key Laboratory of High Magnetic Field and Ion Beam Physical Biology , Hefei Institutes of Physical Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei, Anhui, P.R.China.', 'b University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, P.R.China.', 'a High Magnetic Field Laboratory, Key Laboratory of High Magnetic Field and Ion Beam Physical Biology , Hefei Institutes of Physical Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei, Anhui, P.R.China.', 'c Institute of Physical Science and Information Technology , Anhui University , Hefei , Anhui , P.

With further applications and increasing numbers of patients, the reproducible manufacture of high-quality clinical-grade CAR T cells is becoming an ever greater challenge. New processing techniques, quality-control mechanisms, and logistic developments are required to meet both medical needs and regulatory restrictions.

A detailed map of the DNA methylation dynamics that occur during cell differentiation would contribute to decipher the molecular networks governing cell fate commitment. METHODS: Illumina MethylationEPIC BeadChip platform was used to describe the genome-wide DNA methylation changes observed throughout hematopoietic maturation by analyzing multiple myeloid and lymphoid hematopoietic cell types. RESULTS: We identified a plethora of DNA methylation changes that occur during human hematopoietic differentiation. We observed that T lymphocytes display substantial enhancement of de novo CpG hypermethylation as compared with other hematopoietic cell populations. T-cell-specific hypermethylated regions were strongly associated with open chromatin marks and enhancer elements, as well as binding sites of specific key transcription factors involved in hematopoietic differentiation, such as PU.1 and TAL1. CONCLUSION: These results provide novel insights into the role of DNA methylation at enhancer elements in T-cell development.","['Tejedor, J Ramon', 'Bueno, Clara', 'Cobo, Isabel', 'Bayon, Gustavo F', 'Prieto, Cristina', 'Mangas, Cristina', 'Perez, Raul F', 'Santamarina, Pablo', 'Urdinguio, Rocio G', 'Menendez, Pablo', 'Fraga, Mario F', 'Fernandez, Agustin F']","['Tejedor JR', 'Bueno C', 'Cobo I', 'Bayon GF', 'Prieto C', 'Mangas C', 'Perez RF', 'Santamarina P', 'Urdinguio RG', 'Menendez P', 'Fraga MF', 'Fernandez AF']","['Cancer Epigenetics Laboratory, Institute of Oncology of Asturias (IUOPA), HUCA, Universidad de Oviedo, Principado de Asturias, Spain.', 'Fundacion para la Investigacion Biosanitaria de Asturias (FINBA), Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria del Principado de Asturias (ISPA), Principado de Asturias, Spain.', 'Department of Biomedicine, School of Medicine, Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Biomedicine, School of Medicine, Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Cancer Epigenetics Laboratory, Institute of Oncology of Asturias (IUOPA), HUCA, Universidad de Oviedo, Principado de Asturias, Spain.', 'Department of Biomedicine, School of Medicine, Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Cancer Epigenetics Laboratory, Institute of Oncology of Asturias (IUOPA), HUCA, Universidad de Oviedo, Principado de Asturias, Spain.', 'Cancer Epigenetics Laboratory, Institute of Oncology of Asturias (IUOPA), HUCA, Universidad de Oviedo, Principado de Asturias, Spain.', 'Nanomaterials & Nanotechnology Research Center (CINN-CSIC), Universidad de Oviedo, Principado de Asturias, Spain.', 'Cancer Epigenetics Laboratory, Institute of Oncology of Asturias (IUOPA), HUCA, Universidad de Oviedo, Principado de Asturias, Spain.', 'Fundacion para la Investigacion Biosanitaria de Asturias (FINBA), Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria del Principado de Asturias (ISPA), Principado de Asturias, Spain.', 'Nanomaterials & Nanotechnology Research Center (CINN-CSIC), Universidad de Oviedo, Principado de Asturias, Spain.', 'Department of Biomedicine, School of Medicine, Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institucio Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avancats (ICREA), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute-Campus ICO, Research Institut Germans Trias i Pujol (IGTP), Badalona, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CIBERONC), ISCIII, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Nanomaterials & Nanotechnology Research Center (CINN-CSIC), Universidad de Oviedo, Principado de Asturias, Spain.', 'Cancer Epigenetics Laboratory, Institute of Oncology of Asturias (IUOPA), HUCA, Universidad de Oviedo, Principado de Asturias, Spain.', 'Fundacion para la Investigacion Biosanitaria de Asturias (FINBA), Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria del Principado de Asturias (ISPA), Principado de Asturias, Spain.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180405,England,Epigenomics,Epigenomics,101519720,,IM,"['Binding Sites', 'CpG Islands', '*DNA Methylation', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*DNA enhancers', '*DNA methylation', '*MethylationEPIC BeadChip', '*T lymphocytes', '*hematopoietic differentiation']",2018/04/06 06:00,2019/06/25 06:00,['2018/04/06 06:00'],"['2018/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/25 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.2217/epi-2017-0163 [doi]'],ppublish,Epigenomics. 2018 Jul;10(7):903-923. doi: 10.2217/epi-2017-0163.

We studied BMD by quantitative ultrasound (QUS) in 72 ALL survivors, and evaluated any correlation with cumulative doses of steroids and cytotoxic agents. Mean age at diagnosis was 61+/-45 months, while mean age at QUS was 318.3+/-129.6 months; mean period of follow-up was 41.2+/-37.8 months. Mean amplitude-dependent speed of sound z-score was -1.22+/-1.19. Ten survivors (13.8%) presented a z-score below -2 SD. A negative correlation was found between amplitude-dependent speed of sound z-score and age at diagnosis (P=0.01). A positive correlation was observed with length of follow-up (P=0.01). No correlation was found with cytotoxic drugs. This study represents the largest cohort of childhood ALL survivors studied by QUS. Our results suggest that QUS for its characteristics of being radiation free may be an effective option to assess BMD in pediatric age.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in combination with chemotherapy have significantly improved its remission rate. However, relapse remains the major obstacle to achieve long survival. Lenalidomide is a second-generation oral immunomodulatory drug that has been broadly applied in the treatment of various hematological malignancies. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 54-year-old Chinese male patient who complained of chest pain and fatigue for 20 days. Bone marrow aspirate examination revealed hypercellularity with 70% blast cells. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that the blast cells exhibit both myeloid and lymphoid lineage antigens. Chromosomal analysis reveals t(9;22)(q34;q11) translocation. Minor BCR-ABL fusion gene was positive. DIAGNOSIS: Philadelphia chromosome-positive mixed phenotype acute leukemia.

To investigate the influence of the position of the pyridine nitrogen on biological activity, two different series of alpha-bromoacryloylamido indolyl pyridinyl propenones 3a-h and 4a-d were designed and synthesized by a pharmacophore hybridization approach and evaluated for their antiproliferative activity against a panel of six human cancer cell lines. These hybrid molecules were prepared to combine the alpha-bromoacryloyl moiety with two series of indole-inspired chalcone analogues, possessing an indole derivative and a 3- or 4-pyridine ring, respectively, linked on either side of 2-propen-1-one system. The structure-activity relationship was also investigated by the insertion of alkyl or benzyl moieties at the N-1 position of the indole nucleus. We found that most of the newly synthesized displayed high antiproliferative activity against U-937, MOLT-3, K-562, and NALM-6 leukaemia cell lines, with one-digit to double-digit nanomolar IC50 values. The antiproliferative activities of 3-pyridinyl derivatives 3f-h revealed that N-benzyl indole analogues generally exhibited lower activity compared to N-H or N-alkyl derivatives 3a-b and 3c-e, respectively. Moreover, cellular mechanism studies elucidated that compound 4a induced apoptosis along with a decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential and activated caspase-3 in a concentration-dependent manner.","['Romagnoli, Romeo', 'Prencipe, Filippo', 'Lopez-Cara, Luisa Carlota', 'Oliva, Paola', 'Baraldi, Stefania', 'Baraldi, Pier Giovanni', 'Estevez-Sarmiento, Francisco', 'Quintana, Jose', 'Estevez, Francisco']","['Romagnoli R', 'Prencipe F', 'Lopez-Cara LC', 'Oliva P', 'Baraldi S', 'Baraldi PG', 'Estevez-Sarmiento F', 'Quintana J', 'Estevez F']","['a Dipartimento di Scienze Chimiche e Farmaceutiche , Universita di Ferrara , Ferrara , Italy.', 'a Dipartimento di Scienze Chimiche e Farmaceutiche , Universita di Ferrara , Ferrara , Italy.', 'b Departamento de Quimica Farmaceutica y Organica Facultad de Farmacia , Campus de Cartuja s/n , Granada , Spain.', 'a Dipartimento di Scienze Chimiche e Farmaceutiche , Universita di Ferrara , Ferrara , Italy.', 'a Dipartimento di Scienze Chimiche e Farmaceutiche , Universita di Ferrara , Ferrara , Italy.', 'a Dipartimento di Scienze Chimiche e Farmaceutiche , Universita di Ferrara , Ferrara , Italy.', 'c Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular , Instituto Universitario de Investigaciones Biomedicas y Sanitarias, Universidad de las Palmas de Gran Canaria , Spain.', 'c Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular , Instituto Universitario de Investigaciones Biomedicas y Sanitarias, Universidad de las Palmas de Gran Canaria , Spain.', 'c Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular , Instituto Universitario de Investigaciones Biomedicas y Sanitarias, Universidad de las Palmas de Gran Canaria , Spain.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,J Enzyme Inhib Med Chem,Journal of enzyme inhibition and medicinal chemistry,101150203,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (alpha-bromoacryloylamido indolyl pyridinyl propenone)', '5S5A2Q39HX (Chalcone)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Chalcone/analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Indoles/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Molecular Structure', 'Pyridines/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'caspases', 'in vitro antiproliferative activity', 'indole-based chalcone', 'alpha-bromoacryloyl moiety']",2018/04/06 06:00,2018/05/02 06:00,['2018/04/06 06:00'],"['2018/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/14756366.2018.1450749 [doi]'],ppublish,J Enzyme Inhib Med Chem. 2018 Dec;33(1):727-742. doi: 10.1080/14756366.2018.1450749.,,,,PMC6009983,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Human leukemia cells were cultured and treated with various concentrations of tunicamycin for 0, 24, 48, 72 and 90 h. Subsequently, human leukemia cells were assigned into the ER activation group, which was treated with 100 ng/ml tunicamycin, the ER activation + TO901317 (PI3K inhibitor) group, and the control group. An MTT assay was conducted to detect cell proliferation. In addition, a monodansylcadaverine (MDC) assay was used to detect the formation of autophagosomes and Annexin Vfluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide double staining was used to examine cell apoptosis. Western blotting was performed to detect the expression levels of 78kDa glucoseregulated protein (GRP78), phosphorylated (p)protein kinase Rlike endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), palpha subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2alpha), microtubuleassociated protein 1A/1Blight chain 3 (LC3), caspase3, CCAATenhancerbinding protein homologous protein (CHOP), PI3K, AKT and mTOR. Treatment with 100 ng/ml tunicamycin for 72 h was considered the optimal condition for further experiments. Compared with in cells prior to treatment, human leukemia cells treated with tunicamycin exhibited increased expression of pPERK, peIF2alpha and GRP78 after 72 h (P<0.05). In addition, the expression levels of mTOR, AKT and PI3K were decreased in the ER activation group compared with in the control and ER activation + TO901317 groups (P<0.05).

Transforming growth factor beta1 (TGFbeta1)induced epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT) of tubular epithelial cells serves a role in the initiation and progression of renal fibrosis. Furthermore, recent results indicated that the progression of EMT is reversible. The present study aimed to clarify the role of miR152 in EMT of the tubular epithelial cell line HK2, stimulated by TGFbeta1, using in vitro transfection with a miR152 mimic and to further investigate the underlying mechanism of miR152 activity. In the present study, miR152 expression was significantly reduced in TGFbeta1treated HK2 cells, accompanied by an increased expression of hematopoietic preBcell leukemia transcription factor (PBX)interacting protein (HPIP). Additionally, miR152 overexpression inhibited TGFbeta1induced EMT and suppressed HPIP expression by directly targeting the 3' untranslated region of HPIP in HK2 cells. Furthermore, upregulation of HPIP reversed miR152mediated inhibitory effects on the EMT. Collectively, the results suggest that downregulation of miR152 initiates the dedifferentiation of renal tubules and progression of renal fibrosis, which may provide important targets for prevention strategies of renal fibrosis.","['Ning, Ya-Xian', 'Wang, Xiao-Yuan', 'Wang, Jian-Qin', 'Zeng, Rong', 'Wang, Gou-Qin']","['Ning YX', 'Wang XY', 'Wang JQ', 'Zeng R', 'Wang GQ']","['Department of Nephrology, Lanzhou University Second Hospital, Lanzhou, Gansu 730000, P.R.

However, TKIs do not effectively eliminate CML stem cells. In fact, CML stem cells persist and cause relapse in the majority of patients upon discontinuation of the drug treatment. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses have revealed that p53 and c-Myc play defining roles in CML stem cell survival, suggesting that the dual targeting of p53 and c-Myc may selectively eliminate stem cells in patients with CML. Since the downregulation of c-Myc and then upregulation of p21 (a target gene of p53) are commonly observed during the differentiation of acute myeloid leukemia cells induced by differentiation inducers, we hypothesized that differentiation-inducing agents may be useful in regulating c-Myc and p53 expression in CML cells. In the present study, we demonstrate that some differentiation-inducing agents effectively suppress the self-renewal ability of CML cells, and that the combination of these inducers with TKIs results in significantly greater inhibitory effects on CML cell growth compared to the use of TKIs or the inducer alone. The KU812 cells were treated with various concentrations of the inducers in the presence or absence of 30 nM imatinib for 4 days. Among the differentiation inducers we tested, cotylenin A (CN-A) was the most potent at inhibiting the self-renewal ability of the CML cells. CN-A induced the robust expression of CD38, a marker of committed progenitor and more differentiated myelomonocytic cells, and rapidly suppressed c-Myc expression and upregulated p21 expression in CML cells. Thus, these results suggest that CN-A may have potential to promote the elimination of stem cells in CML.","['Ikejiri, Fumiyoshi', 'Honma, Yoshio', 'Okada, Takahiro', 'Urano, Takeshi', 'Suzumiya, Junji']","['Ikejiri F', 'Honma Y', 'Okada T', 'Urano T', 'Suzumiya J']","['Department of Oncology/Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Shimane University, Izumo, Shimane 6938501, Japan.', 'Department of Oncology/Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Shimane University, Izumo, Shimane 6938501, Japan.', 'Department of Oncology/Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Shimane University, Izumo, Shimane 6938501, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Shimane University, Izumo, Shimane 6938501, Japan.', 'Department of Oncology/Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Shimane University, Izumo, Shimane 6938501, Japan.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180402,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (cotylenin A)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/*genetics/metabolism', 'Diterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*genetics/metabolism']",,,2018/04/06 06:00,2018/10/10 06:00,['2018/04/06 06:00'],"['2018/01/11 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/10 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.3892/ijo.2018.4350 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2018 Jun;52(6):2061-2068. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2018.4350.

However, no reports have fully elucidated the application of LIF in marmoset induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) culture, particularly the underlying mechanisms. To demonstrate the feasibility of the application of LIF to marmoset iPSCs, the present study assessed these cells in the presence of LIF. Cell proliferation was measured using MTT assay, cell apoptosis was determined by flow cytometric analysis of fluorescein isothiocyanate Annexin V staining and the differentially expressed genes were analysed using Digital Gene Expression (DGE) analysis. The altered expression of pluripotencyassociated genes was confirmed by reverse transcriptionquantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis. Furthermore, following treatment with LY294002, cell proliferation was measured by MTT assay and protein levels were confirmed by western blot analysis. The results showed that LIF significantly promoted the number of proliferating cells, but had no effect on apoptosis. Digital Gene Expression analysis was used to examine the differentially expressed genes of marmoset iPSCs in the presence of LIF. The results showed that the pluripotencyassociated transcription factorencoding gene Tbox 3 (Tbx3) was activated by LIF. Notably, LIF increased the levels of phosphorylated (p)AKT and Tbx3 in the marmoset iPSCs. Furthermore, pretreatment with LY294002, an inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3kinase (PI3K), significantly impaired the LIFinduced upregulation of pAKT and Tbx3 in the marmoset iPSCs, suggesting that the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is involved in this regulation. Taken together, the results suggested that LIF is effective in maintaining marmoset iPSCs in cultures, which is associated with the activation of Tbx3 through regulation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.","['Ke, Minxia', 'He, Quan', 'Hong, Danping', 'Li, Ouyang', 'Zhu, Mengyi', 'Ou, Wen-Bin', 'He, Yulong', 'Wu, Yuehong']","['Ke M', 'He Q', 'Hong D', 'Li O', 'Zhu M', 'Ou WB', 'He Y', 'Wu Y']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Life Science, Zhejiang SciTech University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310018, P.R.

Therefore, alleviating the adverse effects and improving anti-PCa efficacy are the focuses of the chemohormonal therapy for future researches. In this study, the commercial androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT), polyester microsphere Enantone (ENT), and polypeptide micelles loaded with a clinical antitumor agent mitoxantrone (MTO) are employed for micro/nanocarrier-assisted chemohormonal therapy.

Relapse is the major cause of treatment failure in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. AML rarely presents as ocular manifestation in relapse or at presentation. The M4 subtype of AML is most commonly presented with extramedullary involvement. In this report, we presented a young female with AML who was diagnosed and treated for AML about 40 months ago. She did not transplant because she did not have a full-match donor. About 4 months ago, she visited with a red eye and conjunctival infiltration. She was referred to an ophthalmologist for a biopsy, and the pathology report showed the relapse of AML which was treated with systemic chemotherapy. Red eyes with subconjunctival nodules in patients with a history of previous AML should raise the suspicion for recurrent disease that warrants urgent biopsy and systemic treatment. Eye involvement with leukemia is usually responsive to systemic chemotherapy.","['Mozaheb, Zahra', 'Khooei, Alireza']","['Mozaheb Z', 'Khooei A']","['Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-5170-6765'],['eng'],['Case Reports'],20180212,United States,Case Rep Hematol,Case reports in hematology,101576456,,,,,,2018/04/06 06:00,2018/04/06 06:01,['2018/04/06 06:00'],"['2017/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/06 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2018/9590469 [doi]'],epublish,Case Rep Hematol. 2018 Feb 12;2018:9590469. doi: 10.1155/2018/9590469. eCollection 2018.,,,,PMC5829340,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results: In this study, DNMT3A mutation was identified in 7.9% of 469 de novo MDS patients. DNMT3A-mutated patients had higher platelet counts at diagnosis, and patients with ring sideroblasts had the highest incidence of DNMT3A mutations, whereas those with multilineage dysplasia had the lowest incidence. Thirty-one (83.8%) of 37 DNMT3A-mutated patients had additional molecular abnormalities at diagnosis, and DNMT3A mutation was highly associated with mutations of IDH2 and SF3B1. Patients with DNMT3A mutations had a higher risk of leukemia transformation and shorter overall survival. Further, DNMT3A mutation was an independent poor prognostic factor irrespective of age, IPSS-R, and genetic alterations. The sequential study demonstrated that the original DNMT3A mutations were retained during follow-ups unless allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was performed, while DNMT3A mutation was rarely acquired during disease progression. Conclusions: DNMT3A mutation predicts unfavorable outcomes in MDS and was stable during disease evolutions. It may thus be a potential biomarker to predict prognosis and monitor the treatment response.","['Lin, Ming-En', 'Hou, Hsin-An', 'Tsai, Cheng-Hong', 'Wu, Shang-Ju', 'Kuo, Yuan-Yeh', 'Tseng, Mei-Hsuan', 'Liu, Ming-Chih', 'Liu, Chia-Wen', 'Chou, Wen-Chien', 'Chen, Chien-Yuan', 'Tang, Jih-Luh', 'Yao, Ming', 'Li, Chi-Cheng', 'Huang, Shang-Yi', 'Ko, Bor-Sheng', 'Hsu, Szu-Chun', 'Lin, Chien-Ting', 'Tien, Hwei-Fang']","['Lin ME', 'Hou HA', 'Tsai CH', 'Wu SJ', 'Kuo YY', 'Tseng MH', 'Liu MC', 'Liu CW', 'Chou WC', 'Chen CY', 'Tang JL', 'Yao M', 'Li CC', 'Huang SY', 'Ko BS', 'Hsu SC', 'Lin CT', 'Tien HF']","['1Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, No.7, Chung Shan S.

However, lack of standardization of cellular products within the same clinical trial and lack of harmonization between different trials have hindered the clear identification of efficacy and safety determinants that should be unveiled in order to advance the field. With the aim of facilitating the isolation and in vivo tracking of CAR-T cells, we here propose the inclusion within the CAR molecule of a novel extracellular spacer based on the low-affinity nerve-growth-factor receptor (NGFR). We screened four different spacer designs using as target antigen the CD44 isoform variant 6 (CD44v6). We successfully generated NGFR-spaced CD44v6 CAR-T cells that could be efficiently enriched with clinical-grade immuno-magnetic beads without negative consequences on subsequent expansion, immuno-phenotype, in vitro antitumor reactivity, and conditional ablation when co-expressing a suicide gene. Most importantly, these cells could be tracked with anti-NGFR monoclonal antibodies in NSG mice, where they expanded, persisted, and exerted potent antitumor effects against both high leukemia and myeloma burdens. Similar results were obtained with NGFR-enriched CAR-T cells specific for CD19 or CEA, suggesting the universality of this strategy. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the incorporation of the NGFR marker gene within the CAR sequence allows for a single molecule to simultaneously work as a therapeutic and selection/tracking gene. Looking ahead, NGFR spacer enrichment might allow good manufacturing procedures-manufacturing of standardized CAR-T cell products with high therapeutic potential, which could be harmonized in different clinical trials and used in combination with a suicide gene for future application in the allogeneic setting.","['Casucci, Monica', 'Falcone, Laura', 'Camisa, Barbara', 'Norelli, Margherita', 'Porcellini, Simona', 'Stornaiuolo, Anna', 'Ciceri, Fabio', 'Traversari, Catia', 'Bordignon, Claudio', 'Bonini, Chiara', 'Bondanza, Attilio']","['Casucci M', 'Falcone L', 'Camisa B', 'Norelli M', 'Porcellini S', 'Stornaiuolo A', 'Ciceri F', 'Traversari C', 'Bordignon C', 'Bonini C', 'Bondanza A']","['Innovative Immunotherapies Unit, Division of Immunology, Transplantation and Infectious Diseases, San Raffaele Hospital Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy.', 'Innovative Immunotherapies Unit, Division of Immunology, Transplantation and Infectious Diseases, San Raffaele Hospital Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy.', 'Innovative Immunotherapies Unit, Division of Immunology, Transplantation and Infectious Diseases, San Raffaele Hospital Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy.', 'Innovative Immunotherapies Unit, Division of Immunology, Transplantation and Infectious Diseases, San Raffaele Hospital Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy.', 'Molmed Spa, Milano, Italy.', 'Molmed Spa, Milano, Italy.', 'Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milano, Italy.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, San Raffaele Hospital Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy.', 'Molmed Spa, Milano, Italy.', 'Molmed Spa, Milano, Italy.', 'Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milano, Italy.', 'Experimental Hematology Unit, Division of Immunology, Transplantation and Infectious Diseases, San Raffaele Hospital Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy.', 'Innovative Immunotherapies Unit, Division of Immunology, Transplantation and Infectious Diseases, San Raffaele Hospital Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy.', 'Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milano, Italy.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, San Raffaele Hospital Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180321,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,"['0 (CD44v6 antigen)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (NGFR protein, human)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)', '0 (Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Genes, Transgenic, Suicide', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/immunology', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Mice', 'Multiple Myeloma/therapy', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/genetics/*immunology', 'Receptors, Chimeric Antigen/genetics/*immunology', 'Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor/genetics/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Thymidine Kinase/*genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*CAR spacer', '*CAR-T cells', '*antitumor efficacy', '*cell sorting', '*good manufacturing procedures-manufacturing', '*suicide gene']",2018/04/06 06:00,2018/04/06 06:01,['2018/04/06 06:00'],"['2017/11/09 00:00 [received]', '2018/02/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/06 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2018.00507 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2018 Mar 21;9:507. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2018.00507. eCollection 2018.,,,,PMC5871667,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we aimed to investigate whether integration of gene mutations with other risk factors could further improve the stratification of MDS patients. Mutational analyses of 25 genes relevant to myeloid malignancies in 426 primary MDS patients showed that mutations of CBL, IDH2, ASXL1, DNMT3A, and TP53 were independently associated with shorter survival. Patients within each IPSS-R or 2016 WHO classification-defined risk group could be stratified into two risk subgroups based on the mutational status of these five genes; patients with these poor-risk mutations had an OS shorter than others in the same risk group, but similar to those with the next higher risk category.

His blood films prepared by natural air drying revealed medium-sized lymphocytes with unevenly distributed large and small villous projections. The cytoplasm was basophilic, nuclei were oval with clumped chromatin, and nucleoli were absent in most cells. Immune phenotypes CD19+, CD20+, CD11c+, FMC7+, IgM+, and Igkappa+ were detected. TRAP stain appeared negative, IgH JH chain genes were monoclonally rearranged, and BRAF V600E mutation was not detected. On the basis of these findings, hairy cell leukemia-Japanese variant (HCL-JV) was strongly suspected. The patient was followed up for >4 years without treatment. However, because thrombocytopenia and splenomegaly gradually progressed, splenectomy was performed. Microscopic examination confirmed that the splenic white pulp was atrophic. Moreover, infiltrates comprising small-to-medium-sized atypical lymphocytes with inconspicuous nucleoli were predominantly detected in the congested red pulp. On the basis of these results and immune histochemical findings, the patient was diagnosed with splenic diffuse red pulp small B-cell lymphoma (SDRPL).

We identified reasons for ineligibility and compared outcomes of ineligible with eligible patients treated on Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) Leukemia Committee protocols. Patients enrolled in SWOG phase 2, 2/3, or 3 protocols open since 2005 were analyzed for eligibility status, reasons for ineligibility, baseline characteristics, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS), serious adverse events (SAEs), complete remission (CR) status, and overall survival. A total of 2361 patients were enrolled in the 13 included studies. Of these, 247 (10%) were deemed ineligible; 78 were excluded from analyses, and 169 were included. Of the 169 included in analyses, 60% (101/169) were excluded due to missing baseline documentation. Baseline characteristics comparing ineligible to eligible patients were similar, with the exception of ECOG PS for S0325 (P = .02) and S0530 (P = .002). In multivariable analyses, neither the proportion of patients with ECOG PS >/= 2 (P = .12) nor the rate of grade 5 SAEs (P = .62) differed between groups. There was no difference in survival between eligible and ineligible patients (P = .25), and CR rates were similar, with the exception of S0325 (P < .001) and S0703 (P = .004).

SUMMARY ANSWER: Overall, no difference was found in the desire to have children between CCSs and controls, whereas CCSs consult a fertility specialist more often, at a younger age, and sooner after their first attempt at conceiving. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Female CCSs may face a shorter than anticipated reproductive window as a result of their cancer treatment. Little is known about their desire to have children and use of reproductive health care, especially in relation to their former cancer treatment. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This study is part of the DCOG LATER-VEVO study, a nationwide retrospective cohort study on female fertility in Dutch CCSs. In total, 1749 CCSs and 1673 controls were invited for the study. Data collection took place between January 2008 and May 2014. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Data on the desire to have children and use of reproductive health care were collected by questionnaire. The control group consisted of sisters from CCSs and females from the general population. In total, 1106 (63%) CCSs and 818 (49%) controls completed the questionnaire. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Overall, no difference was found in the desire to have children between CCSs and controls (86% and 89%, respectively). However, survivors of a CNS tumour were less likely to desire children and CCSs without biological children at time of study were more likely to report that their desire to have children was unfulfilled because of medical reasons (9%), compared to controls (1%). In total, 12% of CCSs ever consulted a fertility specialist compared to 10% of controls (OR = 1.7, 95% CI: 1.3-2.4). Mean (SD) age at time of their first visit was 27.7 (4.4) years for CCSs and 29.9 (3.9) years for controls (P < 0.01). In total, 43% of CCSs consulted a fertility specialist within 12 months after they had started trying to achieve a pregnancy, compared to 27% of controls. Risk factors for consulting a fertility specialist included a previous diagnosis of renal tumour, leukaemia, lymphoma or a CNS tumour, and treatment with alkylating chemotherapy, gonadotoxic radiotherapy or both. In total, 70% of CCSs reported a female factor as cause of subfertility compared to 34% of controls (OR = 4.5, 95% CI: 2.3-8.7) and in this specific group, CCSs seemed more likely to use fertility treatment (OR = 2.9, 95% CI: 1.0-8.2). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Because of the low number of CCSs who used fertility treatment, we were not able to look at specific diagnoses and treatment types associated with using fertility treatment. Nevertheless, we were able to identify diagnostic- and treatment-related risk factors for consulting a fertility specialist. Details regarding consultations with a fertility specialist and fertility treatment were based on self-report and may therefore be subject to recall bias. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Decisions about parenthood affect all CCSs. It's important to evaluate reproductive intentions and function timely after cancer treatment, so CCSs can be adequately counselled regarding family planning and fertility treatment.

The current study evaluated 843 RCC from the three major histologic subtypes, including 488 clear cell RCC, 274 papillary RCC, and 81 chromophobe RCC. Comprehensive genomic and phenotypic analysis of the RCC subtypes reveals distinctive features of each subtype that provide the foundation for the development of subtype-specific therapeutic and management strategies for patients affected with these cancers. Somatic alteration of BAP1, PBRM1, and PTEN and altered metabolic pathways correlated with subtype-specific decreased survival, while CDKN2A alteration, increased DNA hypermethylation, and increases in the immune-related Th2 gene expression signature correlated with decreased survival within all major histologic subtypes. CIMP-RCC demonstrated an increased immune signature, and a uniform and distinct metabolic expression pattern identified a subset of metabolically divergent (MD) ChRCC that associated with extremely poor survival.","['Ricketts, Christopher J', 'De Cubas, Aguirre A', 'Fan, Huihui', 'Smith, Christof C', 'Lang, Martin', 'Reznik, Ed', 'Bowlby, Reanne', 'Gibb, Ewan A', 'Akbani, Rehan', 'Beroukhim, Rameen', 'Bottaro, Donald P', 'Choueiri, Toni K', 'Gibbs, Richard A', 'Godwin, Andrew K', 'Haake, Scott', 'Hakimi, A Ari', 'Henske, Elizabeth P', 'Hsieh, James J', 'Ho, Thai H', 'Kanchi, Rupa S', 'Krishnan, Bhavani', 'Kwiatkowski, David J', 'Lui, Wembin', 'Merino, Maria J', 'Mills, Gordon B', 'Myers, Jerome', 'Nickerson, Michael L', 'Reuter, Victor E', 'Schmidt, Laura S', 'Shelley, C Simon', 'Shen, Hui', 'Shuch, Brian', 'Signoretti, Sabina', 'Srinivasan, Ramaprasad', 'Tamboli, Pheroze', 'Thomas, George', 'Vincent, Benjamin G', 'Vocke, Cathy D', 'Wheeler, David A', 'Yang, Lixing', 'Kim, William Y', 'Robertson, A Gordon', 'Spellman, Paul T', 'Rathmell, W Kimryn', 'Linehan, W Marston']","['Ricketts CJ', 'De Cubas AA', 'Fan H', 'Smith CC', 'Lang M', 'Reznik E', 'Bowlby R', 'Gibb EA', 'Akbani R', 'Beroukhim R', 'Bottaro DP', 'Choueiri TK', 'Gibbs RA', 'Godwin AK', 'Haake S', 'Hakimi AA', 'Henske EP', 'Hsieh JJ', 'Ho TH', 'Kanchi RS', 'Krishnan B', 'Kwiatkowski DJ', 'Lui W', 'Merino MJ', 'Mills GB', 'Myers J', 'Nickerson ML', 'Reuter VE', 'Schmidt LS', 'Shelley CS', 'Shen H', 'Shuch B', 'Signoretti S', 'Srinivasan R', 'Tamboli P', 'Thomas G', 'Vincent BG', 'Vocke CD', 'Wheeler DA', 'Yang L', 'Kim WY', 'Robertson AG', 'Spellman PT', 'Rathmell WK', 'Linehan WM']","['Urologic Oncology Branch, National Cancer Institute, Center for Cancer Research, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN 37232, USA.', 'Van Andel Research Institute, Grand Rapids, MI 49503, USA.', 'Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC 27599, USA.', 'Urologic Oncology Branch, National Cancer Institute, Center for Cancer Research, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', ""Canada's Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre, Vancouver, BC V5Z 4S6, Canada."", ""Canada's Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre, Vancouver, BC V5Z 4S6, Canada."", 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'The Broad Institute of Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA.', 'Urologic Oncology Branch, National Cancer Institute, Center for Cancer Research, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02215, USA.', 'Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS 66206, USA.', 'Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN 37232, USA.', 'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', ""Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA."", 'Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.', 'Mayo Clinic Arizona, Phoenix, AZ 85054, USA.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC 27599, USA.', ""Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA."", 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Laboratory of Pathology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Centura Health, Centennial, CO 80112, USA.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Urologic Oncology Branch, National Cancer Institute, Center for Cancer Research, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA; Basic Science Program, Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc.

Dnmt3a loss of function in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) skews divisions toward self-renewal at the expense of differentiation. Moreover, DNMT3A mutations can be detected in the blood of aging individuals, indicating that mutant cells outcompete normal HSCs over time. It is important to understand how these mutations provide a competitive advantage to HSCs. Here we show that Dnmt3a-null HSCs can regenerate over at least 12 transplant generations in mice, far exceeding the lifespan of normal HSCs. Molecular characterization reveals that this in vivo immortalization is associated with gradual and focal losses of DNA methylation at key regulatory regions associated with self-renewal genes, producing a highly stereotypical HSC phenotype in which epigenetic features are further buttressed. These findings lend insight into the preponderance of DNMT3A mutations in clonal hematopoiesis and the persistence of mutant clones after chemotherapy.","['Jeong, Mira', 'Park, Hyun Jung', 'Celik, Hamza', 'Ostrander, Elizabeth L', 'Reyes, Jaime M', 'Guzman, Anna', 'Rodriguez, Benjamin', 'Lei, Yong', 'Lee, Yeojin', 'Ding, Lei', 'Guryanova, Olga A', 'Li, Wei', 'Goodell, Margaret A', 'Challen, Grant A']","['Jeong M', 'Park HJ', 'Celik H', 'Ostrander EL', 'Reyes JM', 'Guzman A', 'Rodriguez B', 'Lei Y', 'Lee Y', 'Ding L', 'Guryanova OA', 'Li W', 'Goodell MA', 'Challen GA']","['Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Dan L.

The sample consisted of 24 children diagnosed with leukaemia and solid tumours (58% girls with a mean age of 8.0 years) who underwent an AAT programme consisting of three 30-min sessions in an open group. Two dogs (one Labrador retriever and one golden retriever) were used, and activities such as sensory stimulation, gait training, and socialization were conducted. The exclusion criteria were severe mental problems, inability to answer the questions included in the instruments used, allergy to animals, unavailability/lack of interest, isolation precaution, surgical wound, use of invasive devices, ostomy, no current blood count for evaluation, neutropaenia, infection, fever, diarrhoea, vomiting, respiratory symptoms at the beginning of the intervention or 1 week before the intervention, hospitalization or scheduled surgery, and non-completion of the AAT programme. The variables analysed using validated self or other evaluations were stress, pain, mood, anxiety, depression, quality of life, heart rate, and blood pressure. A quasi-experimental study design was used. We observed a decrease in pain (p = 0.046, d = -0.894), irritation (p = 0.041, d = -0.917), and stress (p = 0.005; d = -1.404) and a tendency towards improvement of depressive symptoms (p = 0.069; d = -0.801). Among the caregivers, an improvement was observed in anxiety (p = 0.007, d = -1.312), mental confusion (p = 0.006, d = -1.350), and tension (p = 0.006, d = -1.361). Therefore, the selection criteria and care protocols used for the AAT programme in the oncological context were adequate, and the programme was effective.","['Silva, Nathiana B', 'Osorio, Flavia L']","['Silva NB', 'Osorio FL']","['Pio XII Foundation-Barretos Cancer Hospital, Barretos, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Pio XII Foundation-Barretos Cancer Hospital, Barretos, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Neurosciences and Behavioural Sciences, Faculty of Medicine of Ribeirao Preto-USP, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-7621-1790'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180404,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['*Animal Assisted Therapy', 'Animals', 'Anxiety/pathology', 'Caregivers/psychology', 'Child', 'Depression/pathology', 'Dogs', 'Female', 'Heart Rate', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/physiopathology/*psychology/therapy', 'Pain/pathology', '*Program Evaluation', 'Quality of Life', 'Stress, Psychological']",,,2018/04/05 06:00,2018/07/14 06:00,['2018/04/05 06:00'],"['2017/11/20 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0194731 [doi]', 'PONE-D-17-40971 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2018 Apr 4;13(4):e0194731. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0194731. eCollection 2018.,,,,PMC5884536,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While Dex is commonly used for hematological malignancies, the effects of Dex in solid cancer cells remain controversial. To develop a more effective anticancer drug for solid cancers, Dex was modified by ionizing radiation and the anticancer activity of ionizing-radiation-irradiated Dex (Dex-IR) was investigated in human lung cancer cells. Using the MTT assay, the proliferation of non-small cell lung cancer cells was significantly inhibited after treatment with Dex-IR compared with Dex. Furthermore, Dex-IR induced apoptotic cell death and cell cycle arrest of H1650 human lung cancer cells. The invasiveness of H1650 cells was significantly reduced and the matrix metalloproteinase activity was strongly suppressed. These results indicate that Dex-IR acts as a tumor suppressor by both inducing apoptosis and arresting the cell cycle. Although the structure of Dex-IR remains to be determined, our results suggest it may be useful as a novel anticancer agent for the treatment of solid cancers.","['Lee, Eun-Hee', 'Park, Chul Hong', 'Choi, Hyo Jin', 'Kawala, Remigius Ambrose', 'Bai, Hyoung-Woo', 'Chung, Byung Yeoup']","['Lee EH', 'Park CH', 'Choi HJ', 'Kawala RA', 'Bai HW', 'Chung BY']","['Research Division for Biotechnology, Advanced Radiation Technology Institute (ARTI), Korea Atomic Energy Insitute (KAERI), 29 Geumgu-gil, Jeongeup-si, Jeollabuk-do, Republic of Korea.', 'Daegu-Gyeongbuk Medical Innovation Foundation, Medical Device Development Center, Daegu, Republic of Korea.', 'Research Division for Biotechnology, Advanced Radiation Technology Institute (ARTI), Korea Atomic Energy Insitute (KAERI), 29 Geumgu-gil, Jeongeup-si, Jeollabuk-do, Republic of Korea.', 'Research Division for Biotechnology, Advanced Radiation Technology Institute (ARTI), Korea Atomic Energy Insitute (KAERI), 29 Geumgu-gil, Jeongeup-si, Jeollabuk-do, Republic of Korea.', 'Research Division for Biotechnology, Advanced Radiation Technology Institute (ARTI), Korea Atomic Energy Insitute (KAERI), 29 Geumgu-gil, Jeongeup-si, Jeollabuk-do, Republic of Korea.', 'Radiation Biotechnology and Applied Radioisotope Science, University of Science and Technology (UST), Daejeon, Republic of Korea.', 'Research Division for Biotechnology, Advanced Radiation Technology Institute (ARTI), Korea Atomic Energy Insitute (KAERI), 29 Geumgu-gil, Jeongeup-si, Jeollabuk-do, Republic of Korea.', 'Radiation Biotechnology and Applied Radioisotope Science, University of Science and Technology (UST), Daejeon, Republic of Korea.', 'Research Division for Biotechnology, Advanced Radiation Technology Institute (ARTI), Korea Atomic Energy Insitute (KAERI), 29 Geumgu-gil, Jeongeup-si, Jeollabuk-do, Republic of Korea.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-1122-171X'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180404,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Matrix Metalloproteinases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/radiation effects/*therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*drug therapy/pathology/radiotherapy', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology/radiation effects/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology/radiotherapy', 'Matrix Metalloproteinases/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness']",,,2018/04/05 06:00,2018/07/28 06:00,['2018/04/05 06:00'],"['2017/09/26 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0194341 [doi]', 'PONE-D-17-34896 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2018 Apr 4;13(4):e0194341. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0194341. eCollection 2018.,,,,PMC5884514,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such conditioning causes host stromal cell injury, impairing restoration of the central (thymus) and peripheral (spleen and lymph node) T cell compartments and slow immune reconstitution. The chemokine, CCL21, produced by host stromal cells, recruits T- and B-cells that provide lymphotoxin mediated instructive signals to stromal cells for lymphoid organogenesis. Moreover, T- and B-cell recruitment into these sites is required for optimal adaptive immune responses to pathogens and tumor antigens. Previously, we reported that CCL21 was markedly reduced in secondary lymphoid organs of transplanted animals. Here, we utilized adenoviral CCL21 gene transduced dendritic cells (DC/CCL21) given by footpad injections as a novel approach to restore CCL21 expression in secondary lymphoid organs post-transplant. CCL21 expression in secondary lymphoid organs reached levels of naive controls and resulted in increased T cell trafficking to draining lymph nodes (LNs). An increase in both lymphoid tissue inducer cells and the B cell chemokine CXCL13 known to be important in LN formation was observed. Strikingly, only mice vaccinated with DC/CCL21 loaded with bacterial, viral or tumor antigens and not recipients of DC/control adenovirus loaded cells or no DCs had a marked increase in the systemic clearance of pathogens (bacteria; virus) and leukemia cells. Because DC/CCL21 vaccines have been tested in clinical trials for patients with lung cancer and melanoma, our studies provide the foundation for future trials of DC/CCL21 vaccination in patients receiving pre-transplant conditioning regimens.","['Stefanski, Heather E', 'Jonart, Leslie', 'Goren, Emily', 'Mule, James J', 'Blazar, Bruce R']","['Stefanski HE', 'Jonart L', 'Goren E', 'Mule JJ', 'Blazar BR']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States of America.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States of America.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States of America.', 'Cutaneous Oncology Program, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida, United States of America.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States of America.']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-7527-9315'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20180404,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Chemokine CCL21)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/genetics', 'Animals', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/methods', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cancer Vaccines/genetics/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chemokine CCL21/*genetics/immunology', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Lymph Nodes/immunology', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', '*Transduction, Genetic', 'Vaccination']",,,2018/04/05 06:00,2018/07/14 06:00,['2018/04/05 06:00'],"['2017/09/19 00:00 [received]', '2018/02/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0193461 [doi]', 'PONE-D-17-33268 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2018 Apr 4;13(4):e0193461. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0193461. eCollection 2018.,,['Dryad/10.5061/dryad.641hb'],"['P01 CA065493/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA072669/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC5884478,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This cancer-associated hypersialylation directly impacts the signaling interactions between tumor cells and their surrounding microenvironment, especially the interactions mediated by immune cell surface sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins (Siglecs) to relay inhibitory signals for cytotoxicity. First, we obtained a Siglec-7(neg) NK-92MI cell line, NK-92MI-S7N, by separating a group of Siglec-7(neg) cell population from an eight-month-long-term NK-92MI in vitro culture by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). The effect of Siglec-7 loss on NK-92MI-S7N cells was characterized by the cell morphology, proliferation, and cytotoxic activity via FACS, MTS assay, cytotoxic assay, and natural killer (NK) degranulation assay. We found the expression levels of Siglec-7 in NK-92MI were negatively correlated with NK cytotoxicity against leukemia cells. This NK-92MI-S7N cell not only shared very similar phenotypes with its parental cells but also possessed a high and sustainable killing activity. Furthermore, this Siglec-7(neg) NK line was unexpectedly capable of eliminating a NK-92MI-resistant leukemia cell, THP-1, through enhancing the effector-target interaction. In this study, a NK cell line with high and sustainable cytotoxicity was established and this cell may provide a potential application in NK-based treatment for leukemia patients.","['Huang, Chin-Han', 'Liao, Yi-Jen', 'Fan, Ting-Hsi', 'Chiou, Tzeon-Jye', 'Lin, Yen-Hsi', 'Twu, Yuh-Ching']","['Huang CH', 'Liao YJ', 'Fan TH', 'Chiou TJ', 'Lin YH', 'Twu YC']","['Department of Biotechnology and Laboratory Science in Medicine, School of Biomedical Science and Engineering, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei 112, Taiwan. pomelof76@gmail.com.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Taipei Tzu Chi Hospital, Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Foundation, New Taipei City 231, Taiwan. pomelof76@gmail.com.', 'School of Medical Laboratory Science and Biotechnology, College of Medical Science and Technology, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 112, Taiwan. yjliao@tmu.edu.tw.', 'Department of Biotechnology and Laboratory Science in Medicine, School of Biomedical Science and Engineering, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei 112, Taiwan. pups0432@gmail.com.', 'Division of Transfusion Medicine, Department of Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei 112, Taiwan. tjchiou@vghtpe.gov.tw.', 'Department of Biotechnology and Laboratory Science in Medicine, School of Biomedical Science and Engineering, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei 112, Taiwan. cathy501213@gmail.com.', 'Department of Biotechnology and Laboratory Science in Medicine, School of Biomedical Science and Engineering, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei 112, Taiwan. yctwu@ym.edu.tw.']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-0327-0738'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180404,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,['0 (Sialic Acid Binding Immunoglobulin-like Lectins)'],IM,"['Cell Degranulation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/genetics/immunology/metabolism', '*Phenotype', 'Sialic Acid Binding Immunoglobulin-like Lectins/*deficiency/genetics/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['Siglec-7', 'glycosylation', 'hypersialylation', 'immuno-surveillance', 'natural killer cell']",2018/04/05 06:00,2018/09/11 06:00,['2018/04/05 06:00'],"['2018/01/12 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/29 00:00 [revised]', '2018/04/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/11 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms19041073 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms19041073 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2018 Apr 4;19(4). pii: ijms19041073. doi: 10.3390/ijms19041073.,,,,PMC5979288,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: As rituximab has shown to influence B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling, we investigated the interaction of anti-CD20 antibody rituximab and the new type II glycoengineered anti-CD20 antibody obinutuzumab in combination with the PI3K delta inhibitor idelalisib. METHODS: Established DLBCL cell lines were treated with either rituximab or obinutuzumab alone or in combination with PI3K delta inhibitor idelalisib. RESULTS: Rituximab and to a lesser extent obinutuzumab monotherapy resulted in a temporary upregulation of p-Akt, p42/44, and p38 signaling pathways. Idelalisib reduced p-Akt expression. Rituximab antagonized the p-Akt downregulation at early time points, while obinutuzumab did not interfere with idelalisib's effects. In cell growth analysis, early antagonism could also be detected. CONCLUSION: The combination of idelalisib with CD antibodies shows an initial antagonism of rituximab but not obinutuzumab in downregulation of PI3K-signaling targets.","['Zoellner, Anna-Katharina', 'Peter, Nico', 'Zimmermann, Yvonne', 'Hutter, Grit', 'Hiddemann, Wolfgang', 'Dreyling, Martin']","['Zoellner AK', 'Peter N', 'Zimmermann Y', 'Hutter G', 'Hiddemann W', 'Dreyling M']","['Department of Medicine III, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine III, Laboratory for Experimental Leukemia and Lymphoma Research (ELLF), Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine III, Laboratory for Experimental Leukemia and Lymphoma Research (ELLF), Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine III, Laboratory for Experimental Leukemia and Lymphoma Research (ELLF), Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine III, Laboratory for Experimental Leukemia and Lymphoma Research (ELLF), Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine III, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine III, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine III, Laboratory for Experimental Leukemia and Lymphoma Research (ELLF), Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7800-2730'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180404,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['PI3K', 'anti-CD20', 'diffuse large B-cell lymphoma']",2018/04/05 06:00,2018/04/05 06:00,['2018/04/05 06:00'],"['2018/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/05 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ejh.13075 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Eur J Haematol. 2018 Apr 4. doi: 10.1111/ejh.13075.,['(c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

In 2012, the Food and Drug Administration issued a statement warning physicians of the increased risk with lenalidomide treatment of the following secondary primary malignancies: Acute myelogenous leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, and Hodgkin lymphoma. The statement did not mention glioblastoma multiforme, a Grade 4 astrocytoma, or other high-grade astrocytomas that have been reported on rare occasions in the setting of multiple myeloma. CASE PRESENTATION: A 72-year-old man, who had been in complete remission from multiple myeloma for 1 year after treatment that included lenalidomide, presented with confusion, headache, nausea and vomiting, and recurrent falls. A magnetic resonance image of his brain revealed a mass that on stereotactic biopsy was found to be glioblastoma multiforme. DISCUSSION: We present the seventh reported case of high-grade astrocytoma as a second primary malignancy in multiple myeloma and the first reported occurrence of glioblastoma multiforme after the use of lenalidomide in multiple myeloma. This report adds to the pool of cases that reveal associations between use of lenalidomide and increased risk of developing secondary primary high-grade astrocytomas in multiple myeloma.","['Moore, Christine A', 'Ibrahim, Moayed', 'Kapila, Aaysha', 'Bajaj, Kailash']","['Moore CA', 'Ibrahim M', 'Kapila A', 'Bajaj K']","['Internist at East Tennessee State University in Kingsport. mooreca2@etsu.edu.', 'Internist at East Tennessee State University in Kingsport. ibrahimm@etsu.edu.', 'Internist at East Tennessee State University in Johnson City. kapilaa@etsu.edu.', 'Internist at East Tennessee State University in Johnson City. bajajk@etsu.edu.']",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Perm J,The Permanente journal,9800474,"['0 (Immunologic Factors)', 'F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Glioblastoma/*complications', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors', 'Lenalidomide/*therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Multiple Myeloma/*complications/*drug therapy', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*complications']",,,2018/04/05 06:00,2018/12/12 06:00,['2018/04/05 06:00'],"['2018/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [medline]']","['17-125 [pii]', '10.7812/TPP/17-125 [doi]']",ppublish,Perm J. 2018;22:17-125. doi: 10.7812/TPP/17-125.,,,,PMC5882177,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Within this logistic framework, lymphoid recovery is characterized by the parameters R (slope of ascent), a (time of maximal rate of ascent) and K (plateau), the 'steady-state' lymphocyte count. A retrospective analysis of allogeneic SCT performed from 2008 to 2013 was undertaken to compare lymphoid recovery and clinical outcomes in 131 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia, and myelodysplastic syndromes. Using Prism software, a logistic curve was successfully fit to the absolute lymphocyte count recovery in all patients. Patients were classified according to the magnitude and rate of lymphoid recovery; pattern A achieved an absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC) of >1000/muL by day 45, pattern B an ALC 500 < x < 1000/muL, and pattern C an ALC <500/muL. Pattern A was characterized by a higher mean K (p < .0001) compared with patterns B and C. Patients with patterns B and C were more likely to have mixed T cell chimerism at 90 d following SCT (p = .01). There was a trend towards improved survival (and relapse-free survival) in those with pattern A and B at 1 year compared to pattern C (p = .073). There was no difference in cGVHD (p = .42) or relapse (p = .45) between pattern types. Cytomegalovirus (CMV), aGVHD, and all relapse were heralded by deviation from logistic behavior. Pattern C patients were more likely to require donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) (p = .017). Weaning of tacrolimus post-transplant was associated with a second, separate logistic expansion in some patients. This study demonstrated that lymphoid reconstitution follows a prototypical logistic recovery and that pattern observed correlates with T cell chimerism and need for DLI, and may influence survival.","['Kobulnicky, David J', 'Sabo, Roy T', 'Sharma, Shashank', 'Shubar Ali, Ali S', 'Kobulnicky, Kristen M', 'Roberts, Catherine H', 'Clark, William B', 'Chung, Harold M', 'McCarty, John M', 'Toor, Amir A']","['Kobulnicky DJ', 'Sabo RT', 'Sharma S', 'Shubar Ali AS', 'Kobulnicky KM', 'Roberts CH', 'Clark WB', 'Chung HM', 'McCarty JM', 'Toor AA']","['a Bone Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Internal Medicine , Virginia Commonwealth University , Richmond , VA , USA.', 'b Department of Biostatistics , Virginia Commonwealth University , Richmond , VA , USA.', 'a Bone Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Internal Medicine , Virginia Commonwealth University , Richmond , VA , USA.', 'a Bone Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Internal Medicine , Virginia Commonwealth University , Richmond , VA , USA.', 'a Bone Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Internal Medicine , Virginia Commonwealth University , Richmond , VA , USA.', 'a Bone Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Internal Medicine , Virginia Commonwealth University , Richmond , VA , USA.', 'a Bone Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Internal Medicine , Virginia Commonwealth University , Richmond , VA , USA.', 'a Bone Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Internal Medicine , Virginia Commonwealth University , Richmond , VA , USA.', 'a Bone Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Internal Medicine , Virginia Commonwealth University , Richmond , VA , USA.', 'a Bone Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Internal Medicine , Virginia Commonwealth University , Richmond , VA , USA.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180404,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/blood/*epidemiology/immunology/prevention & control', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/blood/immunology/mortality/*therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Kinetics', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Lymphoid Tissue/cytology/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*epidemiology/immunology/prevention & control', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Basic biology', '*clinical results', '*lymphoid leukemia', '*myeloid leukemias and dysplasias']",2018/04/05 06:00,2019/06/25 06:00,['2018/04/05 06:00'],"['2018/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/25 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2018.1452216 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2018 Dec;59(12):2973-2981. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2018.1452216.

SFKs impede the retinoic acid receptor, and SFK inhibitors enhance all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-mediated cellular differentiation in AML cell lines and primary blasts. To translate these findings into the clinic, we undertook a phase-I dose-escalation study of the combination of the SFK inhibitor dasatinib and ATRA in patients with high-risk myeloid neoplasms. Nine subjects were enrolled: six received 70 mg dasatinib plus 45 mg/m(2) ATRA daily, and three received 100 mg dasatinib plus 45 mg/m(2) ATRA daily for 28 days. Headache and QTc prolongations were the only two grade 3 adverse events observed. No significant clinical responses were observed. We conclude that the combination of 70 mg dasatinib and 45 mg/m(2) ATRA daily is safe with acceptable toxicity. Our results provide the safety profile for further investigations into the clinical efficacy of this combination therapy in myeloid malignancies.","['Redner, Robert L', 'Beumer, Jan H', 'Kropf, Patricia', 'Agha, Mounzer', 'Boyiadzis, Michael', 'Dorritie, Kathleen', 'Farah, Rafic', 'Hou, Jing-Zhao', 'Im, Annie', 'Lim, Seah H', 'Raptis, Anastasios', 'Sehgal, Alison', 'Christner, Susan M', 'Normolle, Daniel', 'Johnson, Daniel E']","['Redner RL', 'Beumer JH', 'Kropf P', 'Agha M', 'Boyiadzis M', 'Dorritie K', 'Farah R', 'Hou JZ', 'Im A', 'Lim SH', 'Raptis A', 'Sehgal A', 'Christner SM', 'Normolle D', 'Johnson DE']","['a Cancer Therapeutics Program, UPMC Hillman Cancer Center , Pittsburgh , PA , USA.', 'b Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine , University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine , Pittsburgh , PA , USA.', 'a Cancer Therapeutics Program, UPMC Hillman Cancer Center , Pittsburgh , PA , USA.', 'b Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine , University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine , Pittsburgh , PA , USA.', 'c Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences , University of Pittsburgh School of Pharmacy , Pittsburgh , PA , USA.', 'b Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine , University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine , Pittsburgh , PA , USA.', 'a Cancer Therapeutics Program, UPMC Hillman Cancer Center , Pittsburgh , PA , USA.', 'b Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine , University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine , Pittsburgh , PA , USA.', 'a Cancer Therapeutics Program, UPMC Hillman Cancer Center , Pittsburgh , PA , USA.', 'b Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine , University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine , Pittsburgh , PA , USA.', 'a Cancer Therapeutics Program, UPMC Hillman Cancer Center , Pittsburgh , PA , USA.', 'b Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine , University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine , Pittsburgh , PA , USA.', 'a Cancer Therapeutics Program, UPMC Hillman Cancer Center , Pittsburgh , PA , USA.', 'b Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine , University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine , Pittsburgh , PA , USA.', 'a Cancer Therapeutics Program, UPMC Hillman Cancer Center , Pittsburgh , PA , USA.', 'b Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine , University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine , Pittsburgh , PA , USA.', 'a Cancer Therapeutics Program, UPMC Hillman Cancer Center , Pittsburgh , PA , USA.', 'b Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine , University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine , Pittsburgh , PA , USA.', 'b Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine , University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine , Pittsburgh , PA , USA.', 'a Cancer Therapeutics Program, UPMC Hillman Cancer Center , Pittsburgh , PA , USA.', 'b Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine , University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine , Pittsburgh , PA , USA.', 'a Cancer Therapeutics Program, UPMC Hillman Cancer Center , Pittsburgh , PA , USA.', 'b Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine , University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine , Pittsburgh , PA , USA.', 'a Cancer Therapeutics Program, UPMC Hillman Cancer Center , Pittsburgh , PA , USA.', 'd Department of Biostatistics , University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health , Pittsburgh , PA , USA.', 'b Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine , University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine , Pittsburgh , PA , USA.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-2042-296X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8978-9401', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0973-7100', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3954-7401', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8675-5014']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180404,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Dasatinib/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Headache/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Long QT Syndrome/chemically induced', 'Middle Aged', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'src-Family Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*ATRA', '*dasatinib', '*pharmacodynamics', '*pharmacokinetics', '*phase I']",2018/04/05 06:00,2019/06/14 06:00,['2018/04/05 06:00'],"['2018/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2018.1443330 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2018 Nov;59(11):2595-2601. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2018.1443330.

Twenty-five patients who received maintenance azacitidine were matched to historical controls in a two-to-one ratio based on diagnosis, donor type, conditioning regimen intensity, and age. Over 90% of patients received myeloablative conditioning. There was no difference in time to hematologic relapse, overall survival, or non-relapse mortality. Maintenance therapy was stopped early in 72% of patients due to graft-versus-host-disease, relapse, infection, and intolerance (13 of 25 patients received less than 4 cycles).

The multi-drug resistance-1 (MDR1/ABCB1) gene encodes P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which plays an important role in chemoresistance; however, its transcriptional regulation remains unclear. We investigated the role of YY1 in the regulation of MDR1 and its relation to ALL outcomes. Analysis of the MDR1 promoter revealed four putative YY1-binding sites, which we analyzed using a reporter system and ChIP analysis. YY1 silencing resulted in the inhibition of MDR1 expression and function. The clinical roles of YY1 and MDR1 expression were evaluated in children with ALL. Expression of both proteins was increased in ALL patients compared to controls. We identified a positive correlation between YY1 and MDR1 expression. High levels of YY1 were associated with decreased overall survival. Our results demonstrated that YY1 regulates the transcription of MDR1. Therefore, YY1 may serve as a useful prognostic and/or therapeutic target.","['Antonio-Andres, Gabriela', 'Rangel-Santiago, Jesus', 'Tirado-Rodriguez, Belen', 'Martinez-Ruiz, Gustavo U', 'Klunder-Klunder, Miguel', 'Vega, Mario I', 'Lopez-Martinez, Briceida', 'Jimenez-Hernandez, Elva', 'Torres Nava, Jose', 'Medina-Sanson, Aurora', 'Huerta-Yepez, Sara']","['Antonio-Andres G', 'Rangel-Santiago J', 'Tirado-Rodriguez B', 'Martinez-Ruiz GU', 'Klunder-Klunder M', 'Vega MI', 'Lopez-Martinez B', 'Jimenez-Hernandez E', 'Torres Nava J', 'Medina-Sanson A', 'Huerta-Yepez S']","['a Unidad de Investigacion en Enfermedades Oncologicas , Hospital Infantil de Mexico, Federico Gomez , Mexico City , Mexico.', 'a Unidad de Investigacion en Enfermedades Oncologicas , Hospital Infantil de Mexico, Federico Gomez , Mexico City , Mexico.', 'a Unidad de Investigacion en Enfermedades Oncologicas , Hospital Infantil de Mexico, Federico Gomez , Mexico City , Mexico.', 'a Unidad de Investigacion en Enfermedades Oncologicas , Hospital Infantil de Mexico, Federico Gomez , Mexico City , Mexico.', 'b Facultad de Medicina , Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico , Mexico City , Mexico.', 'c Departamento de Investigacion en Salud Comunitaria , Hospital Infantil de Mexico, Federico Gomez , Mexico City , Mexico.', 'd Department of Medicine, Hematology-Oncology Division , VA West Los Angeles Medical Center BBRI, UCLA Medical Center, Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center , Los Angeles , CA , USA.', 'e Molecular Signal Pathway in Cancer Laboratory , UIMEO, Oncology Hospital, Siglo XXI National Medical Center, IMSS , Mexico City , Mexico.', 'f Laboratorio Central , Hospital Infantil de Mexico, Federico Gomez , Mexico City , Mexico.', 'g Servicio de Hemato-Oncologia , Hospital Infantil de Moctezuma , Mexico City , Mexico.', 'g Servicio de Hemato-Oncologia , Hospital Infantil de Moctezuma , Mexico City , Mexico.', 'h Departamento de Hemato-Oncologia , Hospital Infantil de Mexico, Federico Gomez , Mexico City , Mexico.', 'a Unidad de Investigacion en Enfermedades Oncologicas , Hospital Infantil de Mexico, Federico Gomez , Mexico City , Mexico.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180404,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (YY1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (YY1 protein, human)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/genetics/metabolism', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Survival Rate', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'YY1 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*', '*Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*YY1', '*chemoresistance', '*children']",2018/04/05 06:00,2019/10/23 06:00,['2018/04/05 06:00'],"['2018/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/23 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2018.1448083 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2018 Nov;59(11):2628-2638. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2018.1448083.

We demonstrated significant differential gene expression profiles (GEPs) between MDS and normal and identified 41 disease classifier genes. Additionally, two main clusters of GEPs distinguished patients based on their major clinical features, particularly between those whose disease remained stable versus patients who transformed into acute myeloid leukemia within 12 months. The genes whose expression was associated with disease outcome were involved in functional pathways and biologic processes highly relevant for MDS. Combined with exomic analysis we identified differential isoform usage of genes in MDS mutational subgroups, with consequent dysregulation of distinct biologic functions. This combination of clinical, transcriptomic and exomic findings provides valuable understanding of mechanisms underlying MDS and its progression to a more aggressive stage and also facilitates prognostic characterization of MDS patients.","['Im, Hogune', 'Rao, Varsha', 'Sridhar, Kunju', 'Bentley, Jason', 'Mishra, Tejaswini', 'Chen, Rui', 'Hall, Jeff', 'Graber, Armin', 'Zhang, Yan', 'Li, Xiao', 'Mias, George I', 'Snyder, Michael P', 'Greenberg, Peter L']","['Im H', 'Rao V', 'Sridhar K', 'Bentley J', 'Mishra T', 'Chen R', 'Hall J', 'Graber A', 'Zhang Y', 'Li X', 'Mias GI', 'Snyder MP', 'Greenberg PL']","['a Department of Genetics , Stanford University School of Medicine , Stanford , CA , USA.', 'a Department of Genetics , Stanford University School of Medicine , Stanford , CA , USA.', 'b Hematology Division , Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford Cancer Institute , Stanford , CA , USA.', 'c Quantitative Science Unit , Stanford University , Stanford , CA , USA.', 'a Department of Genetics , Stanford University School of Medicine , Stanford , CA , USA.', 'a Department of Genetics , Stanford University School of Medicine , Stanford , CA , USA.', 'd Genoptix Inc. , Carlsbad , CA , USA.', 'd Genoptix Inc. , Carlsbad , CA , USA.', 'e Department of Hematology , Jiaotong University, 6th Hospital , Shanghai , China.', 'e Department of Hematology , Jiaotong University, 6th Hospital , Shanghai , China.', 'f Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology , Michigan State University , East Lansing , MI , USA.', 'a Department of Genetics , Stanford University School of Medicine , Stanford , CA , USA.', 'b Hematology Division , Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford Cancer Institute , Stanford , CA , USA.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-7348-526X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9083-1216']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180404,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*pathology', 'Disease Progression', 'Exons/*genetics', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Transcriptome/*genetics', 'Whole Exome Sequencing']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Myeloid leukemias and dysplasias', '*isoform usage', '*myeloproliferative disorders', '*trancriptomics']",2018/04/05 06:00,2019/06/25 06:00,['2018/04/05 06:00'],"['2018/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/25 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2018.1452210 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2018 Dec;59(12):2952-2962. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2018.1452210.

The median overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) was also similar between the two groups although more 'older' (aged from 60 to 69 years old) and 'unfit' patients underwent DCAG regimen. Notably, patients in DCAG group experienced significantly fewer infections (75 versus 100%, p = .001). Moreover recovery of platelet count was significantly more rapid in DCAG group.

We retrospectively identified 122 patients with such blastic phases. The overall median survival was four months: 10.2 months for patients treated with intensive treatments compared to three months for best supportive care (p = .005). Azacytidine, intensive chemotherapies, or allogeneic stem cell transplantation gave the highest median survivals with 9, 10.2, and 19.4 months, respectively. Accelerated phases (AP) had a longer median survival compared to acute leukemia (4.8 months vs. 3.1 months; p = .02). In this retrospective and observational study, we observe that the longest survivals are seen in patients eligible for intensive treatments. Azacytidine shows interesting results in patients non-fit for intensive chemotherapy. Supportive care should probably be restricted to elderly patients and those with unfavorable karyotype. An early diagnosis of AP could also result in a better survival rate.","['Mollard, Lise-Marie', 'Chauveau, Aurelie', 'Boyer-Perrard, Francoise', 'Douet-Guilbert, Nathalie', 'Houot, Roch', 'Quintin-Roue, Isabelle', 'Couturier, Marie-Anne', 'Dagorne, Anaig', 'Malou, Mohamed', 'Le Calloch, Ronan', 'Luycx, Odile', 'Thepot, Sylvain', 'Hunault, Mathilde', 'Guillerm, Gaelle', 'Berthou, Christian', 'Ugo, Valerie', 'Lippert, Eric', 'Ianotto, Jean-Christophe']","['Mollard LM', 'Chauveau A', 'Boyer-Perrard F', 'Douet-Guilbert N', 'Houot R', 'Quintin-Roue I', 'Couturier MA', 'Dagorne A', 'Malou M', 'Le Calloch R', 'Luycx O', 'Thepot S', 'Hunault M', 'Guillerm G', 'Berthou C', 'Ugo V', 'Lippert E', 'Ianotto JC']","[""a Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Institut de Cancero-Hematologie, CHRU de Brest , Brest , France."", ""b Laboratoire d'Hematologie, CHRU de Brest , Brest , France."", ""c Service des Maladies du Sang, CHU d'Angers , Brest , France."", 'd Laboratoire de Cytogenetique, CHRU de Brest , Brest , France.', ""e Laboratoire d'Anatomo-Pathologie, CHRU Brest , Brest , France."", ""f Service d'Hematologie Clinique, CHU de Rennes , Brest , France."", ""g Service d'Hematologie Clinique, CH de Saint-Brieuc , Brest , France."", ""h Service d'Hematologie Clinique, CH de Morlaix , Brest , France."", 'i Service de Medecine Interne, CH de Quimper , Brest , France.', ""j Service d'Hematologie, CH de Lorient , Brest , France."", ""k Laboratoire d'Hematologie, CHU d'Angers , Brest , France."", ""c Service des Maladies du Sang, CHU d'Angers , Brest , France."", ""c Service des Maladies du Sang, CHU d'Angers , Brest , France."", ""a Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Institut de Cancero-Hematologie, CHRU de Brest , Brest , France."", ""a Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Institut de Cancero-Hematologie, CHRU de Brest , Brest , France."", 'i Service de Medecine Interne, CH de Quimper , Brest , France.', ""b Laboratoire d'Hematologie, CHRU de Brest , Brest , France."", ""a Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Institut de Cancero-Hematologie, CHRU de Brest , Brest , France.""]",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Observational Study']",20180404,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,['M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/*therapeutic use', 'Blast Crisis/mortality/*therapy', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Palliative Care/methods', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Myeloproliferative neoplasms', '*allogeneic stem cell transplantation', '*blastic phase', '*hypomethylating agents']",2018/04/05 06:00,2019/06/25 06:00,['2018/04/05 06:00'],"['2018/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/25 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2018.1441408 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2018 Dec;59(12):2812-2820. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2018.1441408.

Their epidemiology was studied in patients at the General Hospital of Douala (GHD) and the Yaounde Central Hospital (CHY) from 2004 through 2014. The variables we studied were social and demographic (age, sex, occupation, marital status), clinical (reasons for consultation, clinical signs, year of diagnosis), and biological (blood count, myelogram and blood smear, immunophenotyping, biopsy, and cytogenetics). In all, 4409 files were reviewed and 454 cases identified, documented and confirmed (248 in GHD and 206 in CHY). The prevalence of malignant blood diseases was 10.4%. The patients' mean age was 44.3 +/- 19 [range : 1-80] years and the M/F sex ratio 1.4/1. In 32.2% of the cases, the patient consulted because of a tumor. The most frequent malignant blood diseases, in decreasing order, were non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (31.1%), chronic myeloid leukemia (21.4%), chronic lymphoid leukemia (12.6%), multiple myeloma (11.2%), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (7.4%), and acute myeloblastic leukemia (6.4%). Their incidence by age group showed that acute lymphoblastic leukemia was most common among children (20%), and chronic myeloid leukemia among young adults (28.9%). The main hemogram abnormalities were anemia (73.7%), hyperleukocytosis (57.3%), and thrombopenia (39.2%). Various types of malignant blood diseases thus exist in the hospital environment in Cameroon, and their forms are underdiagnosed.","['Moueleu Ngalagou, P T', 'Ngouadjeu Dongho Tsakeu, E', 'Ngo Sack, F', 'Eboumbou Moukoko, E C', 'Konn Jolly, Y', 'Luma, H']","['Moueleu Ngalagou PT', 'Ngouadjeu Dongho Tsakeu E', 'Ngo Sack F', 'Eboumbou Moukoko EC', 'Konn Jolly Y', 'Luma H']","['Unite de physiologie et de medecine de sport, Faculte des sciences, Universite de Douala, Cameroun, Institut universitaire du Golfe de Guinee.', 'Service medecine interne, Hopital general de Douala, Cameroun, Departement des sciences biologiques, Faculte de medecine et des sciences pharmaceutiques, Universite de Douala, Cameroun.', ""Departement des sciences biologiques, Faculte de medecine et des sciences pharmaceutiques, Universite de Douala, Cameroun, Service d'hematologie et d'oncologie medicale, Hopital central de Yaounde, Cameroun."", 'Departement des sciences biologiques, Faculte de medecine et des sciences pharmaceutiques, Universite de Douala, Cameroun.', 'Departement des sciences biologiques, Faculte de medecine et des sciences pharmaceutiques, Universite de Douala, Cameroun.', 'Service medecine interne, Hopital general de Douala, Cameroun.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,France,Med Sante Trop,Medecine et sante tropicales,101581406,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cameroon/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Hospitals', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['Cameroon', 'epidemiology', 'malignant blood diseases']",2018/04/05 06:00,2018/12/12 06:00,['2018/04/05 06:00'],"['2018/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [medline]']","['mst.2018.0759 [pii]', '10.1684/mst.2018.0759 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Sante Trop. 2018 Feb 1;28(1):61-66. doi: 10.1684/mst.2018.0759.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Epidemiologie des hemopathies malignes recensees en milieu hospitalier au Cameroun.,,,

Presepsin is also known as soluble CD14 subtype; it is a glycoprotein fragment derived from monocytes and macrophages. We aimed to evaluate the significance of presepsin and other biomarkers for diagnosis of bacteremia in children with HEM. Sixty pediatric patients with different HEM (acute lymphoblastic leukemia 36, acute myeloid leukemia 12, non-Hodgkin lymphoma 10, and Hodgkin disease 2). Thirty age and sex-matched healthy children serving as control were enrolled in this study. Estimation of presepsin, procalcitonin (PCT), and C-reactive protein (CRP) during episode of FN in addition to absolute neutrophils count (ANC) and blood culture was performed for all the participants. Presepsin levels were higher in the patients than in control with a higher increments in the positive blood cultures than the sterile cases. Presepsin concentration was significantly higher in bacteremia than clinically proved infection and fever of unknown origin. A statistically significant positive correlation between presepsin and CRP plus PCT levels but negative correlation with ANC were observed in the patients subgroups. Presepsin is a useful marker for detection of bacteremia with sensitivity and specificity (100 and 85.7%). This finding supported that presepsin was superior to PCT and CRP in identifying bacterial infection in FN.","['Baraka, Ahmad', 'Zakaria, Marwa']","['Baraka A', 'Zakaria M']","['Department of Clinical Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University, Zagazig, Egypt. barakalab@yahoo.com.', 'Department of Pediatric, Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University, Zagazig, Egypt.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9949-4124'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180403,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (presepsin protein, human)', '9007-12-9 (Calcitonin)', '9007-41-4 (C-Reactive Protein)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bacteremia/*diagnosis/*etiology', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'C-Reactive Protein', 'Calcitonin/blood', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Febrile Neutropenia/*etiology', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications', 'Humans', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/*blood', 'Male', 'Peptide Fragments/*blood', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",['NOTNLM'],"['CRP', 'Febrile neutropenia', 'Hematological malignancies (HEM)', 'PCT', 'Presepsin']",2018/04/05 06:00,2018/09/07 06:00,['2018/04/05 06:00'],"['2017/10/24 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/03/22 00:00 [revised]', '2018/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/07 06:00 [medline]', '2018/04/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-018-2447-x [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-018-2447-x [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2018 Aug;108(2):184-191. doi: 10.1007/s12185-018-2447-x.
