Clinico-pathological and treatment data of 108 children with relapsed ependymoma in the United Kingdom (UK) treated between 1985 and 2002 were reviewed to identify prognostic factors affecting survival. The primary site was the most common site of relapse (84%). Overall 25% had metastatic relapse. Surgery at relapse was attempted in only 55%. Radiotherapy was delivered at relapse in 66% infants and 50% of older children were re-irradiated. Overall 5-year survival was 24% and 27% for children less than 3 years of age at initial diagnosis and older children, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that, for infants, surgery (p=0.01) and radiotherapy (p=0.001) at relapse were independent predictors of survival. For older children regardless of the previous radiotherapy, repeat irradiation was associated with better outcome (p=0.05). Relapse was associated with poor outcome in both age groups. A survival advantage conferred by both radiotherapy and surgery at relapse is independently significant.","['Messahel, B', 'Ashley, S', 'Saran, F', 'Ellison, D', 'Ironside, J', 'Phipps, K', 'Cox, T', 'Chong, W K', 'Robinson, K', 'Picton, S', 'Pinkerton, C R', 'Mallucci, C', 'Macarthur, D', 'Jaspan, T', 'Michalski, A', 'Grundy, R G']","['Messahel B', 'Ashley S', 'Saran F', 'Ellison D', 'Ironside J', 'Phipps K', 'Cox T', 'Chong WK', 'Robinson K', 'Picton S', 'Pinkerton CR', 'Mallucci C', 'Macarthur D', 'Jaspan T', 'Michalski A', 'Grundy RG']","['Department of Paediatrics, Royal Marsden Hospital, Sutton, Surrey, UK.']","[""Children's Cancer Leukaemia Group Brain Tumour Committee""]",['eng'],['Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090507,England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Brain Neoplasms/pathology/*therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Ependymoma/pathology/secondary/*therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/pathology/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/05/12 09:00,2009/08/12 09:00,['2009/05/12 09:00'],"['2008/11/21 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/08 00:00 [revised]', '2009/03/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/12 09:00 [medline]']","['S0959-8049(09)00216-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejca.2009.03.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 2009 Jul;45(10):1815-23. doi: 10.1016/j.ejca.2009.03.018.

To date, most of these genes' functions still remain undefined. In this study, we report an unknown cytokine receptor like molecule (p48.2) that is frequently deleted in patients with type-1 and type-2 NF1 microdeletions in the neurofibromin locus. The cloned gene has 1317 base pair long that encodes a 438aa intracellular protein. The gene was subsequently named p48.2 based on its predicted molecular weight. A typical fibronectin type III (FNIII) domain was identified in p48.2 between Arg(176) and Pro(261) in which a palindromic Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) repeat plus a putative Trp-Ser-X-Trp-Ser (WSXWS) motif were found at the domain's C-terminus. p48.2 mRNAs were abundant in many tumor cell lines and normal human tissues and up-regulated in some freshly isolated lung cancer and leukemia cells. Interestingly, over-expression of p48.2 in human embryo kidney 293T cells could significantly cause G0/G1 arrest and prevented S phase entry. In contrast, repressing endogenous p48.2 gene expression by specific siRNA markedly reduced G0/G1 population. Importantly, over-expression of p48.2 could significantly up-regulate rather than down-regulate cyclin D1 and cyclin D3 expressions. We further showed that the induction of cyclin D1 expression was directly due to the activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3), but was independent of RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase (RAS/MAPK) signaling pathway. Thus, p48.2 may represent a novel type of intracellular protein functioning as a negative regulator at the G0/G1 phase.","['Yang, Fan', 'Xu, Yu-Ping', 'Li, Jian', 'Duan, Su-Su', 'Fu, Ying-Jie', 'Zhang, Yun', 'Zhao, Yan', 'Qiao, Wen-Tao', 'Chen, Qi-Min', 'Geng, Yun-Qi', 'Che, Chang-Yan', 'Cao, Ying-Li', 'Wang, Ying', 'Zhang, Lei', 'Long, Lin', 'He, Jie', 'Cui, Quan-Cai', 'Chen, Shu-Chang', 'Wang, Shu-Hui', 'Liu, Li']","['Yang F', 'Xu YP', 'Li J', 'Duan SS', 'Fu YJ', 'Zhang Y', 'Zhao Y', 'Qiao WT', 'Chen QM', 'Geng YQ', 'Che CY', 'Cao YL', 'Wang Y', 'Zhang L', 'Long L', 'He J', 'Cui QC', 'Chen SC', 'Wang SH', 'Liu L']","['Department of Microbiology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing 100005, China.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090507,Netherlands,Int J Biochem Cell Biol,The international journal of biochemistry & cell biology,9508482,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', '*Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Computational Biology', 'Cyclin D1/genetics/metabolism', 'Cyclin D3/genetics/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'G1 Phase', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genome, Human/genetics', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Space/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Receptors, Cytokine/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Resting Phase, Cell Cycle', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Signal Transduction']",2009/05/12 09:00,2010/01/14 06:00,['2009/05/12 09:00'],"['2007/10/09 00:00 [received]', '2009/04/22 00:00 [revised]', '2009/04/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S1357-2725(09)00155-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.biocel.2009.04.022 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Biochem Cell Biol. 2009 Nov;41(11):2240-50. doi: 10.1016/j.biocel.2009.04.022.

WT1 offers the possibility to analyze those cases without currently known underlying genetic abnormalities. To compare the value of chimeric specific quantitative PCR with WT1 PCR in CBF acute leukemia, 445 samples from 96 AML (49 AML1-ETO+ and 47 CBFB-MYH11+) cases were included in the study. For each sample AML1-ETO or CBFB-MYH11 levels obtained using the conditions of the BIOMED group were compared with the results of WT1 levels using sensitive primers and conditions. Simultaneously, normal range expression of WT1 was established using RNA obtained from eight healthy donors. WT1 mutations were also investigated both at RNA and at the genomic level. The majority of CBF samples showed rises in WT1 levels (88.7%) at diagnosis. However, 18% of AML1-ETO showed WT1 levels below 250 copies in contrast with 5% CBFB-MYH11 cases. WT1 mutation was not detected in any case (70 diagnostic samples). We found correlation between WT1 levels at diagnosis and the CD34 blast population estimated by flow cytometry in CBFB-MYH11+ cases. We found no association between WT1 levels and clinical outcome. There was a high concordance between chimeric transcript analysis and WT1 levels in CR patients. Concordance was also high in relapsed patients (78% in AML1-ETO and 98% in CBFB-MYH11+ cases). Both WT1 and specific chimeric transcript identified and rescued false negative results of the other test. Additional studies are needed to determine whether the rare discrepancies are a reflection of the cooperative nature of WT1 overexpression or a consequence of the uneven distribution in the leukemic population. WT1 is a powerful MRD tool even in cases with currently available molecular targets.","['Lasa, Adriana', 'Carricondo, Maite', 'Estivill, Camino', 'Bussaglia, Elena', 'Gich, Ignasi', 'Brunet, Salut', 'Aventin, Anna', 'Sierra, Jorge', 'Nomdedeu, Josep F']","['Lasa A', 'Carricondo M', 'Estivill C', 'Bussaglia E', 'Gich I', 'Brunet S', 'Aventin A', 'Sierra J', 'Nomdedeu JF']","['Laboratori dHematologia, Hospital de la Santa Creu I Sant Pau, Avda Sant Antoni M.

The disease is caused by mutation in genes encoding proteins required for the Fanconi anemia pathway, a response mechanism to replicative stress, including that caused by genotoxins that cause DNA interstrand crosslinks. Defects in the Fanconi anemia pathway lead to genomic instability and apoptosis of proliferating cells. To date, 13 complementation groups of Fanconi anemia were identified. Five of these genes have been deleted or mutated in the mouse, as well as a sixth key regulatory gene, to create mouse models of Fanconi anemia. This review summarizes the phenotype of each of the Fanconi anemia mouse models and highlights how genetic and interventional studies using the strains have yielded novel insight into therapeutic strategies for Fanconi anemia and into how the Fanconi anemia pathway protects against genomic instability.","['Parmar, Kalindi', ""D'Andrea, Alan"", 'Niedernhofer, Laura J']","['Parmar K', ""D'Andrea A"", 'Niedernhofer LJ']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, 44 Binney Street, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",,['eng'],"['U19 AI067751-040001/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'U19AI067751/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'U19 AI067751/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES016114-03/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES016114/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20090410,Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,IM,"['Animals', 'DNA Repair', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Fanconi Anemia/*genetics', 'Genomic Instability', 'Mice/*genetics', 'Mice, Mutant Strains']",2009/05/12 09:00,2009/09/30 06:00,['2009/05/12 09:00'],"['2009/01/30 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/18 00:00 [revised]', '2009/03/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S0027-5107(09)00117-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2009.03.015 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 2009 Jul 31;668(1-2):133-40. doi: 10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2009.03.015.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Various bortezomib-resistant lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia lines were established by repeated cycles of bortezomib selection. Mutations were detected by sequencing the complementary DNA of the PSMB5 gene. Mutated clones were selected by limited dilution and cultured without bortezomib. Messenger RNA expression levels of PSMB5 in these mutated clones were measured by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The degree of resistance was determined by cytotoxicity at various bortezomib concentrations. The chymotrypsin-like activities were assayed by measuring the release of the fluorescent 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin from the substrate N-succinyl-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin. RESULTS: In addition to the previously reported PSMB5 G322A mutant (Ala49Thr), a C323T mutant (Ala49Val), and G322A, C326T conjoined mutant (Ala49Thr and Ala50Val) were selected and clones containing these mutations (JurkatB-G322A, JurkatB-C323T, and JurkatB-G322A/C326T) were obtained. After being cultured without bortezomib for >2 months, no significant difference in PSMB5 messenger RNA levels was detected between these JurkatB cells and parental Jurkat cells. JurkatB-G322A, JurkatB-C323T, and JurkatB-G322A/C326T clones displayed 22.0-fold, 39.4-fold, and 66.7-fold resistance, respectively, to bortezomib compared to Jurkat cells. There were no significant differences between the chymotrypsin-like activities of these mutants and Jurkat cells. The inhibitory effect of bortezomib on chymotrypsin-like activity was the weakest in JurkatB-G322A/C326T cells, and the strongest in JurkatB-G322A cells, with JurkatB-C323T cells falling in between. CONCLUSION: Mutations of the PSMB5 gene resulting in substitutions of Ala49 and Ala50 of PSMB5 protein can confer varying bortezomib resistance.","['Lu, Shuqing', 'Yang, Jianmin', 'Chen, Zhilong', 'Gong, Shenglan', 'Zhou, Hong', 'Xu, Xiaoqian', 'Wang, Jianmin']","['Lu S', 'Yang J', 'Chen Z', 'Gong S', 'Zhou H', 'Xu X', 'Wang J']","['Department of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090506,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Boronic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'DNA Primers', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics/pathology', '*Mutation', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/*genetics', 'Pyrazines/*pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2009/05/12 09:00,2009/07/15 09:00,['2009/05/12 09:00'],"['2009/01/04 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/16 00:00 [revised]', '2009/04/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/15 09:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(09)00128-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2009.04.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2009 Jul;37(7):831-7. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2009.04.001.

We examined the capacity of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) to regulate leukocyte responses to bacterial chemotactic peptide N-formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLF), which is recognized by a human G protein-coupled receptor FPR on phagocytic leukocytes. Pretreatment of human monocytic cells or FPR-transfected rat basophilic leukemia cells (ETFR cells) with EGCG significantly inhibited fMLF-induced chemotaxis. Intraperitoneal administration of EGCG in mice suppressed fMLF-induced leukocyte infiltration into the air pouch created in the skin. Mechanistic studies revealed that EGCG dose-dependently suppressed fMLF-induced calcium flux in monocytic cells and ETFR cells. fMLF-induced ETFR cell migration was significantly inhibited by a specific MEK1/2 inhibitor, PD98059, which was associated with reduction in fMLF-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation. These results suggest that EGCG inhibits FPR-mediated leukocyte activation thus is a promising anti-inflammatory compound.","['Zhu, Jingjing', 'Wang, Oumei', 'Ruan, Lingfei', 'Hou, Xinwei', 'Cui, Youhong', 'Wang, Ji Ming', 'Le, Yingying']","['Zhu J', 'Wang O', 'Ruan L', 'Hou X', 'Cui Y', 'Wang JM', 'Le Y']","['Institute for Nutritional Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, China.']",,['eng'],['Z01 BC010725/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090506,Netherlands,Int Immunopharmacol,International immunopharmacology,100965259,IM,"['Animals', 'Antioxidants/*pharmacology', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Camellia sinensis/immunology', 'Catechin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/drug effects/immunology', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Inflammation', 'Injections, Intraperitoneal', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/blood/drug therapy/immunology', 'Mice', 'Monocytes/drug effects/immunology/*metabolism', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/immunology/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Formyl Peptide/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/immunology', 'Transfection', 'Transgenes']",2009/05/12 09:00,2010/01/15 06:00,['2009/05/12 09:00'],"['2009/04/10 00:00 [received]', '2009/04/28 00:00 [revised]', '2009/05/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S1567-5769(09)00167-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.intimp.2009.05.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Int Immunopharmacol. 2009 Aug;9(9):1126-30. doi: 10.1016/j.intimp.2009.05.002.

Although dietary flavonoid morin has been known to suppress mast cell activation, its in vivo anti-allergic activity and the underlying mechanisms remain are largely unknown. In this study, we determine whether morin suppresses IgE-mediated allergic responses in an animal model and its mechanism of action. Morin suppressed IgE-mediated PCA in mice (ED50 23.9 mg/kg) and inhibited degranulation and production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin (IL)-4 in antigen (Ag)-stimulated mast cells. The mechanism of action was a follows. Morin inhibited the activating phosphorylation of spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and linker for activation of T cells (LAT) in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL)-2H3 cells and bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs). Akt and the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, p38, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) were inhibited as well. In vitro kinase assay indicated that Fyn kinase, not Lyn and Syk, was inhibited by morin in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 5.7 microM).

To gain an understanding of the interspecies differences in the metabolism of meisoindigo, the relevant metabolism studies were carried out for the first time in rat, pig and human liver microsomes of different genders by ultra fast liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (UFLC-MS/MS). The qualitative metabolite identification was accomplished by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) in combination with Enhanced Product Ion (EPI). The semi-quantitative metabolic stability and metabolite formation were simultaneously measured by MRM. The in vitro metabolic pathways of meisoindigo in three species were proposed as 3,3' double bond reduction, followed by N-demethylation, and reduction followed by phenyl mono-oxidation. Two novel metabolic pathways involving direct phenyl mono-oxidation without reduction in the three species, and direct N-demethylation without reduction in only pig and human, were also proposed. It may be noted that the two metabolites formed after reduction followed by phenyl mono-oxidation at positions 4, 5, 6 or 7, as well as one metabolite formed from direct phenyl mono-oxidation at either of the two phenyl rings without reduction were found to be uniquely present in human. The in vitro t(1/2) and in vitro CL(int) values of meisoindigo were calculated. Statistical analysis showed there were no significant differences in the metabolic stability profiles of meisoindigo among three species, and gender effect on the metabolic stability of meisoindigo was negligible. Formation profiles of the most significant reductive metabolites were obtained in the three species.","['Huang, Meng', 'Ho, Paul C']","['Huang M', 'Ho PC']","['Department of Pharmacy, Faculty of Science, National University of Singapore, 117543, Singapore.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090129,England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Indoles/chemistry/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Microsomes, Liver/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Molecular Structure', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Species Specificity', 'Swine', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",2009/05/12 09:00,2009/06/03 09:00,['2009/05/12 09:00'],"['2008/12/29 00:00 [received]', '2009/01/20 00:00 [revised]', '2009/01/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/03 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-2952(09)00046-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2009.01.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2009 Apr 15;77(8):1418-28. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2009.01.012.

This was in contradistinction to the major modality of antifolate resistance of impaired drug transport in leukemia cells exposed to methotrexate. To identify the genes associated with methotrexate and 7-hydroxymethotrexate resistance, we herein explored the patterns of genome-wide expression profiles in these antifolte-resistant leukemia sublines. mRNA levels of the reduced folate carrier, the primary influx transporter of folates and antifolates, were down-regulated more than two-fold in methotrexate-resistant cells. The dramatic loss of FPGS activity in 7-hydroxymethotrexate-resistant cells was associated with alterations in the expression of various genes aimed at preserving reduced folates and/or enhancing purine nucleotide biosynthesis, e.g. methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase, glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase, adenosine deaminase, cystathionine beta synthase, as well as the ATP-dependent folate exporters BCRP/ABCG2 and MRP1/ABCC1. The observed changes in gene expression were generally not paralleled by acquired DNA copy numbers alterations, suggesting transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. Interestingly, gene expression of DNA/RNA metabolism and transport genes were more profoundly altered in methotrexate-resistant subline, whereas in 7-hydroxymethotrexate-resistant cells, the most profoundly affected groups of genes were those encoding for proteins involved in metabolism and cellular proliferation. Thus, the present investigation provides evidence that 7-hydroxymethotrexate induces gene expression alterations and an antifolate resistance modality that are distinct from its parent drug methotrexate.","['Fotoohi, Alan Kambiz', 'Assaraf, Yehuda G', 'Moshfegh, Ali', 'Hashemi, Jamileh', 'Jansen, Gerrit', 'Peters, Godefridus J', 'Larsson, Catharina', 'Albertioni, Freidoun']","['Fotoohi AK', 'Assaraf YG', 'Moshfegh A', 'Hashemi J', 'Jansen G', 'Peters GJ', 'Larsson C', 'Albertioni F']","['Department of Oncology and Pathology, Karolinska Institutet, Cancer Center Karolinska, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090119,England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/blood/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects/genetics', 'Folic Acid/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Methotrexate/*analogs & derivatives/blood/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Nucleotides/*biosynthesis', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*drug therapy', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/metabolism']",2009/05/12 09:00,2009/06/03 09:00,['2009/05/12 09:00'],"['2008/11/20 00:00 [received]', '2008/12/30 00:00 [revised]', '2008/12/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/03 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-2952(09)00004-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2008.12.026 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2009 Apr 15;77(8):1410-7. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2008.12.026.

(PP) is a popular folk medicine used for treating cancer, leukemia, hepatitis, rheumatism and other diseases. In this study, our objectives were to examine the total flavonoid and phenol content of different PP extracts (aqueous: HWEPP; ethanolic: EEPP; supercritical carbon dioxide: SCEPP-0, SCEPP-4 and SCEPP-5) and their antiproliferative effects in human lung cancer H661 cells. Among all the extracts tested, results showed that SCEPP-5 possessed the highest total flavonoid (226.19 +/- 4.15 mg/g) and phenol (100.82 +/- 6.25 mg/g) contents. SCEPP-5 also demonstrated the most potent inhibitory effect on H661 cell proliferation. Using DNA ladder and flow cytometry analysis, SCEPP-5 effectively induced H661 cell apoptosis as demonstrated by the accumulation of Sub-G1 peak and fragmentation of DNA. SCEPP-5 not only induced cell cycle arrest at S phase, it also up-regulated the expression of pro-apoptotic protein (Bax) and down-regulated the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP). Furthermore, the apoptotic induction in H661 cells was found to associate with an elevated p53 protein expression, cytochrome c release, caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage. Taken together, these results conclude that SCEPP-5 induced cell cycle arrest at S phase, and its apoptotic induction could be mediated through the p53-dependent pathway and modification of Bax and XIAP proteins expression. The results have also provided important pharmacological backgrounds for the potential use of PP supercritical fluid extract as products for cancer prevention.","['Wu, Shu-Jing', 'Chang, Shun-Pang', 'Lin, Doung-Liang', 'Wang, Shyh-Shyan', 'Hou, Fwu-Feuu', 'Ng, Lean-Teik']","['Wu SJ', 'Chang SP', 'Lin DL', 'Wang SS', 'Hou FF', 'Ng LT']","['Graduate Institute of Nutritional Health, Chia-Nan University of Pharmacy and Science, Tainan, Taiwan.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Food Chem Toxicol,Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association,8207483,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carbon Dioxide', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Chromatography, Supercritical Fluid', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Flavonoids/chemistry/isolation & purification', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Phenols/chemistry/isolation & purification', 'Physalis/*chemistry', 'Plant Extracts/pharmacology']",2009/05/09 09:00,2009/07/17 09:00,['2009/05/09 09:00'],"['2009/05/09 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/17 09:00 [medline]']","['S0278-6915(09)00065-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.fct.2009.01.044 [doi]']",ppublish,Food Chem Toxicol. 2009 Jun;47(6):1132-8. doi: 10.1016/j.fct.2009.01.044.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Indicators and Reagents)', '0 (Phenols)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '142M471B3J (Carbon Dioxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although principal component analysis (PCA) is a widely used feature selection algorithm in microarray analysis, its holistic mechanism prevents it from capturing the latent local data structure in the following cancer molecular pattern identification. In this study, we investigate the benefit of enforcing non-negativity constraints on principal component analysis (PCA) and propose a nonnegative principal component (NPCA) based classification algorithm in cancer molecular pattern analysis for gene expression data. This novel algorithm conducts classification by classifying meta-samples of input cancer data by support vector machines (SVM) or other classic supervised learning algorithms. The meta-samples are low-dimensional projections of original cancer samples in a purely additive meta-gene subspace generated from the NPCA-induced nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). We report strongly leading classification results from NPCA-SVM algorithm in the cancer molecular pattern identification for five benchmark gene expression datasets under 100 trials of 50% hold-out cross validations and leave one out cross validations. We demonstrate superiority of NPCA-SVM algorithm by direct comparison with seven classification algorithms: SVM, PCA-SVM, KPCA-SVM, NMF-SVM, LLE-SVM, PCA-LDA and k-NN, for the five cancer datasets in classification rates, sensitivities and specificities. Our NPCA-SVM algorithm overcomes the over-fitting problem associative with SVM-based classifications for gene expression data under a Gaussian kernel. As a more robust high-performance classifier, NPCA-SVM can be used to replace the general SVM and k-NN classifiers in cancer biomarker discovery to capture more meaningful oncogenes.","['Han, Xiaoxu']",['Han X'],"['Department of Mathematics and Bioinformatics Program, Eastern Michigan University, Ypsilanti, MI 48197, USA. xiaoxu.han@emich.edu']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Japan,Genome Inform,Genome informatics.

To examine the additional genomic alterations of ALL at relapse, we performed single nucleotide polymorphism genomic microarry (SNP-chip) analysis on 14 ALL bone marrow samples at initial diagnosis, remission and relapse. Only two cases at initial diagnosis had a normal appearing genome by SNP-chip. All 14 cases had genomic alterations at relapse; and 10 of these had additional genomic abnormalities not present at diagnosis. Deletion of either the INK4A/ARF gene (2 cases) or the NF2 gene (2 cases) at 22q12.2 was an acquired genomic change at relapse. Loss of heterozygosity with normal copy number [uniparental disomy (UPD)] was detected in 3 cases as an additional genomic change at relapse. Interestingly, several genomic alterations, especially deletions, detected at initial diagnosis, disappeared at relapse, suggesting the ALL cells at relapse were minor clones at initial diagnosis and emerged at relapse. For several cases, trisomy at initial diagnosis changed to either UPD (2 cases) or normal appearing genome (2 cases). Further, we found disruption of PTPRD gene occurring at intron 23 as an additional genomic abnormality in one case.

In about 50% of the 'core binding factor' (CBF)-AMLs, c-Kit harbors additional gain-of-function mutations, whereas the t(15;17)-positive AML-M3 (100% c-Kit positive) presents virtually no c-Kit mutations. In all c-Kit-positive AMLs, c-Kit signaling is activated. Here, we investigated the role of c-Kit in the determination of the leukemic phenotype in a model of CBF-AML and AML-M3. We studied the role of aberrant c-Kit signaling on normal and leukemic murine stem cells by RNA interference, the c-Kit-inhibitor Imatinib and a constitutively-activated c-Kit mutant in well-established stem cell assays. Effects of the AML-M3-associated PML/RARalpha and the AML-1/ETO as a model for CBF-AML on c-Kit signaling were investigated in trans-activation assays on the Kit promoter. The contribution of activated c-Kit signaling to PML/RARalpha- and AML-1/ETO-induced leukemogenesis was investigated in a murine transduction/transplantation leukemia model. We report that: i) the inhibition of c-Kit impaired the stem cell capacity of PML/RARalpha- and AML-1/ETO-positive HSC; ii) PML/RARalpha was able to activate the c-Kit promoter; iii) constitutively-activated c-Kit increased the stem cell capacity of HSC; and iv) constitutively-activated c-Kit increased the leukemogenic potential of PML/RARalpha- and AML-1/ETO-positive HSC.

Obesity, measured as body mass index, has been identified as a possible risk factor for several solid tumors as well as some adult hematopoietic malignancies. This case-control study (N = 253 cases and 270 controls), conducted at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, investigated the role of obesity and adulthood weight gain in CML risk. Cases and controls were similar with respect to smoking, alcohol consumption, and occupational solvent and ionizing radiation exposure. Cases were significantly more likely to have a history of occupational exposure to agricultural chemicals (11% cases versus 3% controls, P = 0.001). Cases were more likely to be obese during adulthood compared with controls at age 25 [odds ratios (OR) = 4.29; 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), 1.63-11.3], at age 40 (OR = 5.12; 95% CI, 1.92-13.6), and at diagnosis (OR = 3.09; 95% CI, 1.56-6.13).

Among participants > or =45 years, cases gained significantly more weight each year between ages 25 and 40 compared with controls (0.78 versus 0.44 kg/y, P < 0.001) with the association strongest among those who gained >1 kg/y between 25 and 40 years of age (OR, 3.63; 95% CI, 1.46-9.04). Our results suggest that obesity and adulthood weight gain play important roles in CML risk. Several plausible biological mechanisms have been proposed and warrant further investigation. In the future, cancer prevention interventions aimed at reducing the incidence of CML could be developed.","['Strom, Sara S', 'Yamamura, Yuko', 'Kantarijian, Hagop M', 'Cortes-Franco, Jorge E']","['Strom SS', 'Yamamura Y', 'Kantarijian HM', 'Cortes-Franco JE']","['Department of Epidemiology, The University of Texas M.

A G-C exchange at p53 codon 72 polymorphism results in a substitution of proline (Pro) for arginine (Arg) in the transactivation domain, which was shown to alter the primary structure of the p53 protein. Both polymorphisms have been implicated in cancer. To investigate whether that MDM2 SNP309 and p53 codon 72 polymorphism should be at least partially responsible for genetic susceptibility to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), both polymorphisms were determined in a case-control study consisting of 231 AML patients and 128 normal individuals. The MDM2 SNP309G allele was associated with increased risk of AML. Furthermore, the p53 codon 72 and MDM2 SNP309 polymorphisms did not associate with age of onset and any other clinical parameters studied. When the p53 and MDM2 polymorphisms were combined, no multiplicative joint effect between the MDM2 GG and p53 Pro/Pro genotypes exists in the risk of developing AML. These results suggest that the MDM2 SNP309 homozygous GG genotype may be a genetic susceptibility factor in the pathogenesis of AML.","['Xiong, Xiujuan', 'Wang, Min', 'Wang, Lin', 'Liu, Jiazhuo', 'Zhao, Xin', 'Tian, Zheng', 'Wang, Jianxiang']","['Xiong X', 'Wang M', 'Wang L', 'Liu J', 'Zhao X', 'Tian Z', 'Wang J']","[""State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, People's Republic of China.""]",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090506,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Base Sequence', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Codon', 'DNA Primers', 'Female', '*Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",2009/05/09 09:00,2009/09/04 06:00,['2009/05/09 09:00'],"['2008/12/09 00:00 [received]', '2009/04/03 00:00 [revised]', '2009/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/09 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(09)00179-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2009.04.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2009 Nov;33(11):1454-8. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2009.04.007.

The ability to predict responders may help in stratifying patients and exploring different therapeutic approaches for nonresponders. Proteomics methods were used to search for predictive factors or combinations of factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Peripheral blood plasma samples from 41 patients with confirmed acute myeloid leukemia with intermediate or poor cytogenetics were obtained prior to induction therapy for proteomic analysis. For each plasma sample, four fractions eluted from a strong anion column were applied to 3 different ProteinChip array surfaces and 12 surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization spectra were generated. Peaks that correlated with response were identified, and decision trees incorporating these peaks along with various clinical and laboratory findings were constructed to predict response. RESULTS: Multiple decision trees were constructed. One peak, when combined with age, provided strong positive prediction of responders with 83% accuracy. A second tree, which combined one peak with both cytogenetics and the percent of monocytes in peripheral blood, detected responders with 95% accuracy. A third peak was adequate to predict responders in the intermediate cytogenetic group with 86% accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Proteomic analysis should be further explored to define factors important in predicting clinical response in patients with acute myeloid leukemia.","['Albitar, Maher', 'Potts, Steven J', 'Giles, Francis J', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Jilani, Iman', 'Donahue, Amber C', 'Estey, Elihu H', 'Kantarjian, Hagop']","['Albitar M', 'Potts SJ', 'Giles FJ', ""O'Brien S"", 'Jilani I', 'Donahue AC', 'Estey EH', 'Kantarjian H']","['Quest Diagnostics Nichols Institute, San Juan Capistrano, CA 92690-6130, USA. maher.x.albitar@questdiagnostics.com']",,['eng'],['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],20090505,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', '*Proteomics', 'Reproducibility of Results']",2009/05/09 09:00,2009/07/15 09:00,['2009/05/09 09:00'],"['2008/06/28 00:00 [received]', '2009/01/27 00:00 [revised]', '2009/03/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/09 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/15 09:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(09)00129-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2009.03.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2009 Jul;37(7):784-90. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2009.03.011.

MRI demonstrated T1-weighted high-signal intensity lesions in the medial temporal lobe and thalamus, and PCR of the CSF disclosed an increase in the copy numbers of the HHV6 genome. The patient died after a clinical course of 6 months, and at autopsy the brain showed remarkable atrophy of the hippocampus. Histopathologically, neuronal loss with astrocytosis and patchy necrosis with infiltration of macrophages were found predominantly in the hippocampus, amygdala, mamillary body, claustrum, and thalamus. Perivascular and intraparenchymal lymphocytic infiltration was slight. Similar lesions were also scattered in the cerebral neocortex, midbrain, pontine base, cerebellar white matter, and lumbar cord. In some of these lesions, axons were relatively preserved in comparison with myelin sheaths. Significant increase in the copy numbers of the HHV6 genome was demonstrated in the postmortem brain tissue by PCR. Neuropathological features of the present case were similar to those described in previously reported cases, but the distribution of lesions was more widespread.

Interestingly, co-administration of dexamethasone with L-ASP seems to reduce the risk of thrombosis. OBJECTIVES: We have investigated the effect of two corticoids, dexamethasone and prednisone, on the conformational consequences of L-ASP treatment on antithrombin. PATIENTS/METHODS: Levels, activity, conformation and immunohistological features of antithrombin were studied in patients, cell and mice models. Because of the importance of the steroid receptor-heat stress response (HSR) axis, and the role of unfolded protein response (UPR) in conformational diseases, we also evaluated Hsp27, Hsp70, Hsp90, HSF-1 and ER chaperons (Grp78 and Grp94). RESULTS: In all models, L-ASP alone or in combination with prednisone caused the intracellular retention of antithrombin associated with a severe deficiency. In contrast, the combination of L-ASP with dexamethasone ameliorated both the deficiency and intracellular retention of the serpin, which is associated with increased expression of heat shock proteins and ER-chaperons. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest a protective effect of dexamethasone on the conformational consequences of L-ASP on antithrombin as a result of exacerbated HSR and UPR that help to explain the reduced risk of thrombosis reported in patients that follow this scheme of treatment.","['Hernandez-Espinosa, D', 'Minano, A', 'Ordonez, A', 'Mota, R', 'Martinez-Martinez, I', 'Vicente, V', 'Corral, J']","['Hernandez-Espinosa D', 'Minano A', 'Ordonez A', 'Mota R', 'Martinez-Martinez I', 'Vicente V', 'Corral J']","['Centro Regional de Hemodonacion, University of Murcia, Murcia, Spain.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090427,England,J Thromb Haemost,Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH,101170508,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antithrombins/*chemistry', 'Asparaginase/*therapeutic use', 'Base Sequence', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Primers', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP', 'Female', 'Heat-Shock Response/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein Conformation', 'Young Adult']",2009/05/09 09:00,2009/10/23 06:00,['2009/05/09 09:00'],"['2009/05/09 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/23 06:00 [medline]']","['JTH3449 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1538-7836.2009.03449.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Thromb Haemost. 2009 Jul;7(7):1128-33. doi: 10.1111/j.1538-7836.2009.03449.x.

The SPINK2 protein contains a typical Kazal domain composed by six cysteine residues forming three disulfide bridges. The expression of SPINK2 is closely related to cancer such as lymphomas, in that a high transcript level of SPINK2 in patients with primary cutaneous follicle center cell lymphomas have better prognosis with lower mortality. To clarify the role of SPINK2 in cancer, we performed quantitative real-time PCR and showed that the expression level of SPINK2 is significantly elevated in most leukemia cell lines except B-lymphoblast TK-6 cells. The molecular function and structural features of SPINK2 were also investigated by employing the recombinant active and mutant inactive SPINK2 proteins to determine its key P2-P2' (Pro(23)-Arg(24)-His(25)-Phe(26)) active site. The inhibition assay results demonstrated that Arg(24) at the P1 site is crucial for the specificity of SPINK2 on target enzyme. Although His(25) at the P1' and Phe(26) at the P2' residues are also involved in trypsin-SPINK2 interaction, Pro(23) at the P2 site may not be directly participated in interacting with trypsin. In addition, we determined the 3D solution structure of SPINK2 and used this structure to predict the SPINK2-proteinase complex structure and binding properties. These studies not only provide critical information about the structural properties and biophysical features of the SPINK2 proteinase inhibitor, but also suggest its important role in tumor progression and response to treatment.","['Chen, Ting', 'Lee, Tian-Ren', 'Liang, Wei-Guang', 'Chang, Wun-Shaing Wayne', 'Lyu, Ping-Chiang']","['Chen T', 'Lee TR', 'Liang WG', 'Chang WS', 'Lyu PC']","['Institute of Bioinformatics and Structural Biology, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Proteins,Proteins,8700181,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Circular Dichroism', 'Glycoproteins/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Serine Peptidase Inhibitors, Kazal Type']",2009/05/08 09:00,2009/10/30 06:00,['2009/05/08 09:00'],"['2009/05/08 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/prot.22432 [doi]'],ppublish,Proteins. 2009 Oct;77(1):209-19. doi: 10.1002/prot.22432.,"['0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (SPINK2 protein, human)', '0 (Serine Peptidase Inhibitors, Kazal Type)']",['PDB/2JXD'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study examined the effects of the MEK inhibitor on the action of DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-AzadC), another epigenetic agent in AML cells. AZD6244 significantly potentiated the ability of 5-AzadC to induce growth arrest and apoptosis of NB4, and freshly isolated AML cells. In parallel, 5-AzadC induced expression of p21(waf1) in AML cells, which was potently enhanced in the presence of AZD6244. Further studies explored the molecular mechanisms by which 5-AzadC induced expression of p21(waf1) and found that a low dose of 5-AzadC (1 microM) induced acetylation of histone H3 on the p21(waf1) gene promoter; however, higher dose of this compound (3 or 5 microM) potently induced DNA damage as assessed by expression of gammaH2AX, in NB4 cells. These effects were strikingly enhanced by concomitant blockade of MEK signaling. Furthermore, knock-down of p21(waf1) by the siRNA rescued NB4 cells from 5-AzadC-mediated growth inhibition. Taken together, combination of 5-AzadC and the MEK inhibitor may be useful for treatment of individuals with a subset of AML.","['Nishioka, Chie', 'Ikezoe, Takayuki', 'Yang, Jing', 'Komatsu, Naoki', 'Koeffler, H Phillip', 'Yokoyama, Akihito']","['Nishioka C', 'Ikezoe T', 'Yang J', 'Komatsu N', 'Koeffler HP', 'Yokoyama A']","['Department of Hematology and Respiratory Medicine, Kochi University, Japan.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Acetylation', 'Aged', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Benzimidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/*genetics', 'DNA Modification Methylases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Decitabine', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Histone Deacetylases/metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 1/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2009/05/08 09:00,2009/08/26 09:00,['2009/05/08 09:00'],"['2009/05/08 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/26 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.24377 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2009 Sep 1;125(5):1168-76. doi: 10.1002/ijc.24377.,"['0 (AZD 6244)', '0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DNA Modification Methylases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP2K1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",,,,,,,['2009 UICC.'],,,,,,,,,,

Introduction of current treatment strategies may improve the outcome for children with APL in these countries. METHODS: The diagnosis was based on the FAB classification and detection of PML-RAR alpha rearrangement. From December 1999 to September 2004, 16 eligible children were treated with an intensive in-house protocol including high-dose AraC and anthracycline. Subsequently, 14 cases were treated with a less intensive protocol modified from the PETHEMA LPA99. RESULTS: The 3.5 years event-free survival (EFS) was 37.5% (95% CI, 13.8-61.2%) for patients treated on initial protocol. The treatment failures were: six patients abandoned treatment (37.5%), two who died of intracranial hemorrhage at diagnosis (6.3%) and sepsis in remission (6.3%) respectively, and two who relapsed (12.5%). Those treated on modified PETHEMA had a 3.5 years EFS of 79.6% (95% CI, 52.9-106.3%). Treatment failures included: one who died of intracranial hemorrhage at diagnosis (7.1%) and one who relapsed (7.1%). The patients on modified PETHEMA had a significantly higher EFS (P = 0.012), lower frequency of sepsis during treatment (7.7% vs. 77.8%; P = 0.0015), and lower hospitalization cost (median US$ 4,700 vs. US$ 20,000; P < 0.0001) than those on in-house protocol. CONCLUSION: Treatment with the less intensive protocol based on the PETHEMA LPA99 study of childhood APL successfully reduced chemotherapy toxicity and lowered hospitalization costs without increasing relapses. This led to decreases in treatment-related morbidity and the treatment abandonment rate, thus improving overall outcome.","['Luo, Xue-Qun', 'Ke, Zhi-Yong', 'Huang, Li-Bin', 'Guan, Xiao-Qing', 'Zhang, Ying-Chuan', 'Zhang, Xiao-Li']","['Luo XQ', 'Ke ZY', 'Huang LB', 'Guan XQ', 'Zhang YC', 'Zhang XL']","['Department of Pediatric, The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, Zhongshan Er Lu, Guangzhou, China. l-xuequn@126.com']",,['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anthracyclines/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Health Care Costs', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/adverse effects']",2009/05/08 09:00,2009/08/01 09:00,['2009/05/08 09:00'],"['2009/05/08 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/01 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22042 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2009 Sep;53(3):325-8. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22042.,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,,,,,['Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2009 Sep;53(3):303-5.

Members of the BCL2 family of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins are regulated by GC, but to what extent these regulations contribute to GC-induced cell death and resistance development is poorly understood. Using primary lymphoblasts from ALL children during systemic GC monotherapy and related cell lines, we have previously shown that the response of the BCL2 rheostat to GC was dominated by induction of the pro-apoptotic BH3-only molecules BMF and BCL2L11/Bim, but we also observed an unexpected significant repression of the pro-apoptotic BCL2 protein PMAIP1/Noxa. Here, we report that GC represses Noxa mRNA levels and also interferes with its protein stability in a proteasome-dependent manner. Prevention of GC-mediated Noxa repression by conditional expression of transgenic Noxa changed the kinetics of GC-induced apoptosis to resemble cell death induced by BimEL alone. Hence, GC appear to activate functionally relevant pro- as well as anti-apoptotic pathways in ALL cells. Interfering with the anti-apoptotic component of the GC response might contribute to improved therapeutic approaches and circumvention of resistance to this therapy.","['Ploner, Christian', 'Rainer, Johannes', 'Lobenwein, Susanne', 'Geley, Stephan', 'Kofler, Reinhard']","['Ploner C', 'Rainer J', 'Lobenwein S', 'Geley S', 'Kofler R']","['Division Molecular Pathophysiology, Biocenter, Medical University of Innsbruck, Fritz-Pregl-Strasse 3, 6020, Innsbruck, Austria.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is present in virtually 100% of BL cases occurring in endemic areas, but in only 10-20% of sporadic cases. In EBV(-) BL cells, reactivation of p53, induced by reducing MDM2 protein level, led to apoptosis. We show here that nutlin-3, a potent antagonist of MDM2, activates the p53 pathway in all BL cell lines harboring wild-type p53, regardless of EBV status. However, nutlin-3 strongly induced apoptosis in EBV(-) or latency I EBV(+) cells, whereas latency III EBV(+) cells were much more resistant. Prior treatment with sublethal doses of nutlin-3 sensitizes EBV(-) or latency I EBV(+) cells to apoptosis induced by etoposide or melphalan, but protects latency III EBV(+) cells. p21(WAF1) which is overexpressed in the latter, is involved in this protective effect, as siRNA-mediated inhibition of p21(WAF1) restores sensitivity to etoposide. Nutlin-3 protects latency III BL cells by inducing a p21(WAF1)-mediated G1 arrest. Most BL patients with wild-type p53 tumors could therefore benefit from treatment with nutlin-3, after a careful determination of the latency pattern of EBV in infected patients.","['Renouf, B', 'Hollville, E', 'Pujals, A', 'Tetaud, C', 'Garibal, J', 'Wiels, J']","['Renouf B', 'Hollville E', 'Pujals A', 'Tetaud C', 'Garibal J', 'Wiels J']","['UMR 8126 CNRS, Univ Paris-Sud, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090507,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology/virology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/physiology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*physiology']",2009/05/08 09:00,2009/09/24 06:00,['2009/05/08 09:00'],"['2009/05/08 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/24 06:00 [medline]']","['leu200992 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.92 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Sep;23(9):1557-63. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.92.

We aimed to explore the possible role of the transcription factor STAT3 in the pathophysiology of this malignancy, as it was involved in oncogenesis and chemoresistance. For this, we established and characterized a continuous interleukin 2-dependent NK cell line (MEC04) from a patient with a fatal nasal-type NK-cell lymphoma. Cells harbored poor cytotoxic activity against K562 cells, and spontaneously secreted interferon-gamma, interleukin-10 and vascular-endothelium growth factor in vitro. STAT3 was phosphorylated in Y705 dimerization residue in MEC04 cells and restricted to the nucleus. Y705 STAT3 phosphorylation involved JAK2, as exposure of cells to AG490 inhibitor inhibited Y705 STAT3 phosphorylation. By using recombinant transducible TAT-STAT3-beta (beta isoform), TAT-STAT3Y705F (a STAT3 protein mutated on Y705 residue, which prevents STAT3 dimerization) and peptides inhibiting specifically STAT3 dimerization, we inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation and cell growth, with cell death induction. Finally, STAT3 was phosphorylated in Y705 residue in the nuclei of lymphoma cells in eight/nine patients with nasal-type NK/T-cell lymphoma and in YT, another NK cell line. Our results suggest that STAT3 protein has a major role in the oncogenic process of nasal-type NK-cell lymphomas, and may represent a promising therapeutical target.","['Coppo, P', 'Gouilleux-Gruart, V', 'Huang, Y', 'Bouhlal, H', 'Bouamar, H', 'Bouchet, S', 'Perrot, C', 'Vieillard, V', 'Dartigues, P', 'Gaulard, P', 'Agbalika, F', 'Douay, L', 'Lassoued, K', 'Gorin, N-C']","['Coppo P', 'Gouilleux-Gruart V', 'Huang Y', 'Bouhlal H', 'Bouamar H', 'Bouchet S', 'Perrot C', 'Vieillard V', 'Dartigues P', 'Gaulard P', 'Agbalika F', 'Douay L', 'Lassoued K', 'Gorin NC']","[""Service d'Hematologie et de Therapie Cellulaire, AP-HP, Hopital Saint-Antoine, Paris, France. paulcoppo@aol.com""]",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090507,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis', 'Janus Kinase 2/physiology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*etiology/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Middle Aged', 'Nose Neoplasms/*etiology/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'bcl-X Protein/physiology']",2009/05/08 09:00,2009/09/24 06:00,['2009/05/08 09:00'],"['2009/05/08 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/24 06:00 [medline]']","['leu200991 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.91 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Sep;23(9):1667-78. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.91.

Conventional radiography, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and nuclear medicine imaging are all used in an attempt to better clarify the extent of bone disease and soft tissue disease in MM. This review summarizes all available data in the literature and provides recommendations for the use of each of the technologies. Conventional radiography still remains the 'gold standard' of the staging procedure of newly diagnosed and relapsed myeloma patients. MRI gives information complementary to skeletal survey and is recommended in MM patients with normal conventional radiography and in all patients with an apparently solitary plasmacytoma of bone. Urgent MRI or CT (if MRI is not available) is the diagnostic procedure of choice to assess suspected cord compression. Bone scintigraphy has no place in the routine staging of myeloma, whereas sequential dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans are not recommended. Positron emission tomography/CT or MIBI imaging are also not recommended for routine use in the management of myeloma patients, although both techniques may be useful in selected cases that warrant clarification of previous imaging findings, but such an approach should ideally be made within the context of a clinical trial.","['Dimopoulos, M', 'Terpos, E', 'Comenzo, R L', 'Tosi, P', 'Beksac, M', 'Sezer, O', 'Siegel, D', 'Lokhorst, H', 'Kumar, S', 'Rajkumar, S V', 'Niesvizky, R', 'Moulopoulos, L A', 'Durie, B G M']","['Dimopoulos M', 'Terpos E', 'Comenzo RL', 'Tosi P', 'Beksac M', 'Sezer O', 'Siegel D', 'Lokhorst H', 'Kumar S', 'Rajkumar SV', 'Niesvizky R', 'Moulopoulos LA', 'Durie BG']","['Department of Therapeutics, Alexandra Hospital, Athens, Greece. mdimop@med.uoa.gr']",['IMWG'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20090507,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Absorptiometry, Photon', 'Bone Neoplasms/diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Multiple Myeloma/*diagnosis', 'Paraproteinemias/diagnosis', 'Plasmacytoma/diagnosis', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prognosis', 'Technetium Tc 99m Sestamibi', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",2009/05/08 09:00,2009/09/24 06:00,['2009/05/08 09:00'],"['2009/05/08 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/24 06:00 [medline]']","['leu200989 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.89 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Sep;23(9):1545-56. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.89.

We found in this study that PLK1 was aberrantly highly expressed in a variety of human leukemia cell lines (n=20), as well as, freshly isolated leukemia cells from individuals with acute myelogenous leukemia (n=50) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n=15) compared with bone marrow mononuclear cells from healthy volunteers (n=13) (acute myelogenous leukemia, P=0.016; acute lymphoblastic leukemia, P=0.008), as measured by real-time RT-PCR. Downregulation of PLK1 by a small interfering RNA in NB4 acute myelogenous leukemia cells inhibited their proliferation. GW843682X is a novel selective PLK1 inhibitor. The compound-induced growth inhibition, caused accumulation of cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle and mediated apoptosis of human leukemia cells. Pre-treatment of cells with the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK attenuated the action of GW843682X in leukemia cells, indicating the involvement of the caspase pathway in the PLK1 inhibitor-mediated apoptosis. Furthermore, we found that the PLK1 inhibitor synergistically potentiated the growth inhibition and apoptosis of leukemia cells when combined with tubulin-depolymerizing agent vincristine.

MicroRNAs (miRs) are post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression, and c-kit has been described as a target of miRs-221 and -222 in erythropoiesis. In the present study, we identified c-kit as a target of PLZF in normal and leukemic cells. Particularly, in erythropoietic (E) culture of CD34(+) progenitors, PLZF is downregulated, whereas c-kit expression at both the mRNA and protein levels inversely increases during the first days of E differentiation. In functional experiments, PLZF transfection induces c-kit downregulation, inhibits E proliferation and delays differentiation, whereas PLZF knockdown induces opposite effects, independently of miRs-221 and -222 expression. The inverse correlation between PLZF and c-kit expression was found in normal CD34(+)38(+/-) hematopoietic progenitor/stem cells and in acute myeloid leukemias of M0/M1 French-American-British subtypes, suggesting that the control of PLZF on c-kit expression may be crucial at the level of the stem cell/progenitor compartment. Altogether, our data indicate a new mechanism of regulation of c-kit expression that involves a transcriptional control by PLZF in CD34(+) cells and early erythropoiesis.","['Spinello, I', 'Quaranta, M T', 'Pasquini, L', 'Pelosi, E', 'Petrucci, E', 'Pagliuca, A', 'Castelli, G', 'Mariani, G', 'Diverio, D', 'Foa, R', 'Testa, U', 'Labbaye, C']","['Spinello I', 'Quaranta MT', 'Pasquini L', 'Pelosi E', 'Petrucci E', 'Pagliuca A', 'Castelli G', 'Mariani G', 'Diverio D', 'Foa R', 'Testa U', 'Labbaye C']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Molecular Medicine, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090504,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD34/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', '*Erythropoiesis', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Luciferases/genetics/metabolism', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/metabolism', 'Microscopy, Phase-Contrast', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transfection']",2009/05/08 09:00,2009/07/09 09:00,['2009/05/08 09:00'],"['2009/05/08 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/09 09:00 [medline]']","['onc200987 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2009.87 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2009 Jun 11;28(23):2276-88. doi: 10.1038/onc.2009.87.

These disorders can be broadly characterized into Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph(+)) or negative (Ph(-)) genetic groupings. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a Ph(+) MPD that is defined on the basis of its molecular lesion, the BCR-ABL fusion gene. Inhibitors directed at the constitutive kinase activity of BCR-ABL have been shown to be disease modifying in CML and have dramatically altered the standard of care for this leukemia. The three main Ph(-) MPDs are polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). The key features of these Ph(-) MPDs are an increased red blood cell mass in PV, a high platelet count in ET and bone marrow fibrosis in PMF, respectively. These disorders also share many clinical features such as long clinical course, increased risk for thrombosis, hemorrhage and elevated risk of leukemic transformation. Interest in these disorders has been ignited by the recent discovery of activating mutations in the tyrosine kinase gene, JAK2, in the predominance of Ph(-) MPD patients and has highlighted JAK2 as a therapeutic intervention point for drug discovery efforts with selective kinase inhibitors. This review will focus on the comparison of Ph(+) and Ph(-) MPDs, drug discovery and development efforts targeting these disorders, and will assess the new opportunities for targeted therapies for these diseases.","['Kumar, C', 'Purandare, A V', 'Lee, F Y', 'Lorenzi, M V']","['Kumar C', 'Purandare AV', 'Lee FY', 'Lorenzi MV']","['SmartAnalyst, New York, NY, USA.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20090504,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Carbazoles/chemistry/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Chronic Disease', 'Drug Discovery/*methods/trends', 'Furans', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Molecular Structure', 'Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",2009/05/08 09:00,2009/09/17 06:00,['2009/05/08 09:00'],"['2009/05/08 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/17 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2009107 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2009.107 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2009 Jun 18;28(24):2305-13. doi: 10.1038/onc.2009.107.

Its quantity is not only regulated through transcriptional control but also through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, accompanied by phosphorylation, although the mechanisms are poorly understood. In this report, we tried to identify an E3 ubiquitin ligase, which targets c-Myb for ubiquitin-dependent degradation. We found that an F-box protein, Fbw7, interacted with c-Myb, which is mutated in numerous cancers. Fbw7 facilitated ubiquitylation and degradation of c-Myb in intact cells. Moreover, depletion of Fbw7 by RNA interference delayed turnover and increased the abundance of c-Myb in myeloid leukemia cells concomitantly, and suppressed the transcriptional level of gamma-globin, which receives transcriptional repression from c-Myb. In addition, we analysed sites required for both ubiquitylation and degradation of c-Myb. We found that Thr-572 is critical for Fbw7-mediated ubiquitylation in mouse c-Myb using site-directed mutagenesis. Fbw7 recognized the phosphorylation of Thr-572, which was mediated by glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3). In consequence, the c-Myb protein was markedly stabilized by the substitution of Thr-572 to Ala. These observations suggest that SCF(Fbw7) ubiquitin ligase regulates phosphorylation-dependent degradation of c-Myb protein.","['Kitagawa, K', 'Hiramatsu, Y', 'Uchida, C', 'Isobe, T', 'Hattori, T', 'Oda, T', 'Shibata, K', 'Nakamura, S', 'Kikuchi, A', 'Kitagawa, M']","['Kitagawa K', 'Hiramatsu Y', 'Uchida C', 'Isobe T', 'Hattori T', 'Oda T', 'Shibata K', 'Nakamura S', 'Kikuchi A', 'Kitagawa M']","['Department of Biochemistry 1, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Higashi-ku, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka, Japan. kitamasa@hama-med.ac.jp']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090504,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'F-Box Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Threonine/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitination']",2009/05/08 09:00,2009/07/16 09:00,['2009/05/08 09:00'],"['2009/05/08 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/16 09:00 [medline]']","['onc2009111 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2009.111 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2009 Jun 25;28(25):2393-405. doi: 10.1038/onc.2009.111.

In the present study, fourteen benzylidenecyclopentanone analogues of curcumin were studied for their effects on histamine release from rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells. After screening, four selected compounds: 2,5-bis(4-hydroxybenzylidene)cyclopentanone; 2,5-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzylidene)cyclopentanone; 2,5-bis(4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethylbenzylidene) cyclopentanone; and 2,5-bis(4-hydroxy-3,5-diethylbenzylidene)cyclopentanone were studied for their concentration-dependent effects on histamine release and Ca(2+) uptake. In RBL-2H3 cells and rat peritoneal mast cells stimulated with antigen or compound 48/80, respectively, the methoxy-hydroxy analogue was more potent than curcumin in inhibiting histamine release. In contrast, the inhibitory effects of methyl/ethyl analogues were less potent than those of curcumin. Moreover, these compounds abrogated histamine release induced by increased intracellular Ca(2+) concentrations in response to stimulants such as thapsigargin and ionomycin. These compounds also showed potent inhibitory effects on (45)Ca(2+) uptake in RBL-2H3 cells. The mechanism of the inhibitory effects of these curcumin analogues on histamine release appeared to be related to blockade of Ca(2+) signaling events. These results provide useful information to guide the development of new synthetic compounds for the treatment of allergic and inflammatory diseases related to histamine or mast cells.","['Nugroho, Agung Endro', 'Ikawati, Zullies', 'Sardjiman', 'Maeyama, Kazutaka']","['Nugroho AE', 'Ikawati Z', 'Sardjiman', 'Maeyama K']","['Department of Pharmacology, Informational Biomedicine, Ehime University Graduate School of Medicine, Toon, Ehime, Japan.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Japan,Biol Pharm Bull,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,9311984,IM,"['Animals', 'Benzylidene Compounds/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Curcumin/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Cyclopentanes/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Histamine Release/*drug effects', 'Mast Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Molecular Structure', 'Rats']",2009/05/08 09:00,2009/07/10 09:00,['2009/05/08 09:00'],"['2009/05/08 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/10 09:00 [medline]']","['JST.JSTAGE/bpb/32.842 [pii]', '10.1248/bpb.32.842 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Pharm Bull. 2009 May;32(5):842-9. doi: 10.1248/bpb.32.842.,"['0 (Benzylidene Compounds)', '0 (Cyclopentanes)', '220W81TN3S (cyclopentanone)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The inhibitors of protein kinase C (PKC) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), but not of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K), inhibited the HL-60 differentiation induced by the extract in combination with ATRA or 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3), signifying that PKC and ERK were involved in the cell differentiation enhancement by the extract.

Based on the recent identification of TET2 mutations, we evaluated the mutational status of TET1, TET2, and TET3 in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Sequencing of TET2 in 408 paired tumor/normal samples distinguished between 68 somatic mutations and 6 novel single nucleotide polymorphisms and identified TET2 mutations in MPN (27 of 354, 7.6%), CMML (29 of 69, 42%), AML (11 of 91, 12%), and M7 AML (1 of 28, 3.6%) samples. We did not identify somatic TET1 or TET3 mutations or TET2 promoter hypermethylation in MPNs. TET2 mutations did not cluster in genetically defined MPN, CMML, or AML subsets but were associated with decreased overall survival in AML (P = .029). These data indicate that TET2 mutations are observed in different myeloid malignancies and may be important in AML prognosis.","['Abdel-Wahab, Omar', 'Mullally, Ann', 'Hedvat, Cyrus', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Patel, Jay', 'Wadleigh, Martha', 'Malinge, Sebastien', 'Yao, JinJuan', 'Kilpivaara, Outi', 'Bhat, Rukhmi', 'Huberman, Kety', 'Thomas, Sabrena', 'Dolgalev, Igor', 'Heguy, Adriana', 'Paietta, Elisabeth', 'Le Beau, Michelle M', 'Beran, Miloslav', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'Ebert, Benjamin L', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Stone, Richard M', 'Gilliland, D Gary', 'Crispino, John D', 'Levine, Ross L']","['Abdel-Wahab O', 'Mullally A', 'Hedvat C', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Patel J', 'Wadleigh M', 'Malinge S', 'Yao J', 'Kilpivaara O', 'Bhat R', 'Huberman K', 'Thomas S', 'Dolgalev I', 'Heguy A', 'Paietta E', 'Le Beau MM', 'Beran M', 'Tallman MS', 'Ebert BL', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Stone RM', 'Gilliland DG', 'Crispino JD', 'Levine RL']","['Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.']",,['eng'],"['K08 HL082677/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA021115/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HHMI/Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States', 'R01 CA101774/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL082677/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA10863101/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA101774-07/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA114737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090506,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Codon, Nonsense', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Dioxygenases', 'Exons', 'Frameshift Mutation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*genetics', 'Mixed Function Oxygenases', '*Mutation', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Survival Rate']",2009/05/08 09:00,2009/07/25 09:00,['2009/05/08 09:00'],"['2009/05/08 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/25 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)37146-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-03-210039 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Jul 2;114(1):144-7. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-03-210039.

Current immunosuppressive regimens with glucocorticoids and calcineurin inhibitors produce excellent patient and graft survival rates. This has resulted in both increases in transplant numbers and an increased recognition of previously neglected long-term complications of transplantation such as fractures and osteoporosis. Both pretransplantation bone disease and immunosuppressive therapy result in rapid bone loss and increased fracture rates. Patients are particularly at risk early after transplantation. The bone health of candidates for organ transplantation should be assessed with bone densitometry of the hip and spine. Spinal x-rays should be performed to diagnose prevalent fractures. Any secondary causes of osteoporosis should be identified and treated. Vitamin D deficiency should be corrected with vitamin D doses selected to achieve a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration of at least 20 ng/ml. All patients should receive calcium. Patients with kidney failure should be evaluated and treated for chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder, including renal osteodystrophy. Secondary hyperparathyroidism, in particular, should be treated. Treatment is indicated in the immediate posttransplantation period irrespective of bone mineral density because further rapid bone loss will occur in the first several months after transplantation. Long-term organ transplant recipients should also have bone mass measurement and treatment of osteoporosis. Oral and iv bisphosphonates are the most promising approach for the management of transplantation osteoporosis. Active vitamin D metabolites may have additional benefits in reducing hyperparathyroidism, particularly after kidney transplantation.","['Ebeling, Peter R']",['Ebeling PR'],"['Department of Medicine (Royal Melbourne Hospital/Western Hospital) and Endocrinology, The University of Melbourne, Western Hospital, Gordon Street, Footscray 3011, Victoria, Australia. peterre@unimelb.edu.au']",,['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,0375362,IM,"['Absorptiometry, Photon', 'Adult', 'Bone Density', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/therapy', 'Heart Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Kidney Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/therapy', 'Liver Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Lung Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Osteoporosis/diagnosis/etiology/prevention & control/*therapy', 'Transplantation/*adverse effects']",2009/05/08 09:00,2009/05/29 09:00,['2009/05/08 09:00'],"['2009/05/08 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/29 09:00 [medline]']","['94/5/1483 [pii]', '10.1210/jc.2009-0205 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2009 May;94(5):1483-90. doi: 10.1210/jc.2009-0205.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our conceptual framework of human brain cancer has been redrawn in the current decade. There is a gathering acceptance that brain tumour formation is a phenotypic outcome of dysregulated neurogenesis, with tumours viewed as abnormally differentiated neural tissue. In relation, there is accumulating evidence that brain tumours, similar to leukaemia and many solid tumours, are organized as a developmental hierarchy which is maintained by a small fraction of cells endowed with many shared properties of tissue stem cells. Proof that neurogenesis persists throughout adult life, compliments this concept. Although the cancer cell of origin is unclear, the proliferative zones that harbour stem cells in the embryonic, post-natal and adult brain are attractive candidates within which tumour-initiation may ensue. Dysregulated, unlimited proliferation and an ability to bypass senescence are acquired capabilities of cancerous cells. These abilities in part require the establishment of a telomere maintenance mechanism for counteracting the shortening of chromosomal termini. A strategy based upon the synthesis of telomeric repeat sequences by the ribonucleoprotein telomerase, is prevalent in approximately 90% of human tumours studied, including the majority of brain tumours. This review will provide a developmental perspective with respect to normal (neurogenesis) and aberrant (tumourigenesis) cellular turnover, differentiation and function. Within this context our current knowledge of brain tumour telomere/telomerase biology will be discussed with respect to both its developmental and therapeutic relevance to the hierarchical model of brain tumourigenesis presented by the cancer stem cell paradigm.","['Rahman, Ruman', 'Heath, Rachel', 'Grundy, Richard']","['Rahman R', 'Heath R', 'Grundy R']","[""School of Clinical Sciences, Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham, NG7 2UH, UK. ruman.rahman@nottingham.ac.uk""]",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20090131,Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Brain Neoplasms/*enzymology/pathology', '*Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cellular Senescence', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*enzymology/pathology', 'Neurogenesis', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Telomerase/*metabolism', 'Telomere/*metabolism/pathology']",2009/05/08 09:00,2009/07/08 09:00,['2009/05/08 09:00'],"['2008/11/26 00:00 [received]', '2009/01/21 00:00 [revised]', '2009/01/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/08 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/08 09:00 [medline]']","['S0925-4439(09)00026-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbadis.2009.01.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2009 Apr;1792(4):280-8. doi: 10.1016/j.bbadis.2009.01.011.

This is due to their capacity for extensive proliferation and differentiation into effector cells. More recently it has been shown that the proliferative and differentiative ability of stem cells decreases with age, suggesting that this may play a role in tissue aging. Down syndrome (DS), is associated with many of the signs of premature tissue aging including T-cell deficiency, increased incidence of early Alzheimer-type, Myelodysplastic-type disease and leukaemia. Previously we have shown that both hematopoietic (HSC) and neural stem cells (NSC) in patients affected by DS showed signs of accelerated aging. In this study we tested the hypothesis that changes in gene expression in HSC and NSC of patients affected by DS reflect changes occurring in stem cells with age. The profiles of genes expressed in HSC and NSC from DS patients highlight pathways associated with cellular aging including a downregulation of DNA repair genes and increases in proapoptotic genes, s-phase cell cycle genes, inflammation and angiogenesis genes. Interestingly, Notch signaling was identified as a potential hub, which when deregulated may drive stem cell aging. These data suggests that DS is a valuable model to study early events in stem cell aging.","['Cairney, C J', 'Sanguinetti, G', 'Ranghini, E', 'Chantry, A D', 'Nostro, M C', 'Bhattacharyya, A', 'Svendsen, C N', 'Keith, W N', 'Bellantuono, I']","['Cairney CJ', 'Sanguinetti G', 'Ranghini E', 'Chantry AD', 'Nostro MC', 'Bhattacharyya A', 'Svendsen CN', 'Keith WN', 'Bellantuono I']","['Centre for Oncology and Applied Pharmacology, University of Glasgow, UK.']",,['eng'],['Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090206,Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Cellular Senescence', 'Child, Preschool', 'Down Syndrome/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Models, Biological', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Receptors, Notch/genetics/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', '*Systems Biology', 'Wnt Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",2009/05/08 09:00,2009/07/08 09:00,['2009/05/08 09:00'],"['2008/12/18 00:00 [received]', '2009/01/21 00:00 [revised]', '2009/01/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/08 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/08 09:00 [medline]']","['S0925-4439(09)00027-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbadis.2009.01.015 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2009 Apr;1792(4):353-63. doi: 10.1016/j.bbadis.2009.01.015.

This enzyme is highly expressed and active in most malignant tumors while it is usually not or transiently detectable in normal somatic cells, suggesting that it plays an important role in cellular immortalization and tumorigenesis. As most leukemic cells are generally telomerase-positive and have often shortened telomeres, our understanding of how telomerase is deregulated in these diseases could help to define novel therapies targeting the telomere/telomerase complex.

In this particular ECG from a patient with combined electrolyte imbalance, we have dubbed the unusual appearance of the segment between the peak of the T wave to the next P wave as the ""tee-pee"" sign.","['Johri, Amer M', 'Baranchuk, Adrian', 'Simpson, Christopher S', 'Abdollah, Hoshiar', 'Redfearn, Damian P']","['Johri AM', 'Baranchuk A', 'Simpson CS', 'Abdollah H', 'Redfearn DP']","[""Arrhythmia Service, Kingston General Hospital, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada.""]",,['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Ann Noninvasive Electrocardiol,"Annals of noninvasive electrocardiology : the official journal of the International Society for Holter and Noninvasive Electrocardiology, Inc",9607443,IM,"['Abdominal Pain/etiology', 'Calcium Channel Blockers/administration & dosage', 'Calcium Gluconate/administration & dosage', 'Electrocardiography/*methods', 'Fluid Therapy/methods', 'Humans', 'Hyperkalemia/complications/physiopathology/therapy', 'Hypocalcemia/complications/physiopathology/therapy', 'Hypoglycemic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Insulin/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications/drug therapy', 'Magnesium/blood', 'Magnesium Sulfate/administration & dosage', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monitoring, Physiologic/methods', 'Polystyrenes/administration & dosage', 'Vomiting/etiology', 'Water-Electrolyte Imbalance/complications/*physiopathology/therapy']",2009/05/08 09:00,2009/08/21 09:00,['2009/05/08 09:00'],"['2009/05/08 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/21 09:00 [medline]']","['ANEC283 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1542-474X.2009.00283.x [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Noninvasive Electrocardiol. 2009 Apr;14(2):211-4. doi: 10.1111/j.1542-474X.2009.00283.x.,"['0 (Calcium Channel Blockers)', '0 (Hypoglycemic Agents)', '0 (Insulin)', '0 (Polystyrenes)', '70KO0R01RY (polystyrene sulfonic acid)', '7487-88-9 (Magnesium Sulfate)', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)', 'SQE6VB453K (Calcium Gluconate)']",,,,PMC6932546,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the expression of Bmi-1 and ki-67. Double-labeling staining was used to display the distribution of Bcl-2(+)/ki-67(-) cells in 162 cases of GC and its matched normal mucosa and precancerous lesion. RESULTS: The positive rate of Bmi-1 expression in GC (52.5%) was significantly higher than that in normal gastric mucosa (21.6%, chi(2) = 33.088, P < 0.05). The Bmi-1 expression in GC was closely related with the Lauren's and Borrmann's classification and clinical stage (chi(2) = 4.400, 6.122 and 11.190, respectively, P < 0.05). The expression of ki-67 was related to the Borrmann's classification (chi(2) = 13.380, P < 0.05). Bcl-2 expression was correlated with the Lauren's classification (chi(2) = 4.725, P < 0.05), and the Bmi-1 expression both in GC (r(k) = 0.157, P < 0.05) and in intestinal metaplasia (r(k) = 0.270, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Abnormal Bmi-1 expression in GC may be involved in cell proliferation, apoptosis and cancerization.

In the last few years, the development of genetic and pharmacological tools has allowed a more precise definition of the specific roles of Rho GTPases in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and progeny of these cells. Rho GTPases are now known to be crucial in HSCs response to hematopoietic microenvironment cues. This article will review the known HSC functions, which are regulated by Rho GTPases. RECENT FINDINGS: This review analyzes the latest data on how different Rho GTPases control adhesion, migration, retention, proliferation, survival, senescence and oncogenic transformation of HSCs and relates these new findings to the physiological functions of these cells. SUMMARY: The development of small molecule inhibitors with ability to interfere Rho GTPase activation by guanine nucleotide exchange factors offers new therapeutic strategies to manipulate the function of HSCs.","['Cancelas, Jose A', 'Williams, David A']","['Cancelas JA', 'Williams DA']","[""Division of Experimental Hematology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA.""]",,['eng'],"['R01 CA113969-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK062757/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL087159/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA113969/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL087159/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA113969/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK062757/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', '*Cell Movement', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/pathology', 'Models, Biological', 'rho GTP-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",2009/05/07 09:00,2009/09/26 06:00,['2009/05/07 09:00'],"['2009/05/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOH.0b013e32832c4b80 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2009 Jul;16(4):249-54. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0b013e32832c4b80.,['EC 3.6.5.2 (rho GTP-Binding Proteins)'],,,49,PMC3908896,['NIHMS175488'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Although there are many disease development markers known so far, for example, B-cell lymphoma/leukemia (BCL) 2, new ones are needed for better understanding course of the disease. FOXP1 is known to be strongly expressed after B-cell activation. Its essential role in B-cell development suggested that it could also have a role in a various tumor B-cells. We have analyzed 74 bone marrow samples from B-CLL patients for presence of FOXP1 and its gene aberrations in tumor cells.

One inhibitory mechanism is up-regulation of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expressed on tumor or stromal cells which binds to programmed death-1 (PD-1) on activated T cells. PD-1/PD-L1 engagement results in diminished antitumor T-cell responses and correlates with poor outcome in murine and human solid cancers. In contrast to available data in solid tumors, little is known regarding involvement of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway in immune escape by hematopoietic cancers, such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML). To investigate this hypothesis, we used the murine leukemia, C1498. When transferred intravenously, C1498 cells grew progressively and apparently evaded immune destruction. Low levels of PD-L1 expression were found on C1498 cells grown in vitro. However, PD-L1 expression was up-regulated on C1498 cells when grown in vivo. PD-1(-/-) mice challenged with C1498 cells generated augmented antitumor T-cell responses, showed decreased AML burden in the blood and other organs, and survived significantly longer than did wild-type mice. Similar results were obtained with a PD-L1 blocking antibody. These data suggest the importance of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway in immune evasion by a hematologic malignancy, providing a rationale for clinical trials targeting this pathway in leukemia patients.","['Zhang, Long', 'Gajewski, Thomas F', 'Kline, Justin']","['Zhang L', 'Gajewski TF', 'Kline J']","['Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.']",,['eng'],"['K23 CA133196/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA127475/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090505,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*metabolism/physiology', 'B7-1 Antigen/*metabolism/physiology', 'B7-H1 Antigen', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/physiology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Disease Progression', 'Down-Regulation/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neoplasm Transplantation/pathology', 'Peptides/*metabolism/physiology', 'Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor', 'Protein Binding', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Escape/immunology']",2009/05/07 09:00,2009/10/01 06:00,['2009/05/07 09:00'],"['2009/05/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)37180-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-03-206672 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Aug 20;114(8):1545-52. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-03-206672.

Previously, we found that ZD55, an adenovirus serotype 5-based CRAd, infected and killed the leukemia cells expressing coxsackie adenovirus receptor (CAR). However, majority of leukemic cells lack CAR expression on their cell surface, resulting in resistance to CRAd infection. In this study, we showed that SG235, a novel fiber chimeric CRAd that has Ad35 tropism, permitted CAR-independent cell entry, and this in turn produced selective cytopathic effects in a variety of human leukemic cells in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, SG235 expressing exogenous tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (SG235-TRAIL) effectively induced apoptosis of leukemic cells via the activation of extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathway and elicited a superior antileukemia activity compared with SG235. In addition, normal hematopoietic progenitors were resistant to the inhibitory activity of SG235 and SG235-TRAIL.

Patients with cancer, including those with hematologic malignancies, have elevated numbers of Treg in the peripheral circulation and in tumor tissues. However, mechanisms of suppression and clinical significance of Treg, especially in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), has not been well defined. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We prospectively evaluated the phenotype, function, and mechanisms of suppression used by Treg in newly diagnosed untreated AML patients. The relationship between the frequency of circulating Treg and the disease status as well as treatment outcome was also evaluated. RESULTS: The percentage of circulating Treg was higher (P < 0.0001) and their phenotype was distinct in AML patients relative to normal controls. Suppression mediated by Treg coincubated with proliferating autologous responder cells was also higher (P < 0.001) in AML than that mediated by control Treg. Using Transwell inserts, we showed that interleukin-10 and transforming growth factor-beta1 production as well as cell-to-cell contact were necessary for Treg-mediated suppression. Also, the pretreatment Treg frequency predicted response to chemotherapy. Unexpectedly, patients who achieved complete remission still had elevated frequency of Treg, which mediated high levels of suppressor activity. CONCLUSIONS: Treg accumulating in the peripheral circulation of AML patients mediate vigorous suppression via contact-dependent and contact-independent mechanisms. Patients with lower Treg frequency at diagnosis have a better response to induction chemotherapy. During the post-induction period, the Treg frequency and suppressive activity remain elevated in complete remission, suggesting that Treg are resistant to conventional chemotherapy.","['Szczepanski, Miroslaw J', 'Szajnik, Marta', 'Czystowska, Malgorzata', 'Mandapathil, Magis', 'Strauss, Laura', 'Welsh, Ann', 'Foon, Kenneth A', 'Whiteside, Theresa L', 'Boyiadzis, Michael']","['Szczepanski MJ', 'Szajnik M', 'Czystowska M', 'Mandapathil M', 'Strauss L', 'Welsh A', 'Foon KA', 'Whiteside TL', 'Boyiadzis M']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA 15232, USA.']",,['eng'],['P01 CA109688/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090505,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'CD4 Antigens/immunology', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/*immunology/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/cytology/*immunology/metabolism']",2009/05/07 09:00,2009/08/04 09:00,['2009/05/07 09:00'],"['2009/05/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/04 09:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-08-3010 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-3010 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2009 May 15;15(10):3325-32. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-3010.

Previously, we demonstrated that Sizn1 positively modulates the BMP signal by interacting with Smad family members and cAMP-responsive element-binding protein-binding protein. To further define the molecular basis of Sizn1 function, we have explored its subcellular localization and generated various deletion mutants to carry out domain analyses. Here, we report that Sizn1 localizes to promyelocytic leukemia protein nuclear bodies (PML-NBs). Sizn1 deletion mutants that disrupt the MA homologous domain or the middle region fail to target to the PML-NB. We show that two SUMO interaction motifs (SIMs) in Sizn1 can bind to SUMO and govern SUMO conjugation to Sizn1 in the absence of the consensus motif for SUMO attachment. Interestingly, the SIM mutant Sizn1 localizes to nuclear bodies, but not to PML-NBs. Thus, SIMs mediate the localization of Sizn1 to PML-NB. Interestingly, mutations in SIM sequences and deletion of the MA homologous domain also affected the transcriptional co-activation function of a Sizn1. Taken together, our data indicate that the SIMs in Sizn1 are required for its PML-NB localization and for the full transcriptional co-activation function in BMP signaling.","['Cho, Ginam', 'Lim, Youngshin', 'Golden, Jeffrey A']","['Cho G', 'Lim Y', 'Golden JA']","[""Department of Pathology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, USA.""]",,['eng'],"['R01 NS045034/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS046616/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 NS045034/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS45034/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090505,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Glutathione Transferase/genetics/metabolism', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Intranuclear Inclusion Bodies/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism', 'Luciferases/genetics/metabolism', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'SUMO-1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Smad1 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection', 'Zinc Fingers']",2009/05/07 09:00,2009/09/26 06:00,['2009/05/07 09:00'],"['2009/05/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(19)81167-5 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M109.010181 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2009 Jul 17;284(29):19592-600. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M109.010181.

HTLV was identified more than 25 years ago as the etiological agent of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. It was then shown to be a complex retrovirus, given that it not only encodes the characteristic retroviral Gag, Pol and Env proteins, but also regulatory and accessory proteins. Since the first studies documenting the role of these proteins in viral expression, the picture has become increasingly more complex. Indeed, owing to the limited size of its genome that contains overlapping open-reading frames, HTLV has evolved unique ways to regulate its expression. Retroviral expression was originally thought to be mainly controlled through the regulation of transcription from the 5 long-terminal repeats, but we now know that the 3 long-terminal repeats also serve as promoters. Regulation of splicing and mRNA export, and post-translational modifications of viral protein also play a major role.

Longer follow-up in chronic myeloid leukaemia: clear advantages.,226-8,,"(1) In 2002/2003, the clinical evaluation of imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia left many questions unanswered. This article examines data published since then; (2) The only new data on first-line efficacy are the 5-year results of an unblinded trial comparing imatinib versus the interferon plus cytarabine combination. The survival rate was 89% with imatinib, versus about 70% in previous clinical trials of interferon plus cytarabine. Fewer than 2% of patients relapsed after responding to imatinib; (3) As second-line treatment for patients in the chronic phase, we now have non-comparative follow-up data on 532 patients in whom interferon had failed. At 5 years the overall survival rate was 79%, versus about 50% with standard treatments; (4) As second-line treatment for patients in the accelerated phase, we now have non-comparative follow-up data on 235 patients. After 3 years 55% of the patients were still alive, while the usual survival time is 3 to 18 months; (5) As second-line treatment of the blast crisis, we now have non-comparative follow-up data on 260 patients. After 3 years 14% of the patients were still alive, while the usual survival time for patients at this stage is 2 to 4 months; (6) The only new study is a non-comparative follow-up study of 50 children and adolescents aged 2 to 19 years treated with imatinib. The estimated 2-year survival rate was 84%. The haematological and cytogenetic response rates were similar to those reported in adults; (7) The initial clinical evaluation of imatinib showed that its main adverse effects were nausea and vomiting, oedema, fluid retention, muscle cramps, and cutaneous disorders. It was estimated that heart failure occurred in 1 to 10 per 1000 patients. A study of 54 patients confirmed the high incidence of cutaneous disorders. Cases of prostate and bladder cancer have been reported in patients treated with imatinib in France. A study of 16 patients suggests that imatinib might alter bone metabolism; (8) In France, treatment with imatinib costs about 25% more than the interferon plus cytarabine combination; (9) In practice, imatinib seems to increase survival time when used as a first-line or second-line treatment for patients in different phases of chronic myeloid leukaemia. Adverse effects must continue to be closely monitored.",,,,,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,France,Prescrire Int,Prescrire international,9439295,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Approval', 'Europe', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use']",2009/05/07 09:00,2009/05/16 09:00,['2009/05/07 09:00'],"['2009/05/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/16 09:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Prescrire Int. 2008 Dec;17(98):226-8.,"['0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One immense restriction consists in a reduced level of activity due to different factors. Physical activity affects various aspects of development and can be regarded as an essential part of a child's life. In the present study physical activity in patients undergoing cancer therapy was quantified in order to determine the extent of the restriction and to provide baseline information for the assessment of possible interventions. PROCEDURE: Physical activity in 80 patients and 45 healthy children matched for age and gender was measured using the StepWatch 3 Activity Monitor (SAM, OrthoCare Innovations). RESULTS: Pediatric cancer patients, at 2,787 gait cycles (gcs) per day, were significantly less active than their healthy counterparts (8,096 gcs). Patients were significantly more active at home than during inpatient stays (3,185 gcs compared to 1,830 gcs), and patients with bone tumors were less active than those with leukemia regarding both, the amount (1,849 gcs vs. 2,992 gcs) and the intensity of activity. CONCLUSION: The present study quantified an often observed but so far hardly assessable problem. Activity in cancer patients is considerably reduced and patients with bone tumors are at increased risk from the detrimental effects of prolonged inactivity. Both our findings and the accepted fact that activity is an essential element of child development confirm the need for interventions tailored to a patient's needs and abilities during the course of treatment.","['Winter, Corinna', 'Muller, Carsten', 'Brandes, Mirko', 'Brinkmann, Anja', 'Hoffmann, Christiane', 'Hardes, Jendrik', 'Gosheger, Georg', 'Boos, Joachim', 'Rosenbaum, Dieter']","['Winter C', 'Muller C', 'Brandes M', 'Brinkmann A', 'Hoffmann C', 'Hardes J', 'Gosheger G', 'Boos J', 'Rosenbaum D']","['Motion Analysis Laboratory, University Hospital Muenster, Muenster, Germany. winterco@uni-muenster.de']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bone Neoplasms/physiopathology/therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Gait', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/physiopathology/therapy', '*Motor Activity', 'Neoplasms/*physiopathology/therapy']",2009/05/06 09:00,2009/08/01 09:00,['2009/05/06 09:00'],"['2009/05/06 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/01 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22055 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2009 Sep;53(3):438-43. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22055.,,,,,,,,"['(c) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,

From morphological aspects, these categories show overlaps. To evaluate whether these morphological similarities have genetic parallels, we investigated 1,851 cases with suspected/confirmed myelodysplastic or myeloproliferative diseases by chromosome banding and molecular analyses. Cytogenetics revealed aberrant karyotypes in 354 patients (19.1% of the original cohort) who were the basis of further analysis. The distribution of chromosomal aberrations differed significantly between categories. Isolated +9 and gain of 9p were exclusively observed in MPN (+9: 10/93; 11%; p < 0.001; +9p: 6/93; 7% of all aberrant MPN cases) but were not detected in MDS or MDS/MPN (p = 0.001). Isolated del(5q) (p = 0.002), -7 in combination with other aberrations (p = 0.016), and complex aberrations (p = 0.003) were 2.9- to 7.5-fold more frequent in MDS than in MPN. Trisomies 8 and 21 and del(20q) were comparably frequent in both subgroups. Interestingly, the MDS/MPN overlap cohort showed a higher frequency of -7 accompanied by other aberrations (3/17; 18% of all aberrant cases; p = 0.001), i(17)(q10) (2/17; 12%; p = 0.013), and +21 (2/17; 12%; p = 0.013) when compared to MPN or MDS only. These differences support the category for MDS/MPN within the new WHO classification. Overlaps between the diverse disorders were seen also for the JAK2V617F (MPN 66/89; 74%; MDS/MPN 4/14; 29%; MDS 2/63; 3%) and NRAS mutations (MDS 2/67; 3%; MPN 2/4; MDS/MPN 1/1). In conclusion, cytogenetics and molecular genetics show overlaps in varying proportions of MDS and MPN cases which might indicate common pathways in their etiology. Some markers are strongly associated with one of these disorders and can be helpful for differential diagnosis especially in difficult cases.","['Bacher, Ulrike', 'Schnittger, Susanne', 'Kern, Wolfgang', 'Weiss, Tamara', 'Haferlach, Torsten', 'Haferlach, Claudia']","['Bacher U', 'Schnittger S', 'Kern W', 'Weiss T', 'Haferlach T', 'Haferlach C']","['Clinic for Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center Hamburg (UCCH), Martinistr. 52, Hamburg 20246, Germany. u.bacher@uke.de']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090505,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cytogenetics', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic, Atypical, BCR-ABL Negative/classification/diagnosis/*genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/classification/diagnosis/*genetics/*pathology', 'Young Adult']",2009/05/06 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/05/06 09:00'],"['2009/02/19 00:00 [received]', '2009/04/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/06 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-009-0745-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2009 Dec;88(12):1207-13. doi: 10.1007/s00277-009-0745-3.

The results of telomeric repeat amplification protocol showed that telomerase activity was significantly reduced upon transfection of the HL-60 cell line with hTERT siRNAs. The results of this study showed that telomerase activity and cell proliferation were efficiently inhibited in the hTERT siRNA-treated leukemic cell line.","['Miri-Moghaddam, E', 'Deezagi, A', 'Soheili, Z S']","['Miri-Moghaddam E', 'Deezagi A', 'Soheili ZS']","['National Institute of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (NIGEB), Tehran, Iran.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090505,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,"['Cell Proliferation', 'Down-Regulation', 'HL-60 Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', '*RNA/genetics/metabolism', '*RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', '*Telomerase/genetics/metabolism', 'Transfection']",2009/05/06 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/05/06 09:00'],"['2008/11/16 00:00 [received]', '2009/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/06 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-009-0748-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2009 Dec;88(12):1169-76. doi: 10.1007/s00277-009-0748-0.

This has limited tetramer use for antigen-specific T cells isolation and cloning, as sorted tetramer positive cells were shown to possess compromised functional integrity. Here we show that the cross-linking of a secondary co-stimulatory signal into oligomeric MHC:peptide complexes prevents such cell death, and in contrast strongly stimulates antigen-specific T cell responses. Such soluble antigen-presenting complexes (sAPCs) containing MHC:peptide complexes linked to either anti-CD27 or anti-CD28 antibodies were capable of priming and expanding HLA-A*0201 restricted CMV specific T cells and also of generating functional HLA-A*0301 restricted BCR/ABL-specific T cell responses. These sAPCs constitute an encouraging alternative method for generating antigen-specific T cells that could be applied to a variety of antigens.","['Rusakiewicz, Sylvie', 'Aubert, Geraldine', 'Clark, Richard E', 'Madrigal, Alejandro J', 'Dodi, Anthony I', 'Travers, Paul J']","['Rusakiewicz S', 'Aubert G', 'Clark RE', 'Madrigal AJ', 'Dodi AI', 'Travers PJ']","['Anthony Nolan Research Institute, The Royal Free Hospital, University College of London, Hampstead, London NW3 2QG, UK.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090505,Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/*metabolism', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/immunology/metabolism', 'CD28 Antigens/immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/immunology/metabolism', 'HLA-A Antigens/*immunology', 'HLA-A2 Antigen', 'HLA-A3 Antigen', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex/immunology', 'Monocytes/cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'Peptide Fragments/*immunology', 'Streptavidin/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7/immunology/metabolism']",2009/05/06 09:00,2009/08/01 09:00,['2009/05/06 09:00'],"['2008/09/10 00:00 [received]', '2009/04/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/06 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/01 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00262-009-0711-x [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2009 Sep;58(9):1459-70. doi: 10.1007/s00262-009-0711-x.

Unfortunately, donor T cells can attack nonmalignant host tissues and cause graft-vs-host disease (GVHD). It has previously been shown that effector memory T cells not primed to alloantigen do not cause GVHD yet transfer functional T cell memory and mediate GVL. Recently, central memory T cells (T(CM)) have also been reported to not cause GVHD. In contrast, in this study, we demonstrate that purified CD8(+) T(CM) not specifically primed to alloantigens mediate GVHD in the MHC-mismatched C57BL/6 (B6)-->BALB/c and the MHC-matched, multiple minor histocompatibility Ag-mismatched C3H.SW-->B6 strain pairings. CD8(+) T(CM) and naive T cells (T(N)) caused similar histological disease in liver, skin, and bowel. B6 CD8(+) T(CM) and T(N) similarly expanded in BALB/c recipients, and the majority of their progeny produced IFN-gamma upon restimulation. However, in both models, CD8(+) T(CM) induced milder clinical GVHD than did CD8(+) T(N). Nonetheless, CD8(+) T(CM) and T(N) were similarly potent mediators of GVL against a mouse model of chronic-phase chronic myelogenous leukemia. Thus, in contrast to what was previously thought, CD8(+) T(CM) are capable of inducing GVHD and are substantially different from T(EM) but only subtly so from T(N).","['Zheng, Hong', 'Matte-Martone, Catherine', 'Jain, Dhanpat', 'McNiff, Jennifer', 'Shlomchik, Warren D']","['Zheng H', 'Matte-Martone C', 'Jain D', 'McNiff J', 'Shlomchik WD']","['Department of Medicine, Penn State Milton S.

We evaluated outcome improvement in such patients in recent years. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Nine hundred two patients with APL, including 204 patients and 68 patients with WBC counts more than 10,000/microL and more than 50,000/microL, respectively, were enrolled between 1993 and 2005 in two successive randomized trials of the European APL group (APL 93 and APL 2000) that tested, in particular, the modalities of combination of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and chemotherapy, maintenance treatment, escalating doses of cytarabine, early administration of dexamethasone, and CNS prophylaxis. RESULTS: Between the APL 93 and 2000 trials, the complete response (CR) rate increased from 89.6% to 93%, and the 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) decreased from 40% to 9.5% in patients with WBC counts of 10,000 to 50,000/microL. In patients with WBC counts more than 50,000/microL, the CR rate increased from 82% to 91%, and 5-year CIR decreased from 59% to 24%. Whereas in the APL 93 trial, increased WBC counts were significantly associated with higher CIR and shorter survival, this was not the case in the APL 2000 trial. In patients with increased WBC counts, enrollment onto the APL 2000 trial (v APL 93) and combined maintenance with ATRA and chemotherapy were associated with significantly lower CIR and better survival. CONCLUSION: Outcome of APL with high WBC count has markedly improved over the years as a result of fewer early deaths and fewer relapses. Better initial supportive care and combined maintenance treatment have contributed to this improvement.","['Kelaidi, Charikleia', 'Chevret, Sylvie', 'De Botton, Stephane', 'Raffoux, Emmanuel', 'Guerci, Agnes', 'Thomas, Xavier', 'Pigneux, Arnaud', 'Lamy, Thierry', 'Rigal-Huguet, Francoise', 'Meyer-Monard, Sandrine', 'Chevallier, Patrice', 'Maloisel, Frederic', 'Deconinck, Erick', 'Ferrant, Augustin', 'Fegueux, Nathalie', 'Ifrah, Norbert', 'Sanz, Miguel', 'Dombret, Herve', 'Fenaux, Pierre', 'Ades, Lionel']","['Kelaidi C', 'Chevret S', 'De Botton S', 'Raffoux E', 'Guerci A', 'Thomas X', 'Pigneux A', 'Lamy T', 'Rigal-Huguet F', 'Meyer-Monard S', 'Chevallier P', 'Maloisel F', 'Deconinck E', 'Ferrant A', 'Fegueux N', 'Ifrah N', 'Sanz M', 'Dombret H', 'Fenaux P', 'Ades L']","[""European APL Group, L'Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale U848, Villejuif, France.""]",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090504,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Europe', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/blood/*drug therapy/mortality', '*Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Outcome and Process Assessment, Health Care', 'Proportional Hazards Models', '*Quality of Health Care/trends', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2009/05/06 09:00,2009/06/12 09:00,['2009/05/06 09:00'],"['2009/05/06 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/12 09:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2008.18.4119 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2008.18.4119 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2009 Jun 1;27(16):2668-76. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2008.18.4119.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients had relapsed/refractory HCL and needed treatment based on blood counts. Patients were stratified into three groups: response to cladribine less than 1 year, those with a response lasting 1 to 4 years, or no response and uncontrolled infection. Patients received BL22 40 microg/kg every other day for three doses on cycle 1. Those achieving hematologic remission (HR), defined as neutrophils > or = 1,500/mm(3), hemoglobin > or = 11 g/dL, and platelets > or = 100,000/mm(3), were observed. Patients without HR were re-treated at 30 microg/kg every other day for three doses every 4 weeks beginning at least 8 weeks after cycle 1. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients were enrolled including 26, nine, and one in groups 1 to 3. The response after one cycle (CR, 25%; PR, 25%) improved when 56% were re-treated (CR, 47%; PR, 25%). CR rate was similar in groups 1 and 2 (P = .7). Twenty-two with baseline spleen height lower than 200 mm had higher CR (64% v 21%; P = .019) and OR rates (95% v 36%; P = .0002) compared to 14 with spleens either absent or higher than 200 mm. The only serious toxicity was reversible grade 3 hemolytic uremic syndrome, not requiring plasmapheresis, in two patients (6%). High neutralizing antibodies were observed in four patients (11%) and prevented re-treatment. CONCLUSION: BL22 activity in HCL is confirmed. Best responses to BL22 after cladribine failure are achieved before the patients develop massive splenomegaly or undergo splenectomy.","['Kreitman, Robert J', 'Stetler-Stevenson, Maryalice', 'Margulies, Inger', 'Noel, Pierre', 'Fitzgerald, David J P', 'Wilson, Wyndham H', 'Pastan, Ira']","['Kreitman RJ', 'Stetler-Stevenson M', 'Margulies I', 'Noel P', 'Fitzgerald DJ', 'Wilson WH', 'Pastan I']","['Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Laboratory of Clinical Pathology, and Medicine Branch, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. kreitmar@mail.nih.gov']",,['eng'],['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20090504,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Cladribine/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance', 'Enterotoxins/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Spleen', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/05/06 09:00,2009/07/10 09:00,['2009/05/06 09:00'],"['2009/05/06 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/10 09:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2008.20.2630 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2008.20.2630 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2009 Jun 20;27(18):2983-90. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2008.20.2630.

Mastic showed selective antibacterial action against Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella melaninogenica, but no anti-HIV activity. Among a total of thirteen human cell types, promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 was the most sensitive to the cytotoxicity of mastic, followed by myeloblastic leukemia (ML-1, KG-1), erythroleukemia (K-562), oral squamous cell carcinoma (HSC-2, HSC-3, HSC-4), hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2), glioblastoma (T98G, U87MG) and normal oral cells (gingival fibroblast, pulp cell, periodontal ligament fibroblast, most resistant). Mastic did not induce the differentiation of myelogenous leukemic cells into maturing cells with higher nitroblue tetrazolium-reducing activity, but induced apoptotic cell death, characterized by internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, caspase-3 activation and a decline in the intracellular concentration of putrescine. The cytotoxicity of mastic against leukemic cells did not diminish during its storage. On the other hand, mastic inhibited the spontaneous apoptosis of OPMNs. Mastic showed hydroxyl radical-scavenging activity. The selective antibacterial and apoptosis-modulating activity of mastic suggests its possible beneficial effects on oral health.","['Sakagami, Hiroshi', 'Kishino, Kaori', 'Kobayashi, Masaki', 'Hashimoto, Ken', 'Iida, Satora', 'Shimetani, Akiko', 'Nakamura, Yuko', 'Takahashi, Keiso', 'Ikarashi, Takeshi', 'Fukamachi, Haruka', 'Satoh, Kazue', 'Nakashima, Hideki', 'Shimizu, Takahisa', 'Takeda, Ken', 'Watanabe, Shuji', 'Nakamura, Wataru']","['Sakagami H', 'Kishino K', 'Kobayashi M', 'Hashimoto K', 'Iida S', 'Shimetani A', 'Nakamura Y', 'Takahashi K', 'Ikarashi T', 'Fukamachi H', 'Satoh K', 'Nakashima H', 'Shimizu T', 'Takeda K', 'Watanabe S', 'Nakamura W']","['Division of Pharmacology, Department of Diagnostic and Therapeutic Sciences, Meikai University School of Dentistry, Sakado, Saitama 350-0283, Japan. sakagami@dent.meikai.ac.jp']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,In Vivo,"In vivo (Athens, Greece)",8806809,IM,"['Anti-Infective Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor/*methods', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Mastic Resin', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Neutrophils/*metabolism', 'Putrescine/pharmacology', 'Resins, Plant/*pharmacology']",2009/05/06 09:00,2009/07/02 09:00,['2009/05/06 09:00'],"['2009/05/06 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/02 09:00 [medline]']",['23/2/215 [pii]'],ppublish,In Vivo. 2009 Mar-Apr;23(2):215-23.,"['0 (Anti-Infective Agents)', '0 (Mastic Resin)', '0 (Resins, Plant)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'V10TVZ52E4 (Putrescine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By glutathione (GSH) pre-treatment, eupalinin A-induced cell growth inhibition was markedly reduced in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Eupalinin A reduced the intracellular GSH level in the early phase, but the GSH pre-treatment reduced this depression. Interestingly, the supplementation of GSH changed the cell death type from autophagic cell death to apoptotic cell death. Pre-treatment with GSH plus p38 MAP kinase inhibitor (SB203580) strongly diminished the eupalinin A-induced autophagic cell death compared with GSH pre-treatment, suggesting a negative regulation of p38 MAP kinase in this cell death type conversion.

P-glycoprotein (P-gp) increased and decreased along with mdr-1 expression in three cell lines out of five vincristine (VCR)-resistant cell lines.

The RUNX1 gene, located in chromosome 21q22, is crucial for the establishment of definite hematopoiesis and the generation of hematopoietic stem cells in the embryo. It contains a ""Runt homology domain"" (RHD) and a transactivation domain. RUNX1 can act as activator or repressor of target gene expression depending upon the large number of transcription factors, coactivators and corepressors that interact with it. Three modes of leukemogenesis due to acquired alterations of the RUNX1 gene have been recognized: point mutations, amplification and translocations. Some translocations have been shown to be recurrent whereas others have been only reported in a few cases or in a sole case. At present, 32 partner chromosomes have been described but the partner gene has solely been identified in 17 translocations at the molecular level. Most of the translocations involving RUNX1 lead to the formation of a fusion transcript made of the 5' region of RUNX1, including the RHD, fused to the 3' region of a partner gene, with the exception of RUNX1-ETV6 in which the 3' sequences of RUNX1, including the RHD, are fused to the 5' region of ETV6, including its promotor. Three RUNX1 translocations (retaining RHD) that are fused out of frame to partner genes are also known. All the translocations that retain RHD but remove the transcription activation domain have a leukemogenic effect by acting as dominant negative inhibitors of wild-type RUNX1 in transcription activation.","['De Braekeleer, Etienne', 'Ferec, Claude', 'De Braekeleer, Marc']","['De Braekeleer E', 'Ferec C', 'De Braekeleer M']","['National Institute of Health and Medical Research, U613, Brest, France.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,"['Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2009/05/06 09:00,2009/07/03 09:00,['2009/05/06 09:00'],"['2009/05/06 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/03 09:00 [medline]']",['29/4/1031 [pii]'],ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2009 Apr;29(4):1031-7.,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)']",,,68,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Bax was not affected by the treatment of TP-110, cleavage of Bid and release of cytochrome c were enhanced. Interestingly, TP-110 reduced the intrinsic inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs), cIAP-1 and XIAP, that suppress executioner caspases. The reduction of IAPs was observed not only by TP-110, but also by another proteasome inhibitor, MG-132. These results indicate that proteasome inhibitors reduce the level of IAPs and that the apoptosis induced by TP-110 is correlated with the level of IAPs in leukemia cell lines. Additionally, a reduction of cIAP-1 and XIAP by TP-110 contributes to the sensitization of Fas-mediated apoptosis. Taken together, the alteration of the apoptosis regulatory proteins by a proteasome inhibitor induces apoptosis in tumor cells.","['Iijima, Masatomi', 'Momose, Isao', 'Ikeda, Daishiro']","['Iijima M', 'Momose I', 'Ikeda D']","['Numazu Bio-Medical Research Institute, Microbial Chemistry Research Center, Shizuoka 410-0301, Japan. iijimam@bikaken.or.jp']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Oligopeptides/*pharmacology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', '*Proteasome Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2009/05/06 09:00,2009/07/03 09:00,['2009/05/06 09:00'],"['2009/05/06 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/03 09:00 [medline]']",['29/4/977 [pii]'],ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2009 Apr;29(4):977-85.,"['0 (1-naphthylacetyl-(O-methyl)-tyrosyl-valyl-(O-methyl)-tyrosinal)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of our study was to investigate the efficacy of low-intensity ultrasound on malignant astrocytic tumor cells with the photosensitizer, Photofrin, which is taken up by the cell surface receptor, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein/alpha2-macroglobulin receptor (LRP/alpha2MR). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cells were sonicated with continuous wave ultrasound with or without the presence of Photofrin (75 mg/ml) at an intensity of 0.3 W/cm(2) for a duration of 5, 15, or 30 s. RESULTS: Ultrasound alone induced instant cell killing immediately after sonication in both U251MG and U105MG malignant gliomas cells. In U251MG cells, which expressed LRP/alpha2MR, significant enhancement of cell killing was observed following Photofrin pretreatment, 52.7+/-17.5%, 13.0+/-4.6% and 3.9+/-0.9% for 5, 15, and 30 s respectively (p<0.05). This enhancement of cell killing was abolished by preincubation with receptor-associated protein (RAP) which binds specifically to LRP/alpha2MR. This enhancement by Photofrin was not achieved in U105MG which did not express LRP/alpha2MR. U251MG cells accumulated 2.43+/-0.25 Photofrin mg/mg protein, which significantly decreased with RAP pretreatment (1.38+/-0.22 Photofrin mg/mg protein) (p<0.05). U105MG cells accumulated 1.31+/-0.16 Photofrin mg/mg protein, which was significantly less than in U251MG cells. Photofrin uptake was not altered by RAP pretreatment in U105MG cells. U251MG cells exposed to ultrasound in the presence of Photofrin showed multiple surface pores and dimple-like craters. CONCLUSION: This is the first report to demonstrate the usefulness of low-intensity ultrasound for the cell killing of malignant glioma cells. Antitumor activity might be enhanced by combination with photosensitizer, which is transported by cell surface LRP/alpha2-MR to some degree.","['Hayashi, Shuji', 'Yamamoto, Masaki', 'Tachibana, Katsuhiro', 'Ueno, Yushi', 'Bu, Guojun', 'Fukushima, Takeo']","['Hayashi S', 'Yamamoto M', 'Tachibana K', 'Ueno Y', 'Bu G', 'Fukushima T']","['Department of Neurosurgery, Fukuoka University School of Medicine, Jonan-ku, Fukuoka 814-0180, Japan. s-h@hakujyujikai.or.jp']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,"['Brain Neoplasms/pathology/*therapy', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Dihematoporphyrin Ether/*therapeutic use', 'Glioma/pathology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor-Related Protein-1/genetics/metabolism', 'Photosensitizing Agents/*therapeutic use', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Ultrasonic Therapy', 'alpha-Macroglobulins/genetics/metabolism']",2009/05/06 09:00,2009/06/26 09:00,['2009/05/06 09:00'],"['2009/05/06 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/26 09:00 [medline]']",['29/3/897 [pii]'],ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2009 Mar;29(3):897-905.,"['0 (Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor-Related Protein-1)', '0 (Photosensitizing Agents)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (alpha-Macroglobulins)', '97067-70-4 (Dihematoporphyrin Ether)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, this mechanism does not fully explain the regression of tumours induced by this drug in animal models of cancer. Here we show that Minerval also induced apoptosis in Jurkat T-lymphoblastic leukaemia and other cancer cells. Minerval inhibited proliferation of Jurkat cells, concomitant with a decrease of cyclin D3 and cdk2 (cyclin-dependent kinase2). In addition, the changes that induced on Jurkat cell membrane organization caused clustering (capping) of the death receptor Fas (CD95), caspase-8 activation and initiation of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway, which finally resulted in programmed cell death. The present results suggest that the intrinsic pathway (associated with caspase-9 function) was activated downstream by caspase-8. In a xenograft model of human leukaemia, Minerval also inhibited tumour progression and induced tumour cell death. Studies carried out in a wide variety of cancer cell types demonstrated that apoptosis was the main molecular mechanism triggered by Minerval. This is the first report on the pro-apoptotic activity of Minerval, and in part explains the effectiveness of this non-toxic anticancer drug and its wide spectrum against different types of cancer.","['Llado, Victoria', 'Gutierrez, Antonio', 'Martinez, Jordi', 'Casas, Jesus', 'Teres, Silvia', 'Higuera, Monica', 'Galmes, Antonio', 'Saus, Carles', 'Besalduch, Joan', 'Busquets, Xavier', 'Escriba, Pablo V']","['Llado V', 'Gutierrez A', 'Martinez J', 'Casas J', 'Teres S', 'Higuera M', 'Galmes A', 'Saus C', 'Besalduch J', 'Busquets X', 'Escriba PV']","['Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Biomedicine, Department of Biology, IUNICS, University of the Balearic Islands, Spain.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20081224,England,J Cell Mol Med,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,101083777,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cyclin D3/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HT29 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology', 'Oleic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors', '*Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2009/05/06 09:00,2010/08/11 06:00,['2009/05/06 09:00'],"['2009/05/06 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/11 06:00 [medline]']","['JCMM625 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1582-4934.2008.00625.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Mol Med. 2010 Mar;14(3):659-70. doi: 10.1111/j.1582-4934.2008.00625.x.

In this study, we used a genetic co-segregation analysis to assess the association of Crtam, Zbtb16, and Mobp with the alcohol preference (AP) phenotype in the alcohol-preferring C57BL/6J (B6) and alcohol avoiding DBA/2J (D2) strains of mice. METHODS: Semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to confirm previous microarray analysis results that Crtam, Zbtb16, and Mobp brain mRNA levels in the B6 and D2 strains are altered by ethanol treatment. The association of the 3 genes with AP was assessed in a F(2) population (n = 427) derived from the reciprocal crosses involving the B6 and D2 strains. Each F(2) individual was assessed for their AP using the 2 bottle choice test and genotyped for Crtam, Zbtb16, and Mobp single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that differ between B6 and D2 mice. RESULTS: Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis confirmed that Crtam, Zbtb16, and Mobp are ethanol-responsive genes. The SNP analyses show that alleles of the 3 genes co-segregate with the AP phenotype in F(2) mice, where individuals homozygous for the B6 allele have higher AP than those homozygous for the D2 allele. Also, the Crtam-Zbtb16 loci that are tightly linked and the Mobp locus act in an additive fashion in determining the relative AP phenotype. CONCLUSION: Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that Crtam, Zbtb16, and Mobp may be involved in AP in mice. The nature of this association remains to be established and may reflect a direct effect of these genes or an indirect effect caused by linked genes on mouse chromosome 9.","['Weng, Julia', 'Symons, Melissa N', 'Singh, Shiva M']","['Weng J', 'Symons MN', 'Singh SM']","['Department of Biology, University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario, Canada.']",,['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090430,England,Alcohol Clin Exp Res,"Alcoholism, clinical and experimental research",7707242,IM,"['Alcohol Drinking/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Chromosomes, Mammalian/*genetics', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'Ethanol/*administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Immunoglobulins/*genetics', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Myelin Proteins', 'Myelin-Associated Glycoprotein/*genetics', 'Myelin-Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Quantitative Trait Loci/*genetics']",2009/05/06 09:00,2010/04/13 06:00,['2009/05/06 09:00'],"['2009/05/06 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/13 06:00 [medline]']","['ACER971 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1530-0277.2009.00971.x [doi]']",ppublish,Alcohol Clin Exp Res. 2009 Aug;33(8):1409-16. doi: 10.1111/j.1530-0277.2009.00971.x.

To identify new surface biomarkers, we developed an original proteomic approach based on mass spectrometry analysis of plasma membrane microparticles derived from chronic B-cell lymphoproliferations of single patients: chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), small cell lymphoma (SLL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). A straightforward selection process for proteomic-based candidate biomarker identification was further constructed in order to propose potentially useful and relevant biomarkers. Comparison of the lists of the proteins identified in each pathology combined to highly stringent MS validation criteria for protein identification allowed to propose CD148, a membrane receptor with phosphatase activity, as a discriminating biomarker candidate. Flow cytometry analyses, performed on 158 patients and 30 controls, showed that an anti-CD148 antibody stained significantly higher MCL than CLL and SLL circulating cells (p<0.0001), which validates CD148 overexpression in MCL. Our results indicate that a medium or high CD148 expression level may exclude the diagnosis of CLL and high CD148 expression levels (CD148 MFI equal or superior to 2 times the value obtained with CLL/SLL) allows MCL diagnosis to be suspected with 91% specificity (versus CLL and SLL) and 78% sensitivity.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We here report that we have identified a metal-stimulated serine octanoyltransferase activity in microsomes from human erythroleukemic (HEL) cells. The HEL acylating enzyme was linear with respect to time and protein, exhibited a neutral pH optimum (stimulated by cobalt and zinc), and inhibited by chelating reagents. Hydroxylamine treatment removed most, but not all, of the attached radioactivity. A salt extract of microsomal membranes contained the major portion of enzyme activity, indicating that this acyltransferase is not an integral membrane protein. Sucrose density fractionation showed that the acyltransferase activity is concentrated in the endoplasmic reticulum. In competition experiments, the acyltransferase was well inhibited by activated forms of fatty acids containing at least eight to fourteen carbons, but not by acetyl CoA. The zinc-stimulated HEL acyltransferase did not octanoylate proenkephalin, proopiomelanocortin, His-tagged proghrelin, or proghrelin lacking the amino-terminal His-tag stub of Gly-Ala-Met. The peptides des-acyl ghrelin and ACTH were also not acylated; however, des-acyl ghrelin containing the N-terminal tripeptide Gly-Ala-Met was acylated. Mutagenesis studies indicated a requirement for serine five residues from the amino terminus, reminiscent of myristoyl transferase, but not of ghrelin acylation. However, recombinant myristoyl transferase could not recapitulate the hydroxylamine sensitivity, zinc-stimulation, nor EDTA inhibition obtained with HEL acyltransferase, properties preserved in the HEL cell enzyme purified through four sequential chromatographic steps. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In conclusion, our data demonstrate the presence of a zinc-stimulated acyltransferase activity concentrated in the endoplasmic reticulum in HEL cells which is likely to contribute to medium-chain protein lipidation.","['Ozawa, Akihiko', 'Speaker, Richard B 3rd', 'Lindberg, Iris']","['Ozawa A', 'Speaker RB 3rd', 'Lindberg I']","['Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology, University of Maryland-Baltimore, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.']",,['eng'],"['R01 DA005084/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK049703/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 DA005084/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'DA05084/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090504,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Acylation', 'Acyltransferases/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/enzymology', 'Fatty Acids/chemistry/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/enzymology', 'Microsomes/enzymology', 'Peptide Hormones/chemistry/metabolism', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Zinc/metabolism']",2009/05/05 09:00,2009/08/18 09:00,['2009/05/05 09:00'],"['2009/01/20 00:00 [received]', '2009/04/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/05 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/18 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0005426 [doi]'],ppublish,PLoS One. 2009;4(5):e5426. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0005426.

Modeling activation of the PTEN/AKT/mTOR pathway in the Emu-Myc mouse is a valuable tool to study tumor genotype/chemosensitivity relationships in vivo. In this model, blocking translation initiation with silvestrol, an inhibitor of the ribosome recruitment step has been showed to modulate the sensitivity of the tumors to the effect of standard chemotherapy. However, inhibitors of translation elongation have been tested as potential anti-cancer therapeutic agents in vitro, but have not been extensively tested in genetically well-defined mouse tumor models or for potential synergy with standard of care agents. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we chose four structurally different chemical inhibitors of translation elongation: homoharringtonine, bruceantin, didemnin B and cycloheximide, and tested their ability to alter the chemoresistance of Emu-myc lymphomas harbouring lesions in Pten, Tsc2, Bcl-2, or eIF4E. We show that in some genetic settings, translation elongation inhibitors are able to synergize with doxorubicin by reinstating an apoptotic program in tumor cells. We attribute this effect to a reduction in levels of pro-oncogenic or pro-survival proteins having short half-lives, like Mcl-1, cyclin D1 or c-Myc. Using lymphomas cells grown ex vivo we reproduced the synergy observed in mice between chemotherapy and elongation inhibition and show that this is reversed by blocking protein degradation with a proteasome inhibitor. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results indicate that depleting short-lived pro-survival factors by inhibiting their synthesis could achieve a therapeutic response in tumors harboring PTEN/AKT/mTOR pathway mutations.","['Robert, Francis', 'Carrier, Marilyn', 'Rawe, Svea', 'Chen, Samuel', 'Lowe, Scott', 'Pelletier, Jerry']","['Robert F', 'Carrier M', 'Rawe S', 'Chen S', 'Lowe S', 'Pelletier J']","['Department of Biochemistry, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",,['eng'],['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090501,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin D1/metabolism', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Depsipeptides/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E/genetics', 'Female', 'Genes, bcl-2', 'Genes, myc', 'Harringtonines/pharmacology', 'Homoharringtonine', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/genetics', 'Peptide Chain Elongation, Translational/*drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/metabolism', 'Quassins/pharmacology', 'Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 2 Protein', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics']",2009/05/05 09:00,2009/08/18 09:00,['2009/05/05 09:00'],"['2009/01/30 00:00 [received]', '2009/04/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/05 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/18 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0005428 [doi]'],ppublish,PLoS One. 2009;4(5):e5428. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0005428.

Most antitumor drugs, among them DNA topoisomerase (topo) inhibitors, target nuclear DNA. The aim of the present study was to explore feasibility of the assessment of DNA damage response (DDR) as potential biomarker, eventually related to the clinical response, during treatment of human leukemias. We have measured DDR as reported by activation of ATM through its phosphorylation on Ser 1981 (ATM-S1981(P)) concurrent with histone H2AX phosphorylation on Ser139 (gammaH2AX) in leukemic blast cells from the blood of twenty patients, 16 children/adolescents and 4 adults, diagnosed with acute leukemias and treated with topo2 inhibitors doxorubicin, daunomycin, mitoxantrone or idarubicin. Phosphorylation of H2AX and ATM was detected using phospho-specific Abs and measured in individual cells by flow cytometry. The increase in the level of ATM-S1981(P) and gammaH2AX, varying in extent between the patients, was observed in blasts from the blood collected one hour after completion of the drug infusion with respect to the pre-treatment level. A modest degree of correlation was observed between the induction of ATM activation and H2AX phosphorylation in blasts of individual patients. The number of the studied patients (20) and the number of the clinically non-responding ones (2) was too low to draw a conclusion whether the assessment of DDR can be clinically prognostic. The present findings, however, demonstrate the feasibility of assessment of DDR during the treatment of leukemias with drugs targeting DNA.","['Halicka, H Dorota', 'Ozkaynak, M Fevzi', 'Levendoglu-Tugal, Oya', 'Sandoval, Claudio', 'Seiter, Karen', 'Kajstura, Malgorzata', 'Traganos, Frank', 'Jayabose, Somasunadaram', 'Darzynkiewicz, Zbigniew']","['Halicka HD', 'Ozkaynak MF', 'Levendoglu-Tugal O', 'Sandoval C', 'Seiter K', 'Kajstura M', 'Traganos F', 'Jayabose S', 'Darzynkiewicz Z']","['Brander Cancer Research Institute, Department of Pathology, New York Medical College, Valhalla, NY 10595, USA.']",,['eng'],"['R01 CA028704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 28 704/PHS HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090630,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*blood/metabolism', 'Child', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Topoisomerases/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*blood/metabolism', 'Daunorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Histones/*blood/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Mitoxantrone/therapeutic use', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*blood/metabolism', 'Topoisomerase Inhibitors', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*blood/metabolism']",2009/05/05 09:00,2009/07/29 09:00,['2009/05/05 09:00'],"['2009/05/05 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/29 09:00 [medline]']","['8598 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.8.11.8598 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2009 Jun 1;8(11):1720-4. doi: 10.4161/cc.8.11.8598.

NK cells cytotoxicity is regulated by a balance between stimulatory and inhibitory signals. Interleukin-2 is known to increase NK cell cytotoxicity. Although many cytokines have been studied in efforts to induce durable NK cell expansions, most reports indicate a rather modest effect and the requirement for additional stimuli. We found that contact with the K562 myeloid leukemia cell line, genetically modified to express a membrane-bound form of interleukin-15 and the ligand for the costimulatory molecule 4-1BB, induced vigorous expansion of NK cells from peripheral blood. Based on these findings, we developed a method for large-scale clinical-grade expansion of NK cells. This method is currently used to expand allogeneic NK cells for infusion in patients with leukemia and solid tumors. We here summarize methods for expansion and activation of NK cells from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells as well as clinical-scale methods to produce NK cells for immunotherapy under Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) conditions.","['Cho, Duck', 'Campana, Dario']","['Cho D', 'Campana D']","[""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.""]",,['eng'],"['P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA113482/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA113482/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA113482-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,Korea (South),Korean J Lab Med,The Korean journal of laboratory medicine,101322822,IM,"['Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology/*transplantation', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Neoplasms/immunology/*therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy']",2009/05/05 09:00,2009/08/28 09:00,['2009/05/05 09:00'],"['2009/05/05 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/28 09:00 [medline]']","['200904089 [pii]', '10.3343/kjlm.2009.29.2.89 [doi]']",ppublish,Korean J Lab Med. 2009 Apr;29(2):89-96. doi: 10.3343/kjlm.2009.29.2.89.,['0 (Interleukin-2)'],,,62,PMC2771620,['NIHMS154271'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated whether Survivin mediates the enhanced survival of primary hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) resulting from ITD-Flt3 signaling. Ectopic ITD-Flt3 mutants increased Survivin expression in Ba/F3 cells downstream of PI3-kinase/Akt. Treatment of ITD-Flt3(+) human MV4-11 leukemia cells with the ITD-Flt3 inhibitor SU5416 reduced Survivin expression and inhibited cell proliferation. ITD-Flt3 dramatically increased the number of primary mouse marrow c-kit(+), Sca-1(+), Lin(Neg) cells and colony-forming unit granulocyte-macrophages (CFU-GMs) able to proliferate in the absence of growth factors, whereas Survivin deletion significantly reduced growth factor-independent proliferation and increased apoptosis, which was further accentuated by SU5416. Ectopic ITD-Flt3 reduced differentiation of Lin(Neg) marrow cells cultured with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) plus stem cell factor, which was partially blocked by Survivin deletion. In addition, Survivin deletion decreased secondary colony formation induced by ITD-Flt3. Dominant-negative (dn)-Survivin delayed development of acute leukemia in mice that received a transplant of Ba/F3 cells expressing ITD-Flt3. These results suggest that Survivin regulates expansion of ITD-Flt3-transformed HPCs with self-renewal capability and development of ITD-Flt3(+) acute leukemia and that antagonizing Survivin may provide therapeutic benefit for patients with acute leukemia expressing ITD-Flt3.","['Fukuda, Seiji', 'Singh, Pratibha', 'Moh, Akira', 'Abe, Mariko', 'Conway, Edward M', 'Boswell, H Scott', 'Yamaguchi, Seiji', 'Fu, Xin-Yuan', 'Pelus, Louis M']","['Fukuda S', 'Singh P', 'Moh A', 'Abe M', 'Conway EM', 'Boswell HS', 'Yamaguchi S', 'Fu XY', 'Pelus LM']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology and Walther Oncology Center, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, USA. sfukuda@med.shimane-u.ac.jp']",,['eng'],"['R01 HL069669/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL079654/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL069669/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL079654/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090501,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Gene Deletion', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Leukemia/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins', 'Survivin', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics/*metabolism']",2009/05/05 09:00,2009/07/28 09:00,['2009/05/05 09:00'],"['2009/05/05 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/28 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)37105-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-11-188714 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Jul 9;114(2):394-403. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-11-188714.

Promising results were obtained with the combination of zidovudine and interferon-alpha. Chronic ATL has a relatively better outcome, but poor long-term survival is noted when patients are managed with a watchful-waiting policy or with chemotherapy. In ATL cell lines, arsenic trioxide shuts off constitutive NF-kappaB activation and potentiates interferon-alpha apoptotic effects through proteasomal degradation of Tax. Clinically, arsenic/interferon therapy exhibits some efficacy in refractory aggressive ATL patients. These results prompted us to investigate the efficacy and safety of the combination of arsenic, interferon-alpha, and zidovudine in 10 newly diagnosed chronic ATL patients. An impressive 100% response rate was observed including 7 complete remissions, 2 complete remissions but with more than 5% circulating atypical lymphocytes, and 1 partial response. Responses were rapid and no relapse was noted. Side effects were moderate and mostly hematologic. In conclusion, treatment of chronic ATL with arsenic, interferon-alpha, and zidovudine is feasible and exhibits an impressive response rate with moderate toxicity. Long-term follow up will clarify whether this will translate to disease cure.

We report the first case of discordance in an infant monozygotic twin pair. Twin A presented at age 9 months with MLL-ENL(+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia and twin B remains healthy 3 years later. The presence and eventual clearance of a clonal population of MLL-ENL(+) cells was shown in the bone marrow and peripheral blood of twin B. Clearance of this clone was temporally associated with viral-induced cytopenias, suggesting an immune-mediated clearance of the clone before the development of leukemia. Thus, concordance of MLL-rearranged acute leukemia in infant monozygotic twins is not universal. The implications of this case for MLL-rearranged leukemogenesis are discussed.","['Chuk, Meredith K', 'McIntyre, Emily', 'Small, Donald', 'Brown, Patrick']","['Chuk MK', 'McIntyre E', 'Small D', 'Brown P']","['Pediatric Oncology Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA.']",,['eng'],"['K23 CA111728/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA090668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090501,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Clone Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*analysis/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Neutropenia/etiology/immunology', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*analysis/genetics', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology/radiotherapy', 'Preleukemia/complications/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Remission Induction', 'Remission, Spontaneous', 'Respiratory Tract Infections/blood/complications/*immunology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Thrombocytopenia/etiology/immunology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', '*Twins, Monozygotic', 'Virus Diseases/blood/complications/*immunology']",2009/05/05 09:00,2009/08/29 09:00,['2009/05/05 09:00'],"['2009/05/05 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/29 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)37231-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-01-202259 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Jun 25;113(26):6691-4. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-01-202259.

During this workshop we discussed new clinical and experimental data in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) research, particularly focusing on the validity (or otherwise) of corresponding mathematical models and simulations. We were specifically interested in whether the models could shed light on any of the fundamental mechanisms underlying this disease. Moreover, we were aiming to form a new community of clinicians and modelers looking at this disease and to define a common language and theoretical framework within which collaboration could flourish. The workshop showed the role that models can play, not just in trying to fit to existing data or predicting what individual mechanisms or system behaviors might occur, but also in challenging the orthodoxy of the concept of a stem cell and concepts such as ""differentiation"" and ""determination"". For years the prevailing view of a stem cell has been an entity (object) with a fixed set of behaviors and with a pre-determined fate. New perspectives in modeling, coupled with the new data that are being accumulated in the genesis of CML and its treatment, questions these assumptions. We propose how we can reach a consensus about a functional view of stem cells in a more continuous and flexible way and how, within this context, we can investigate the significance of modeling results and how they might impact on our interpretation of experimental observations and the development of new clinical strategies. This paper reports on the workshop and the state-of-the-art models and data from experimental and clinical trials, and sets out a roadmap for more interdisciplinary collaboration between modelers, wet-lab experimentalists, and clinicians interested in CML. It is our strong belief that a more integrated and coherent interdisciplinary approach will further advance the treatment of CML in future years.","['Roeder, Ingo', ""d'Inverno, Mark""]","['Roeder I', ""d'Inverno M""]","['Institute for Medical Informatics, Statistics and Epidemiology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.']",['other participants'],['eng'],['R01 HL046598/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090502,United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Computer Simulation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology/*physiopathology/therapy', 'Models, Biological']",2009/05/05 09:00,2009/09/08 06:00,['2009/05/05 09:00'],"['2009/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/05 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/08 06:00 [medline]']","['S1079-9796(09)00062-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcmd.2009.03.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2009 Jul-Aug;43(1):88-97. doi: 10.1016/j.bcmd.2009.03.003.

We report a potent inhibition of crucial oncogenes by p53 upon reactivation by small-molecule RITA in vitro and in vivo. RITA-activated p53 unleashes the transcriptional repression of antiapoptotic proteins Mcl-1, Bcl-2, MAP4, and survivin; blocks the Akt pathway on several levels; and downregulates c-Myc, cyclin E, and beta-catenin. p53 ablates c-Myc expression via several mechanisms at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional level. We show that the threshold for p53-mediated transrepression of survival genes is higher than for transactivation of proapoptotic targets. Inhibition of oncogenes by p53 reduces the cell's ability to buffer proapoptotic signals and elicits robust apoptosis.

In this study, we examined whether serine threonine tyrosine kinase 1 (STYK1)/novel oncogene with kinase domain (NOK) is overexpressed in patients with acute leukemia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In peripheral blood cells from nonleukemic group and acute leukemic patients, STYK1/NOK messenger RNA (mRNA) expression was analyzed by quantitaive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. The effect of inhibition of STYK1/NOK mRNA on the leukemic cells was also examined. RESULTS: When appropriate, cutoff was set using the values in nonleukemic individuals, positive STYK1/NOK expression was detected in 80.0% of leukemic patients. STYK1/NOK mRNA was highly expressed in the patients with trisomy/tetrasomy 21. mRNA expression began to decrease after chemotherapy with various drugs; this resulted in a decrease in the number of leukemic blasts in the patients' peripheral blood samples. Such changes in the gene expression were also noted in promyelocytic leukemia (M3) patients treated with all-trans retinoic acid. In addition, transfection of small inhibitory RNA against the STYK1/NOK gene into K562 cells inhibited their growth in proportion to the decrease in the mRNA expression. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that STYK1/NOK mRNA is widely expressed in the patients with acute leukemia and suggest that inhibition of this molecule could potentially serve as a novel therapeutic target.","['Kondoh, Takashi', 'Kobayashi, Daisuke', 'Tsuji, Naoki', 'Kuribayashi, Kageaki', 'Watanabe, Naoki']","['Kondoh T', 'Kobayashi D', 'Tsuji N', 'Kuribayashi K', 'Watanabe N']","['Department of Clinical Laboratory Medicine, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090503,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Primers', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2009/05/05 09:00,2009/07/15 09:00,['2009/05/05 09:00'],"['2009/01/26 00:00 [received]', '2009/04/09 00:00 [revised]', '2009/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/05 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/15 09:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(09)00136-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2009.04.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2009 Jul;37(7):824-30. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2009.04.010.

It has been reported that downregulation of JUNB expression is a universal phenomenon in patients with CML due aberrant DNA methylation of its promoter. Based on this, we studied methylation and gene expression levels of JUNB in CML. We analyzed the methylation status of the JUNB gene in 6 cell lines and in 102 patients with CML using several bisulfite PCR assays. JUNB expression was analyzed using real-time PCR and gene expression profiling. JUNB methylation was not observed in any of the cell lines studied, and only in 3% of patients with CML. Despite the lack of JUNB methylation, JUNB was expressed at low levels both in CML cell lines (median dCT -6.86; range -5.87 to -9.61), and in patients with CML in blastic phase (BP) (median dCT -3.95; range -1.48 to -6.29) (p = 0.002). Finally, we evaluated JUNB expression in 82 additional patients with CML by gene expression arrays. We found that JUNB was significantly downregulated in advanced phase CML in contrast to chronic phase CML (median log ratio difference in expression = 0.53). Overall, our results indicate that JUNB expression is downregulated in advanced phase CML through a mechanism independent from DNA methylation.","['Hoshino, Koyu', 'Quintas-Cardama, Alfonso', 'Radich, Jerald', 'Dai, Hongyui', 'Yang, Hui', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo']","['Hoshino K', 'Quintas-Cardama A', 'Radich J', 'Dai H', 'Yang H', 'Garcia-Manero G']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77230-1402, USA.']",,['eng'],"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-85053/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA100067/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-100067/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090505,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Primers', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2009/05/05 09:00,2009/07/30 09:00,['2009/05/05 09:00'],"['2008/11/11 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/27 00:00 [revised]', '2009/03/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/05 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/30 09:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(09)00172-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2009.03.044 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2009 Oct;33(10):1361-6. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2009.03.044.

Octaarginine and PFVYLI were efficiently endocytosed into cells at 37 degrees C but an ability to translocate directly across the plasma membrane at higher peptide concentrations or when uptake experiments were performed on ice was confined to the cationic variant. Octaarginine- and PFVYLI-PAD conjugates were cytotoxic, with KG1a leukaemia cells being more sensitive than HeLa cells and octaarginine-PAD being the most potent conjugate in both cell lines. The effects of the CPP-PAD conjugates on cell morphology and permeability was rapid suggesting that cytotoxicity is partially mediated at the plasma membrane rather than exclusively through induction of apoptosis at the mitochondria. Primary human leukaemia cells were more similar to KG1a cells than HeLa cells, suggesting the relative sensitivity of leukaemia cells to these peptides could be exploited in vivo.","['Watkins, Catherine L', 'Brennan, Paul', 'Fegan, Christopher', 'Takayama, Kentaro', 'Nakase, Ikuhiko', 'Futaki, Shiroh', 'Jones, Arwyn T']","['Watkins CL', 'Brennan P', 'Fegan C', 'Takayama K', 'Nakase I', 'Futaki S', 'Jones AT']","['Welsh School of Pharmacy, Cardiff University, Cardiff, CF10 3NB Wales, UK.']",,['eng'],"['BB/D013038/1/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090504,Netherlands,J Control Release,Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,8607908,IM,"['Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*chemistry', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane Permeability/drug effects', 'Cell Survival', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Oligopeptides/*administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Peptides/*chemistry', 'Temperature']",2009/05/05 09:00,2010/03/10 06:00,['2009/05/05 09:00'],"['2009/03/23 00:00 [received]', '2009/04/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/05 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0168-3659(09)00266-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jconrel.2009.04.028 [doi]']",ppublish,J Control Release. 2009 Dec 16;140(3):237-44. doi: 10.1016/j.jconrel.2009.04.028.

Previous studies reported that misfolded proteins or proteins containing polyglutamine tracts form aggregates with PML, chaperones, and components of the proteasome, supporting a role for PML in misfolded protein degradation. RESULTS: In the current study, we have identified a reactive oxygen species (ROS) dependent aggregation of PML, small ubiquitin-like modifier 1 (SUMO-1), heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and 20S proteasomes in human cell lines that have been transiently transfected with vectors expressing the puromycin resistance gene, puromycin n-acetyl transferase (pac). Immunofluorescent studies demonstrated that PML, SUMO-1, HSP70 and 20S proteasomes aggregated to form nuclear inclusions in multiple cell lines transfected with vectors expressing puromycin (puro) resistance in regions distinct from nucleoli. This effect does not occur in cells transfected with identical vectors expressing other antibiotic resistance genes or with vectors from which the pac sequence has been deleted. Furthermore, ROS scavengers were shown to ablate the effect of puro vectors on protein aggregation in transfected cells demonstrating a dependency of this effect on the redox state of transfected cells. CONCLUSION: Taken together we propose that puromycin vectors may elicit an unexpected misfolded protein response, associated with the formation of nuclear aggresome like structures in human cell lines. This effect has broad implications for cellular behavior and experimental design.","['Moran, Diarmuid M', 'Shen, Hong', 'Maki, Carl G']","['Moran DM', 'Shen H', 'Maki CG']","['Department of Radiation and Cellular Oncology, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA. diarmuidmoran@uchicago.edu']",,['eng'],"['R01 CA108843/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 108843/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090501,England,BMC Cell Biol,BMC cell biology,100966972,IM,"['Cell Line', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intranuclear Inclusion Bodies/drug effects/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/drug effects/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Folding/drug effects', 'Puromycin/*pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'SUMO-1 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",2009/05/05 09:00,2009/07/16 09:00,['2009/05/05 09:00'],"['2009/02/03 00:00 [received]', '2009/05/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/05 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/16 09:00 [medline]']","['1471-2121-10-32 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2121-10-32 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cell Biol. 2009 May 1;10:32. doi: 10.1186/1471-2121-10-32.,"['0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (SUMO1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '4A6ZS6Q2CL (Puromycin)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",,,,PMC2685373,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First, Sab-1 RT exhibits the most efficient dNTP incorporation efficiency at low dNTP concentrations, whereas the other four SIVagm RT proteins display different levels of reduced polymerase activity at low dNTP concentrations. Tan-1 RT exhibited the most restricted dNTP incorporation efficiency. Indeed, the pre-steady state analysis revealed that Sab-1 RT displays tight dNTP binding affinity (K(d) approximately 1-5 microM), comparable to values observed for NL4-3 and HXB2 HIV-1 RTs, whereas the dNTP binding affinity of Tan-1 RT is 6.2, approximately 34.8-fold lower than that of Sab-1 RT. Second, Tan-1 RT fidelity was significantly higher than that of Sab-1 RT. Indeed, Tan-1 RT enzymatically mimics oncoretroviral murine leukemia virus RT which is characterized by its low dNTP binding affinity and high fidelity. This study reports that simultaneous changes in dNTP binding affinity and fidelity of RTs appear to occur among natural SIV variants isolated from African green monkeys.","['Skasko, Mark', 'Diamond, Tracy L', 'Kim, Baek']","['Skasko M', 'Diamond TL', 'Kim B']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Rochester Medical Center, 601 Elmwood Avenue, Box 672, Rochester, New York 14642, USA.']",,['eng'],"['AI049781/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AI49815/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Chlorocebus aethiops/*virology', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'DNA, Viral/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Simian Immunodeficiency Virus/classification/*enzymology']",2009/05/05 09:00,2009/07/31 09:00,['2009/05/05 09:00'],"['2009/05/05 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/31 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/bi900346m [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 2009 Jun 16;48(23):5389-95. doi: 10.1021/bi900346m.,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several reports indicate that in APL cells apoptosis occurs mainly by a mechanism that involves the inhibition of glutathione peroxidase, one of the enzymes that regulates mitochondrial levels of H(2)O(2). Peroxiredoxin (Prx) III, a c-MYC target gene, is also a mitochondria-specific H(2)O(2)-scavenger enzyme. We studied here the role of Prx III during ATO-induced apoptosis in APL-derived NB4 cells, since these cells express high levels of Prx III. The protein and mRNA levels of Prx III decreased during ATO-induced apoptosis of NB4 cells. The downregulation of Prx III occurred before reactive oxygen species accumulation, reduction in the mitochondrial membrane potential and apoptosis. Depletion of Prx III enhanced mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis events. In contrast, overexpression of Prx III led to reduced levels of ATO-induced apoptosis. c-MYC was also downregulated in ATO-treated NB4 cells. Furthermore, depletion of c-MYC also reduced the Prx-III expression levels. Finally chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assays confirmed that downregulation of Prx-III was caused by the reduction of c-MYC levels during ATO-induced apoptosis of NB4 cells. These findings demonstrate a novel apoptotic-response pathway whereby downregulation of Prx-III potentiates ATO-induced apoptosis in APL cells.","['Vivas-Mejia, Pablo E', 'Ozpolat, Bulent', 'Chen, Xian', 'Lopez-Berestein, Gabriel']","['Vivas-Mejia PE', 'Ozpolat B', 'Chen X', 'Lopez-Berestein G']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",,['eng'],"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54CA96300/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5P30CA016672-29/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'DNA Primers', '*Down-Regulation', '*Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Peroxiredoxins/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2009/05/02 09:00,2009/06/20 09:00,['2009/05/02 09:00'],"['2009/05/02 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/20 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.24341 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2009 Jul 15;125(2):264-75. doi: 10.1002/ijc.24341.,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'EC 1.11.1.15 (Peroxiredoxins)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",,,,,,,['Copyright 2009 UICC.'],,,,,,,,,,

Our previous studies demonstrated that berbamine has anti-leukemia activity. In this study, we investigated the anticancer activity of berbamine against human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) HepG2 cells in vitro and in vivo. Berbamine treatment decreased the cell growth in a dose-dependent manner with an IC(50) value of 34.5 +/- 0.5 microM. Flow cytometric analysis of apoptosis using Annexin V/propidium iodide staining showed that the percentage of apoptotic cells was increased in a time-dependent manner. Berbamine treatment increased the expression level of Fas and P53, caused depolarization of mitochondrial membrane and decrease of membrane potential, and activated caspase-3, -8, and -9 in HepG2 cells. Berbamine-induced apoptosis could be blocked by the broad caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk. HepG2 human HCC xenograft mice treated with berbamine showed a significant reduction in tumor growth rates compared to saline-treated mice.

There have been many studies of aggregating binary classifiers to construct a multiclass classifier based on one-versus-the-rest (1R), one-versus-one (11), or other coding strategies, as well as some comparison studies between them. However, the studies found that the best coding depends on each situation. Therefore, a new problem, which we call the ""optimal coding problem,"" has arisen: how can we determine which coding is the optimal one in each situation? To approach this optimal coding problem, we propose a novel framework for constructing a multiclass classifier, in which each binary classifier to be aggregated has a weight value to be optimally tuned based on the observed data. Although there is no a priori answer to the optimal coding problem, our weight tuning method can be a consistent answer to the problem. We apply this method to various classification problems including a synthesized data set and some cancer diagnosis data sets from gene expression profiling. The results demonstrate that, in most situations, our method can improve classification accuracy over simple voting heuristics and is better than or comparable to state-of-the-art multiclass predictors.","['Yukinawa, Naoto', 'Oba, Shigeyuki', 'Kato, Kikuya', 'Ishii, Shin']","['Yukinawa N', 'Oba S', 'Kato K', 'Ishii S']","['Graduate School of Information Sciences, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Ikoma, Nara, Japan. naoto-yu@is.naist.jp']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,IEEE/ACM Trans Comput Biol Bioinform,IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics,101196755,IM,"['*Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bayes Theorem', 'Computer Simulation', 'Esophageal Neoplasms/classification/diagnosis/genetics', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/classification/diagnosis/genetics', '*Models, Statistical', 'Neoplasms/classification/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/classification/diagnosis/genetics']",2009/05/02 09:00,2009/08/29 09:00,['2009/05/02 09:00'],"['2009/05/02 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/29 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1109/TCBB.2007.70239 [doi]'],ppublish,IEEE/ACM Trans Comput Biol Bioinform. 2009 Apr-Jun;6(2):333-43. doi: 10.1109/TCBB.2007.70239.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors have been recently shown to selectively target cells with defects in double-strand DNA repair, the aim of this study was to explore the possibility of exploiting defects in DNA repair in leukemic cells using PARP inhibitors. DESIGN AND METHODS: Leukemic cell lines were exposed to various PARP inhibitors alone and in combination with non-cytotoxic concentrations of DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, 5' aza-2'-deoxycytidine and/or the histone deacetylase inhibitor, MS275, to test for potentiation of apoptosis with these agents. RESULTS: PARP inhibitors, KU-0058948 and PJ34, induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of primary myeloid leukemic cells and myeloid leukemic cell lines in vitro. Immunofluorescence analysis also revealed that PARP inhibitor sensitivity in these leukemic cells was due to a defect in homologous recombination DNA repair. Addition of 5' aza-2'-deoxycytidine failed to increase the cytotoxicity of PARP inhibitors. In contrast, MS275 potentiated the cytotoxic effect of KU-0058948 and PJ34 in all PARP inhibitor-sensitive leukemic cells. Immunofluorescence analysis supported the idea that histone deacetylase inhibitors potentiate cytotoxicity by inhibiting DNA repair processes. Conclusions On the basis of the data presented here, we suggest that PARP inhibitors can potentially exploit defects in double-strand DNA break repair in leukemic cells, paving the way for testing the therapeutic potential of these agents in myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia.","['Gaymes, Terry J', 'Shall, Sydney', 'MacPherson, Lee J', 'Twine, Natalie A', 'Lea, Nicholas C', 'Farzaneh, Farzin', 'Mufti, Ghulam J']","['Gaymes TJ', 'Shall S', 'MacPherson LJ', 'Twine NA', 'Lea NC', 'Farzaneh F', 'Mufti GJ']","[""Department of Haematological, Medicine, King's College, London, The Rayne Institute, 123 Coldharbour Lane, London, UK.""]",,['eng'],"['BB/E005896/1/BB_/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Azacitidine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Benzamides/pharmacology', 'Butyrates/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Modification Methylases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'DNA Repair/*drug effects', 'Decitabine', 'Drug Synergism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Fluorobenzenes/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Histone Acetyltransferases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Phenanthrenes/pharmacology', 'Phthalazines/pharmacology', '*Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'U937 Cells']",2009/05/02 09:00,2009/09/26 06:00,['2009/05/02 09:00'],"['2009/05/02 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/26 06:00 [medline]']","['94/5/638 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2008.001933 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2009 May;94(5):638-46. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2008.001933.,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Fluorobenzenes)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (KU0058948)', '0 (N-(oxo-5,6-dihydrophenanthridin-2-yl)-N,N-dimethylacetamide hydrochloride)', '0 (Phenanthrenes)', '0 (Phthalazines)', '0 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridines)', '1ZNY4FKK9H (entinostat)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DNA Modification Methylases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Histone Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",,,,PMC2675675,,,,,,,,['Haematologica. 2021 Aug 01;106(8):2294.

In this report we show that the intracellular concentration of TAL1 is regulated by transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), which triggers its polyubiquitylation and degradation by the proteasome. This effect is mediated by AKT1, which phosphorylates TAL1 at threonine 90. Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that this event increases association of TAL1 with the E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP. The E47 heterodimerization partner of TAL1 hinders this association.

It is thus necessary to identify high-risk patients as early as possible to effectively individualize treatment. We aimed to define novel molecular risk markers in T-ALL and performed array-based comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH) and expression analyses in 73 patients. We show that DNA copy-number changes are common in T-ALL and affect 70 of 73 (96%) patients. Notably, genomic imbalances predicted to down-regulate the TGF-beta or up-regulate the PI3K-AKT pathways are identified in 25 of 73 (34%) and 21 of 73 (29%) patients, suggesting that these pathways play key roles in T-ALL leukemogenesis. Furthermore, we identified a deletion at 6q15-16.1 in 9 of 73 (12%) of the patients, which predicts poor early treatment response. This deletion includes the CASP8AP2 gene, whose expression is shown to be down-regulated. The interaction of CASP8AP2 with CASP8 plays a crucial role in apoptotic regulation, suggesting a functional link between the clinical effect of the deletion and the molecular mode of action.

Gain of 2p appears to be a marker of progression and may contribute to the poor prognosis.","['Chapiro, Elise', 'Leporrier, Nathalie', 'Radford-Weiss, Isabelle', 'Bastard, Christian', 'Mossafa, Hossein', 'Leroux, Dominique', 'Tigaud, Isabelle', 'De Braekeleer, Marc', 'Terre, Christine', 'Brizard, Francoise', 'Callet-Bauchu, Evelyne', 'Struski, Stephanie', 'Veronese, Lauren', 'Fert-Ferrer, Sandra', 'Taviaux, Sylvie', 'Lesty, Claude', 'Davi, Frederic', 'Merle-Beral, Helene', 'Bernard, Olivier A', 'Sutton, Laurent', 'Raynaud, Sophie D', 'Nguyen-Khac, Florence']","['Chapiro E', 'Leporrier N', 'Radford-Weiss I', 'Bastard C', 'Mossafa H', 'Leroux D', 'Tigaud I', 'De Braekeleer M', 'Terre C', 'Brizard F', 'Callet-Bauchu E', 'Struski S', 'Veronese L', 'Fert-Ferrer S', 'Taviaux S', 'Lesty C', 'Davi F', 'Merle-Beral H', 'Bernard OA', 'Sutton L', 'Raynaud SD', 'Nguyen-Khac F']","[""Service d'hematologie biologique, CHU Pitie-Salpetriere, Universite Paris 6, France.""]",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090429,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 2', 'Gene Dosage', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics']",2009/05/02 09:00,2010/02/19 06:00,['2009/05/02 09:00'],"['2009/02/25 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/25 00:00 [revised]', '2009/03/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/02 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(09)00166-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2009.03.042 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2010 Jan;34(1):63-8. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2009.03.042.

We examined whether the ability of bisphosphonates to induce osteoclast apoptosis and inhibit bone resorption in vitro is influenced by the cytokine receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand (RANKL), an important mediator of inflammation-induced bone loss. METHODS: Rabbit osteoclasts were treated with the bisphosphonates clodronate or alendronate for up to 48 hours in the absence or presence of RANKL. Changes in cell morphology and induction of apoptosis were examined by scanning electron microscopy, whilst resorptive activity was determined by measuring the area of resorption cavities. Changes in the level of anti-apoptotic proteins, including Mcl-1, Bcl-2, and Bcl-x>L, were determined in rabbit osteoclasts and in cytokine-starved mouse osteoclasts by Western blotting. RESULTS: RANKL significantly attenuated the ability of both clodronate and alendronate to induce osteoclast apoptosis and inhibit bone resorption. Treatment of rabbit osteoclasts with RANKL was associated with an increase in the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 but not Bcl-2. A role for Mcl-1 in osteoclast survival was suggested using osteoclasts generated from mouse bone marrow macrophages in the presence of RANKL + macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) since cytokine deprivation of mouse osteoclasts caused a rapid loss of Mcl-1 (but not Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL), which preceded the biochemical and morphological changes associated with apoptosis. Loss of Mcl-1 from mouse osteoclasts could be prevented by factors known to promote osteoclast survival (RANKL, M-CSF, tumour necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-alpha], or lipopolysaccharide [LPS]). CONCLUSIONS: RANKL protects osteoclasts from the apoptosis-inducing and anti-resorptive effects of bisphosphonates in vitro. The ability of RANKL (and other pro-inflammatory factors such as TNF-alpha and LPS) to increase the level of Mcl-1 in osteoclasts may explain the lack of effectiveness of some bisphosphonates in preventing inflammation-induced bone loss.","['Sutherland, Karen A', 'Rogers, Helena L', 'Tosh, Denise', 'Rogers, Michael J']","['Sutherland KA', 'Rogers HL', 'Tosh D', 'Rogers MJ']","['Bone & Musculoskeletal Research Programme, School of Medicine & Dentistry, Institute of Medical Sciences, University of Aberdeen, Foresterhill, Aberdeen, UK.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090430,England,Arthritis Res Ther,Arthritis research & therapy,101154438,IM,"['Alendronate/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Clodronic Acid/pharmacology', 'Cyclin D1/metabolism', 'Diphosphonates/*pharmacology', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Osteoclasts/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'RANK Ligand/*metabolism', 'Rabbits', 'bcl-X Protein/metabolism']",2009/05/02 09:00,2009/07/29 09:00,['2009/05/02 09:00'],"['2008/06/25 00:00 [received]', '2009/04/08 00:00 [revised]', '2009/04/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/02 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/29 09:00 [medline]']","['ar2681 [pii]', '10.1186/ar2681 [doi]']",ppublish,Arthritis Res Ther. 2009;11(2):R58. doi: 10.1186/ar2681.

The clinical course and long-term outcome of patients experiencing this complication has not been extensively detailed. PROCEDURE: We reviewed the clinical course for all children with ALL diagnosed with pancreatitis at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute/Children's Hospital Boston between 1987 and 2003. The outcome of these patients was compared with that of patients with ALL who did not experience pancreatitis. RESULTS: Twenty-eight of 403 children (7%) were diagnosed with pancreatitis. Patients 10-18 years old at diagnosis had 2.4 times the risk of developing pancreatitis compared with younger patients. Pancreatitis typically occurred early in the course of therapy (median 4 weeks after first dose of asparaginase). Ninety-three percent of affected patients were hospitalized and 57% received parenteral nutrition. No patient developed chronic sequelae or died as a result of pancreatitis. Sixteen (57%) patients were re-treated with asparaginase, 10 of whom had another episode of pancreatitis. No significant differences in event-free survival were observed when comparing patients with and without a history of pancreatitis. CONCLUSION: Asparaginase-associated pancreatitis was more common in older children, and caused significant acute morbidity. It tended to occur after the first few doses of asparaginase, suggesting a predisposition to this complication rather than a cumulative drug effect. Re-treatment with asparaginase after an episode of pancreatitis was associated with a high risk of recurrent pancreatitis.","['Kearney, Susan L', 'Dahlberg, Suzanne E', 'Levy, Donna E', 'Voss, Stephan D', 'Sallan, Stephen E', 'Silverman, Lewis B']","['Kearney SL', 'Dahlberg SE', 'Levy DE', 'Voss SD', 'Sallan SE', 'Silverman LB']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology, Blood and Marrow Transplantation, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA. kearn054@umn.edu']",,['eng'],"['P01 CA068484/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA068484-13/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA068484-139001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5P01CA68484/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Asparaginase/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/epidemiology', 'Pancreatitis/*chemically induced/therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/05/01 09:00,2009/07/10 09:00,['2009/05/01 09:00'],"['2009/05/01 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/10 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22076 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2009 Aug;53(2):162-7. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22076.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",,,,PMC2721691,['NIHMS110197'],,"['(c) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,

We assessed neuropsychological functioning in a population-based cohort of young adult childhood ALL survivors. PROCEDURE: Neuropsychological testing was performed on 64 survivors an average of 20 years after the diagnosis. The test battery included verbal intelligence quotient (VIQ) and performance intelligence quotient (PIQ), memory function, orientation and attention as well as motor performance. Cranial irradiation had been administered to 44 survivors as part of ALL treatment, whereas 20 survivors had been treated solely with chemotherapy. A control group consisted of 45 healthy young adults. Earlier neuropsychological test results of 45 of the survivors were available for comparison. RESULTS: The ALL survivors attained significantly lower test scores than the controls in all the neuropsychological function areas. The mean VIQ test scores were 91, 100, and 109 (P < 0.001), and the mean PIQ test scores 100, 111, and 118 (P < 0.001) for the irradiated survivors, non-irradiated survivors and controls, respectively. Memory and motor functions were impaired among the irradiated survivor group compared with the controls. A significant decline in PIQ and VIQ test scores was observed in the irradiated survivor group during the follow-up period, but only in VIQ in the non-irradiated group.

Survival analysis, using the Cox multivariate regression, for gender (P = 0.659, CI: 0.852-1.161), age (P = 0.943, CI: 0.725-1.225), symptom-diagnosis interval (P = 0.002, CI: 1.116-1.668), WCC (P < 0.001, CI: 1.353-1.814) and platelet count (P = 0.001, CI: 0.546-0.849) was performed. Bulk disease (P = 0.049, CI: 0.428-0.986), mediastinal adenopathy (P = 0.045, CI: 1.040-3.697), WCC (P = 0.016, CI: 1.395-2.691), platelet count (P = 0.031, CI: 0.431-0.967) and administration of 2 intensification blocks (P = 0.012, CI: 0.624-0.940) were found to be significant predictors of outcome by multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The management of ALL requires financial resources and access to quality supportive care. One third of our patients opted for no therapy. The other problem areas were a high proportion of therapy defaulters, lost to follow up and infection related deaths during induction and remission phases. The introduction of remedial measures for resolving the difficulties identified would hopefully improve cure rates in ALL in developing nations.","['Kulkarni, K P', 'Marwaha, R K', 'Trehan, A', 'Bansal, D']","['Kulkarni KP', 'Marwaha RK', 'Trehan A', 'Bansal D']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Advanced Pediatric Center, PGIMER, Chandigarh, India.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'India', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*mortality/physiopathology', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/05/01 09:00,2009/07/10 09:00,['2009/05/01 09:00'],"['2009/05/01 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/10 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.21897 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2009 Aug;53(2):168-73. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21897.,,,,,,,['Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2010 Jan;54(1):178; author reply 179.

Eight FA proteins (FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG, FANCL and FANCM) and three non-FA proteins (FAAP100, FAAP24 and HES1) form an FA nuclear core complex, which is required for monoubiquitination of the FANCD2-FANCI dimer upon DNA damage. FANCL possesses a PHD/RING-finger domain and is a putative E3 ubiquitin ligase subunit of the core complex. In this study, we report an FA patient with an unusual presentation belonging to the FA-L complementation group. The patient lacks an obvious FA phenotype except for the presence of a cafe-au-lait spot, mild hypocellularity and a family history of leukemia. The molecular diagnosis and identification of the FA subgroup was achieved by FA complementation assay. We identified bi-allelic novel mutations in the FANCL gene and functionally characterized them.

This study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) in down-regulating Mcl-1 expression and its mechanism of RA synovial fibroblast sensitization to TNFalpha-induced apoptosis. METHODS: EGCG effects on cultured RA synovial fibroblast cell morphology, proliferation, and viability over 72 hours were determined by microscopy and a fluorescent cell enumeration assay. Caspase 3 activity was determined by a colorimetric assay. Western blotting was used to evaluate the apoptosis mediators poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), Mcl-1, Bcl-2, Akt, and nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB. RESULTS: In RA synovial fibroblasts, EGCG (5-50 microM) inhibited constitutive and TNFalpha-induced Mcl-1 protein expression in a concentration- and time-dependent manner (P<0.05). Importantly, EGCG specifically abrogated Mcl-1 expression in RA synovial fibroblasts and affected Mcl-1 expression to a lesser extent in osteoarthritis and normal synovial fibroblasts or endothelial cells. Inhibition of Mcl-1 by EGCG triggered caspase 3 activity in RA synovial fibroblasts, which was mediated via down-regulation of the TNFalpha-induced Akt and NF-kappaB pathways. Caspase 3 activation by EGCG also suppressed RA synovial fibroblast growth, and this effect was mimicked by Akt and NF-kappaB inhibitors. Interestingly, Mcl-1 degradation by EGCG sensitized RA synovial fibroblasts to TNFalpha-induced PARP cleavage and apoptotic cell death. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that EGCG itself induces apoptosis and further sensitizes RA synovial fibroblasts to TNFalpha-induced apoptosis by specifically blocking Mcl-1 expression and, hence, may be of promising adjunct therapeutic value in regulating the invasive growth of synovial fibroblasts in RA.","['Ahmed, Salahuddin', 'Silverman, Matthew D', 'Marotte, Hubert', 'Kwan, Kevin', 'Matuszczak, Natalie', 'Koch, Alisa E']","['Ahmed S', 'Silverman MD', 'Marotte H', 'Kwan K', 'Matuszczak N', 'Koch AE']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-2200, USA. salahmed@umich.edu']",,['eng'],"['AR-48267/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AT003633/AT/NCCIH NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 AR055741/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 AR055741-01A1/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AR048267-05/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'AR-055741/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI040987-08/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AR048267/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-40987/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AT-003633/AT/NCCIH NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI040987/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,Arthritis Rheum,Arthritis and rheumatism,0370605,IM,"['Anticarcinogenic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/*metabolism/physiopathology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 3/analysis', 'Catechin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Down-Regulation/physiology', 'Fibroblasts/physiology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Osteoarthritis/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*analysis', 'Synovial Membrane/cytology/*physiopathology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",2009/05/01 09:00,2009/07/01 09:00,['2009/05/01 09:00'],"['2009/05/01 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/01 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/art.24488 [doi]'],ppublish,Arthritis Rheum. 2009 May;60(5):1282-93. doi: 10.1002/art.24488.,"['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '8R1V1STN48 (Catechin)', 'BQM438CTEL (epigallocatechin gallate)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",,,,PMC2917979,['NIHMS221345'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We conducted a single-institution prospective study to analyze the impact of these angiogenic factors and the expression of their receptors on the survival of adult patients newly diagnosed with AML. We investigated the levels of VEGF transcript isoforms VEGF121, -145, -165, -189 and -206 and their receptors, VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2, using quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assays in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 67 consecutive AML patients at diagnosis. VEGF total protein was measured for comparison with mRNA levels in PBMCs. The VEGF121 splice variant transcript in AML PBMCs was significantly higher than in the normal controls. VEGF transcripts were quantified in all samples while its protein was detected in 42/67 (63%) of AML samples. High levels of VEGF121, VEGF165 transcripts and VEGF protein in AML were significantly related to a worse prognosis when analyzing overall survival (p<0.0001, p=0.019 and p=0.012, respectively) or event-free survival (p<0.0001, p=0.010 and p=0.047) using univariate analysis. In multivariable analysis only VEGF121 expression remained an independent prognostic factor for either event-free survival or overall survival [aHR=8.83 (3.48-22.4), p<0.0001, and aHR=9.52 (3.41-26.6), p<0.0001]. No prognostic value was observed for the other isoforms and the two receptors. Our findings show that the level of VEGF121 mRNA in circulating cells from AML patients is a strong independent prognostic parameter, which could be useful in the management of unselected AML patients.","['Mourah, Samia', 'Porcher, Raphael', 'Lescaille, Geraldine', 'Rousselot, Philippe', 'Podgorniak, Marie-Pierre', 'Labarchede, Geraldine', 'Naimi, Benyoussef', 'Medioni, Jacques', 'Dombret, Herve', 'Calvo, Fabien']","['Mourah S', 'Porcher R', 'Lescaille G', 'Rousselot P', 'Podgorniak MP', 'Labarchede G', 'Naimi B', 'Medioni J', 'Dombret H', 'Calvo F']","['INSERM U716, Laboratoire de Pharmacologie AP-HP, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France. samia.mourah@sls.aphp.fr']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Int J Biol Markers,The International journal of biological markers,8712411,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Base Sequence', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood/*genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoassay', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Isoforms/blood/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/blood/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/blood/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/*blood/*genetics', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1/*genetics', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",2009/05/01 09:00,2009/08/13 09:00,['2009/05/01 09:00'],"['2009/05/01 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/13 09:00 [medline]']",['10.5301/jbm.2009.3178 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Biol Markers. 2009 Jan-Mar;24(1):22-31. doi: 10.5301/jbm.2009.3178.,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (VEGFA protein, human)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Size fractionation was performed on CHROMA SPIN-400 columns. cDNA fragments longer than 500 bps were ligated into the lambdaZAPExpress vector. The recombinant DNA was packaged in vitro with Gigapack III gold packaging extract. The titers of the primary and amplified library were 1.0 x 10(5) and 5.0 x 10(9) pfu/ml, respectively. To characterize the constructed cDNA library, 15 phage plaques were selected randomly to test the inserted fragments. The results showed that the inserts were mostly longer than 500 bps. To test the utility, the library was screened with primers designed for three immune-related genes of, Myxovirus resistant (Mx), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and Toll-like receptor (TLR). Results of Blastn and alignment showed that they are members of Mx, TNF-alpha and TLR gene families, respectively, which meets our anticipates for this cDNA library as an immune-related one.

Mothers of A-T children, obligate ATM heterozygote mutation carriers, have a breast cancer (BC) relative risk of about 3. The frequency of ATM carriers in BC women with a BC family history has been estimated to be 2.70%. To further our clinical understanding of familial BC and examine whether haematological malignancies are predictive of ATM germline mutation, we estimated the frequency of heterozygote mutation carriers in a series of 122 BC women with a family history of both BC and haematological malignancy and without BRCA1/2 mutation. The gene screening was performed with a new high throughput method, EMMA (enhanced mismatch mutation analysis). Amongst 28 different ATM variants, eight mutations have been identified in eight patients: two mutations leading to a putative truncated protein and six being likely deleterious mutations. One of the truncating mutations was initially interpreted as a missense mutation, p.Asp2597Tyr, but is actually a splice mutation (c.7789G>T/p.Asp2597_Lys2643>LysfsX3).

METHODS: Jurkat human acute lymphocytic leukemia cells and HeLa cells transfected with a tet-regulated Bcl-2 expression system were treated with ABT-737 or its less active stereoisomer. GSH concentrations, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), caspase activation and apoptotic DNA fragmentation were measured. RESULTS: ABT-737 induced oxidative stress through decreased GSH and increased intracellular hydrogen peroxide and superoxide levels. Apoptotic DNA fragmentation and caspase activation were the consequences of this oxidative stress. Combining ABT-737 with ROS-inducing agents such as adaphostin or etoposide enhanced cell death. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that inhibition of Bcl-2 causes a loss of GSH, an increase in ROS, caspase activation and subsequent apoptosis. Clinically, redox alterations as a consequence of Bcl-2 inhibition by ABT-737 should be considered in devising combination therapies with this novel agent or its derivatives.","['Howard, Adrienne N', 'Bridges, Kathleen A', 'Meyn, Raymond E', 'Chandra, Joya']","['Howard AN', 'Bridges KA', 'Meyn RE', 'Chandra J']","['Department of Pediatrics Research, The University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center, Box 853, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",,['eng'],"['R01 CA115811/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA69003/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090429,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Biphenyl Compounds/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Caspases/drug effects/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Glutathione/*drug effects/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Nitrophenols/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects', 'Piperazines/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Stereoisomerism', 'Sulfonamides/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Superoxides/metabolism', 'Transfection']",2009/05/01 09:00,2009/10/14 06:00,['2009/05/01 09:00'],"['2008/12/22 00:00 [received]', '2009/04/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/01 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00280-009-1001-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2009 Dec;65(1):41-54. doi: 10.1007/s00280-009-1001-1.

However, plasma exposure to the drug from a given dosing regimen can vary widely among patients. Reasons for this may include incomplete adherence, intrinsic variations in the metabolism of imatinib, and drug-drug interactions. Data from two recent studies have shown a correlation between imatinib trough plasma concentration and clinical response, leading to suggestions that maintaining imatinib blood concentrations above approximately 1000 ng/ml might be associated with improved outcomes. In patients who do not respond as well as expected to initial imatinib treatment, measurement of trough plasma concentration could assist with decisions about whether to increase the dose. Blood-level testing may also be helpful in other clinical scenarios: for example, when poor adherence is suspected, adverse reactions are unusually severe, or there is a possible drug-drug interaction. Further work is required to confirm prospectively the link between imatinib plasma concentrations and response, and to define effective trough concentrations in different patient populations. However, based on the current data, imatinib blood-level testing seems to be a useful aid when making clinical decisions in CML.","['Cortes, J E', 'Egorin, M J', 'Guilhot, F', 'Molimard, M', 'Mahon, F-X']","['Cortes JE', 'Egorin MJ', 'Guilhot F', 'Molimard M', 'Mahon FX']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA. jcortes@mdanderson.org']",,['eng'],['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20090430,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Drug Interactions', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Intestinal Absorption', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Medication Adherence', 'Orosomucoid/metabolism', 'Piperazines/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Binding', 'Pyrimidines/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Failure']",2009/05/01 09:00,2009/09/24 06:00,['2009/05/01 09:00'],"['2009/05/01 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/24 06:00 [medline]']","['leu200988 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.88 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Sep;23(9):1537-44. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.88.

GC-induced apoptosis involves an intrinsic mitochondria-dependent pathway. We and others have shown that BIM (BCL-2 interacting mediator of cell death), a BH3-only pro-apoptotic protein, is up-regulated by dexamethasone (Dex) treatment in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells and plays an essential role in Dex-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, BIM is inactivated by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-mediated phosphorylation. We therefore hypothesized co-treatment with Dex and MEK/ERK inhibitors would promote apoptosis in ALL cells through BIM up-regulation and activation. We show here that MEK inhibitors (PD184352 and PD98059) synergistically enhance Dex lethality in a variety of ALL cells and in two primary ALL specimens. Co-treatment with Dex and PD184352 results in BIM accumulation, pro-apoptotic BAX/BAK activation, and cytochrome c release from mitochondria. Down-regulation of BIM by short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) in ALL cells suppressed BAX/BAK activation, cytochrome c release, and cell death by Dex/PD184352 co-treatment. BIM accumulated by this treatment sequesters anti-apoptotic BCL-XLMCL-1, resulting in the release of BAK from these anti-apoptotic molecules. This study provides a rational foundation for future attempts to improve the activity of GCs with clinically relevant pharmacologic MEK inhibitors in the treatment of ALL and possibly other hematologic malignancies.","['Rambal, A A', 'Panaguiton, Z L G', 'Kramer, L', 'Grant, S', 'Harada, H']","['Rambal AA', 'Panaguiton ZL', 'Kramer L', 'Grant S', 'Harada H']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Massey Cancer Center, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA 23298, USA.']",,['eng'],"['R01 CA100866/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA100866-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA134473/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA100866/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090430,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Benzamides/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dexamethasone/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Synergism', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 1/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Subcellular Fractions', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",2009/05/01 09:00,2009/11/06 06:00,['2009/05/01 09:00'],"['2009/05/01 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/06 06:00 [medline]']","['leu200980 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.80 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Oct;23(10):1744-54. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.80.

The transmission of HTLV-1 from HTLV-1-positive cells (MT-2 cells) to HTLV-1-negative cells (XC cells) was considered to be prevented by Phx-1, Phx-2, or Phx-3 because the syncytium formation between these cells was inhibited markedly in the presence of these phenoxazines. The present results suggest that Phx-1, Phx-2, and, in particular, Phx-3 may be useful as therapeutic agents against ATL, which is extremely refractory to current therapies.","['Miyano-Kurosaki, Naoko', 'Ikegami, Kou', 'Kurosaki, Kunihiko', 'Endo, Takahiko', 'Aoyagi, Hoshimi', 'Hanami, Mari', 'Yasumoto, Jun', 'Tomoda, Akio']","['Miyano-Kurosaki N', 'Ikegami K', 'Kurosaki K', 'Endo T', 'Aoyagi H', 'Hanami M', 'Yasumoto J', 'Tomoda A']","['Department of Life and Environmental Sciences, Chiba Institute of Technology, Japan.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090429,Japan,J Pharmacol Sci,Journal of pharmacological sciences,101167001,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Giant Cells/pathology', 'HTLV-I Infections/transmission/virology', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Necrosis', 'Oxazines/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Rats', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2009/05/01 09:00,2009/07/03 09:00,['2009/05/01 09:00'],"['2009/05/01 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/03 09:00 [medline]']","['JST.JSTAGE/jphs/08347FP [pii]', '10.1254/jphs.08347fp [doi]']",ppublish,J Pharmacol Sci. 2009 May;110(1):87-97. doi: 10.1254/jphs.08347fp.

We show that amyloidogenic fragments known as semen-derived enhancer of virus infection (SEVI) originating from prostatic acid phosphatase greatly increase XMRV infections of primary prostatic epithelial and stromal cells. Hybrid simian/human immunodeficiency chimeric virus particles pseudotyped with XMRV envelope protein were used to demonstrate that the enhancing effect of SEVI, or of human semen itself, was at the level of viral attachment and entry. SEVI enhanced XMRV infectivity but did not bypass the requirement for the xenotropic and polytropic retrovirus receptor 1. Furthermore, XMRV RNA was detected in prostatic secretions of some men with prostate cancer. The fact that the precursor of SEVI is produced in abundance by the prostate indicates that XMRV replication occurs in an environment that provides a natural enhancer of viral infection, and this may play a role in the spread of this virus in the human population.","['Hong, Seunghee', 'Klein, Eric A', 'Das Gupta, Jaydip', 'Hanke, Kirsten', 'Weight, Christopher J', 'Nguyen, Carvell', 'Gaughan, Christina', 'Kim, Kyeong-Ae', 'Bannert, Norbert', 'Kirchhoff, Frank', 'Munch, Jan', 'Silverman, Robert H']","['Hong S', 'Klein EA', 'Das Gupta J', 'Hanke K', 'Weight CJ', 'Nguyen C', 'Gaughan C', 'Kim KA', 'Bannert N', 'Kirchhoff F', 'Munch J', 'Silverman RH']","['Department of Cancer Biology, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio 44195, USA.']",,['eng'],['CA104943/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20090429,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Acid Phosphatase', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fibroblasts/enzymology/virology', 'Gammaretrovirus/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*enzymology/*virology', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae Infections/*enzymology/*virology']",2009/05/01 09:00,2009/07/25 09:00,['2009/05/01 09:00'],"['2009/05/01 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/25 09:00 [medline]']","['JVI.00268-09 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00268-09 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2009 Jul;83(14):6995-7003. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00268-09.

EBNA-LP localizes predominantly in the nucleus through the action of nuclear localization signals in the repeated regions of the protein. EBNA-LP has also been detected in the cytoplasm, and a previous study suggested that some of the EBNA-LP coactivation function is mediated by relocalizing histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Although EBNA-LP can be found in the cytoplasm, it has no obvious nuclear export signal, and there is no direct evidence for active shuttling between these cellular compartments. Whether active shuttling between the nucleus and cytoplasm is required for coactivation remains to be clarified. To address these issues, we tested a variety of EBNA-LP isoforms and mutants for nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling activity in an interspecies heterokaryon assay and for the ability to associate with HDAC4. EBNA-LP isoforms smaller than 42 kDa shuttle efficiently in the heterokaryon assay via a crm-1-independent mechanism. In addition, no specific EBNA-LP domain that mediates nuclear export could be identified. In contrast, an EBNA-LP 62-kDa isoform does not demonstrate detectable shuttling in the heterokaryon assay yet still coactivates EBNA2 similarly to the smaller EBNA-LP isoforms. All of the EBNA-LP mutants tested, including the coactivation-deficient DeltaCR3 mutant and the nonshuttling 62-kDa isoform, were capable of associating with HDAC4. Taken together, our results suggest that simple diffusion may account for the nuclear export observed with smaller isoforms of EBNA-LP, that nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling is not required for efficient EBNA-LP coactivation function, and that competence for HDAC4 association is not sufficient to mediate nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling or EBNA-LP coactivation in the absence of a functional interaction with Sp100A.","['Ling, Paul D', 'Tan, Jie', 'Peng, RongSheng']","['Ling PD', 'Tan J', 'Peng R']","['Department of Molecular Virology and Microbiology, Baylor College of Medicine, One Baylor Plaza, Houston, Texas 77030, USA. pling@bcm.tmc.edu']",,['eng'],['R01 CA124309/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090429,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/*metabolism/virology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Histone Deacetylases/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Protein Transport', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Viral Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism']",2009/05/01 09:00,2009/07/25 09:00,['2009/05/01 09:00'],"['2009/05/01 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/25 09:00 [medline]']","['JVI.00654-09 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00654-09 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2009 Jul;83(14):7109-16. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00654-09.

When EBV infection induces RUNX3, the consequent reduction in RUNX1 levels is required for the ensuing cell proliferation because forced expression of RUNX1 in an EBV lymphoblastoid cell line prevented cell proliferation. The TEL-RUNX1 fusion gene from acute B-lymphocytic leukemia retains almost all of the RUNX1 sequence but does not prevent B-cell proliferation in the same assay. B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) was found to be induced by conditionally expressed RUNX3 in a lymphoma cell line. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that RUNX3 binds to the RUNX1 promoter in a lymphoblastoid cell line and a Burkitt's lymphoma cell line. The TLE binding VWRPY sequence from the C terminus of RUNX3 was found to be required for repression of the RUNX1 P1 promoter in a B-lymphoma cell line. The mechanism of repression in B-cell lines most likely involves recruitment of corepressor TLE3 or TLE4 to the RUNX1 promoter.

METHODS: In human embryoid bodies (hEBs) derived from spontaneous differentiation of chESC3, a hESC cell line we established previously, the expressions of such genes as KDR, Bmi1, Scl and gata2 were detected by RT-PCR every other day during the 12-day differentiation to monitor the process of the hematopoiesis. The hematopoietic stem cell marker CD34 was examined using flow cytometry to evaluate the efficiency of hematopoietic differentiation of the cells on days 6, 8, 10 and 12. The spontaneously differentiated hESCs were seeded in the hematopoietic colony culture system to study the hematopoietic colony forming ability. Immunocytochemical staining for CD45 was performed on the hEBs to examine the emergence of mature hematopoietic cells. RESULTS: The expressions of the hematopoietic stem cell-related genes KDR and Bmi-1 were detected in the hESCs, and on days 4 to 6, the two genes were upregulated with prolonged cuture of the hEBs. Scl and gata2 gene expressions were detected since 6-8 days of culture and maintained high expressions till day 12. Flow cytometry revealed a gradual increase in CD34-positive cells in the culture, with positivity rates on days 6, 8, 10, and 12 of (1.4-/+0.4)%, (3.4-/+1.3)%, (5.5-/+2.2)%, and (5.1-/+1.7)%, respectively. The numbers of CD43-positive cell colonies on days 6, 8, 10, and 12 were 0, 7-/+2, 37-/+11, and 89-/+29 in each 10(5) cells, respectively.

Moreover, multiplexed stable isotope reagents designed for MS/MS-based quantification of peptides rely on accurate and robust detection of low-mass fragments for all precursors. Collectively these observations suggest that beam-type or tandem in-space MS/MS measurements, such as that available on traditional triple quadrupole mass spectrometers, may provide beneficial figures of merit for quantitative proteomics analyses. The recent introduction of a multipole collision cell adjacent to an Orbitrap mass analyzer provides for higher energy collisionally activated dissociation (HCD) with efficient capture of fragment ions over a wide mass range. Here we describe optimization of various instrument and post-acquisition parameters that collectively provide for quantification of iTRAQ-labeled phosphorylated peptides isolated from complex cell lysates. Peptides spanning a concentration dynamic range of 100:1 are readily quantified. Our results indicate that appropriate parameterization of collision energy as a function of precursor m/z and z provides for optimal performance in terms of peptide identification and relative quantification by iTRAQ.

However, the mechanisms involved in the regulation of BIM in CML and its role in the clinical setting have not been established. DESIGN AND METHODS: We analysed the mRNA expression of BIM in 100 newly diagnosed patients with CML in chronic phase by Q-RT-PCR and the protein levels by Western blot analysis. Methylation status was analysed by bisulphite genomic sequencing and MSP. CML cell lines were treated with imatinib and 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, and were transfected with two different siRNAs against BIM and cell proliferation and apoptosis were analysed. RESULTS: We demonstrated that down-regulation of BIM expression was present in 36% of the patients and was significantly associated with a lack of optimal response to imatinib as indicated by the decrease in cytogenetic and molecular responses at 6, 12 and 18 months in comparison with patients with normal BIM expression (p<0.05). Expression of BIM was mediated by promoter hypermethylation as demonstrated by restoration of BIM expression after treatment of CML cells with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. Using CML cell lines with low and normal expression of BIM we further demonstrated that the expression of BIM is required for imatinib-induced CML apoptosis. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that down-regulation of BIM is epigenetically controlled by methylation in a percentage of CML patients and has an unfavourable prognostic impact, and that the combination of imatinib with a de-methylating agent may result in improved responses in patients with decreased expression of BIM.","['San Jose-Eneriz, Edurne', 'Agirre, Xabier', 'Jimenez-Velasco, Antonio', 'Cordeu, Lucia', 'Martin, Vanesa', 'Arqueros, Victor', 'Garate, Leire', 'Fresquet, Vicente', 'Cervantes, Francisco', 'Martinez-Climent, Jose A', 'Heiniger, Anabel', 'Torres, Antonio', 'Prosper, Felipe', 'Roman-Gomez, Jose']","['San Jose-Eneriz E', 'Agirre X', 'Jimenez-Velasco A', 'Cordeu L', 'Martin V', 'Arqueros V', 'Garate L', 'Fresquet V', 'Cervantes F', 'Martinez-Climent JA', 'Heiniger A', 'Torres A', 'Prosper F', 'Roman-Gomez J']","['Hematology Department and Area of Cell Therapy, Clinica Universitaria, Foundation for Applied Medical Research, University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090504,England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Azacitidine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Modification Methylases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Decitabine', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects/*genetics', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical/methods', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2009/05/01 09:00,2009/08/12 09:00,['2009/05/01 09:00'],"['2009/01/07 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/23 00:00 [revised]', '2009/04/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/01 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/12 09:00 [medline]']","['S0959-8049(09)00249-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejca.2009.04.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 2009 Jul;45(10):1877-89. doi: 10.1016/j.ejca.2009.04.005.

Because of its relevance to BioMedicine, we have sought to obtain a detailed characterization of AM Omics in Homo sapiens, namely its Genomics and Evolution, Transcriptomics, Proteomics, Interactomics, Oncogenomics, and Pharmacogenomics. METHODS: This project exploited the methodology commonly used in Computational Biology (i.e., mining of many omics databases of the web) as well as the High Throughput biomolecular analytical techniques. RESULTS: In Homo sapiens AM is comprised of 342 protein-encoding genes (possessing either anti- or pro-apoptotic activity, or a regulatory function) and 110 MIR-encoding genes targeting them: some have a critical role within the system (core AM nodes), others perform tissue-, pathway-, or disease-specific functions (peripheral AM nodes). By overlapping the cancer type-specific AM mutation map in the fourteen most frequent cancers in western societies (breast, colon, kidney, leukaemia, liver, lung, neuroblastoma, ovary, pancreas, prostate, skin, stomach, thyroid, and uterus) to their transcriptome, proteome and interactome in the same tumour type, we have identified the most prominent AM molecular alterations within each class. The comparison of the fourteen mutated AM networks (both protein- as MIR-based) has allowed us to pinpoint the hubs with a general and critical role in tumour development and, conversely, in cell physiology: in particular, we found that some of these had already been used as targets for pharmacological anticancer therapy. For a better understanding of the relationship between AM molecular alterations and pharmacological induction of apoptosis in cancer, we examined the expression of AM genes in K562 and SH-SY5Y after anticancer treatment. CONCLUSION: We believe that our data on the Apoptotic Machinery will lead to the identification of new cancer genes and to the discovery of new biomarkers, which could then be used to profile cancers for diagnostic purposes and to pinpoint new targets for pharmacological therapy. This approach could pave the way for future studies and applications in molecular and clinical Medicine with important perspectives both for Oncology as for Regenerative Medicine.","['Di Pietro, Cinzia', 'Ragusa, Marco', 'Barbagallo, Davide', 'Duro, Laura R', 'Guglielmino, Maria R', 'Majorana, Alessandra', 'Angelica, Rosario', 'Scalia, Marina', 'Statello, Luisa', 'Salito, Loredana', 'Tomasello, Luisa', 'Pernagallo, Salvo', 'Valenti, Salvo', ""D'Agostino, Vito"", 'Triberio, Patrizio', 'Tandurella, Igor', 'Palumbo, Giuseppe A', 'La Cava, Piera', 'Cafiso, Viviana', 'Bertuccio, Taschia', 'Santagati, Maria', 'Li Destri, Giovanni', 'Lanzafame, Salvatore', 'Di Raimondo, Francesco', 'Stefani, Stefania', 'Mishra, Bud', 'Purrello, Michele']","['Di Pietro C', 'Ragusa M', 'Barbagallo D', 'Duro LR', 'Guglielmino MR', 'Majorana A', 'Angelica R', 'Scalia M', 'Statello L', 'Salito L', 'Tomasello L', 'Pernagallo S', 'Valenti S', ""D'Agostino V"", 'Triberio P', 'Tandurella I', 'Palumbo GA', 'La Cava P', 'Cafiso V', 'Bertuccio T', 'Santagati M', 'Li Destri G', 'Lanzafame S', 'Di Raimondo F', 'Stefani S', 'Mishra B', 'Purrello M']","['Dipartimento di Scienze BioMediche, Sezione di Biologia Generale, Biologia Cellulare, Genetica Molecolare G Sichel, Unita di Biologia Genomica e dei Sistemi Complessi, Genetica, Bioinformatica, Universita di Catania, 95123 Catania, Italy. dipietro@unict.it']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090430,England,BMC Med Genomics,BMC medical genomics,101319628,,,2009/05/01 09:00,2009/05/01 09:01,['2009/05/01 09:00'],"['2008/10/15 00:00 [received]', '2009/04/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/01 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/01 09:01 [medline]']","['1755-8794-2-20 [pii]', '10.1186/1755-8794-2-20 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Med Genomics. 2009 Apr 30;2:20. doi: 10.1186/1755-8794-2-20.,,,,,PMC2683874,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesized that granulocytes could generate volatile organic compounds. METHODS: To begin to test this, we developed a bioreactor and analytical GC-MS system to accurately identify and quantify gases in trace concentrations (parts per billion) emitted solely from cell/media culture. A human promyelocytic leukemia cell line, HL60, frequently used to assess neutrophil function, was grown in serum-free medium. RESULTS: HL60 cells released acetaldehyde and hexanaldehyde in a time-dependent manner. The mean +/- SD concentration of acetaldehyde in the headspace above the cultured cells following 4-, 24- and 48-h incubation was 157 +/- 13 ppbv, 490 +/- 99 ppbv, 698 +/- 87 ppbv. For hexanaldehyde these values were 1 +/- 0.3 ppbv, 8 +/- 2 ppbv, and 11 +/- 2 ppbv. In addition, our experimental system permitted us to identify confounding trace gas contaminants such as styrene. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that human immune cells known to mimic the function of innate immune cells, like neutrophils, produce volatile gases that can be measured in vitro in trace amounts.","['Shin, Hye-Won', 'Umber, Brandon J', 'Meinardi, Simone', 'Leu, Szu-Yun', 'Zaldivar, Frank', 'Blake, Donald R', 'Cooper, Dan M']","['Shin HW', 'Umber BJ', 'Meinardi S', 'Leu SY', 'Zaldivar F', 'Blake DR', 'Cooper DM']","['Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA 92697, USA. hyewons@uci.edu']",,['eng'],"['P01 HD048721/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL080947/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-HL-080947/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-HD-048721/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090429,England,J Transl Med,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,IM,"['Acetaldehyde/*analysis', 'Aldehydes/*analysis', 'Bioreactors', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Culture Media', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes/cytology/*metabolism', 'Styrene/analysis', 'Volatile Organic Compounds/analysis']",2009/05/01 09:00,2009/07/09 09:00,['2009/05/01 09:00'],"['2008/12/09 00:00 [received]', '2009/04/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/01 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/09 09:00 [medline]']","['1479-5876-7-31 [pii]', '10.1186/1479-5876-7-31 [doi]']",epublish,J Transl Med. 2009 Apr 29;7:31. doi: 10.1186/1479-5876-7-31.,"['0 (Aldehydes)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Volatile Organic Compounds)', '44LJ2U959V (Styrene)', '9DC2K31JJQ (n-hexanal)', 'GO1N1ZPR3B (Acetaldehyde)']",,,,PMC2683805,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although STLS is a serious and potentially fatal complication in patients with neoplastic disorders, few investigations have addressed the relevance of clinical and laboratory features in assessing prognosis. A retrospective study was conducted, reviewing the records of all patients who developed acute renal failure (ARF) at Chang Gung memorial hospital between 1 July 1999 and 30 June 2003. STLS-induced acute uric acid nephropathy was identified in 12 of 1072 ARF patients (1.1%) during the study period. All patients had advanced stage tumours with large tumour burden, and 66.7% of cases had abdominal organ involvement. All 12 hyperuricemic patients became oliguric despite conservative therapy, and remained hyperuricemic (21.6 +/- 5.2 mg/dl) before dialysis therapy. Diuresis developed in eight patients (66.7%), with associated resolution of hyperuricemia, azotemia and metabolic derangements following dialysis initiation. Overall hospital mortality was 58.3%. Death in most patients was related to hyponatremia and hypoalbuminemia on admission. The serum sodium was found to have the best Youden index (0.86) and highest overall prediction accuracy (93%). Moreover, serum sodium and serum albumin for individual patients were significantly and positively correlated (r = 0.617, p = 0.032).

Loss of response on imatinib is often because of BCR-ABL mutations. Dasatinib is a 325-fold more potent inhibitor of Bcr-Abl than imatinib and has been associated with high rates of durable responses in patients with CML in chronic phase (CP) after imatinib failure. METHODS: To determine the optimal time for initiating dasatinib after loss of response on imatinib, data from dasatinib trials in CML-CP were analyzed. Patients were grouped according to whether they received early intervention with dasatinib (ie, after cytogenetic recurrence on imatinib), rather than after both cytogenetic and hematologic recurrence. RESULTS: Overall, 72% of patients who received dasatinib after loss of a major cytogenetic response (MCyR) on imatinib achieved a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) compared with 42% of patients who were treated after loss of both MCyR and complete hematologic response (CHR). Event-free survival (EFS) also was higher after earlier dasatinib treatment (24-month EFS rates: 89% after loss of MCyR on imatinib vs 29% after loss of both MCyR and CHR). Among patients who were treated after loss of CHR on imatinib with no prior MCyR, 26% achieved a CCyR with dasatinib, and the 24-month EFS rate was 64%. In all 3 groups, CCyR rates were similar in patients with or without pre-existing BCR-ABL mutations. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study suggested that optimal outcomes are achieved when dasatinib is administered early after imatinib resistance.","['Quintas-Cardama, Alfonso', 'Cortes, Jorge E', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'Liu, David', 'Bleickardt, Eric', 'Chen, Tai-Tsang', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M']","['Quintas-Cardama A', 'Cortes JE', ""O'Brien S"", 'Ravandi F', 'Borthakur G', 'Liu D', 'Bleickardt E', 'Chen TT', 'Kantarjian HM']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

Although in recent years chemoimmunotherapeutic combinations such as fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab have induced response rates of 95% in previously untreated patients and increased the rates of failure-free survival, CLL remains incurable for many patients because of a lack of disease response or the development of refractoriness to fludarabine. Fludarabine-refractory disease is defined as CLL that does not respond to fludarabine or that recurs within 6 months of treatment with a fludarabine-containing regimen. The natural course of the disease is associated with poor survival. Salvage therapeutic strategies include alemtuzumab-containing regimens, targeted agents, and allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Single-agent alemtuzumab induces response in up to 40% of patients with fludarabine-refractory CLL, but responses are not durable, and the median survival is approximately 1 to 2 years. Alemtuzumab is also combined with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and/or rituximab, and other agents such as lenalidomide and flavopiridol, as well as targeted agents, and used in fludarabine-refractory CLL. Cumulative evidence suggests that allogeneic stem cell transplantation is an efficacious therapeutic strategy for patients who do not respond to fludarabine or who develop disease recurrence within 12 months after purine analog treatment. In conclusion, chemoimmunotherapy regimens that include alemtuzumab and/or rituximab and allogeneic stem cell transplantation improve the prognosis of this disease, but there is a continued need for novel, more effective therapies.","['Tsimberidou, Apostolia-Maria', 'Keating, Michael J']","['Tsimberidou AM', 'Keating MJ']","['Department of Investigational Cancer Therapeutics, The University of Texas M.

The Life Span Study cohort of Japanese A-bomb survivors, a large cohort that includes all ages and both sexes with a wide range of well-characterised doses, is the primary resource for estimating carcinogenic risks from low linear energy transfer external exposure. Extensive data on persons exposed for therapeutic or diagnostic medical reasons offer the opportunity to study fractionated exposure, risks at high therapeutic doses, and risks of site-specific cancers in non-Japanese populations. Studies of persons exposed for occupational and environmental reasons allow a direct evaluation of exposure at low doses and dose rates, and also provide information on different types of radiation such as radon and iodine-131. This article summarises the findings from these studies with emphasis on studies with well-characterised doses. CONCLUSIONS: Epidemiologic studies provide the necessary data for quantifying cancer risks as a function of dose and for setting radiation protection standards. Leukaemia and most solid cancers have been linked with radiation. Most solid cancer data are reasonably well described by linear-dose response functions although there may be a downturn in risks at very high doses. Persons exposed early in life have especially high relative risks for many cancers, and radiation-related risk of solid cancers appears to persist throughout life.","['Gilbert, Ethel S']",['Gilbert ES'],"['Radiation Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA. gilberte@mail.nih.gov']",,['eng'],['Z99 CA999999/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Int J Radiat Biol,International journal of radiation biology,8809243,IM,"['Environmental Exposure/adverse effects', '*Epidemiologic Studies', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Radiation Injuries/*complications', 'Risk']",2009/04/30 09:00,2009/08/13 09:00,['2009/04/30 09:00'],"['2009/04/30 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/13 09:00 [medline]']","['910782193 [pii]', '10.1080/09553000902883836 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Biol. 2009 Jun;85(6):467-82. doi: 10.1080/09553000902883836.,,,,101,PMC2859619,['NIHMS190343'],,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: In this study, dual-colour real-time RT-PCR was used to quantify the expression of Mcl-1 splicing variants in malignant and paired normal renal tissue samples, obtained from 93 ccRCC patients (median follow-up: 45 months) undergoing radical nephrectomy. RESULTS: Over-expression of the anti-apoptotic Mcl-1L variant in ccRCC occurred in nearly 60% of the paired samples (p = 0.004). Decreased expression, however, was related to poor tumour differentiation (p = 0.013) and independently predicted a higher risk for relapse (hazard rate 3.99; 95% CI 1.32-12.04; p = 0.014). Kaplan-Meier analyses revealed down-regulation of Mcl-1L in ccRCC to be associated with a markedly shortened recurrence-free and disease-specific survival, particularly in patients with locally advanced (p < 0.001 and p = 0.003) and poorly differentiated tumours (p = 0.004 and p = 0.011). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest Mcl-1L to provide a molecular parameter for outcome prediction in ccRCC patients, down-regulation indicating exceptionally aggressive tumour phenotypes.","['Kempkensteffen, Carsten', 'Hinz, Stefan', 'Johannsen, Manfred', 'Krause, Hans', 'Magheli, Ahmed', 'Christoph, Frank', 'Kollermann, Jens', 'Schrader, Mark', 'Schostak, Martin', 'Miller, Kurt', 'Weikert, Steffen']","['Kempkensteffen C', 'Hinz S', 'Johannsen M', 'Krause H', 'Magheli A', 'Christoph F', 'Kollermann J', 'Schrader M', 'Schostak M', 'Miller K', 'Weikert S']","['Department of Urology, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany. carsten.kempkensteffen@charite.de']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090427,Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Carcinoma, Renal Cell/*diagnosis/*genetics/mortality/pathology', '*Down-Regulation', 'Female', '*Gene Expression', 'Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics/metabolism', '*RNA Splicing']",2009/04/30 09:00,2009/06/26 09:00,['2009/04/30 09:00'],"['2008/11/27 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/04/30 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/26 09:00 [medline]']","['000215826 [pii]', '10.1159/000215826 [doi]']",ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2009;30(2):73-9. doi: 10.1159/000215826.

However, with notable exceptions such as acute promyelocytic leukemia, significant improvements in outcome based on these insights have not been forthcoming. Acute myeloid leukemia is a paradigm of cancer stem (or leukemia initiating) cells with hierarchy analogous to that seen in hematopoiesis. Normal hematopoiesis requires complex bidirectional interactions between the bone marrow microenvironment (or niche) and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). These interactions are critical for the maintenance of normal HSC quiescence and perturbations can influence HSC self-renewal. Leukemia stem cells (LSCs), which also possess limitless self-renewal, may hijack these homeostatic mechanisms, take refuge within the sanctuary of the niche during chemotherapy, and consequently contribute to eventual disease relapse. We will discuss the emerging evidence supporting the importance of the bone marrow microenvironment in LSC survival and consider the physiologic interactions of HSCs and the niche that inform our understanding of microenvironment support of LSCs. Finally, we will discuss approaches for the rational development of therapies that target the microenvironment.","['Lane, Steven W', 'Scadden, David T', 'Gilliland, D Gary']","['Lane SW', 'Scadden DT', 'Gilliland DG']","[""Division of Hematology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA. swlane@partners.org""]",,['eng'],['Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20090428,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Communication', 'Cell Survival', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', '*Homeostasis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology']",2009/04/30 09:00,2009/09/09 06:00,['2009/04/30 09:00'],"['2009/04/30 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)37448-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-01-202606 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Aug 6;114(6):1150-7. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-01-202606.

This paper considers Pareto optimal designs for gene expression studies involving 2-color microarrays. Pareto optimality enables the recommendation of designs that are particularly efficient for the effects of most interest to biologists. This is relevant in the microarray context where analysis is typically carried out separately for those effects. Our approach will allow for effects of interest that correspond to contrasts rather than solely considering parameters of the linear model. We further develop the approach to cater for additional experimental considerations such as contrasts that are of equal scientific interest. This amounts to partitioning all relevant contrasts into subsets of effects that are of equal importance. Based on the partitions, a penalty is employed in order to recommend designs for complex and varied microarray experiments. Finally, we address the issue of gene-specific dye bias.

To explore this possibility, the effects on human lymphocytes of two mannose-specific and structurally closely related lectins, Morniga M from Morus nigra and artocarpin from Artocarpus integrifolia were investigated. In silico analysis revealed that Morniga M presents a more largely open carbohydrate-binding cavity than artocarpin, probably allowing interactions with a broader spectrum of carbohydrate moieties. In vitro, Morniga M interacted strongly with the lymphocyte surface and was uptaken quickly by cells. Morniga M and artocarpin triggered the proliferation and activation of human T and NK lymphocytes. A minority of B lymphocytes was activated in artocarpin-treated culture, whereas Morniga M favored the emergence of CD4+ CD8+ T lymphocytes. Moreover, cell death occurred in activated PBMC, activated T lymphocytes, and Jurkat T leukemia cells incubated with Morniga M only. The biological effects of both lectins were dependent on carbohydrate recognition. The Morniga M-induced cell death resulted, at least in part, from caspase-dependent apoptosis and FADD-dependent receptor-mediated cell death. Finally, Morniga M, but not artocarpin, triggered AICD of T lymphocytes. In conclusion, both lectins trigger lymphocyte activation, but only Morniga M induces cell death. In spite of similar in vitro mannose-binding specificities and virtually identical structure, only Morniga M probably interacts with carbohydrate moieties bound to molecules able to induce cell death. The present data suggest that subtle alterations in N-glycans can distinguish activation and cell death molecules at the lymphocyte surface.","['Benoist, Herve', 'Culerrier, Raphael', 'Poiroux, Guillaume', 'Segui, Bruno', 'Jauneau, Alain', 'Van Damme, Els J M', 'Peumans, Willy J', 'Barre, Annick', 'Rouge, Pierre']","['Benoist H', 'Culerrier R', 'Poiroux G', 'Segui B', 'Jauneau A', 'Van Damme EJ', 'Peumans WJ', 'Barre A', 'Rouge P']","['INSERM U.858 I2MR, Toulouse, France. herve.benoist@inserm.fr']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090428,United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Artocarpus/chemistry', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*drug effects', 'Mannose-Binding Lectins/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Morus/chemistry', 'Plant Lectins/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*drug effects']",2009/04/30 09:00,2009/08/20 09:00,['2009/04/30 09:00'],"['2009/04/30 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/20 09:00 [medline]']","['jlb.0708434 [pii]', '10.1189/jlb.0708434 [doi]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2009 Jul;86(1):103-14. doi: 10.1189/jlb.0708434.

Cancer testis antigens (CTA), in particular, fulfill this requirement as a result of their aberrant expression restricted to cancer cells and lack of expression in normal tissues bypassing tolerogenic mechanisms against self. Although CTAs have been extensively studied in solid malignancies, little is known regarding their expression in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Using a two-pronged approach we evaluated the immunogenicity of 29 CTAs in 22 patients with CLL and correlated these results to reverse transcriptase PCR data from CLL cell lines and patient cells. RESULTS: We identified IgG-specific antibodies for one antigen, NXF2, and confirmed this response by ELISA and Western blot. We found that treatment of CLL with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine can induce expression of NXF2 that lasted for several weeks after treatment. Treatment also increased levels of MHC and costimulatory molecules (CD80, CD86, and CD40) necessary for antigen presentation. In addition, we identified other promising antigens that may have potential immunotherapeutic application. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that NXF2 could be further pursued as an immunotherapeutic target in CLL, and that treatment with demethylating agents could be exploited to specifically modulate CTA expression and effective antigen presentation in malignant B cells.","['Dubovsky, Jason A', 'McNeel, Douglas G', 'Powers, John J', 'Gordon, John', 'Sotomayor, Eduardo M', 'Pinilla-Ibarz, Javier A']","['Dubovsky JA', 'McNeel DG', 'Powers JJ', 'Gordon J', 'Sotomayor EM', 'Pinilla-Ibarz JA']","['H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL, USA.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090428,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/blood/genetics/*immunology', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'B7-1 Antigen/immunology', 'B7-2 Antigen/immunology', 'Blotting, Western', 'CD40 Antigens/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects', 'DNA Modification Methylases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Decitabine', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2009/04/30 09:00,2009/08/04 09:00,['2009/04/30 09:00'],"['2009/04/30 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/04 09:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-08-2099 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-2099 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2009 May 15;15(10):3406-15. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-2099.

As of today, clinical criteria to predict the development of imatinib resistance in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), other than rebound of the myeloproliferation, are under development. However, there is evidence that the control of glucose-substrate flux is an important mechanism of the antiproliferative action of imatinib because imatinib-resistant gastrointestinal stromal KIT-positive tumors reveal highly elevated glucose uptake in radiologic images. We used nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and gas chromatography mass spectrometry to assess (13)C glucose uptake and metabolism (glycolysis, TCA cycle, and nucleic acid ribose synthesis) during imatinib treatment in CML cell lines with different sensitivities to imatinib. Our results show that sensitive K562-s and LAMA84-s BCR-ABL-positive cells have decreased glucose uptake, decreased lactate production, and an improved oxidative TCA cycle following imatinib treatment. The resistant K562-r and LAMA84-r cells maintained a highly glycolytic metabolic phenotype with elevated glucose uptake and lactate production. In addition, oxidative synthesis of RNA ribose from (13)C-glucose via glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase was decreased, and RNA synthesis via the nonoxidative transketolase pathway was increased in imatinib-resistant cells. CML cells which exhibited a (oxidative/nonoxidative) flux ratio for nucleic acid ribose synthesis of >1 were sensitive to imatinib. The resistant K562-r and LAMA84-r exhibited a (oxidative/nonoxidative) flux ratio of <0.7. The changes in glucose uptake and metabolism were accompanied by intracellular translocation of GLUT-1 from the plasma membrane into the intracellular fraction in sensitive cells treated with imatinib, whereas GLUT-1 remained located at the plasma membrane in LAMA84-r and K562-r cells. The total protein load of GLUT-1 was unchanged among treated sensitive and resistant cell lines. In summary, elevated glucose uptake and nonoxidative glycolytic metabolic phenotype can be used as sensitive markers for early detection of imatinib resistance in BCR-ABL-positive cells.","['Kominsky, Douglas J', 'Klawitter, Jelena', 'Brown, Jaimi L', 'Boros, Laszlo G', 'Melo, Junia V', 'Eckhardt, S Gail', 'Serkova, Natalie J']","['Kominsky DJ', 'Klawitter J', 'Brown JL', 'Boros LG', 'Melo JV', 'Eckhardt SG', 'Serkova NJ']","['Department of Anesthesiology, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, CO, USA.

Initial studies from our laboratory, previously published, indicated that expression of HCV core in insect cells can direct the formation of capsid-like particles lacking the envelope glycoproteins. These protein nanospheres, morphologically similar to natural capsids, were shown to be taken up by human hepatic cells and to produce cell-signalling events. To follow the intracellular fate of these particles we fused the core protein to eGFP. We demonstrate that the chimeric proteins core(173)-eGFP, eGFP-core(191) and eGFP-core(173) can be efficiently expressed, self-assembled, and form fluorescent non-enveloped capsid-like particles. By using confocal microscopy and FACS analysis, we provide evidence that the fluorescent nanospheres can not only enter human hepatic cells - the main target of HCV - but also human immune cells such as T and B lymphocytes, as well as human myeloid leukaemia cells differentiated along the monocyte/macrophage-like pathway. The fluorescent particles might thus be used to trace the intracellular trafficking of naked HCV capsids as showed by live microscopy and to further understand their biological significance.","['Katsarou, Konstantina', 'Serti, Elisavet', 'Tsitoura, Panagiota', 'Lavdas, Alexandros A', 'Varaklioti, Agoritsa', 'Pickl-Herk, Angela-Maria', 'Blaas, Dieter', 'Oz-Arslan, Devrim', 'Zhu, Rong', 'Hinterdorfer, Peter', 'Mavromara, Penelope', 'Georgopoulou, Urania']","['Katsarou K', 'Serti E', 'Tsitoura P', 'Lavdas AA', 'Varaklioti A', 'Pickl-Herk AM', 'Blaas D', 'Oz-Arslan D', 'Zhu R', 'Hinterdorfer P', 'Mavromara P', 'Georgopoulou U']","['Molecular Virology Laboratory, Hellenic Pasteur Institute, 11521 Athens, Greece.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090504,France,Biochimie,Biochimie,1264604,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/virology', 'Capsid/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/*analysis/genetics/metabolism', 'Hepacivirus/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'Hepatocytes/*virology', 'Humans', 'Monocytes/virology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/analysis/genetics/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/virology', 'Viral Core Proteins/*analysis/genetics/metabolism', '*Virus Internalization']",2009/04/30 09:00,2009/08/21 09:00,['2009/04/30 09:00'],"['2009/01/09 00:00 [received]', '2009/04/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/04/30 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/21 09:00 [medline]']","['S0300-9084(09)00109-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.biochi.2009.04.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochimie. 2009 Jul;91(7):903-15. doi: 10.1016/j.biochi.2009.04.016.

Reactivation can occur spontaneously, but more typically is triggered by immunosuppressive therapy of cancer, autoimmune disease, or organ transplantation. Reactivation can be transient and clinically silent, but often causes a flare of disease that can be severe resulting in acute hepatic failure. Most instances of reactivation resolve spontaneously, but if immune suppression is continued, re-establishment of chronic hepatitis occurs which can lead to progressive liver injury and cirrhosis. The best-described instances of reactivation occur in hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) carriers with inactive or minimally active disease who are given cancer chemotherapy for lymphoma or leukemia. Typically, serum HBV DNA rises during chemotherapy, followed by a disease flare and HBV DNA clearance with immune reconstitution after chemotherapy is stopped. Special forms of reactivation occur after solid organ and bone marrow transplantation in which chronic infection often results. Several randomized, placebo-controlled trials have shown that reactivation can be prevented by antiviral prophylaxis. Routine prophylaxis is therefore recommended for persons with HBsAg undergoing cancer chemotherapy or transplantation, but major questions remain.

Rats were treated with CCl4 for 4 weeks, and this was followed by a direct injection of HUMSCs into their livers. After 4 more weeks of CCl4 treatment (8 weeks in all), rats with HUMSC transplants [CCl4 (8W)+HUMSC liver] exhibited a significant reduction in liver fibrosis, as evidenced by Sirius red staining and a collagen content assay, in comparison with rats treated with CCl4 for 8 weeks without HUMSC transplants [CCl4 (8W)]. Moreover, rats in the CCl4 (8W)+HUMSC (liver) group had significantly lower levels of serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, glutamic pyruvate transaminase, alpha-smooth muscle actin, and transforming growth factor-beta1 in the liver, whereas the expression of hepatic mesenchymal epithelial transition factor-phosphorylated type (Met-P) and hepatocyte growth factor was up-regulated, in comparison with the CCl4 (8W) group. Notably, engrafted HUMSCs scattered mostly in the hepatic connective tissue but did not differentiate into hepatocytes expressing human albumin or alpha-fetoprotein. Instead, these engrafted, undifferentiated HUMSCs secreted a variety of bioactive cytokines that may restore liver function and promote regeneration. Human cytokine assay revealed that the amounts of human cutaneous T cell-attracting chemokine, leukemia inhibitory factor, and prolactin were substantially greater in the livers of the CCl4 (8W)+HUMSC (liver) group, with considerably reduced hepatic inflammation manifested by a micro positron emission tomography scan. Our findings suggest that xenogeneic transplantation of HUMSCs is a novel approach for treating liver fibrosis and may be a promising therapeutic intervention in the future.","['Tsai, Pei-Chun', 'Fu, Tz-Win', 'Chen, Yi-Ming Arthur', 'Ko, Tsui-Ling', 'Chen, Tien-Hua', 'Shih, Yang-Hsin', 'Hung, Shih-Chieh', 'Fu, Yu-Show']","['Tsai PC', 'Fu TW', 'Chen YM', 'Ko TL', 'Chen TH', 'Shih YH', 'Hung SC', 'Fu YS']","['Institute of Anatomy and Cell Biology, School of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan, Republic of China.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Liver Transpl,Liver transplantation : official publication of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the International Liver Transplantation Society,100909185,IM,"['Alanine Transaminase/blood', 'Animals', 'Aspartate Aminotransferases/blood', 'Carbon Tetrachloride', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury/pathology/surgery', 'Chemokine CCL27/metabolism', 'Collagen/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Fibrosis/chemically induced/metabolism/pathology/*surgery', 'Hepatic Stellate Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Liver/metabolism/pathology/*surgery', '*Liver Regeneration', 'Male', '*Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Prolactin/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Time Factors', 'Umbilical Cord/cytology/metabolism']",2009/04/29 09:00,2009/07/10 09:00,['2009/04/29 09:00'],"['2009/04/29 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/10 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/lt.21715 [doi]'],ppublish,Liver Transpl. 2009 May;15(5):484-95. doi: 10.1002/lt.21715.,"['0 (CCL27 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CCL27)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '9002-62-4 (Prolactin)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)', 'CL2T97X0V0 (Carbon Tetrachloride)', 'EC 2.6.1.1 (Aspartate Aminotransferases)', 'EC 2.6.1.2 (Alanine Transaminase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

WAS is caused by mutations in the protein WASP which impair its interaction with the WIPF1 protein. Here, we aim to identify a module of WIPF1-coexpressed genes and to assess its use as a prognostic signature for colorectal cancer, glioma, and breast cancer patients. Two public colorectal cancer microarray data sets were used for discovery and validation of the WIPF1 co-expression module. Based on expression of the WIPF1 signature, we classified more than 400 additional tumors with microarray data from our own experiments or from publicly available data sets according to their WIPF1 signature expression. This allowed us to separate patient populations for colorectal cancers, breast cancers, and gliomas for which clinical characteristics like survival times and times to relapse were analyzed. Groups of colorectal cancer, breast cancer, and glioma patients with low expression of the WIPF1 co-expression module generally had a favorable prognosis. In addition, the majority of WIPF1 signature genes are individually correlated with disease outcome in different studies. Literature gene network analysis revealed that among WIPF1 co-expressed genes known direct transcriptional targets of c-myc, ESR1 and p53 are enriched. The mean expression profile of WIPF1 signature genes is correlated with the profile of a proliferation signature. The WIPF1 signature is the first microarray-based prognostic expression signature primarily developed for colorectal cancer that is instrumental in other tumor types: low expression of the WIPF1 module is associated with better prognosis.","['Staub, Eike', 'Groene, Joern', 'Heinze, Maya', 'Mennerich, Detlev', 'Roepcke, Stefan', 'Klaman, Irina', 'Hinzmann, Bernd', 'Castanos-Velez, Esmeralda', 'Pilarsky, Christian', 'Mann, Benno', 'Brummendorf, Thomas', 'Weber, Birgit', 'Buhr, Heinz-Johannes', 'Rosenthal, Andre']","['Staub E', 'Groene J', 'Heinze M', 'Mennerich D', 'Roepcke S', 'Klaman I', 'Hinzmann B', 'Castanos-Velez E', 'Pilarsky C', 'Mann B', 'Brummendorf T', 'Weber B', 'Buhr HJ', 'Rosenthal A']","['Department of Computational Molecular Biology, Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics, Berlin, Germany. eike.staub@nucleolus.net']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090428,Germany,J Mol Med (Berl),"Journal of molecular medicine (Berlin, Germany)",9504370,IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Brain Neoplasms/diagnosis/genetics', 'Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/diagnosis/genetics', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*genetics', 'Neoplasms/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics', 'Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein, Neuronal/genetics/metabolism']",2009/04/29 09:00,2009/09/02 06:00,['2009/04/29 09:00'],"['2008/11/25 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/02/24 00:00 [revised]', '2009/04/29 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00109-009-0467-y [doi]'],ppublish,J Mol Med (Berl). 2009 Jun;87(6):633-44. doi: 10.1007/s00109-009-0467-y.

To improve the induction remission rate, we modified the dose of idarubicin in the original Children's Cancer Group (CCG)-1884 protocol, and retrospectively compared the results. Twenty-eight patients diagnosed with relapsed ALL received induction chemotherapy according to the CCG-1884 protocol. Complete remission (CR) rate in all patients after induction chemotherapy was 57%. The idarubicin 10 mg/m(2)/week group showed CR rate of 74%, compared with the 22% CR rate of the idarubicin 12.5 mg/m(2)/week group (p=0.010). Remission failure due to treatment-related mortality (TRM) was 44% and 5.2% in the idarubicin 12.5 mg/m(2)/week and 10 mg/m(2)/week groups, respectively (p=0.011). Overall survival (OS) and 4-yr event-free survival (EFS) were 12.8% and 10.3%, respectively.

In conclusion, a modified dose of idarubicin from 12.5 mg/m(2)/week to 10 mg/m(2)/week resulted in an improved CR rate in the treatment of relapsed ALL, which was due to lower TRM.

Trauma patients and trauma team members are exposed to radiation during the continuum of care. Knowledge of exposure amounts and effects are important for trauma team members. METHODS: We performed a review of the published literature; keywords included ""trauma,"" ""patients,"" ""trauma team members,"" ""wounds,"" ""injuries,"" ""radiation,"" ""exposure,"" ""dose"" and ""computed tomography"" (CT). We also reviewed the Board on Radiation Effects Research (BEIR VII) report, published in 2005 and 2006. RESULTS: We found no randomized controlled trials or studies. Relevant studies demonstrated that CT accounts for the single largest radiation exposure in trauma patients. Exposure to 100 mSv could result in a solid organ cancer or leukemia in 1 of 100 people. Trauma team members do not exceed the acceptable occupation radiation exposure determined by the National Council of Radiation Protection and Management. Modern imaging technologies such as 16- and 64-slice CT scanners may decrease radiation exposure. CONCLUSION: Multiple injured trauma patients receive a substantial dose of radiation. Radiation exposure is cumulative. The low individual risk of cancer becomes a greater public health issue when multiplied by a large number of examinations. Though CT scans are an invaluable resource and are becoming more easily accessible, they should not replace careful clinical examination and should be used only in appropriate patients.","['Hui, Catherine M', 'MacGregor, John H', 'Tien, Homer C', 'Kortbeek, John B']","['Hui CM', 'MacGregor JH', 'Tien HC', 'Kortbeek JB']","['Division of Orthopaedic Surgery, Department of Surgery, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alta.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Canada,Can J Surg,Canadian journal of surgery.

CTIP2 mutant mice die at birth with epidermal differentiation defects and a compromised epidermal permeability barrier suggesting its role in skin development and/or homeostasis. CTIP2 has also been suggested to function as tumor suppressor in cells, and several reports have described a link between chromosomal rearrangements of CTIP2 and human T cell acute lymphoblast leukemia (T-ALL). The aim of the present study was to look into the pattern of CTIP2 expression in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In the present study, we analyzed CTIP2 expression in human HNSCC cell lines by western blotting, in paraffin embedded archival specimens by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and in cDNA samples of human HNSCC by qRT-PCR. Elevated levels of CTIP2 protein was detected in several HNSCC cell lines. CTIP2 staining was mainly detected in the basal layer of the head and neck normal epithelium. CTIP2 expression was found to be significantly elevated in HNSCC (p<0.01), and increase in CTIP2 expression was associated with poorly differentiated tumor status. Nuclear co-localization of CTIP2 protein and cancer stem cell (CSC) marker BMI1 was observed in most, if not all of the cells expressing BMI1 in moderately and poorly differentiated tumors. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We report for the first time expression of transcriptional regulator CTIP2 in normal human head and neck epithelia. A statistically significant increase in the expression of CTIP2 was detected in the poorly differentiated samples of the human head and neck tumors. Actual CTIP2, rather than the long form of CTIP2 (CTIP2(L)) was found to be more relevant to the differentiation state of the tumors. Results demonstrated existence of distinct subsets of cancer cells, which express CTIP2 and underscores the use of CTIP2 and BMI1 co-labeling to distinguish tumor initiating cells or cancer stem cells (CSCs) from surrounding cancer cells.","['Ganguli-Indra, Gitali', 'Wasylyk, Christine', 'Liang, Xiaobo', 'Millon, Regine', 'Leid, Mark', 'Wasylyk, Bohdan', 'Abecassis, Joseph', 'Indra, Arup K']","['Ganguli-Indra G', 'Wasylyk C', 'Liang X', 'Millon R', 'Leid M', 'Wasylyk B', 'Abecassis J', 'Indra AK']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA. indrag@onid.orst.edu']",,['eng'],"['P30 ES000210/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AR056008/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'ES00210/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090428,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/*genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism']",2009/04/29 09:00,2009/07/14 09:00,['2009/04/29 09:00'],"['2008/12/30 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/04/29 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/14 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0005367 [doi]'],ppublish,PLoS One. 2009;4(4):e5367. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0005367.

Here we describe robust long-term methodology for small and large intestinal culture, incorporating an air-liquid interface and underlying stromal elements. These cultures showed prolonged intestinal epithelial expansion as sphere-like organoids with proliferation and multilineage differentiation. The Wnt growth factor family positively regulates proliferation of the intestinal epithelium in vivo. Accordingly, culture growth was inhibited by the Wnt antagonist Dickkopf-1 (Dkk1) and markedly stimulated by a fusion protein between the Wnt agonist R-spondin-1 and immunoglobulin Fc (RSpo1-Fc).

Abundant evidence from solid tumors demonstrates that preneoplastic lesions activate signaling pathways of a DNA damage response (DDR), which functions as an 'anticancer barrier' hindering tumorigenesis. Testing the hypothesis that subgroups of MDS and AML differ with respect to DDR, we first assessed markers of DDR (phosphorylation of ATM, Chk-1, Chk-2 and H2AX) in cell lines representing different entities of MDS (P39, MOLM-13) and AML (MV4-11, KG-1) before and after gamma-irradiation. Although gamma-irradiation induced apoptosis and G(2)/M arrest and a concomitant increase in the phosphorylation of ATM, Chk-1 and H2AX in MDS-derived cell lines, this radiation response was attenuated in the AML-derived cell lines. It is noteworthy that KG-1, but not P39 cells exhibit signs of an endogenous activation of the DDR. Similarly, we found that the frequency of P-ATM(+) cells detectable in bone marrow (BM) biopsies increased in samples from patients with AML as compared with high-risk MDS samples and significantly correlated with the percentage of BM blasts. In contrast, the frequency of gamma-H2AX(+) cells was heterogeneous in all subgroups of AML and MDS. Whereas intermediate-1 MDS samples contained as little P-Chk-1 and P-Chk-2 as healthy controls, staining for both checkpoint kinases increased in intermediate-2 and high-risk MDS, yet declined to near-to-background levels in AML samples. Thus the activation of Chk-1 and Chk-2 behaves in accord with the paradigm established for solid tumors, whereas ATM is activated during and beyond transformation. In conclusion, we demonstrate the heterogeneity of the DDR response in MDS and AML and provide evidence for its selective suppression in AML because of the uncoupling between activated ATM and inactive checkpoint kinases.","['Boehrer, S', 'Ades, L', 'Tajeddine, N', 'Hofmann, W K', 'Kriener, S', 'Bug, G', 'Ottmann, O G', 'Ruthardt, M', 'Galluzzi, L', 'Fouassier, C', 'Tailler, M', 'Olaussen, K A', 'Gardin, C', 'Eclache, V', 'de Botton, S', 'Thepot, S', 'Fenaux, P', 'Kroemer, G']","['Boehrer S', 'Ades L', 'Tajeddine N', 'Hofmann WK', 'Kriener S', 'Bug G', 'Ottmann OG', 'Ruthardt M', 'Galluzzi L', 'Fouassier C', 'Tailler M', 'Olaussen KA', 'Gardin C', 'Eclache V', 'de Botton S', 'Thepot S', 'Fenaux P', 'Kroemer G']","['INSERM U848, Institut Gustave Roussy, Pavillon de Recherche 1, 39 rue Camille Desmoulins, Villejuif, France.']",,['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090427,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Checkpoint Kinase 2', '*DNA Damage/radiation effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Granulocyte Precursor Cells/drug effects/metabolism/pathology/radiation effects', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Radiation-Sensitizing Agents/pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism']",2009/04/29 09:00,2009/06/25 09:00,['2009/04/29 09:00'],"['2009/04/29 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/25 09:00 [medline]']","['onc200969 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2009.69 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2009 Jun 4;28(22):2205-18. doi: 10.1038/onc.2009.69.

METHODS: Episodes of suspected or confirmed infections were evaluated during the first 12 months of treatment for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). RESULTS: The number of patients was 73 (43 boys). The median age was 4.6 years. A total of 179 episodes occurred, varying from none in six patients to eight in one. Bacteria were cultured in 57 episodes (31.8%), the most common being coagulase-negative staphylococci. The number of episodes fell significantly with increasing age for suspected and confirmed infections (p < 0.001 and p = 0.03). The proportion of confirmed infections was significantly higher (p < 0.001) in the first episodes. The average number of suspected infections was higher in girls than in boys (p = 0.03), but confirmed infections were not. CONCLUSION: Most of the serious infections occur early in the treatment and the number of suspected and confirmed infections falls with age. Suspicion of infection is more likely in girls, but the number of confirmed infections is equal in both sexes.

The distribution of aberrations among cells was close to the expected Poisson for the gamma-irradiated cells, but for the HZE 56Fe ions the distribution was highly dispersed. The observations were consistent with the results of an analysis similar to that of Edwards and co-workers in 1980 after ex vivo irradiation of human blood with alpha particles. The analysis used to fit the current data was based on a compound Poisson process, also used previously by others, but in addition included the random nature of parameters involved such as cell nuclear diameter, particle traversal lengths through cell nuclei, production of aberrations, and cell cycle arrest per traversal. From the measured numbers of acentric fragments produced, the relative size of chromosome 2 and the region associated with PU.1 deletions, an independent prediction of PU.1 loss agreed well with measurements described in the accompanying paper.","['Peng, Yuanlin', 'Borak, Thomas B', 'Bouffler, Simon D', 'Ullrich, Robert L', 'Weil, Michael M', 'Bedford, Joel S']","['Peng Y', 'Borak TB', 'Bouffler SD', 'Ullrich RL', 'Weil MM', 'Bedford JS']","['Department of Environmental and Radiological Health Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado 80523, USA. ypeng@colostate.edu']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,IM,"['Animals', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes', 'Gamma Rays', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Iron', 'Leukemia/*etiology/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*etiology/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Radiometry', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'X-Rays']",2009/04/29 09:00,2009/05/30 09:00,['2009/04/29 09:00'],"['2009/04/29 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/30 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1667/RR1548.1 [doi]'],ppublish,Radiat Res. 2009 Apr;171(4):484-93. doi: 10.1667/RR1548.1.,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Part I. Experimental observations.",474-83,10.1667/RR1547.1 [doi],"Since deletion of the PU.1 gene on chromosome 2 is a crucial acute myeloid leukemia (AML) initiating step in the mouse model, we quantified PU.1 deleted cells in the bone marrow of gamma-, X- and 56Fe-ion-irradiated mice at various times postirradiation. Although 56Fe ions were initially some two to three times more effective than X or gamma rays in inducing PU.1 deletions, by 1 month postirradiation, the proportions of cells with PU.1 deletions were similar for the HZE particles and the sparsely ionizing radiations. These results indicate that while 56Fe ions are more effective in inducing PU.1 deletions, they are also more effective in causing collateral damage that removes hit cells from the bone marrow. After X, gamma or 56Fe-ion irradiation, AML-resistant C57BL/6 mice have fewer cells with PU.1 deletions than CBA mice, and those cells do not persist in the bone marrow of the C57B6/6 mice. Our findings suggest that quantification of PU.1 deleted bone marrow cells 1 month postirradiation can be used as surrogate for the incidence of radiation-induced AML measured in large-scale mouse studies. If so, PU.1 loss could be used to systematically assess the potential leukemogenic effects of other ions and energies in the space radiation environment.","['Peng, Yuanlin', 'Brown, Natalie', 'Finnon, Rosemary', 'Warner, Christy L', 'Liu, Xianan', 'Genik, Paula C', 'Callan, Matthew A', 'Ray, F Andrew', 'Borak, Thomas B', 'Badie, Christophe', 'Bouffler, Simon D', 'Ullrich, Robert L', 'Bedford, Joel S', 'Weil, Michael M']","['Peng Y', 'Brown N', 'Finnon R', 'Warner CL', 'Liu X', 'Genik PC', 'Callan MA', 'Ray FA', 'Borak TB', 'Badie C', 'Bouffler SD', 'Ullrich RL', 'Bedford JS', 'Weil MM']","['Department of Environmental and Radiological Health Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado 80523, USA. ypeng@colostate.edu']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,IM,"['Animals', 'Chromosomes', 'Chromosomes, Artificial, Bacterial/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Gamma Rays', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Iron', 'Leukemia/*etiology/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*etiology/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'X-Rays']",2009/04/29 09:00,2009/05/30 09:00,['2009/04/29 09:00'],"['2009/04/29 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/30 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1667/RR1547.1 [doi]'],ppublish,Radiat Res. 2009 Apr;171(4):474-83. doi: 10.1667/RR1547.1.,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Usually the blast cells in leukemia are transformed after MDS displays a myeloid phenotype. Lymphoid progression had been reported as myeloid-lymphoid hybrid or early B phenotype, but our patient transformed acute T-lymphoblastic leukemia, which is a rare lymphoid transformation. CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND INTERVENTION: We present a case of refractory anemia with excess of blast that transformed into acute T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia. MDS was diagnosed in a 69-year-old man in April 2007. Twelve month later, he developed T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The blasts were positive for expression of CD2, CD3, CD5, CD7, CD45, and HLA-DR, leading to a diagnosis of T-lymphoblastic leukemia. The patient was treated with chemotherapy, but he died of multiple organ failure. CONCLUSION: The mechanism of lymphoid transformation is not yet fully understood. This case clinically supports the nature of MDS as a pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell disorder. MDS often transforms into acute leukemia, usually of a myeloid phenotype. The transformation of MDS into acute lymphoblastic leukemia is extremely rare.","['Serefhanoglu, Songul', 'Goker, Hakan', 'Buyukasik, Yahya', 'Sayinalp, Nilgun', 'Ozcebe, Osman I']","['Serefhanoglu S', 'Goker H', 'Buyukasik Y', 'Sayinalp N', 'Ozcebe OI']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Hacettepe University Medical School, Ankara, Turkey. dr.songul1978@yahoo.com']",,['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,J Natl Med Assoc,Journal of the National Medical Association,7503090,IM,"['Aged', 'Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/*complications', 'Disease Progression', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*etiology/immunology/physiopathology', 'Risk Factors']",2009/04/29 09:00,2009/11/06 06:00,['2009/04/29 09:00'],"['2009/04/29 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0027-9684(15)30887-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0027-9684(15)30887-7 [doi]']",ppublish,J Natl Med Assoc. 2009 Apr;101(4):370-2. doi: 10.1016/s0027-9684(15)30887-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous cytogenetic studies of PCL have reported the presence of complex karyotypes with involvement of multiple unidentified chromosomal regions. We report here the analysis of 12 PCL (10 primary and two secondary) by metaphase and FISH analysis combined with oligonucleotide array data (244 k, Agilent). Interphase-FISH results were compared with those from a series of 861 newly diagnosed patients with MM. Cytogenetic analysis was successful on 11 patients, all of whom showed clonal chromosomal abnormalities. Compared with MM, t(11;14)(q13;q32) (42% versus 15%; P = 0.027) and t(14;16)(q32;q23) (25% versus 4%; P = 0.010) were more frequent in PCL, although neither the specific partner chromosome involved in the IgH translocation nor the ploidy status predicted for survival. Chromosomes 1, 8, 13, and 16 showed the highest number of copy number alterations with 8q24 being the chromosomal region most frequently involved. In eight of 12 patients we found abnormalities (translocations, one amplification, small deletions, and duplications) that directly targeted or were very close to MYC. Only four of these changes were detected by routine FISH analysis using commercial probes with the others exclusively detected by arrays. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that these different abnormalities were associated with increased levels of MYC mRNA. We conclude that MYC dysregulation by complex mechanisms is one of the major molecular events in the oncogenesis of PCL.","['Chiecchio, Laura', 'Dagrada, Gian Paolo', 'White, Helen E', 'Towsend, Mark R', 'Protheroe, Rebecca K M', 'Cheung, Kan Luk', 'Stockley, David M', 'Orchard, Kim H', 'Cross, Nicholas C P', 'Harrison, Christine J', 'Ross, Fiona M']","['Chiecchio L', 'Dagrada GP', 'White HE', 'Towsend MR', 'Protheroe RK', 'Cheung KL', 'Stockley DM', 'Orchard KH', 'Cross NC', 'Harrison CJ', 'Ross FM']","['Leukaemia Research Fund UK Myeloma Forum Cytogenetics Group, Human Genetics Division, University of Southampton, Wessex Regional Genetics Laboratory, Salisbury District Hospital, Salisbury, Wilts, UK. laura.chiecchio@salisbury.nhs.uk']",['UK Myeloma Forum'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human/genetics', 'Comparative Genomic Hybridization', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'Gene Dosage', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/biosynthesis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation', 'Young Adult']",2009/04/28 09:00,2009/10/20 06:00,['2009/04/28 09:00'],"['2009/04/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/gcc.20670 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2009 Jul;48(7):624-36. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20670.,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Elevated AF1q expression in the absence of specific poor cytogenetics is associated with poor outcomes in pediatric patients with AML and adult patients with myelodysplastic syndrome.

The selection process for allogeneic HSCT takes disease-specific as well as patient-specific factors into account. Risk factors which can predict for poor response to chemotherapy can now be identified in acute myeloid as well as lymphoid leukemia, based on phenotype, cytogenetics, molecular genetics and response to therapy. In these patients allogeneic HSCT can improve overall survival from 0-20% to 30-60%. New conditioning protocols have now raised the upper age limit for transplantation to 70 years.

Dasatinib has pH-dependent solubility and is bioavailable as an oral formulation. The effect of gastric pH modifiers on dasatinib pharmacokinetics is evaluated in an open-label, randomized, 3-period, 3-treatment crossover study. Twenty-four healthy subjects receive treatment A (2 doses of dasatinib 50 mg separated by 12 hours), treatment B (famotidine 40 mg given 2 hours after dasatinib 50 mg and 10 hours before another dose of dasatinib 50 mg), and treatment C (30 mL of an antacid containing aluminum/magnesium hydroxides given 2 hours before dasatinib 50 mg and concomitantly with dasatinib 50 mg 12 hours after the previous dasatinib dose); a 7-day washout separates each treatment period. When famotidine is administered 2 hours after dasatinib, dasatinib exposure is similar to dasatinib administered alone. However, dasatinib exposure is reduced by approximately 60% when famotidine is administered 10 hours before dasatinib dosing. In contrast, dasatinib exposure is unchanged when antacid (Maalox) is administered 2 hours before dasatinib; but when the antacid is coadministered with dasatinib, dasatinib exposure is reduced by approximately 55% to 58%. This indicates that H(2)-receptor antagonists should not be coadministered with dasatinib. Dasatinib may be administered with acid-neutralizing antacids if the doses are temporally separated by at least 2 hours.","['Eley, Timothy', 'Luo, Feng R', 'Agrawal, Shruti', 'Sanil, Ashish', 'Manning, James', 'Li, Tong', 'Blackwood-Chirchir, Anne', 'Bertz, Richard']","['Eley T', 'Luo FR', 'Agrawal S', 'Sanil A', 'Manning J', 'Li T', 'Blackwood-Chirchir A', 'Bertz R']","['Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Mailstop: 8A-1.19, 311 Pennington-Rocky Hill Road, Hopewell, NJ 08534, USA. timothy.eley@bms.com']",,['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090424,England,J Clin Pharmacol,Journal of clinical pharmacology,0366372,IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antacids/*pharmacology', 'Anti-Ulcer Agents/*pharmacology', 'Biological Availability', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Dasatinib', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Famotidine/*pharmacology', 'Histamine H2 Antagonists/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', 'Thiazoles/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', 'Young Adult']",2009/04/28 09:00,2009/08/11 09:00,['2009/04/28 09:00'],"['2009/04/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/11 09:00 [medline]']","['0091270009333854 [pii]', '10.1177/0091270009333854 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Pharmacol. 2009 Jun;49(6):700-9. doi: 10.1177/0091270009333854.

While myocardial stem cell therapeutic trials have traditionally relied on intracoronary infusion or intramyocardial injection routes, these cell delivery methods are invasive and can introduce harmful scar tissue, arrhythmia, calcification, or microinfarction in the heart. Given that patients with heart failure are at an increased surgical risk, the development of a noninvasive stem cell therapeutic approach is logistically appealing. Taking advantage of the trophic effects of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and using a hamster heart failure model, the present study demonstrates a novel noninvasive therapeutic regimen via the direct delivery of MSCs into the skeletal muscle bed. Intramuscularly injected MSCs and MSC-conditioned medium each significantly improved ventricular function 1 mo after MSC administration. MSCs at 4 million cells/animal increased fractional shortening by approximately 40%, enhanced capillary and myocyte nuclear density by approximately 30% and approximately 80%, attenuated apoptosis by approximately 60%, and reduced fibrosis by approximately 50%. Myocyte regeneration was evidenced by an approximately twofold increase in the expression of cell cycle markers (Ki67 and phosphohistone H(3)) and an approximately 13% reduction in mean myocyte diameter. Increased circulating levels of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), leukemia inhibitory factor, and macrophage colony-stimulating factor were associated with the mobilization of c-Kit-positive, CD31-positive, and CD133-positive progenitor cells and a subsequent increase in myocardial c-Kit-positive cells. Trophic effects of MSCs further activated the expression of HGF, IGF-II, and VEGF in the myocardium. The work highlights a cardiac repair mechanism mediated by trophic cross-talks among the injected MSCs, bone marrow, and heart that can be explored for noninvasive stem cell therapy.","['Shabbir, Arsalan', 'Zisa, David', 'Suzuki, Gen', 'Lee, Techung']","['Shabbir A', 'Zisa D', 'Suzuki G', 'Lee T']","['Department of Biochemistry and Center for Research in Cardiovascular Medicine, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY 14214, USA.']",,['eng'],['R01-HL84590/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090424,United States,Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol,American journal of physiology.

Prospective data about alcohol, NHL, and other hematologic malignancies (HM) are sparse. METHODS: We carried out a cohort study in a multiethnic population of 126,293 adults who supplied baseline information at health examinations. There were subsequent HM diagnoses in 1244 persons. We used Cox proportional hazards models with seven covariates. The role of beverage types was studied by comparing groups with preponderant choices and by studying the role of frequency of drinking beverage types. RESULTS: Using lifelong abstainers plus infrequent drinkers as referent, adjusted relative risks (95% confidence intervals) for HM follow: less than one drink per day=1.0 (0.9-1.2), one to two drinks per day=0.9 (0.7-1.0), greater than three drinks per day=0.7 (0.6-0.9, p=0.008). For 673 NHL these were 1.2 (1.0-1.5), 0.9 (0.7-1.2), and 0.9 (0.6-1.2). Persons reporting greater than three drinks/day had inverse relations to lymphocytic (n= 146) and myelocytic (n= 169) leukemias, with relative risk of 0.5 (0.2-1.0, p<0.05) for each. No major independent relation was seen for choice of wine, liquor, or beer. CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol drinking is associated with slightly lower risk of HM, due largely to inverse relations to lymphocytic and myelocytic leukemia.","['Klatsky, Arthur L', 'Li, Yan', 'Baer, David', 'Armstrong, Mary Anne', 'Udaltsova, Natalia', 'Friedman, Gary D']","['Klatsky AL', 'Li Y', 'Baer D', 'Armstrong MA', 'Udaltsova N', 'Friedman GD']","['Division of Research, Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program, Oakland, CA 94610, USA. arthur.klatsky@kp.org']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090425,United States,Ann Epidemiol,Annals of epidemiology,9100013,IM,"['Alcohol Drinking/*adverse effects', 'Alcoholic Beverages/adverse effects', 'Beer/adverse effects', 'Cohort Studies', 'Ethnicity', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors', 'Smoking/adverse effects', 'Wine/adverse effects']",2009/04/28 09:00,2009/11/18 06:00,['2009/04/28 09:00'],"['2008/10/08 00:00 [received]', '2009/01/15 00:00 [revised]', '2009/03/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/04/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S1047-2797(09)00076-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.annepidem.2009.03.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Epidemiol. 2009 Oct;19(10):746-53. doi: 10.1016/j.annepidem.2009.03.005.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cells from newly diagnosed chronic-phase CML patients were harvested by leukapheresis and enriched to >95% CD34(+). Expression of the transporter gene MDR1 was performed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Interaction of IM with MDR1 was analyzed by substrate (rhodamine 123) displacement assay. Cell-associated levels of IM in CML CD34(+) cells were measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Intracellular phospho-CrkL levels, apoptosis in total CML CD34(+) cells and high-resolution tracking of cell division were assayed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Measurements of cell-associated IM uptake showed significantly lower drug levels in CD34(+) cells, particularly the CD38(-) subpopulation, as compared to IM-sensitive K562 cells. MDR1 was expressed at low level and dye efflux studies demonstrated very little MDR1 activity in CML CD34(+) cells. Furthermore, combination treatment of primitive CML cells with IM and the MDR1 inhibitor PSC833 did not result in elevated cell-associated IM levels. Although we observed slightly enhanced cytostasis with IM when combined with PSC833, this was independent of BCR-ABL inhibition because no associated decrease in phospho-CrkL was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that inhibition of MDR1 neither enhances the effect of IM against BCR-ABL activity, nor significantly potentiates IM's efficiency in eliminating primitive CML cells.","['Hatziieremia, Sophia', 'Jordanides, Niove E', 'Holyoake, Tessa L', 'Mountford, Joanne C', 'Jorgensen, Heather G']","['Hatziieremia S', 'Jordanides NE', 'Holyoake TL', 'Mountford JC', 'Jorgensen HG']","[""Section of Experimental Haematology, Division of Cancer Sciences and Molecular Pathology, Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Gartnavel General Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.""]",,['eng'],['CZB/4/524/CSO_/Chief Scientist Office/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090425,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*antagonists & inhibitors', '*Antigens, CD34', 'Apoptosis', 'Benzamides', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Separation/methods', 'Cyclosporins/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukapheresis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Piperazines/analysis/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/analysis/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2009/04/28 09:00,2009/07/08 09:00,['2009/04/28 09:00'],"['2008/12/23 00:00 [received]', '2008/12/23 00:00 [revised]', '2009/02/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/04/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/08 09:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(09)00054-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2009.02.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2009 Jun;37(6):692-700. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2009.02.006.

Survival and regeneration of RGCs is increased by intraocular injections of ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) and axonal regeneration is further enhanced by co-injection of a cyclic AMP analogue (CPT-cAMP). Based on these data, and because cytokine signaling is negatively regulated by suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins, we set out to determine whether CNTF injections increase retinal SOCS expression and whether any changes are attenuated by co-injection with CPT-cAMP. Using quantitative PCR we found increased SOCS1, SOCS2 and SOCS3 mRNA levels at various times after a single CNTF injection. Expression remained high for many days. SOCS protein levels were also increased. In situ hybridization revealed that RGCs express SOCS3 mRNA, and SOCS expression in cultured RGCs was increased by CNTF. Co-injection of CPT-cAMP reduced CNTF induced expression of SOCS1 and SOCS3 mRNA and decreased SOCS3 protein expression. CNTF injection also transiently increased retinal leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) expression, an effect that was also moderated by CPT-cAMP. We propose that, along with known reparative effects of elevated cAMP on neurons, reducing SOCS upregulation may be an additional way in which cyclic nucleotides augment cytokine-induced regenerative responses in the injured CNS.","['Park, Kevin K', 'Hu, Ying', 'Muhling, Jillian', 'Pollett, Margaret A', 'Dallimore, Elizabeth J', 'Turnley, Ann M', 'Cui, Qi', 'Harvey, Alan R']","['Park KK', 'Hu Y', 'Muhling J', 'Pollett MA', 'Dallimore EJ', 'Turnley AM', 'Cui Q', 'Harvey AR']","['School of Anatomy and Human Biology M309, The University of Western Australia, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, Perth, WA 6009, Australia.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090424,United States,Mol Cell Neurosci,Molecular and cellular neurosciences,9100095,IM,"['Animals', 'Axons/transplantation', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/administration & dosage/biosynthesis/genetics', '*Cyclic AMP/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Interleukin-10/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Interleukin-6/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Regeneration/*drug effects', 'Retina/drug effects/*injuries/*physiology', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transplants']",2009/04/28 09:00,2009/09/23 06:00,['2009/04/28 09:00'],"['2008/10/27 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/25 00:00 [revised]', '2009/04/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/04/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S1044-7431(09)00080-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mcn.2009.04.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Neurosci. 2009 Jul;41(3):313-24. doi: 10.1016/j.mcn.2009.04.002.

It generally follows an indolent course and is notable for an association with chronic inflammation, neutropenia and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We present herein a case of a patient with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), neutropenia, large granular lymphocytosis, and an expanded clonal population of peripheral blood CD3(+)CD8(+)TCRalphabeta CTLs, consistent with the diagnosis of T-LGL. T-LGL is part of a spectrum of large granular lymphocytic (LGL) disorders, which includes the more common indolent variety of this disease (as illustrated by the case herein), an aggressive but rare form of this leukemia, natural killer (NK) cell LGL leukemia, Felty's syndrome (FS), and chronic large granular lymphocytosis. T-LGL appears to be a relatively rare disease, but the true prevalence is not known. FS occurs in less than 1% of patients with RA and is typically defined by the triad of destructive arthritis, neutropenia, and variable splenomegaly. A subset of patients with FS will demonstrate polyclonal expansion of LGLs, implying a relationship between proliferation of LGLs and the mechanisms of neutropenia. Thus, T-LGL leukemia and FS with LGL expansion in the setting of RA is classically distinguished by the clonality of the CTL population, with monoclonality in T-LGL and polyclonality in FS. Despite this difference, T-LGL and FS are often similar in their clinical and biological behavior. Both may respond to immunosuppressive therapy, and pursue a smoldering course typical of a chronic inflammatory disease.","['Shah, Ankoor', 'Diehl, Louis F', 'St Clair, E William']","['Shah A', 'Diehl LF', 'St Clair EW']","['Division of Rheumatology and Immunology, Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710, USA.']",,['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20090425,United States,Clin Immunol,"Clinical immunology (Orlando, Fla.)",100883537,IM,"['Arthritis, Rheumatoid/*complications', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/complications/*diagnosis/immunology', 'Lymphocytosis/complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/*complications', 'Review Literature as Topic', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology']",2009/04/28 09:00,2009/09/18 06:00,['2009/04/28 09:00'],"['2009/03/13 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/04/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S1521-6616(09)00585-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clim.2009.03.515 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Immunol. 2009 Aug;132(2):145-52. doi: 10.1016/j.clim.2009.03.515.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A Medline/PUBMED search of articles dealing with RAM yielded 66 studies between 1981 and 2006. Factors analyzed included patient age and gender, type of initial tumor treated, radiotherapy (RT) dose and volume, and time interval from RT to development of RAM. RESULTS: A total of 143 patients with a median age at RT of 12 years form the basis of this report. The most common initial tumors or conditions treated with RT were medulloblastoma (n = 27), pituitary adenoma (n = 20), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 20), low-grade astrocytoma (n = 19), and tinea capitis (n = 14). In the 116 patients whose RT fields were known, 55 (47.4%) had a portion of the brain treated, whereas 32 (27.6%) and 29 (25.0%) had craniospinal and whole-brain fields. The median time from RT to develop a RAM or latent time (LT) was 19 years (range, 1-63 years). Male gender (p = 0.001), initial diagnosis of leukemia (p = 0.001), and use of whole brain or craniospinal field (p <or= 0.0001) were associated with a shorter LT, whereas patients who received lower doses of RT had a longer LT (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The latent time to develop a RAM was related to gender, initial tumor type, radiotherapy volume, and radiotherapy dose.","['Paulino, Arnold C', 'Ahmed, Irfan M', 'Mai, Wei Y', 'Teh, Bin S']","['Paulino AC', 'Ahmed IM', 'Mai WY', 'Teh BS']","['Department of Radiology, Section of Radiation Oncology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA. apaulino@tmhs.org']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20090423,United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,IM,"['Adenoma/pathology/radiotherapy', 'Age Factors', 'Astrocytoma/pathology/radiotherapy', 'Brain Neoplasms/pathology/radiotherapy', 'Cranial Irradiation/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Medulloblastoma/pathology/radiotherapy', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/*etiology', 'Meningioma/*etiology', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*etiology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/etiology', 'Pituitary Neoplasms/pathology/radiotherapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology/radiotherapy', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Sex Factors', 'Time Factors', 'Tinea Capitis/radiotherapy', 'Tumor Burden']",2009/04/28 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/04/28 09:00'],"['2008/12/02 00:00 [received]', '2009/01/04 00:00 [revised]', '2009/01/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/04/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0360-3016(09)00230-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijrobp.2009.01.052 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2009 Dec 1;75(5):1408-14. doi: 10.1016/j.ijrobp.2009.01.052.

STUDY DESIGN: A review of 167 children diagnosed with ALL between 1999 to 2002 at Texas Children's Hospital was performed. Blood glucose concentrations during induction therapy were reviewed; patients were assigned to 3 groups: euglycemia (blood glucose < 140 mg/dL), mild hyperglycemia (blood glucose between 140-200 mg/dL), and overt hyperglycemia (blood glucose > 200 mg/dL). RFS and OS among groups were compared by use of Kaplan-Meier and Cox-proportional hazard analyses, adjusting for potential confounding variables. RESULTS: The median follow-up in survivors was 6 years; there were 18 deaths and 36 relapses. Overt hyperglycemia was seen in 56 (34%) patients. Patients with overt hyperglycemia had poorer RFS (68% +/- [SE] 6.7 vs 85% +/- 3.6, P = .025) and OS (74% +/- 6.1 vs 96% +/- 1.9, P < .0001) at 5 years than their counterparts. Patients with overt hyperglycemia had 6.2 times (95% CI 1.6-24.7, P = .01) greater risk for death, independent of risk group and type of steroid.

We examined 5 leukemia cell lines (MOLT-4F, IM-9, HL-60, BALL-1 and Daudi), and found that MOLT-4F (T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia) had the highest susceptibility to D-allose, and that Daudi (Burkitt's lymphoma) had the lowest. D-Allose significantly slowed the cell cycle progression without causing apoptosis of MOLT-4F cells. Intracellular TXNIP expression was specifically and markedly enhanced in MOLT-4F cells by D-allose treatment, and subsequent increase of p27(kip1), a cell cycle inhibitor, was observed. On the other hand, D-allose did not increase TXNIP and p27(kip1) levels at all in Daudi cells.

The ubiquitously expressed MEN1 encoded protein, menin, interacts with MLL (mixed-lineage leukemia protein), and together they are essential components of a multiprotein complex with histone methyl transferase activity. MLL is also essential for hematopoiesis, and plays a critical role in leukemogenesis via epigenetic regulation of Hoxa9 expression that also requires menin. Therefore we chose to explore the role of menin in hematopoiesis. We generated Men1(-/-) embryonic stem (ES) cell lines, and induced them to differentiate in vitro. While these cells were able to form embryoid bodies (EBs) expressing the early markers Flk-1 and c-Kit, their ability to further differentiate into hematopoietic colonies was compromised. The Men1(-/-) ES cells show reduced expression of Hoxa9 that can be recovered by reexpression of Menin. We demonstrate that the block in differentiation of Men1(-/-) ES cell lines can be rescued not only by the expression of menin but also that of Hoxa9. These results suggest that, similar to MLL, menin is required for hematopoiesis, and this requirement may be mediated through regulation of Hoxa9 expression.","['Novotny, Elizabeth', 'Compton, Sheila', 'Liu, P Paul', 'Collins, Francis S', 'Chandrasekharappa, Settara C']","['Novotny E', 'Compton S', 'Liu PP', 'Collins FS', 'Chandrasekharappa SC']","['Genome Technology Branch, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",,['eng'],['Z01 HG000029-13/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20090422,Ireland,Mech Dev,Mechanisms of development,9101218,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Embryo, Mammalian/cytology/metabolism', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/deficiency/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism']",2009/04/28 09:00,2009/10/09 06:00,['2009/04/28 09:00'],"['2008/11/21 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/22 00:00 [revised]', '2009/04/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/04/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0925-4773(09)00044-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mod.2009.04.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Mech Dev. 2009 Jul;126(7):517-22. doi: 10.1016/j.mod.2009.04.001.

Molecular docking studies suggested that Smac-DIABLO may antagonize XIAP by concurrently targeting both BIR2 and BIR3 domains; on this basis bivalent Smac-mimetic compounds have been proposed and characterized. Here, we report the X-ray crystal structure of XIAP-BIR3 domain in complex with a two-headed compound (compound 3) with improved efficacy relative to its monomeric form. A small-angle X-ray scattering study of XIAP-BIR2BIR3, together with fluorescence polarization binding assays and compound 3 cytotoxicity tests on HL60 leukemia cell line are also reported. The crystal structure analysis reveals a network of interactions supporting XIAP-BIR3/compound 3 recognition; moreover, analytical gel-filtration chromatography shows that compound 3 forms a 1:1 stoichiometric complex with a XIAP protein construct containing both BIR2 and BIR3 domains. On the basis of the crystal structure and small-angle X-ray scattering, a model of the same BIR2-BIR3 construct bound to compound 3 is proposed, shedding light on the ability of compound 3 to relieve XIAP inhibitory effects on caspase-9 as well as caspases -3 and -7. A molecular modeling/docking analysis of compound 3 bound to cIAP1-BIR3 domain is presented, considering that Smac-mimetics have been shown to kill tumor cells by inducing cIAP1 and cIAP2 ubiquitination and degradation.

In this study, we examined the effects of several inflammatory cytokines on BAFF expression in cultured human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells both at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional level. Incubation of the cells with IL-10 and IFN-gamma elevated the expression of membrane-bound and soluble forms of BAFF. A similar increase in BAFF-specific mRNA was noted in cultured cells. Unexpectedly, interleukin-4 (IL-4) treatment hardly affected BAFF expression at the mRNA and protein levels. Transcriptional regulation was examined in cultures transfected with a human BAFF promoter/reporter gene (chloramphenicol acetyltransferase) construct. IL-10 and IFN-gamma elicited marked enhancement of the human BAFF promoter activity. Collectively, these results demonstrated that IL-10 and IFN-gamma both regulate BAFF expression and synthesis in human promyelocytic leukemia cell cultures, and the activation occurs at the transcriptional level.","['Zhou, Lin', 'Zhong, Renqian', 'Hao, Wanying', 'Wang, Hao', 'Fan, Xiaoxia', 'Zhang, Lingzhen', 'Mi, Qingmei']","['Zhou L', 'Zhong R', 'Hao W', 'Wang H', 'Fan X', 'Zhang L', 'Mi Q']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shaghai, PR China. gracelin_zhou@yahoo.com.cn']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090422,Netherlands,Exp Mol Pathol,Experimental and molecular pathology,0370711,IM,"['B-Cell Activating Factor/genetics/*immunology', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*immunology', 'Interleukin-10/*immunology', 'Interleukin-4/immunology', '*Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/immunology/pathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2009/04/28 09:00,2009/07/29 09:00,['2009/04/28 09:00'],"['2008/12/09 00:00 [received]', '2009/04/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/04/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/29 09:00 [medline]']","['S0014-4800(09)00049-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.yexmp.2009.04.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Mol Pathol. 2009 Aug;87(1):54-8. doi: 10.1016/j.yexmp.2009.04.002.

Similar to ubiquitination, SUMO modification is a dynamic process that can be reversed by SENPs [SUMO-1/sentrin/SMT3 (suppressor of mif two 3 homologue 1)-specific peptidases]. To date, six SENPs have been discovered in humans, although knowledge of their regulation, specificity and biological functions is limited. In the present study, we report that SENP7 has a restricted substrate specificity, being unable to process SUMO precursors and displaying paralogue-specific isopeptidase activity. The C-terminal catalytic domain of SENP7 efficiently depolymerized poly-SUMO-2 chains but had undetectable activity against poly-SUMO-1 chains. SENP7 also displayed isopeptidase activity against di-SUMO-2- and SUMO-2-modified RanGAP1 (Ran GTPase-activating protein 1) but had limited activity against SUMO-1-modified RanGAP1. in vivo, full-length SENP7 was localized to the nucleoplasm and preferentially reduced the accumulation of high-molecular-mass conjugates of SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 compared with SUMO-1. Small interfering RNA-mediated ablation of SENP7 expression led to the accumulation of high-molecular-mass SUMO-2 species and to the accumulation of promyelocytic leukaemia protein in subnuclear bodies. These findings suggest that SENP7 acts as a SUMO-2/3-specific protease that is likely to regulate the metabolism of poly-SUMO-2/3 rather than SUMO-1 conjugation in vivo.","['Shen, Lin Nan', 'Geoffroy, Marie-Claude', 'Jaffray, Ellis G', 'Hay, Ronald T']","['Shen LN', 'Geoffroy MC', 'Jaffray EG', 'Hay RT']","['Wellcome Trust Centre for Gene Regulation and Expression, School of Life Sciences, University of Dundee, Dow Street, Dundee DD15EH, Scotland, UK.']",,['eng'],"['BB/F010125/1/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom', 'C434/A7794/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090626,England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Carbon-Nitrogen Lyases/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Endopeptidases/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'GTPase-Activating Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Transfection']",2009/04/28 09:00,2009/11/06 06:00,['2009/04/28 09:00'],"['2009/04/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/06 06:00 [medline]']","['BJ20090246 [pii]', '10.1042/BJ20090246 [doi]']",epublish,Biochem J. 2009 Jun 26;421(2):223-30. doi: 10.1042/BJ20090246.,"['0 (GTPase-Activating Proteins)', '0 (Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (SENP7 protein, human)', 'EC 4.3.- (Carbon-Nitrogen Lyases)', 'EC 4.3.- (isopeptidase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously, we showed that Siva-1 inhibited the activity of the prosurvival transcription factor NF-kappaB. In the present study, upon TCR cross-linking of Jurkat T leukemia cells, we demonstrated that the inhibitory target of Siva-1 is upstream of the IKK complex in the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. Additionally, Siva-1 also suppressed the activity of another crucial transcription factor AP-1, and a common mediator of both these pathways is the adaptor protein TRAF2. Further, we observed that Siva-1 indeed interacted with TRAF2 and negatively regulated its activity by promoting K48-hnked polyubiquitination. Siva-1 specifically interacted with the ring finger domain of TRAF2, which is essential for its E3 hgase activity and its ability to subsequently activate NF-kappaB. TCR cross-linking of Jurkat T cells that lacked Siva-1 revealed significantly lowered K48- but elevated K63-ubiquitinated TRAF2 levels upon TCR cross-linking, suggesting that the differential pattern of ubiquitination in these cells essentially contributed to a robust and sustained activation of NF-kappaB.

It seems that co-ordinating biological molecules, which would serve as carriers, should contribute to minimising the toxic effects of the potential platinic drugs. AIM OF THE STUDY: Assessment of in vivo biological activity, and in particular of antineoplastic activity of new platinum(II) and palladium(II) complexes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The assessment of toxicity of the compounds was made with the Deichmann and Le Blanck method. The antineoplastic activity of the new complex compounds--pyrazole derivatives with Pt(II) and Pd(II) ions was tested on mouse L1210 leukemia cell culture and on lymphatic leukemia P388. BDF1 or CDF1 mice divided into groups of 5-9 animals were subject to the tests. RESULTS: Complexes 13, 21, 25, 16, 24 and 28 did not reveal any antineoplastic activity to the mouse L1210 leukemia, whereas complexes 13, 21 and 25 revealed in-vivo antineoplastic activity to the P388 leukemia, extending the mouse's survival time by about 50%. The control group consisted of mice which were administered a 14% methylcellulose solution. CONCLUSIONS: As a result of the tests conducted to asses the in-vivo antineoplastic activity it was found that the 25 complex demonstrates the strongest activity to the P388 leukemia. It may be presumed that it is caused by trans configuration of the complex predisposing to the creation of interstrand cross-links. It may be also caused by the presence of the chloromethyl substituents, located on N1 nitrogen atom of the ligand, which increases the capacity of nitrogen N7 guanine alkylation in DNA.","['Malinowska, Katarzyna', 'Modranka, Roman', 'Kubiak, Katarzyna', 'Mrowicka, Malgorzata', 'Klimczak, Alicja', 'Kedziora, Jozef', 'Rutkowski, Maciej']","['Malinowska K', 'Modranka R', 'Kubiak K', 'Mrowicka M', 'Klimczak A', 'Kedziora J', 'Rutkowski M']","['Uniwersytet Medyczny w Lodzi, Wydzial Fizjoterapii, Zaklad Chemii i Biochemii Klinicznej, Katedra Chemii i Biochemii Klinicznej. modmal@wp.pl']",,['pol'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Poland,Pol Merkur Lekarski,Polski merkuriusz lekarski : organ Polskiego Towarzystwa Lekarskiego,9705469,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Organoplatinum Compounds/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2009/04/28 09:00,2009/05/27 09:00,['2009/04/28 09:00'],"['2009/04/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/27 09:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Pol Merkur Lekarski. 2009 Jan;26(151):57-61.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Organoplatinum Compounds)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",,,,,,,,,,,Badanie aktywnosci przeciwnowotworowej nowych zwiazkow koordynacyjnych platyny(II) i palladu(II).,,,,,,

It is also a part of the purine system, which builds DNA and has potential places/spots of platinum drug co-ordination. Therefore, it may be hoped, that platinum(II) complexes with diazol ligands will have considerable affinity for DNA binding sites. The work was aimed at assessment of biological activity and especially of cytotoxic activity, of new complex connections of the selected diazols with Pt(II) and Pd(II) ions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The MTT test is aimed at the assessment of cytotoxicity of chemical compounds. It consists in the colorimetric determination of a product--farmazon, formed after adding MTT (bromide 3[4,5-dimetylo-2-ilo]-2,5-difenylotetrazolu) to the culture suspension in the presence of the compound subject to the test. All the tested Pt(II) complexes before adding to the cell cultures were dilluted in DMF. MTT tests for individual complexes were conducted on two cell lines L1210 and P388. RESULTS: Compounds 13, 21 and 25 on P388 neoplastic cell revealed about three times smaller in-vitro cytotoxicity, whereas platinum(II) and palladium(II) complexes 13, 21, 25, 43, 46, revealed cytotoxicity being about 3-4 times smaller than the reference cisplatin. Complex 45 revealed eight times smaller activity and complex 44 revealed significantly small, about two hundred smaller activity. CONCLUSION: Based on the MTT tests it may be concluded that compounds 13, 21 and 25 reveal selective cytotoxicity to P388 neoplastic cells.","['Malinowska, Katarzyna', 'Modranka, Roman', 'Kubiak, Katarzyna', 'Mrowicka, Malgorzata', 'Kedziora, Jozef', 'Klimczak, Alicja', 'Rutkowski, Maciej']","['Malinowska K', 'Modranka R', 'Kubiak K', 'Mrowicka M', 'Kedziora J', 'Klimczak A', 'Rutkowski M']","['Uniwersytet Medyczny w Lodzi, Wydzial Fizjoterapii, Zaklad Chemii i Biochemii Klinicznej, Katedra Chemii i Biochemii Klinicznej. modmal@wp.pl']",,['pol'],,"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Poland,Pol Merkur Lekarski,Polski merkuriusz lekarski : organ Polskiego Towarzystwa Lekarskiego,9705469,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Organometallic Compounds/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Palladium', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2009/04/28 09:00,2009/05/27 09:00,['2009/04/28 09:00'],"['2009/04/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/27 09:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Pol Merkur Lekarski. 2009 Jan;26(151):52-6.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Organometallic Compounds)', '5TWQ1V240M (Palladium)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",,,,,,,,,,,Aktywnoss biologiczna--in vitro nowych zwiazkow koordynacyjnych platyny(II) i palladu(II).,,,,,,

The reasons are poorly understood. Australian registry data on 14,824 cancers of adolescence and young adulthood seen between 1982 and 2002 were reviewed. A detailed substudy of clinical characteristics was analyzed from 179 AYAs with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), Ewing sarcoma (ES) or osteosarcomas (OS) treated at a single institution. Despite significant improvements in survival for both groups over the period in question, for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, rhabdomyosarcoma, ES, OS and HL, survival for AYAs was worse than for children. For ES, OS and HL, the survival gap occurred almost entirely in males (Hazard ratios compared with female AYAs of 1.8 [p < 0.01], 1.4 [p = 0.03] and 1.5 [p < 0.01] respectively). Survival outcomes from ES, OS and HL for female AYAs were not significantly different from children of either sex. For brain tumors and thyroid cancers, which are primarily treated surgically, there were no gender-related differences in outcomes. Although no differences in tumor stage or compliance were identified, male AYAs experienced less toxicity and lower response rates to chemotherapy (p = 0.008). Young males account almost entirely for excess mortality from chemosensitive cancers of adolescence and young adulthood compared to children, which may be due to relative underdosing with current chemotherapy dosing algorithms.","['Khamly, Kenneth K', 'Thursfield, Vicky J', 'Fay, Michael', 'Desai, Jayesh', 'Toner, Guy C', 'Choong, Peter F M', 'Ngan, Samuel Y K', 'Powell, Gerard J', 'Thomas, David M']","['Khamly KK', 'Thursfield VJ', 'Fay M', 'Desai J', 'Toner GC', 'Choong PF', 'Ngan SY', 'Powell GJ', 'Thomas DM']","['onTrac@PeterMac, Victorian Adolescent and Young Adult Cancer Service, Peter MacCallum Cancer Center, East Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/classification/*drug therapy', 'Proportional Hazards Models', '*Sex Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2009/04/25 09:00,2009/06/20 09:00,['2009/04/25 09:00'],"['2009/04/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/20 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.24376 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2009 Jul 15;125(2):426-31. doi: 10.1002/ijc.24376.,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,,,,,['Copyright 2009 UICC.'],,,,,,,,,,

BIO treatment significantly increased the expression levels of 364 genes including pluripotency markers such as Nanog and Klf family. Unexpectedly, by aggregating or microinjecting those ES cells to each eight-cell-stage diploid embryo, we stably generated germline-competent ES-derived mice. Furthermore, founder mice completely derived from female XO, heterozygous, or homozygous mutant B6 ES cells were directly available for intercross breeding and phenotypic analysis.

Mouse erythrocytes were used to verify a possible hemolytic activity Cytotoxicity mechanisms were investigated in HL60 cells. KA showed a moderate antiproliferative effect in MTT assay towards all cancer cells (IC(50), 9.1-14.3 microg ml(-1)). However, KA appeared not selective to cancer cells, since it also inhibited the lymphocytes proliferation (IC(50), 12.6 microg ml(-1)). Unlike KA, compounds 1-5 displayed no cytotoxicity and were also free from antiproliferative and hemolytic effects, suggesting that the exocyclic double bond (C16) unit may be the active pharmacophore of KA cytotoxicity. KA-treated HL60 cells displayed decreased proliferation (5-bromo-2';-deoxyuridine incorporation assay) and topoisomerase I activity (DNA relaxation assay). These assays revealed that KA primarily intercalates with DNA and not with topoisomerase I. Fluorescence microscopy using AO/EB (acridine orange/ethidium bromide) staining indicated that KA can induce both apoptosis and necrosis in HL-60 cell cultures, which corroborate the findings with MTT. From these findings, we conclude that KA, although demonstrating cytotoxic potential, may have a limited or poor therapeutic potential due to lack of selectivity to tumor cells.

We previously found that glutamate activates normal human T-cells, inducing their adhesion and chemotaxis, via its glutamate receptors of the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) subtype 3 (GluR3) expressed in these cells. Here, we discovered that human T-leukemia (Jurkat) and cutaneous sezary T-lymphoma (HuT-78) cells also express high levels of GluR3. Furthermore, glutamate (10 nM) elevates CD147/EMMPRIN, a cancer-associated matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) inducer, promoting spread of many tumors. Glutamate-induced CD147 elevation in both cancerous and normal human T-cells was mimicked by AMPA (glutamate/AMPA-receptor agonist) and blocked by CNQX (glutamate/AMPA-receptor antagonist). Importantly, glutamate also increased gelatinase MMP-9 secretion by T-lymphoma. Finally, ex vivo pre-treatment of T-leukemia with glutamate enhanced their subsequent in vivo engraftment into chick embryo liver and chorioallantoic membrane. Together, these findings reveal that glutamate elevates cancer associated proteins and activity in T-cell cancers and by doing so may facilitate their growth and spread, especially to and within the nervous system. If so, glutamate receptors in T-cell malignancies should be blocked.","['Ganor, Yonatan', 'Grinberg, Igor', 'Reis, Arbel', 'Cooper, Itzik', 'Goldstein, Ronald S', 'Levite, Mia']","['Ganor Y', 'Grinberg I', 'Reis A', 'Cooper I', 'Goldstein RS', 'Levite M']","['Department of Neurobiology, the Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['6-Cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Basigin/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chick Embryo', 'Chorioallantoic Membrane/metabolism/surgery', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Glutamic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Graft Survival/drug effects', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Transplantation/methods', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, AMPA/*metabolism', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",2009/04/25 09:00,2009/09/29 06:00,['2009/04/25 09:00'],"['2009/04/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/29 06:00 [medline]']","['910663790 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190902878448 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2009 Jun;50(6):985-97. doi: 10.1080/10428190902878448.,"['0 (Receptors, AMPA)', '0 (glutamate receptor ionotropic, AMPA 3)', '136894-56-9 (Basigin)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '3KX376GY7L (Glutamic Acid)', '6OTE87SCCW (6-Cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The strength of allergic reaction was evaluated by the extent of degranulation in mast cells sensitized with various stimulants. The levels of HO-1, HO-2, and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) expressions were determined by quantitative RT-PCR, western blotting, or immunocytochemistry. RESULTS: Heme oxygenase activity was upregulated after short exposure to quercetin, followed by the induction of HO-1 expression after long exposure to quercetin. The inhibition of degranulation by quercetin was reversed using tin protoporphyrin IX (SnPP), an HO-1 inhibitor. HO-1 metabolites, bilirubin and CO, led to inhibit degranulation, and quercetin translocated Nrf2 from cytoplasm into nucleus in RBL-2H3 cells. CONCLUSION: These results strongly suggest that quercetin exerted anti-allergic actions via activation of Nrf2-HO-1 pathway.","['Matsushima, Miyoko', 'Takagi, Kenzo', 'Ogawa, Miyuki', 'Hirose, Etsuko', 'Ota, Yui', 'Abe, Fumie', 'Baba, Kenji', 'Hasegawa, Takaaki', 'Hasegawa, Yoshinori', 'Kawabe, Tsutomu']","['Matsushima M', 'Takagi K', 'Ogawa M', 'Hirose E', 'Ota Y', 'Abe F', 'Baba K', 'Hasegawa T', 'Hasegawa Y', 'Kawabe T']","['MEXT Innovative Research Center for Preventive Medical Engineering, Nagoya University, Furou-cho, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya, 464-8603, Japan.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090424,Switzerland,Inflamm Res,Inflammation research : official journal of the European Histamine Research Society ...

We examine the application of two statistical methods for clustering such microarray expression data: EMMIX-GENE and GeneClust. EMMIX-GENE is a mixture-model based clustering approach, designed primarily to cluster tissue samples on the basis of the genes. GeneClust is an implementation of the gene shaving methodology, motivated by research to identify distinct sets of genes for which variation in expression could be related to a biological property of the tissue samples. We illustrate the use of these two methods in the analysis of Affymetrix oligonucleotide arrays of well-known data sets from colon tissue samples with and without tumors, and of tumor tissue samples from patients with leukemia. Although the two approaches have been developed from different perspectives, the results demonstrate a clear correspondence between gene clusters produced by GeneClust and EMMIX-GENE for the colon tissue data. It is demonstrated, for the case of ribosomal proteins and smooth muscle genes in the colon data set, that both methods can classify genes into co-regulated families. It is further demonstrated that tissue types (tumor and normal) can be separated on the basis of subtle distributed patterns of genes. Application to the leukemia tissue data produces a division of tissues corresponding closely to the external classification, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), for both methods. In addition, we also identify genes specific for the subgroup of ALL-Tcell samples. Overall, we find that the gene shaving method produces gene clusters at great speed; allows variable cluster sizes and can incorporate partial or full supervision; and finds clusters of genes in which the gene expression varies greatly over the tissue samples while maintaining a high level of coherence between the gene expression profiles. The intent of the EMMIX-GENE method is to cluster the tissue samples. It performs a filtering step that results in a subset of relevant genes, followed by gene clustering, and then tissue clustering, and is favorable in its accuracy of ranking the clusters produced.","['Do, K-A', 'McLachlan, G J', 'Bean, R', 'Wen, S']","['Do KA', 'McLachlan GJ', 'Bean R', 'Wen S']","['University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA. kim@mdanderson.org']",,['eng'],['P50 CA090270/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],20070402,United States,Cancer Inform,Cancer informatics,101258149,,,2007/01/01 00:00,2007/01/01 00:01,['2009/04/25 09:00'],"['2009/04/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2007/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Cancer Inform. 2007;5:25-43.

Recent studies, however, showed that an alternative mode of cell death, autophagy, is involved in the response to anticancer drugs. The specific role of autophagy and its relationship to apoptosis remains, nevertheless, controversial: it can either lead to cell survival or can function in cell death. We show that dexamethasone induced autophagy upstream of apoptosis in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. Inhibition of autophagy by siRNA-mediated repression of Beclin 1 expression inhibited apoptosis showing an important role of autophagy in dexamethasone-induced cell death. Dexamethasone treatment caused an upregulation of promyelocytic leukemia protein, PML, its complex formation with protein kinase B or Akt and a PML-dependent Akt dephosphorylation. Initiation of autophagy and the onset of apoptosis were both dependent on these events. PML knockout thymocytes were resistant to dexamethasone-induced death and upregulation of PML correlated with the ability of dexamethasone to kill primary leukemic cells. Our data reveal key mechanisms of dexamethasone-induced cell death that may inform the development of improved treatment protocols for lymphoid malignancies.","['Laane, E', 'Tamm, K Pokrovskaja', 'Buentke, E', 'Ito, K', 'Kharaziha, P', 'Oscarsson, J', 'Corcoran, M', 'Bjorklund, A-C', 'Hultenby, K', 'Lundin, J', 'Heyman, M', 'Soderhall, S', 'Mazur, J', 'Porwit, A', 'Pandolfi, P P', 'Zhivotovsky, B', 'Panaretakis, T', 'Grander, D']","['Laane E', 'Tamm KP', 'Buentke E', 'Ito K', 'Kharaziha P', 'Oscarsson J', 'Corcoran M', 'Bjorklund AC', 'Hultenby K', 'Lundin J', 'Heyman M', 'Soderhall S', 'Mazur J', 'Porwit A', 'Pandolfi PP', 'Zhivotovsky B', 'Panaretakis T', 'Grander D']","['Department of Oncology and Pathology, Cancer Centre Karolinska R8:03, Karolinska Institutet and Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm S-171 76, Sweden.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090424,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', '*Autophagy', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/agonists/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Nuclear Proteins/agonists/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/drug effects/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/agonists/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/agonists/metabolism']",2009/04/25 09:00,2009/08/20 09:00,['2009/04/25 09:00'],"['2009/04/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/20 09:00 [medline]']","['cdd200946 [pii]', '10.1038/cdd.2009.46 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2009 Jul;16(7):1018-29. doi: 10.1038/cdd.2009.46.

The most significant advance was the approval of the Merck compound raltegravir, the first licensed integrase inhibitor, in October 2007. Another milestone was the identification and characterization of specific nucleoprotein complexes that mediate integrase 3' processing and DNA strand transfer activities in vitro. Genome-wide distribution analyses have furthermore revealed that different retroviruses differentially target distinctive regions of chromatin during integration. For examples, lentiviruses favor actively transcribed genes whereas gammaretroviruses such as Moloney murine leukemia virus prefer transcriptional start sites. Though the underlying mechanisms are unknown for most retroviruses, the lentiviral preference is in large part guided through the interaction with the integrase binding protein lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF)/p75.

The skin can be involved in the context of known disease, but cutaneous signs are rarely the presenting findings. OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of unusual clinical cutaneous presentations of B-CLL. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective case series analysis of 3 patients with unusual cutaneous clinicopathologic presentations of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, including erythematous plaques, angiomatosis/telangiectasia, and erosive skin changes, respectively, without a previous clinical history of chronic lymphocytic lymphoma. Main outcome measures were clinical cutaneous presentations and histopathologic results in the diagnosis of underlying disease. RESULTS: In the 3 cases, lesion locations were the lower cheek, lower extremity, and penis (groin region). Histomorphologic testing showed mild to dense perivascular and periadnexal lymphoid aggregates throughout the dermis and extending into the panniculus, consistent with B-CLL. The diagnosis was confirmed with immunohistochemical studies that showed coexpression of CD5 and CD20 in the neoplastic lymphocytic infiltrate. LIMITATIONS: None. CONCLUSION: Cutaneous manifestations are an uncommon presentation of subclinical B-CLL.

The interval between diagnosis of breast cancer and the appearance of ALL was 4 years. The patient was treated with partial mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection followed by six cycles of CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil) chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Bone metastases were found 3 years after surgery, and she was treated with epirubicin and paclitaxel.

In the WHO classification scheme, pediatric LBL is considered to be the same disease entity as pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, it is unclear whether the genetic basis of pediatric LBL development is similar to that of pediatric ALL. We performed genome-wide analyses of copy number aberrations in 12 T-LBL and 7 precursor B-cell LBL pediatric cases using high-resolution SNP-based array CGH. Similar to what previously has been found in T-ALL, T-LBL exhibited recurrent deletions of the CDKN2A locus, occurring in 92% of the cases. Additionally, we detected deletions of RB1 (16%), duplications of MYB (16%), and an amplification of ABL1 in one case. These results show that, similar to T-ALL, the genomic alterations in T-LBL predominantly target genes involved in cell cycle progression. The majority of precursor B-cell LBL was characterized by high-hyperdiploidy (71%), and showed high resemblance with high-hyperdiploid precursor B-cell ALL. Taken together, our data suggest that pediatric LBL and ALL exhibit similar genomic abnormalities within confined immunophenotypic and cytogenetic subgroups, but that the representations of these subgroups differs between the two entities.","['Schraders, Margit', 'van Reijmersdal, Simon V', 'Kamping, Eveline J', 'van Krieken, Johan H J M', 'van Kessel, Ad Geurts', 'Groenen, Patricia J T A', 'Hoogerbrugge, Peter M', 'Kuiper, Roland P']","['Schraders M', 'van Reijmersdal SV', 'Kamping EJ', 'van Krieken JH', 'van Kessel AG', 'Groenen PJ', 'Hoogerbrugge PM', 'Kuiper RP']","['Department of Pathology, Nijmegen Centre for Molecular Life Sciences, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Cell Cycle', '*Cell Lineage', 'Child', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9/genetics', 'Gene Duplication', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genome, Human/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Polyploidy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*pathology', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/pathology']",2009/04/25 09:00,2009/05/06 09:00,['2009/04/25 09:00'],"['2008/10/27 00:00 [received]', '2008/12/18 00:00 [revised]', '2009/01/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/04/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/06 09:00 [medline]']","['S0165-4608(09)00048-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2009.01.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2009 May;191(1):27-33. doi: 10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2009.01.002.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pathophysiology of MDSs remains unclear. A definition of the molecular biology of MDSs may lead to a better classification, new prognosis indicators and new treatments. We studied a series of 40 MDS/AML samples by high-density array-comparative genome hybridization (aCGH). The genome of MDSs displayed a few alterations that can point to candidate genes, which potentially regulate histone modifications and WNT pathways (e.g. ASXL1, ASXL2, UTX, CXXC4, CXXC5, TET2, TET3). To validate some of these candidates we studied the sequence of ASXL1. We found mutations in the ASXL1 gene in four out of 35 MDS patients (11%). To extend these results we searched for mutations of ASXL1 in a series of chronic myelomonocytic leukaemias, a disease classified as MDS/Myeloproliferative disorder, and found mutations in 17 out of 39 patients (43%). These results show that ASXL1 might play the role of a tumour suppressor in myeloid malignancies.","['Gelsi-Boyer, Veronique', 'Trouplin, Virginie', 'Adelaide, Jose', 'Bonansea, Julien', 'Cervera, Nathalie', 'Carbuccia, Nadine', 'Lagarde, Arnaud', 'Prebet, Thomas', 'Nezri, Meyer', 'Sainty, Danielle', 'Olschwang, Sylviane', 'Xerri, Luc', 'Chaffanet, Max', 'Mozziconacci, Marie-Joelle', 'Vey, Norbert', 'Birnbaum, Daniel']","['Gelsi-Boyer V', 'Trouplin V', 'Adelaide J', 'Bonansea J', 'Cervera N', 'Carbuccia N', 'Lagarde A', 'Prebet T', 'Nezri M', 'Sainty D', 'Olschwang S', 'Xerri L', 'Chaffanet M', 'Mozziconacci MJ', 'Vey N', 'Birnbaum D']","[""Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille, Departement d'Oncologie Moleculaire, UMR891 Inserm, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, France.""]",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090415,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 2', 'Chromosomes, Human, X', 'Comparative Genomic Hybridization', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics']",2009/04/25 09:00,2009/09/11 06:00,['2009/04/25 09:00'],"['2009/04/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/11 06:00 [medline]']","['BJH7697 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.07697.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2009 Jun;145(6):788-800. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.07697.x.

However, B2M levels are heavily influenced by the patient's glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and this study aimed to evaluate whether GFR-adjusted B2M (GFR-B2M) had improved prognostic value compared to unadjusted B2M in a cohort of over 450 consecutive CLL patients from two separate institutions. Multivariate analysis identified a significantly shorter TFS in patients who were ZAP-70 + (P < 0.001), with increased GFR-B2M (P < 0.001), and del(11q) or del(17p) as detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH; P < 0.001). When OS was evaluated by multivariate analysis, age 65 years or older (P < 0.001) and poor risk FISH abnormalities (P < 0.001) had a confirmed adverse prognostic impact, but the predictive value of GFR-B2M was lost in the validation analysis. In all survival models, B2M did not attain independent significance unless GFR-B2M was eliminated from the analysis. In conclusion, GFR-B2M is a better predictor of TFS than unadjusted B2M in CLL patients.","['Delgado, Julio', 'Pratt, Guy', 'Phillips, Neil', 'Briones, Javier', 'Fegan, Chris', 'Nomdedeu, Josep', 'Pepper, Chris', 'Aventin, Anna', 'Ayats, Ramon', 'Brunet, Salut', 'Martino, Rodrigo', 'Valcarcel, David', 'Milligan, Donald', 'Sierra, Jorge']","['Delgado J', 'Pratt G', 'Phillips N', 'Briones J', 'Fegan C', 'Nomdedeu J', 'Pepper C', 'Aventin A', 'Ayats R', 'Brunet S', 'Martino R', 'Valcarcel D', 'Milligan D', 'Sierra J']","['Department of Haematology, Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain. jdelgadog@santpau.cat']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090415,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Creatinine/blood', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'ROC Curve', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Survival Rate', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/*blood']",2009/04/25 09:00,2009/09/11 06:00,['2009/04/25 09:00'],"['2009/04/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/11 06:00 [medline]']","['BJH7699 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.07699.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2009 Jun;145(6):801-5. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.07699.x.

NK cells have the potential to exert a powerful anti-leukaemia effect, as demonstrated by studies of allogeneic transplantation. We have previously shown that CD80/interleukin 2 (IL2) lentivirus (LV)-transduced AML cells stimulate in-vitro T cell activation. The present study demonstrated that allogeneic and autologous culture of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with CD80/IL2-expressing AML cells also promoted NK cell cytotoxicity. Expression of the activation receptors NKp30, NKp44, CD244, CD25, CD69 and HLA-DR significantly increased following allogeneic culture and a consistent increased expression of NKp30, NKp44, NKp46, NKG2D, NKG2C and CD69, and up-regulation of the cytolytic marker CD107a was detected following autologous culture with LV-CD80/IL2 AML cells. Furthermore, increased NK cell lysis of K562 and primary AML blasts was detected. The lytic activity increased by twofold against K562 (from 46.6% to 90.4%) and allogeneic AML cells (from 11.8% to 20.1%) following in-vitro stimulation by CD80/IL2-expressing AML cells. More importantly for potential therapeutic applications, lysis of primary AML cells by autologous NK cells increased by more than 40-fold (from 0.4% to 22.5%). These studies demonstrated that vaccination of patients with CD80/IL2-transduced AML cells could provide a powerful strategy for T/NK cell-mediated stimulation of anti-leukaemic immunological responses.","['Ingram, Wendy', 'Chan, Lucas', 'Guven, Hayrettin', 'Darling, David', 'Kordasti, Shahram', 'Hardwick, Nicola', 'Barber, Linda', 'Mufti, Ghulam J', 'Farzaneh, Farzin']","['Ingram W', 'Chan L', 'Guven H', 'Darling D', 'Kordasti S', 'Hardwick N', 'Barber L', 'Mufti GJ', 'Farzaneh F']","[""Department of Haematological Medicine, King's College London, London, UK.""]",,['eng'],"['BB/E005896/1/BB_/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090420,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'B7-1 Antigen/*genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genetic Vectors/administration & dosage/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Interleukin-2/*genetics', 'K562 Cells', 'Lentivirus/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Natural Killer T-Cells/*immunology', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Transduction, Genetic/*methods', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Young Adult']",2009/04/25 09:00,2009/09/11 06:00,['2009/04/25 09:00'],"['2009/04/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/11 06:00 [medline]']","['BJH7684 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.07684.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2009 Jun;145(6):749-60. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.07684.x.

Ingenol-3-angelate (PEP005) is an activator of protein kinase C and has antileukaemic and immunostimulatory effects in AML. We investigated primary AML cells derived from 35 unselected patients and determined that PEP005 caused a dose-dependent increase in the release of chemokines from clusters I and II, including several T cell chemotactic chemokines. The release of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and hepatocyte growth factor was also increased. CCL2-4/CXCL1/8 release correlated with nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB expression in untreated AML cells, and PEP005-induced chemokine production was associated with further increases in the expression of the NF-kappaB subunits p50, p52 and p65. Increased DNA binding of NF-kappaB was observed during exposure to PEP005, and the specific NF-kappaB inhibitor BMS-345541 reduced constitutive chemokine release even in the presence of PEP005. Finally, PEP005 decreased expression of stem cell markers (CD117, CXCR4) and increased lineage-associated CD11b and CD14 expression. To conclude, PEP005 has a unique functional pharmacological profile in human AML.

The cell lines used were CD22-positive parental Daudi and Raji, and their P-gp positive sublines, Daudi/MDR and Raji/MDR. Cells obtained from 19 patients with B-cell CLL or NHL were also used. The effect of CMC-544 was analysed by viable cell count, morphology, annexin-V staining, and cell cycle distribution. A dose-dependent, selective cytotoxic effect of CMC-544 was observed in cell lines that expressed CD22. CMC-544 was not effective on Daudi/MDR and Raji/MDR cells compared with their parental cells. The MDR modifiers, PSC833 and MS209, restored the cytotoxic effect of CMC-544 in P-gp-expressing sublines. In clinical samples, the cytotoxic effect of CMC-544 was inversely related to the amount of P-gp (P = 0.003), and to intracellular rhodamine-123 accumulation (P < 0.001). On the other hand, the effect positively correlated with the amount of CD22 (P = 0.010). The effect of CMC-544 depends on the levels of CD22 and P-gp. Our findings will help to predict the clinical effectiveness of this drug on these B-cell malignancies, suggesting a beneficial effect with combined use of CMC-544 and MDR modifiers.","['Takeshita, Akihiro', 'Shinjo, Kaori', 'Yamakage, Nozomi', 'Ono, Takaaki', 'Hirano, Isao', 'Matsui, Hirotaka', 'Shigeno, Kazuyuki', 'Nakamura, Satoki', 'Tobita, Tadasu', 'Maekawa, Masato', 'Ohnishi, Kazunori', 'Sugimoto, Yoshikazu', 'Kiyoi, Hitoshi', 'Naoe, Tomoki', 'Ohno, Ryuzo']","['Takeshita A', 'Shinjo K', 'Yamakage N', 'Ono T', 'Hirano I', 'Matsui H', 'Shigeno K', 'Nakamura S', 'Tobita T', 'Maekawa M', 'Ohnishi K', 'Sugimoto Y', 'Kiyoi H', 'Naoe T', 'Ohno R']","['Laboratory and Internal Medicine, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Higashiku, Hamamatsu, Japan. akihirot@hama-med.ac.jp']",,['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090413,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/analysis/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclosporins/therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Inotuzumab Ozogamicin', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/immunology/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy/immunology/metabolism', 'Quinolines/therapeutic use', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2/analysis/immunology', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2009/04/25 09:00,2009/09/11 06:00,['2009/04/25 09:00'],"['2009/04/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/11 06:00 [medline]']","['BJH7701 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.07701.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2009 Jun;146(1):34-43. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.07701.x.

Several studies have reported pDCL cases that do not express this exact profile or expressing some lineage antigens that could thus be misdiagnosed. This study aimed to validate pDCL-specific markers for diagnosis by flow-cytometry or quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction on bone marrow samples. Expression of markers previously found in normal pDC was analysed in 16 pDCL, four pDCL presenting an atypical phenotype (apDCL) and 113 non-pDC - lymphoid or myeloid - acute leukaemia. CD123 was expressed at significantly higher levels in pDCL and apDCL. BDCA-2 was expressed on 12/16 pDCL and on 2/4 apDCL, but was never detected in the 113 non-pDC acute leukaemia cases. BDCA-4 expression was found on 13/16 pDCL, but also in 12% of non-pDC acute leukaemia. High levels of LILRA4 and TCL1A transcripts distinguished pDCL and apDCL from all other acute leukaemia (except B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia for TCL1A). We thus propose a diagnosis strategy, scoring first the CD4(+) CD56(+/-) MPO(neg) cCD3(neg) cCD79a(neg) CD11c(neg) profile and then the CD123(high), BDCA-2 and BDCA-4 expression. Atypical pDCL can be also identified this way and non-pDC acute leukaemia excluded: this scoring strategy is useful for diagnosing pDCL and apDCL.","['Garnache-Ottou, Francine', 'Feuillard, Jean', 'Ferrand, Christophe', 'Biichle, Sabeha', 'Trimoreau, Franck', 'Seilles, Estelle', 'Salaun, Veronique', 'Garand, Richard', 'Lepelley, Pascale', 'Maynadie, Marc', 'Kuhlein, Emilienne', 'Deconinck, Eric', 'Daliphard, Sylvie', 'Chaperot, Laurence', 'Beseggio, Lucille', 'Foisseaud, Vincent', 'Macintyre, Elizabeth', 'Bene, Marie-Christine', 'Saas, Philippe', 'Jacob, Marie-Christine']","['Garnache-Ottou F', 'Feuillard J', 'Ferrand C', 'Biichle S', 'Trimoreau F', 'Seilles E', 'Salaun V', 'Garand R', 'Lepelley P', 'Maynadie M', 'Kuhlein E', 'Deconinck E', 'Daliphard S', 'Chaperot L', 'Beseggio L', 'Foisseaud V', 'Macintyre E', 'Bene MC', 'Saas P', 'Jacob MC']","['INSERM UMR645, Universite of Franche-Comte, Etablissement Francais du Sang Bourgogne Franche-Comte, 1 boulevard A.

Patients who have the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome and associated BCR-ABL1 oncogene have a particularly poor prognosis. Currently, allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is the only known curative treatment for Ph+ ALL and facilitating allo-HSCT in eligible patients is a key treatment goal. However, many patients relapse after allo-HSCT, particularly those with measurable residual disease prior to transplantation, and a significant percentage of patients are ineligible for allo-HSCT, particularly older patients. Hence, many patients require additional/alternative therapies to prolong survival. Studies are ongoing to determine the most effective first-line drug regimens for patients who subsequently undergo allo-HSCT and ineligible patients. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeted to Bcr-Abl are important novel therapies for Ph+ ALL. Although imatinib administered in combination with chemotherapy is established as the current first-line strategy, relapse is common, even among allo-HSCT recipients. Emerging data indicate that more potent multi-targeted kinase inhibitors (including dasatinib, nilotinib, and bosutinib) have promising efficacy in the first- or second-line setting. Here, the evidence base for existing drug treatments for Ph+ ALL is discussed and emerging therapeutic strategies are explored.","['Gruber, Franz', 'Mustjoki, Satu', 'Porkka, Kimmo']","['Gruber F', 'Mustjoki S', 'Porkka K']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Tromso, Tromso, Norway.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20090415,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Child', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Dasatinib', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Neoplasm, Residual/drug therapy/therapy', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*genetics/surgery', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Thiazoles/therapeutic use', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/04/25 09:00,2009/08/04 09:00,['2009/04/25 09:00'],"['2009/04/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/04 09:00 [medline]']","['BJH7666 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.07666.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2009 Jun;145(5):581-97. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.07666.x.

The indeterminacy of the maximum likelihood solutions, multicollinearity of predictor variables and data over-fitting cause unstable parameter estimates. Moreover, computational problems arise due to the large number of predictor (genes) variables. Regularized logistic regression excels as a solution. However, the difficulties found here involve an objective function hard to be optimized from a mathematical viewpoint and a careful required tuning of the regularization parameters. METHODS: Those difficulties are tackled by introducing a new way of regularizing the logistic regression. Estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs), a kind of evolutionary algorithms, emerge as natural regularizers. Obtaining the regularized estimates of the logistic classifier amounts to maximizing the likelihood function via our EDA, without having to be penalized. Likelihood penalties add a number of difficulties to the resulting optimization problems, which vanish in our case. Simulation of new estimates during the evolutionary process of EDAs is performed in such a way that guarantees their shrinkage while maintaining their probabilistic dependence relationships learnt. The EDA process is embedded in an adapted recursive feature elimination procedure, thereby providing the genes that are best markers for the classification. RESULTS: The consistency with the literature and excellent classification performance achieved with our algorithm are illustrated on four microarray data sets: Breast , Colon , Leukemia and Prostate . Details on the last two data sets are available as supplementary material. CONCLUSIONS: We have introduced a novel EDA-based logistic regression regularizer. It implicitly shrinks the coefficients during EDA evolution process while optimizing the usual likelihood function. The approach is combined with a gene subset selection procedure and automatically tunes the required parameters. Empirical results on microarray data sets provide sparse models with confirmed genes and performing better in classification than other competing regularized methods.","['Bielza, Concha', 'Robles, V', 'Larranaga, P']","['Bielza C', 'Robles V', 'Larranaga P']","['Departamento de Inteligencia Artificial, Universidad Politecnica de Madrid, Spain. mcbielza@fi.upm.es']",,['eng'],['R01 LM009520-01/LM/NLM NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090331,Germany,Methods Inf Med,Methods of information in medicine,0210453,IM,"['*Algorithms', 'Logistic Models', 'Neoplasms/classification/genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*classification/*statistics & numerical data']",2009/04/24 09:00,2009/07/17 09:00,['2009/04/24 09:00'],"['2009/04/24 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/17 09:00 [medline]']","['9223 [pii]', '10.3414/ME9223 [doi]']",ppublish,Methods Inf Med. 2009;48(3):236-41. doi: 10.3414/ME9223.

Among the 33 patients with normal bone marrow cell karyotypes, 5 (15%) had clonal, somatically acquired aberrations by SNP array analysis, including 4 with segmental uniparental disomies (UPD) and 1 with three separate microdeletions. Each abnormality was detected more readily in CD34+ cells than in unselected bone marrow cells. Paired analysis of bone marrow and buccal cell DNA from each patient was necessary to distinguish true clonal genomic abnormalities from inherited copy number variations and regions with apparent loss of heterozygosity. UPDs affecting chromosome 7q were identified in two patients who had a rapidly deteriorating clinical course despite a low-risk International Prognostic Scoring System score.

This makes detection of BCR-ABL aberrations of utmost importance for diagnosis, classification and treatment of leukemia patients. BCR-ABL aberrations are currently detected by karyotyping, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or PCR techniques, which are time consuming and require specialized facilities. We developed a simple flow cytometric immunobead assay for detection of BCR-ABL fusion proteins in cell lysates, using a bead-bound anti-BCR catching antibody and a fluorochrome-conjugated anti-ABL detection antibody. We noticed protein stability problems in lysates caused by proteases from mature myeloid cells. This problem could largely be solved by adding protease inhibitors in several steps of the immunobead assay. Testing of 145 patient samples showed fully concordant results between the BCR-ABL immunobead assay and reverse transcriptase PCR of fusion gene transcripts. Dilution experiments with BCR-ABL positive cell lines revealed sensitivities of at least 1%. We conclude that the BCR-ABL immunobead assay detects all types of BCR-ABL proteins in leukemic cells with high specificity and sensitivity. The assay does not need specialized laboratory facilities other than a flow cytometer, provides results within approximately 4 h, and can be run in parallel to routine immunophenotyping.","['Weerkamp, F', 'Dekking, E', 'Ng, Y Y', 'van der Velden, V H J', 'Wai, H', 'Bottcher, S', 'Bruggemann, M', 'van der Sluijs, A J', 'Koning, A', 'Boeckx, N', 'Van Poecke, N', 'Lucio, P', 'Mendonca, A', 'Sedek, L', 'Szczepanski, T', 'Kalina, T', 'Kovac, M', 'Hoogeveen, P G', 'Flores-Montero, J', 'Orfao, A', 'Macintyre, E', 'Lhermitte, L', 'Chen, R', 'Brouwer-De Cock, K A J', 'van der Linden, A', 'Noordijk, A L', 'Comans-Bitter, W M', 'Staal, F J T', 'van Dongen, J J M']","['Weerkamp F', 'Dekking E', 'Ng YY', 'van der Velden VH', 'Wai H', 'Bottcher S', 'Bruggemann M', 'van der Sluijs AJ', 'Koning A', 'Boeckx N', 'Van Poecke N', 'Lucio P', 'Mendonca A', 'Sedek L', 'Szczepanski T', 'Kalina T', 'Kovac M', 'Hoogeveen PG', 'Flores-Montero J', 'Orfao A', 'Macintyre E', 'Lhermitte L', 'Chen R', 'Brouwer-De Cock KA', 'van der Linden A', 'Noordijk AL', 'Comans-Bitter WM', 'Staal FJ', 'van Dongen JJ']","['Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['EuroFlow Consortium'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",20090423,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods/standards', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunoassay/*methods/standards', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protease Inhibitors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2009/04/24 09:00,2009/07/08 09:00,['2009/04/24 09:00'],"['2009/04/24 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/08 09:00 [medline]']","['leu200993 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.93 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Jun;23(6):1106-17. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.93.

Peripheral blood (PB) CD34(+) cells from patients with polycythemia vera (PV) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) generated in vitro significantly fewer mast cells (MCs) than normal PB CD34(+) cells. The numbers of MC progenitors assayed from MPN CD34(+) cells were, however, similar to that assayed from normal CD34(+) cells. A higher percentage of the cultured MPN MCs expressed FcvarepsilonRIalpha, CD63 and CD69 than normal MCs, suggesting that cultured MPN MCs are associated with an increased state of MC activation. Further analysis showed that a higher proportion of cultured PV and PMF MCs underwent apoptosis in vitro.

We studied the function of epigenetic regulation of the Wnt pathway and its prognostic relevance in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). We used a methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction approach to analyze the promoter methylation status of a panel of Wnt antagonists including sFRP1, sFRP2, sFRP4, sFRP5, DKK1 and DKK3. Aberrant methylation of Wnt antagonists was detected in four AML cell lines and in up to 64% of AML marrow samples. Treatment of the cell lines with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine induced reexpression of methylated Wnt antagonists and inactivation of the Wnt pathway by downregulating the Wnt pathway genes cyclin D1, TCF1 and LEF1 and reducing nuclear localization of beta-catenin. In a subgroup of patients 60 years and younger with newly diagnosed AML and intermediate-risk cytogenetics, abnormal methylation of Wnt antagonists was associated with decreased 4-year relapse-free survival (28 vs 61%, respectively, P=0.03).

Instead, targeting cellular functions that are distinctly different between normal and cancer cells may provide a basis for selective killing of tumor cells. One such strategy that is still largely unexplored is to utilize the relatively higher negative mitochondrial membrane potential in carcinoma cells compared with adjacent normal epithelial cells to enhance accumulation and retention of cytotoxic lipophilic cations in the former. In this study, the anticancer activities of a new class of rosamines with cyclic amine substituents and their structure-activity relationships were investigated. From an in-vitro cell growth inhibition assay, 14 of the rosamines inhibited the growth of human leukemia HL-60 cells by 50% at micromolar or lower concentrations. Derivatives containing hydrophilic substituents had less potent activity, whereas aryl substitution at the meso position conferred extra activity with thiofuran and para-iodo aryl substitutions being the most potent. In addition, both compounds were at least 10-fold more cytotoxic than rhodamine 123 against a panel of cell lines of different tissue origin and similar to rhodamine 123, exhibited more cytotoxicity against cancer cells compared with immortalized normal epithelial cells of the same organ type. In subsequent experiments, the para-iodo aryl substituted rosamine was found to localize exclusively within the mitochondria and induced apoptosis as the major mode of cell death. Our results suggest that these compounds offer potential for the design of mitochondria-targeting agents that either directly kill or deliver cytotoxic drugs to selectively kill cancer cells.","['Lim, Siang Hui', 'Wu, Liangxing', 'Burgess, Kevin', 'Lee, Hong Boon']","['Lim SH', 'Wu L', 'Burgess K', 'Lee HB']","['Cancer Research Initiatives Foundation (CARIF), Subang Jaya Medical Centre, Subang Jaya, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Molecular Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Xanthenes/chemistry/*pharmacology']",2009/04/24 09:00,2010/01/13 06:00,['2009/04/24 09:00'],"['2009/04/24 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/CAD.0b013e32832b7bee [doi]'],ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2009 Jul;20(6):461-8. doi: 10.1097/CAD.0b013e32832b7bee.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Xanthenes)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To help identify novel mutations in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), we performed a genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) screen to identify aUPD in 58 patients with atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML; n = 30), JAK2 mutation-negative myelofibrosis (MF; n = 18), or JAK2 mutation-negative polycythemia vera (PV; n = 10). Stretches of homozygous, copy neutral SNP calls greater than 20Mb were seen in 10 (33%) aCML and 1 (6%) MF, but were absent in PV. In total, 7 different chromosomes were involved with 7q and 11q each affected in 10% of aCML cases. CBL mutations were identified in all 3 cases with 11q aUPD and analysis of 574 additional MPNs revealed a total of 27 CBL variants in 26 patients with aCML, myelofibrosis or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Most variants were missense substitutions in the RING or linker domains that abrogated CBL ubiquitin ligase activity and conferred a proliferative advantage to 32D cells overexpressing FLT3. We conclude that acquired, transforming CBL mutations are a novel and widespread pathogenetic abnormality in morphologically related, clinically aggressive MPNs.","['Grand, Francis H', 'Hidalgo-Curtis, Claire E', 'Ernst, Thomas', 'Zoi, Katerina', 'Zoi, Christine', 'McGuire, Carolann', 'Kreil, Sebastian', 'Jones, Amy', 'Score, Joannah', 'Metzgeroth, Georgia', 'Oscier, David', 'Hall, Andrew', 'Brandts, Christian', 'Serve, Hubert', 'Reiter, Andreas', 'Chase, Andrew J', 'Cross, Nicholas C P']","['Grand FH', 'Hidalgo-Curtis CE', 'Ernst T', 'Zoi K', 'Zoi C', 'McGuire C', 'Kreil S', 'Jones A', 'Score J', 'Metzgeroth G', 'Oscier D', 'Hall A', 'Brandts C', 'Serve H', 'Reiter A', 'Chase AJ', 'Cross NC']","['Wessex Regional Genetics Laboratory, Salisbury, United Kingdom.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090422,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*genetics', 'Genome, Human', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics/metabolism', 'Microsatellite Repeats', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation, Missense/*genetics', 'Myeloid Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl/*genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Survival Rate', 'Uniparental Disomy/*genetics', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism']",2009/04/24 09:00,2009/07/17 09:00,['2009/04/24 09:00'],"['2009/04/24 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/17 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)37298-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-12-194548 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Jun 11;113(24):6182-92. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-12-194548.

We describe 9 CLL patients who underwent a spontaneous clinical regression over an 11-year follow-up, despite a residual neoplastic clone detected by flow cytometry. CD38 and ZAP-70 were negative in all cases. Immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (IgVH) genes, mutated in all 7 evaluable patients, were restricted to the VH3 family in 6, with the usage of V(H)3-30 gene in 2. The light chain variable region genes were mutated in 6 of 8 cases, with the use of V(kappa)4-1 gene in 3. Microarray analysis of CLL cells showed a distinctive genomic profile with an overrepresentation of BCR-related and ribosomal genes, regulators of signal transduction and transcription. The number of activated T lymphocytes expressing IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and IL-4 was similar between CLL in spontaneous regression and healthy persons. In conclusion, spontaneous clinical regressions can occur in CLL despite the persistence of the neoplastic clone, and the biologic features include negative CD38 and ZAP-70, mutated V(H)3-30 and V(kappa)4-1 genes. The peculiar gene profile suggests that BCR signaling may play an important role in this scenario as the most significant feature of the leukemic clone in regression.","['Del Giudice, Ilaria', 'Chiaretti, Sabina', 'Tavolaro, Simona', 'De Propris, Maria Stefania', 'Maggio, Roberta', 'Mancini, Francesca', 'Peragine, Nadia', 'Santangelo, Simona', 'Marinelli, Marilisa', 'Mauro, Francesca Romana', 'Guarini, Anna', 'Foa, Robin']","['Del Giudice I', 'Chiaretti S', 'Tavolaro S', 'De Propris MS', 'Maggio R', 'Mancini F', 'Peragine N', 'Santangelo S', 'Marinelli M', 'Mauro FR', 'Guarini A', 'Foa R']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University, Via Benevento 6, Rome, Italy.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090422,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/analysis', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Clone Cells', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/genetics', '*Remission, Spontaneous', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/analysis']",2009/04/24 09:00,2009/09/10 06:00,['2009/04/24 09:00'],"['2009/04/24 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)37061-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-12-196568 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Jul 16;114(3):638-46. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-12-196568.

If the mother-to-child transmission of HTLV-1 is more common for male infants than in female infants, longer exposure to the virus for males may explain the paradoxically higher incidence of ATL. OBJECTIVES: To test the hypothesis that the seroprevalence of HTLV-1 is male predominant during adolescence. STUDY DESIGN: The presence of HTLV-1 antibody in 272,043 blood samples donated to a regional blood bank in an HTLV-1 high-endemic region was assessed. RESULTS: The entire population of female donors had a significantly higher seroprevalence compared to males (2.05% and 1.80%, respectively, p<0.0001). However, compared with male donors, the carrier rate for female donors was lower for the youngest subgroup (16-19 years, p=0.0011); was similar for the next two age subgroups (20-29 years and 30-39 years); and was significantly higher for the last two age subgroups (40-49 years and over 50-64 years, both p<0.0001). In general, older age subgroups led to higher seroprevalence in both genders. CONCLUSIONS: HTLV-1 infection is more common for males until after age 20, when male to female sexual transmission becomes likely. This suggests that mother-to-child transmission is more common for males.","['Eshima, Nobuoki', 'Iwata, Osuke', 'Iwata, Sachiko', 'Tabata, Minoru', 'Higuchi, Yasunori', 'Matsuishi, Toyojiro', 'Karukaya, Shigeru']","['Eshima N', 'Iwata O', 'Iwata S', 'Tabata M', 'Higuchi Y', 'Matsuishi T', 'Karukaya S']","['Department of Biostatistics, Faculty of Medicine, Oita University, Oita 879-5593, Japan.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090421,Netherlands,J Clin Virol,Journal of clinical virology : the official publication of the Pan American Society for Clinical Virology,9815671,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Infections/*epidemiology/transmission/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Seroepidemiologic Studies', 'Sex Factors', 'Young Adult']",2009/04/24 09:00,2009/07/11 09:00,['2009/04/24 09:00'],"['2008/12/10 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/18 00:00 [revised]', '2009/03/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/04/24 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/11 09:00 [medline]']","['S1386-6532(09)00127-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jcv.2009.03.012 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Virol. 2009 Jun;45(2):135-8. doi: 10.1016/j.jcv.2009.03.012.

These cells represent a convenient model to study cell differentiation since all stages are morphologically well characterised. The bone marrow of patients suffering from the chronic phase of chronic myeloid leukaemia without a large increase in the granulocyte to erythroid ratio provided erythroblasts for computer-assisted image density measurements of RNA in nucleoli and cytoplasm at the single cell level. The measurements indicated a significant decrease of the nucleolar and cytoplasmic RNA concentration only in advanced stages of erythroblast differentiation (polychromatic and orthochromatic erythroblasts). The ratio of the nucleolar to cytoplasmic RNA concentration was otherwise very stable and did not change during differentiation, being similar in the early and advanced stages of erythroblastic development. In contrast, the nucleolar size significantly decreased even during the early stages of erythroid development (basophilic erythroblasts). This marked decrease in the nucleolar diameter in differentiating erythroblasts and the less marked decrease in the nucleolar RNA concentration suggest that the amount of RNA in the nucleolus is closely associated with nucleolar size rather than on its concentration within the nucleolar body.","['Smetana, K', 'Klamova, H', 'Jiraskova, I', 'Mikulenkova, D']","['Smetana K', 'Klamova H', 'Jiraskova I', 'Mikulenkova D']","['Institute of Haematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague 128 20, Czech Republic. karel.smetana@uhkt.cz']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090422,Germany,Acta Histochem,Acta histochemica,0370320,IM,"['Cell Differentiation/genetics/*physiology', 'Cell Nucleolus/*genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytoplasm/*genetics', 'Erythroblasts/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics', 'RNA/*genetics']",2009/04/24 09:00,2010/08/26 06:00,['2009/04/24 09:00'],"['2009/01/26 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/17 00:00 [revised]', '2009/02/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/04/24 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0065-1281(09)00020-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.acthis.2009.02.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Histochem. 2010 Jul;112(4):407-11. doi: 10.1016/j.acthis.2009.02.007.

The genotoxic and cytotoxic effects of the compounds were investigated both in vitro, in lymphocyte cultures obtained from blood samples of healthy donors and in vivo, in ascites cells of P388 leukemia obtained from the peritoneal cavity of DBA/2 mice. Preparations were scored for sister-chromatid exchange (SCE) and proliferation-rate indices (PRI). The newly synthesized compounds were also studied for antineoplastic activity against lymphocytic P388 and lymphoid L1210 leukemias in mice, by calculating the mean of the median survival of the drug-treated animals (T) versus the untreated control (C) (T/C%). The activity of caspase-2 and caspase-3, indicators of apoptosis, was assessed biochemically in primary cultures of human lymphocytes. Our results show that the newly synthesized compounds caused severe genotoxic effects by significantly increasing the frequency of SCE and decreasing the PRI values in cultures of peripheral lymphocytes in vitro and in ascites cells of lymphocytic P388 leukemia in vivo. A significant correlation was also observed in both the in vitro and in vivo experiments: the higher the SCE frequency the lower the PRI value (r=-0.65, P<0.001 and r=-0.99, P<0.01, respectively). The measured antileukemic potency was statistically increased by all test compounds in both types of tumours, while the activity of caspase-2 and caspase-3 showed a statistically significant increase after two periods of exposure. The genotoxic (increase of SCE), cytostatic/cytotoxic (decrease of PRI) and antileukemic effects (increase of T/C%) in combination with the induction of apoptosis (activation of caspase-2 and caspase-3) caused by the newly synthesized compounds, lead us to propose them as agents with potentially antineoplastic properties.","['Karapidaki, I', 'Bakopoulou, A', 'Papageorgiou, A', 'Iakovidou, Z', 'Mioglou, E', 'Nikolaropoulos, S', 'Mourelatos, D', 'Lialiaris, T']","['Karapidaki I', 'Bakopoulou A', 'Papageorgiou A', 'Iakovidou Z', 'Mioglou E', 'Nikolaropoulos S', 'Mourelatos D', 'Lialiaris T']","['Laboratory of Biology and Genetics, Medical School, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090303,Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,IM,"['Androsterone/*analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Ascites/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Azasteroids/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 2/metabolism', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytostatic Agents/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Esters', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/pathology/prevention & control', 'Leukemia P388/pathology/prevention & control', 'Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Molecular Structure', 'Mutagenicity Tests', 'Nitrogen Mustard Compounds/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Sister Chromatid Exchange/drug effects', 'Steroids/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Survival Analysis']",2009/04/24 09:00,2009/07/03 09:00,['2009/04/24 09:00'],"['2008/09/30 00:00 [received]', '2009/01/22 00:00 [revised]', '2009/02/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/04/24 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/03 09:00 [medline]']","['S1383-5718(09)00053-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mrgentox.2009.02.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 2009 Apr 30;675(1-2):51-9. doi: 10.1016/j.mrgentox.2009.02.010.

A long-term population-based follow-up study.,99-107,10.1111/j.1600-0609.2009.01256.x [doi],"In 1997-2003, a protocol for treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) (except promyelocytic leukaemia) was activated in four Swedish health care regions covering 50% of the national population. Based on cytogenetics and clinical findings, patients aged 18-60 yr were assigned to one of three risk groups. In this report we account for the long-term clinical outcome of enrolled patients. Patients received idarubicin and cytarabine in standard doses as induction therapy and consolidation courses included high-dose cytarabine. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) from an human leucocyte antigen-identical sibling was recommended in standard and poor-risk patients, whereas unrelated donor transplant was reserved for poor-risk patients. Autologous (auto-SCT) was optional for standard or poor risk patients not eligible for allo-SCT. Two hundred seventy-nine patients with de novo or secondary (9%) AML, median age 51 (18-60) yr, corresponding to 77% of all patients in the population, were included. Twenty (7%) patients were assigned to the good risk group, whereas 150 (54%) and 109 patients (39%) were assigned to standard- and poor-risk groups, respectively. Induction failures accounted for 55 patients; 16 early deaths eight of whom had white blood cell (WBC) >100 at diagnosis, and 39 refractory disease. Thus, complete remission (CR) rate was 80%. At study closure, the median follow-up time of living patients was 90 months. Median survival time from diagnosis in the whole group was 27 months and 4-yr overall survival (OS) rate was 44%. In good, standard, and poor risk groups, 4-yr OS rates were 60, 57 and 24%, respectively. Median relapse-free survival (RFS) time in CR1 was 25 months and RFS at 4 yr was 44%. Four-year RFS rates were significantly (P < 0.001) different between the three risk groups; 64% in good risk, 51% in standard risk and 27% in poor risk patients. One hundred-ten transplantations were performed in CR1; 74 allo-SCT (50 sibling, 24 unrelated donor), and 36 auto-SCT. Non-relapse mortality was 16% for allo-SCT patients. Outcome after relapse was poor with median time to death 163 d and 4-yr survival rate 17%. Three conclusions were: (i) these data reflect treatment results in a minimally selected population-based cohort of adult AML patients <60 yr old; (ii) a risk-adapted therapy aiming at early allogeneic SCT in patients with a high risk of relapse is hampered by induction deaths, refractory disease, and early relapses; and (iii) high WBC count at diagnosis is confirmed as a strong risk factor for early death but not for relapse.","['Wahlin, Anders', 'Billstrom, Rolf', 'Bjor, Ove', 'Ahlgren, Tomas', 'Hedenus, Michael', 'Hoglund, Martin', 'Lindmark, Anders', 'Markevarn, Berit', 'Nilsson, Bo', 'Sallerfors, Bengt', 'Brune, Mats']","['Wahlin A', 'Billstrom R', 'Bjor O', 'Ahlgren T', 'Hedenus M', 'Hoglund M', 'Lindmark A', 'Markevarn B', 'Nilsson B', 'Sallerfors B', 'Brune M']","['Division of Hematology, Cancer Centre, University of Umea, Umea, Sweden. anders.wahlin@vll.se']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090406,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Population Surveillance', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Survival Rate', 'Sweden', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/04/24 09:00,2009/07/31 09:00,['2009/04/24 09:00'],"['2009/04/24 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/31 09:00 [medline]']","['EJH1256 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2009.01256.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2009 Aug;83(2):99-107. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2009.01256.x.

The association between hair dye use and risk of bladder and hematopoietic cancers has been less conclusive. Most hair dye studies have been case-control studies conducted in Caucasian populations. We examined the relationship between personal hair dye use and cancer risk in a prospective cohort of 70,366 Chinese women. After an average of 7 years of follow up, 2437 women were newly diagnosed with cancer by 31 December 2005. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of cancer risk associated with hair dye use, adjusting for potential confounding factors. Compared with women who reported no hair dye use, ever users had an overall cancer risk of 0.89 (95% CI 0.82, 0.97). No significant association was observed for several common cancers, including cancers of the breast (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.78, 1.09), lung (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.62, 1.09), stomach (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.66, 1.21), and colorectum (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.84, 1.28).

We investigated the effect of CDK1 inhibition on p53 signaling after simultaneous dual blockade using the CDK1 inhibitor RO-3306 and the MDM2 inhibitor Nutlin-3 in AML. Treatment of growing AML cells with RO-3306 induced G2/M-phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner. We found that RO-3306 acts cooperatively with Nutlin-3 to induce mitochondrial apoptosis in a cell cycle-independent fashion. RO-3306 downregulated expression of the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and survivin and blocked p53-mediated induction of p21 and MDM2. CDK1 siRNA experiments showed that reduced CDK1 expression affects p53-induced p21 transactivation. We suggest that RO-3306 actively enhances downstream p53 signaling to promote apoptosis and that a combination strategy aimed at both inhibiting CDK1 and activating p53 signaling is potentially effective in AML, where TP53 mutations are rare and downstream p53 signaling is intact.","['Kojima, Kensuke', 'Shimanuki, Masaya', 'Shikami, Masato', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Nakakuma, Hideki']","['Kojima K', 'Shimanuki M', 'Shikami M', 'Andreeff M', 'Nakakuma H']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, Wakayama Medical University, Wakayama, Japan. k-koji@wakayama-med.ac.jp']",,['eng'],"['R01 CA089346/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-89346/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-49639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA049639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA055164-169013/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA055164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090310,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'CDC2 Protein Kinase/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'HL-60 Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Quinolines/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Thiazoles/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/drug effects/*metabolism']",2009/04/24 09:00,2009/07/09 09:00,['2009/04/24 09:00'],"['2009/04/24 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/09 09:00 [medline]']","['CAS1150 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.2009.01150.x [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2009 Jun;100(6):1128-36. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2009.01150.x.

Overexpression of EVI-1 also occurs with high frequency in leukemia patients without 3q26 abnormalities, and importantly, high EVI-1 expression is an independent negative prognostic indicator irrespective of the presence of 3q26 rearrangements. Recent gene targeting studies in mice revealed that Evi-1 is preferentially expressed in hematopoietic stem cells and plays an essential role in proliferation and maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells. In addition, intense attention has been focused on the EVI-1 gene complex as retrovirus integration sites because transcription-activating integrations into the EVI-1 locus confer survival and self-renewing ability to hematopoietic cells. The experimental results using animal models suggest that activation of Evi-1 in hematopoietic cells leads to clonal expansion or dysplastic hematopoiesis, whereas onset of full-blown leukemia requires cooperative genetic events. EVI-1 possesses diverse functions as an oncoprotein, including suppression of transforming growth factor-beta-mediated growth inhibition, upregulation of GATA2, inhibition of the Jun kinase pathway, and stimulation of cell growth via activator protein-1. In this article, we summarize current knowledge regarding the biochemical properties and biological functions of EVI-1 in normal and malignant hematopoiesis, with specific focus on its pathogenetic significance in hematological malignancies.","['Goyama, Susumu', 'Kurokawa, Mineo']","['Goyama S', 'Kurokawa M']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20090309,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,IM,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Chromosome Banding', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Genetic Variation', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics/*virology', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Mice', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogenes/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Virus Integration/*genetics']",2009/04/24 09:00,2009/07/09 09:00,['2009/04/24 09:00'],"['2009/04/24 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/09 09:00 [medline]']","['CAS1152 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.2009.01152.x [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2009 Jun;100(6):990-5. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2009.01152.x.

This cancer mainly affects older (>or=60 years) patients. MDS refers to a collection of hematologic malignancies that share an ineffective production, or hematopoiesis, of normal bone marrow or myeloid cells. As progressive bone marrow failure occurs, patients generally display gradually worsening cytopenias specific to the type of bone marrow cell affected, such as thrombocytopenia or neutropenia. MDS patients often develop disease-related anemia requiring chronic blood transfusion; this can lead to complications including iron overload. As MDS progresses and the number of bone marrow blasts increases, the disease transforms into acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Several classification systems have been developed to identify and differentiate particular types of MDS. Proper identification is essential, allowing the oncologist to determine prognosis, as well as the optimal therapeutic strategy. Several agents have been developed or are under investigation for the treatment of MDS, with the therapeutic goal of increasing survival and decreasing the rate of AML transformation. Currently, 3 agents are FDA-approved: azacitidine, decitabine, and lenalidomide. This clinical roundtable will discuss the optimal management of patients with each of these approved therapies, as well as the various classification systems used to differentiate MDS subtypes for treatment.","['Stone, Richard', 'Sekeres, Mikkael', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Lyons, Roger M']","['Stone R', 'Sekeres M', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Lyons RM']","['Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol,Clinical advances in hematology & oncology : H&O,101167661,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Consensus', 'Decitabine', 'Humans', 'Lenalidomide', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/*drug therapy/epidemiology/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Thalidomide/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",2009/04/23 09:00,2009/04/23 09:01,['2009/04/23 09:00'],"['2009/04/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/23 09:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol. 2008 Dec;6(12):1-15.,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To address this issue, we created a series of CARs that contain the T cell receptor-zeta (TCR-zeta) signal transduction domain with the CD28 and/or CD137 (4-1BB) intracellular domains in tandem. After short-term expansion, primary human T cells were subjected to lentiviral gene transfer, resulting in large numbers of cells with >85% CAR expression. In an immunodeficient mouse xenograft model of primary human pre-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, human T cells expressing anti-CD19 CARs containing CD137 exhibited the greatest antileukemic efficacy and prolonged (>6 months) survival in vivo, and were significantly more effective than cells expressing CARs containing TCR-zeta alone or CD28-zeta signaling receptors. We uncovered a previously unrecognized, antigen-independent effect of CARs expressing the CD137 cytoplasmic domain that likely contributes to the enhanced antileukemic efficacy and survival in tumor bearing mice. Furthermore, our studies revealed significant discrepancies between in vitro and in vivo surrogate measures of CAR efficacy. Together these results suggest that incorporation of the CD137 signaling domain in CARs should improve the persistence of CARs in the hematologic malignancies and hence maximize their antitumor activity.","['Milone, Michael C', 'Fish, Jonathan D', 'Carpenito, Carmine', 'Carroll, Richard G', 'Binder, Gwendolyn K', 'Teachey, David', 'Samanta, Minu', 'Lakhal, Mehdi', 'Gloss, Brian', 'Danet-Desnoyers, Gwenn', 'Campana, Dario', 'Riley, James L', 'Grupp, Stephan A', 'June, Carl H']","['Milone MC', 'Fish JD', 'Carpenito C', 'Carroll RG', 'Binder GK', 'Teachey D', 'Samanta M', 'Lakhal M', 'Gloss B', 'Danet-Desnoyers G', 'Campana D', 'Riley JL', 'Grupp SA', 'June CH']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104-5160, USA. milone@mail.med.upenn.edu']",,['eng'],"['1R01CA105216/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA105216/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI057838/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA120409/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1R01CA120409/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01AI057838/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA105216-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01113482/PHS HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090421,United States,Mol Ther,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,100890581,IM,"['Animals', 'CD28 Antigens/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/methods', 'Lentivirus/genetics', 'Leukemia/genetics/immunology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics/*physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/*physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 9/genetics/*immunology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2009/04/23 09:00,2009/11/06 06:00,['2009/04/23 09:00'],"['2009/04/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S1525-0016(16)31868-8 [pii]', '10.1038/mt.2009.83 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Ther. 2009 Aug;17(8):1453-64. doi: 10.1038/mt.2009.83.

Among therapeutic and prophylactic options being developed, B-cell depletion with monoclonal antibodies is encouraging. Because viral load after transplantation is correlated with PTLD occurrence, we developed a preemptive attitude based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-guided rituximab administration. METHODS: We monitored 115 transplant patients with a quantitative PCR for EBV DNA performed on whole-blood samples. Criteria for treatment initiation were a single PCR above 40,000 DNA genome copies per milliliter (gCop/mL) or two rising values above 10,000 gCop/mL. Weekly rituximab infusion at the dose of 375 mg/m was administered until negative PCR results were available. We evaluated the incidence of EBV reactivation and PTLD development. RESULTS: Nineteen patients (16.5%) met the criteria for treatment. Incidence of reactivation was the same in high-risk and standard-risk patients (12 vs. 7, P=0.38). One patient developed PTLD after discontinuation of therapy due to a serious adverse event. No other serious adverse events were noticed. Viral load disappeared after a median of three cycles of therapy, and weekly monitoring allowed prompt intervention. No PTLD-related death was observed, all-cause mortality in the treated population was 68%. CONCLUSIONS: Our PCR-guided and rituximab-based preemptive approach to avoid PTLD after allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation is feasible but probably overtreated patients. Prospective trials are strongly needed, they should use uniform PCR techniques and consider higher threshold values for treatment initiation.","['Ahmad, Imran', 'Cau, Nguyen V', 'Kwan, John', 'Maaroufi, Younes', 'Meuleman, Nathalie', 'Aoun, Mickael', 'Lewalle, Philippe', 'Martiat, Philippe', 'Crokaert, Francoise', 'Bron, Dominique']","['Ahmad I', 'Cau NV', 'Kwan J', 'Maaroufi Y', 'Meuleman N', 'Aoun M', 'Lewalle P', 'Martiat P', 'Crokaert F', 'Bron D']","['Department of Clinical Hematology, Institut Jules Bordet, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium. imran.ahmad@bordet.be']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anemia, Aplastic/therapy', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/*drug therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods/mortality', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Lymphoma/therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/surgery', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Rituximab', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survivors', 'Virus Activation/*drug effects', 'Young Adult']",2009/04/23 09:00,2009/05/15 09:00,['2009/04/23 09:00'],"['2009/04/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/15 09:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/TP.0b013e31819f1c49 [doi]', '00007890-200904270-00021 [pii]']",ppublish,Transplantation. 2009 Apr 27;87(8):1240-5. doi: 10.1097/TP.0b013e31819f1c49.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The human T-cell lymphotrophic virus (HTLV) has been associated with leukemia/lymphoma and progressive neurologic disease. There has, however, been an increased utilization of HTLV (+) grafts with little data available to support or discourage their use. METHODS: We performed univariate and multivariate analyses related to graft and patient survival for recipients of HTLV (+) donors and compared them with recipients of HTLV (-) donors using the United Network for Organ Sharing database. Complete analysis of recipient and donor clinical and demographic factors was performed. RESULTS: There were 81 adult recipients of HTLV (+) donors and 29,747 HTLV (-) donor recipients. HTLV (+) donors were more likely to be older, women, and black, with a higher average donor risk index and creatinine, and were more likely to be shared nationally. Recipients of HTLV (+) organs were at slightly elevated risk of graft failure (HR=1.39, 95% CI 0.91-2.11) and death (HR=1.20, CI 0.71-2.02) relative to HTLV (-) donor recipients (P=0.12 and 0.5, respectively). The risk decreased after multivariate analysis - graft survival (HR=1.20, CI 0.79-1.83) and patient survival (HR=1.06, CI 0.63-1.79). CONCLUSION: Our analysis reveals no statistically significant difference in graft or patient survival between recipients of HTLV (+) and (-) donors. Serious limitations of these data are that serologic testing for HTLV has a high false positive rate and that there was a short follow-up period.

Mutations of KIT occur in almost half of patients with core-binding factor leukemias, in which they have been associated with worse outcome. Development of new compounds targeting Kit may therefore hold promise for therapy. We investigated the activity and mechanism of action of APcK110, a novel Kit inhibitor, in the mastocytosis cell line HMC1.2 (KITV560G and KITD816V), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) lines OCIM2 and OCI/AML3 (both wild-type), and primary samples from patients with AML. We show that (a) APcK110 inhibits proliferation of the mastocytosis cell line HMC1.2 and the SCF-responsive cell line OCI/AML3 in a dose-dependent manner; (b) APcK110 is a more potent inhibitor of OCI/AML3 proliferation than the clinically used Kit inhibitors imatinib and dasatinib and at least as potent as cytarabine; (c) APcK110 inhibits the phosphorylation of Kit, Stat3, Stat5, and Akt in a dose-dependent fashion, showing activity of APcK110 on Kit and its downstream signaling pathways; (d) APcK110 induces apoptosis by cleavage of caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; and (e) APcK110 inhibits proliferation of primary AML blasts in a clonogenic assay but does not affect proliferation of normal colony-forming cells. Although APcK110 activity may partly depend on cytokine responsiveness (e.g., SCF) and not exclusively KIT mutation status, it remains a potent inhibitor of AML and mastocytosis cell lines and primary AML samples. APcK110 and similar compounds should be evaluated in clinical trials of patients with AML.","['Faderl, Stefan', 'Pal, Ashutosh', 'Bornmann, William', 'Albitar, Maher', 'Maxwell, David', 'Van, Quin', 'Peng, Zhenghong', 'Harris, David', 'Liu, Zhiming', 'Hazan-Halevy, Inbal', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Estrov, Zeev']","['Faderl S', 'Pal A', 'Bornmann W', 'Albitar M', 'Maxwell D', 'Van Q', 'Peng Z', 'Harris D', 'Liu Z', 'Hazan-Halevy I', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Estrov Z']","['Department of Leukemia , The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA. sfaderl@mdanderson.org']",,['eng'],['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],20090421,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Growth Processes/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dasatinib', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Oncogene Protein v-akt/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pyrazoles/*pharmacology', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Stem Cell Factor/metabolism', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology']",2009/04/23 09:00,2009/07/15 09:00,['2009/04/23 09:00'],"['2009/04/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/15 09:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-08-0034 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-0034 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2009 May 1;69(9):3910-7. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-0034.

The development of clinically applicable methods to produce large numbers of fully functional NK cells is a critical step to maximize the potential of this approach. We determined the capacity of the leukemia cell line K562 modified to express a membrane-bound form of interleukin (IL)-15 and 41BB ligand (K562-mb15-41BBL) to generate human NK cells with enhanced cytotoxicity. Seven-day coculture with irradiated K562-mb15-41BBL induced a median 21.6-fold expansion of CD56(+)CD3(-) NK cells from peripheral blood (range, 5.1- to 86.6-fold; n = 50), which was considerably superior to that produced by stimulation with IL-2, IL-12, IL-15, and/or IL-21 and caused no proliferation of CD3(+) lymphocytes. Similar expansions could also be obtained from the peripheral blood of patients with acute leukemia undergoing therapy (n = 11). Comparisons of the gene expression profiles of the expanded NK cells and their unstimulated or IL-2-stimulated counterparts showed marked differences. The expanded NK cells were significantly more potent than unstimulated or IL-2-stimulated NK cells against acute myeloid leukemia cells in vitro. They could be detected for >1 month when injected into immunodeficient mice and could eradicate leukemia in murine models of acute myeloid leukemia. We therefore adapted the K562-mb15-41BBL stimulation method to large-scale clinical-grade conditions, generating large numbers of highly cytotoxic NK cells. The results that we report here provide rationale and practical platform for clinical testing of expanded and activated NK cells for cell therapy of cancer.","['Fujisaki, Hiroyuki', 'Kakuda, Harumi', 'Shimasaki, Noriko', 'Imai, Chihaya', 'Ma, Jing', 'Lockey, Timothy', 'Eldridge, Paul', 'Leung, Wing H', 'Campana, Dario']","['Fujisaki H', 'Kakuda H', 'Shimasaki N', 'Imai C', 'Ma J', 'Lockey T', 'Eldridge P', 'Leung WH', 'Campana D']","[""Department of Oncology, Hartwell Center for Bioinformatics and Biotechnology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA.""]",,['eng'],"['CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA113482-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA113482/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA113482/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090421,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/immunology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/immunology/*therapy', 'U937 Cells']",2009/04/23 09:00,2009/07/15 09:00,['2009/04/23 09:00'],"['2009/04/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/15 09:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-08-3712 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-3712 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2009 May 1;69(9):4010-7. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-3712.

Despite evidence that both molecules are involved in interactions occurring between CLL and normal cells in the context of CLL-involved tissues, a functional link is still missing. Using gene expression profiles comparing CD38(+)CD49d(+) versus CD38(-)CD49d(-) CLL cells, we showed overexpression of the CCL3 and CCL4 chemokines in cells from the former group. These chemokines were also up-regulated by CD38 signals in CLL; moreover, CCL3 was expressed by CLL cells from bone marrow biopsies (BMB) of CD38(+)CD49d(+) but not CD38(-)CD49d(-) cases. High levels of CCR1 and, to a lesser extent, CCR5, the receptors for CCL3 and CCL4, were found in CLL-derived monocyte-macrophages. Consistently, CCL3 increased monocyte migration, and CD68(+) macrophage infiltration was particularly high in BMB from CD38(+)CD49d(+) CLL. Conditioned media from CCL3-stimulated macrophages induced endothelial cells to express vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), the CD49d ligand, likely through tumor necrosis factor alpha overproduction. These effects were apparent in BMB from CD38(+)CD49d(+) CLL, where lymphoid infiltrates were characterized by a prominent meshwork of VCAM-1(+) stromal/endothelial cells. Lastly, CD49d engagement by VCAM-1 transfectants increased viability of CD38(+)CD49d(+) CLL cells. Altogether, CD38 and CD49d can be thought of as parts of a consecutive chain of events ultimately leading to improved survival of CLL cells.","['Zucchetto, Antonella', 'Benedetti, Dania', 'Tripodo, Claudio', 'Bomben, Riccardo', 'Dal Bo, Michele', 'Marconi, Daniela', 'Bossi, Fleur', 'Lorenzon, Debora', 'Degan, Massimo', 'Rossi, Francesca Maria', 'Rossi, Davide', 'Bulian, Pietro', 'Franco, Vito', 'Del Poeta, Giovanni', 'Deaglio, Silvia', 'Gaidano, Gianluca', 'Tedesco, Francesco', 'Malavasi, Fabio', 'Gattei, Valter']","['Zucchetto A', 'Benedetti D', 'Tripodo C', 'Bomben R', 'Dal Bo M', 'Marconi D', 'Bossi F', 'Lorenzon D', 'Degan M', 'Rossi FM', 'Rossi D', 'Bulian P', 'Franco V', 'Del Poeta G', 'Deaglio S', 'Gaidano G', 'Tedesco F', 'Malavasi F', 'Gattei V']","['Clinical and Experimental Onco-Hematology Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, IRCCS, Aviano, Italy.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090421,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'Apoptosis/immunology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/immunology', 'Chemokine CCL3/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'Chemokine CCL4/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'Endothelial Cells/cytology/immunology', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha4/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*immunology/pathology', 'Macrophages/immunology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Receptors, Chemokine/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Up-Regulation', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/biosynthesis/*immunology']",2009/04/23 09:00,2009/07/15 09:00,['2009/04/23 09:00'],"['2009/04/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/15 09:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-08-4173 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-4173 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2009 May 1;69(9):4001-9. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-4173.

We previously found that a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the TNFSF13B promoter resulted in increased transcription, suggesting that genetic variation in TNFSF13B may influence its expression. We therefore wanted to determine if genetic variation in TNFSF13B is associated with high BAFF levels and non-Hogkin lymphoma (NHL) risk. We genotyped 9 tagSNPs within TNFSF13B in a clinic-based study of 441 NHL cases and 475 matched controls and evaluated the association of individual SNPs with risk of NHL; 3 tagSNPs were significant (P < 0.05). When categorized into low-, moderate-, and high-risk groups based on risk alleles, we found the permutation-corrected odds ratio for the trend to be 1.43 (P = 0.0019) for risk of B-cell NHL, 1.69 (P = 0.0093) for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, 1.43 (P = 0.029) for follicular lymphoma, and 1.06 (P = 0.21) for chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma. The mean serum BAFF level in those who carried the low-risk alleles was 2 ng/mL compared with 4.3 ng/mL in those with the high-risk alleles (P = 0.02). Taken together, our data suggest that genetic variation in the TNFSF13B gene is significantly associated with NHL risk and elevated serum BAFF levels.","['Novak, Anne J', 'Slager, Susan L', 'Fredericksen, Zachary S', 'Wang, Alice H', 'Manske, Michelle M', 'Ziesmer, Steven', 'Liebow, Mark', 'Macon, William R', 'Dillon, Stacey R', 'Witzig, Thomas E', 'Cerhan, James R', 'Ansell, Stephen M']","['Novak AJ', 'Slager SL', 'Fredericksen ZS', 'Wang AH', 'Manske MM', 'Ziesmer S', 'Liebow M', 'Macon WR', 'Dillon SR', 'Witzig TE', 'Cerhan JR', 'Ansell SM']","['Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",,['eng'],"['CA121569/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA092104/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA92153/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA092153/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA097274/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA121569-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA097274-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA097274/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA092153-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA121569/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090421,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Adult', 'Alternative Splicing', 'B-Cell Activating Factor/blood/*genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Gene Frequency', '*Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Iowa', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/blood/*genetics', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Risk Factors', 'Wisconsin', 'Young Adult']",2009/04/23 09:00,2009/07/09 09:00,['2009/04/23 09:00'],"['2009/04/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/09 09:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-08-4915 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-4915 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2009 May 15;69(10):4217-24. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-4915.

Although there is increasing acceptance of RPFNA, neither the reproducibility nor the inter-institutional compatibility of RPFNA has been established. To address these key limitations, the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) Prevention Group tested the reproducibility of RPFNA in a multi-institutional cross-sectional study. METHODS: Sixty-three high-risk women from five CALGB institutions (Duke, Ohio State, Roswell Park, Dana Farber, and Vermont) underwent RPFNA from July 1, 2007 to June 30, 2008. Duplicate bilateral RPFNA was performed on each woman by a single investigator on a single day. Masood Cytology Index score was assessed by a single blinded cytopathologist. RESULTS: There was a high degree of statistical agreement in the Masood Cytology Index scores of duplicate RPFNA samples from the same breast, with a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.8312 (P < 0.0001). Importantly, although there was agreement in duplicate samples from the same breast, there was lack of agreement between duplicate samples from the opposite breast. CONCLUSIONS: This multi-institutional study shows that RPFNA is a highly reproducible measure of breast cytology in a cooperative group cross-sectional trial. RPFNA did not show a high degree of agreement between breasts, suggesting that breast cancer risk and progression may occur at different rates in individual breasts from a single woman. These studies provide proof-of-principle for future RPFNA-based cooperative group prevention studies.","['Ibarra-Drendall, Catherine', 'Wilke, Lee G', 'Zalles, Carola', 'Scott, Victoria', 'Archer, Laura E', 'Lem, Siya', 'Yee, Lisa D', 'Lester, Joanne', 'Kulkarni, Swati', 'Murekeyisoni, Christine', 'Wood, Marie', 'Wilson, Karen', 'Garber, Judy', 'Gentry, Carleen', 'Stouder, April', 'Broadwater, Gloria', 'Baker, Joseph C Jr', 'Vasilatos, Shauna N', 'Owens, Elizabeth', 'Rabiner, Sarah', 'Barron, Abbey C', 'Seewaldt, Victoria L']","['Ibarra-Drendall C', 'Wilke LG', 'Zalles C', 'Scott V', 'Archer LE', 'Lem S', 'Yee LD', 'Lester J', 'Kulkarni S', 'Murekeyisoni C', 'Wood M', 'Wilson K', 'Garber J', 'Gentry C', 'Stouder A', 'Broadwater G', 'Baker JC Jr', 'Vasilatos SN', 'Owens E', 'Rabiner S', 'Barron AC', 'Seewaldt VL']","['Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710, USA.']",,['eng'],"['R01CA88799/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA033601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA114068-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA114068/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA114068/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA098441/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA155664/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA98441/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA088799/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA158668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090421,United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,IM,"['Adult', 'Analysis of Variance', '*Biopsy, Fine-Needle', 'Breast Neoplasms/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Nipples', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Risk Assessment/methods']",2009/04/23 09:00,2009/06/26 09:00,['2009/04/23 09:00'],"['2009/04/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/26 09:00 [medline]']","['1055-9965.EPI-08-1210 [pii]', '10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-08-1210 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2009 May;18(5):1379-85. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-08-1210.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Normal CD34(+), AML CD34(+), and CD34(-) sorted subfractions, and AML cell lines (TF-1 and KG1A) were exposed to simvastatin and tipifarnib. RESULTS: Both simvastatin and tipifarnib showed a cytotoxic effect on AML cell lines, which was additive when used in combination. In primary sorted CD34(+) AML cells, a heterogeneous response pattern was observed upon treatment with simvastatin when analyzing cell survival. A group of normal (n = 12) and abnormal (n = 10) responders were identified within the AML CD34(+) subfraction when compared with normal CD34(+) cells. This distinction was not observed within the AML CD34(-) cell fraction. When the CD34(+) AML cells were exposed to simvastatin and tipifarnib, a significant enhanced inhibitory effect was shown exclusively in the normal AML responder group, whereas the AML CD34(-) cell fractions all showed an enhanced inhibitory effect. The observed heterogeneity in AML responsiveness could not be explained by differences in effects on cholesterol metabolism genes or extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation in response to simvastatin and tipifarnib treatment. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that combined treatment with statins and farnesyltransferase inhibitors may be beneficial for a subset of AML patients that can be defined by studying the AML CD34(+) fraction.","['van der Weide, Karen', 'de Jonge-Peeters, Susan D P W M', 'Kuipers, Folkert', 'de Vries, Elisabeth G E', 'Vellenga, Edo']","['van der Weide K', 'de Jonge-Peeters SD', 'Kuipers F', 'de Vries EG', 'Vellenga E']","['Department of Hematology, University of Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090421,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Anticholesteremic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antigens, CD34/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Farnesyltranstransferase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Quinolones/*therapeutic use', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Simvastatin/*therapeutic use']",2009/04/23 09:00,2009/06/23 09:00,['2009/04/23 09:00'],"['2009/04/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/23 09:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-08-3004 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-3004 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2009 May 1;15(9):3076-83. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-3004.

Until recently, cell nuclear architecture has largely been assessed by subjective visual inspection of fluorescently labeled components imaged by the optical microscope. This approach is inadequate to fully quantify spatial associations, especially when the patterns are indistinct, irregular, or highly punctate. Accurate image processing techniques as well as statistical and computational tools are thus necessary to interpret this data if meaningful spatial-function relationships are to be established. Here, we have developed a thresholding algorithm, stable count thresholding (SCT), to segment nuclear compartments in confocal laser scanning microscopy image stacks to facilitate objective and quantitative analysis of the three-dimensional organization of these objects using formal statistical methods. We validate the efficacy and performance of the SCT algorithm using real images of immunofluorescently stained nuclear compartments and fluorescent beads as well as simulated images. In all three cases, the SCT algorithm delivers a segmentation that is far better than standard thresholding methods, and more importantly, is comparable to manual thresholding results. By applying the SCT algorithm and statistical analysis, we quantify the spatial configuration of promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies with respect to irregular-shaped SC35 domains. We show that the compartments are closer than expected under a null model for their spatial point distribution, and furthermore that their spatial association varies according to cell state. The methods reported are general and can readily be applied to quantify the spatial interactions of other nuclear compartments.","['Russell, Richard A', 'Adams, Niall M', 'Stephens, David A', 'Batty, Elizabeth', 'Jensen, Kirsten', 'Freemont, Paul S']","['Russell RA', 'Adams NM', 'Stephens DA', 'Batty E', 'Jensen K', 'Freemont PS']","['Department of Mathematics, Imperial College London, South Kensington, London, United Kingdom.']",,['eng'],"['Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United Kingdom', 'Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Biophys J,Biophysical journal,0370626,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/chemistry/*ultrastructure', '*Cell Nucleus Shape', 'Computer Simulation', 'Fibroblasts/cytology', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted/methods', 'Microscopy, Confocal/*methods', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Nuclear Proteins/analysis', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Transcription Factors/analysis', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/analysis']",2009/04/23 09:00,2009/07/01 09:00,['2009/04/23 09:00'],"['2008/08/04 00:00 [received]', '2008/11/18 00:00 [revised]', '2008/12/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/04/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/01 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-3495(09)00485-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bpj.2008.12.3956 [doi]']",ppublish,Biophys J. 2009 Apr 22;96(8):3379-89. doi: 10.1016/j.bpj.2008.12.3956.,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",,,,PMC2718263,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although originally identified as the normal cellular homologue of the oncoproteins encoded by avian and feline transforming retroviruses, c-Fes has recently been implicated as a tumor suppressor in breast and colonic epithelial cells. Structurally, c-Fes consists of a unique N-terminal region harboring an FCH domain, two coiled-coil motifs, a central SH2 domain, and a C-terminal kinase domain. In living cells, c-Fes kinase activity is tightly regulated by a mechanism that remains unclear. Previous studies have established that c-Fes forms high molecular weight oligomers in vitro, suggesting that the dual coiled-coil motifs may regulate the interconversion of inactive monomeric and active oligomeric states. Here we show for the first time that c-Fes forms oligomers in live cells independently of its activation status using a YFP bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay. We also demonstrate that both N-terminal coiled-coil regions are essential for c-Fes oligomerization in transfected COS-7 cells as well as HCT 116 colorectal cancer and K-562 myeloid leukemia cell lines. Together, these data provide the first evidence that c-Fes, unlike c-Src, c-Abl, and other nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, is constitutively oligomeric in both its repressed and active states. This finding suggests that conformational changes, rather than oligomerization, may govern its kinase activity in vivo.","['Shaffer, Jonathan M', 'Hellwig, Sabine', 'Smithgall, Thomas E']","['Shaffer JM', 'Hellwig S', 'Smithgall TE']","['Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15261, USA.']",,['eng'],"['R01 CA123756/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA123756-01A2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA123756-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA123756/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,IM,"['Animals', 'Bacterial Proteins/chemistry/genetics', 'COS Cells', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Enzyme Activation/genetics', 'Gene Silencing', '*Genetic Complementation Test', 'HCT116 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'K562 Cells', 'Luminescent Proteins/chemistry/genetics', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fes/*biosynthesis/chemistry/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction/genetics']",2009/04/23 09:00,2009/07/23 09:00,['2009/04/23 09:00'],"['2009/04/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/23 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/bi900238f [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 2009 Jun 9;48(22):4780-8. doi: 10.1021/bi900238f.,"['0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (yellow fluorescent protein, Bacteria)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fes)']",,,,PMC3222594,['NIHMS117744'],,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Retrospective study of 80 APL patients was performed and the complete remission (CR), the recovery time of peripheral hemoglobin and platelet, the early mortality, and the adverse reaction rates were analyzed between the ATRA group and the ATRA combined As2O3 group (combined group). RESULTS: CR rate of the combined group and the ATRA group was 91.7% and 87.5% respectively, which showed no significant difference; time of reaching CR, hemoglobin recovery, and platelet recovery for the combined group were 28.0 +/- 7.8 days, 22.36 +/- 8.72 days and 19.38 +/- 9.52 days respectively, while those were 47.7 +/- 10.9 days, 28.40 +/- 8.95 days and 28.03 +/- 7.29 days for the ATRA group, which suggested a significantly shorter period of the combined group of achieving recovery. With 7.1% compared to 13.2%, the early mortality of the combined group seemed lower than that of the ATRA group but with no significance observed (P>0.05). The adverse reaction rates of the two groups also lacked any significant difference (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: Compared with using ATRA alone, the combined therapy of AS2O3 and ATRA was dominant in achieving CR and recovery for APL. Besides, the combined therapy carries the promise of reducing the early mortality with no aggravation of the adverse reaction.","['Tao, Si', 'Zhou, Kun', 'Tang, Duo-Zhuang']","['Tao S', 'Zhou K', 'Tang DZ']","['Department of Hematological Diseases, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan.']",,['chi'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Zhong Xi Yi Jie He Za Zhi,Zhongguo Zhong xi yi jie he za zhi Zhongguo Zhongxiyi jiehe zazhi = Chinese journal of integrated traditional and Western medicine,9211576,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oxides/*administration & dosage', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tretinoin/*administration & dosage', 'Young Adult']",2009/04/23 09:00,2010/06/04 06:00,['2009/04/23 09:00'],"['2009/04/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/04 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhongguo Zhong Xi Yi Jie He Za Zhi. 2009 Feb;29(2):111-4.,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We also evaluated the reactivity of the anti-CD22 antibodies with basophils and noted that the pattern of staining was similar to that seen with pDCs.

We cloned and sequenced the genomic DNA of the zebrafish CXC-64 chemokine; it was most similar to CXCL11 from humans and CXCL10 from a catfish. The zebrafish CXC-64 gene is approximately 4.0 kb long and has a four-exon, three-intron structure common to the human CXCL11 gene. However, the promoter region includes a typical TATA box and multi-transcription factor-binding sequences. To understand the roles of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), poly I:poly C, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in regulating zebrafish CXC-64 expression, serial deletions were made in the promoter region of this clone. Different fragments of the zebrafish CXC-64 5'-flanking region were transfected into RAW264.7 (mouse macrophage; Abelson murine leukemia virus transformed) and zfl (zebrafish liver) cells and then treated with 0, 10, 50, 100, and 200 ng/ml LPS, poly I:poly C, or TNF-alpha. The results showed that the promoter activity presented dose-dependent effects in LPS-treated RAW264.7 cells, TNF-alpha-treated RAW264.7 cells, and LPS-treated zfl cells. These results reveal that the zebrafish CXC-64 chemokine gene promoter region can be induced by LPS in both human and fish cell lines, which suggests that it plays an important role in regulating LPS.","['Chen, Li-Chen', 'Wu, Jen-Leih', 'Shiau, Chyuan-Yuan', 'Chen, Jyh-Yih']","['Chen LC', 'Wu JL', 'Shiau CY', 'Chen JY']","['Department of Food Science, National Taiwan Ocean University, Keelung, 202, Taiwan.', 'Department of Food Science, National I-Lan University, Ilan, 260, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Cellular and Organismic Biology, Academia Sinica, Nankang, Taipei, 115, Taiwan.', 'Department of Food Science, National Taiwan Ocean University, Keelung, 202, Taiwan.', 'Marine Research Station, Institute of Cellular and Organismic Biology, Academia Sinica, 23-10 Dahuen Road, Jiaushi, Ilan, 262, Taiwan. zoocjy@gate.sinica.edu.tw.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090418,Netherlands,Fish Physiol Biochem,Fish physiology and biochemistry,100955049,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chemokines, CXC/*genetics', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Gene Components', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Lipopolysaccharides/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism', 'Zebrafish/*genetics']",2009/04/22 09:00,2010/12/21 06:00,['2009/04/22 09:00'],"['2008/11/17 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/04/22 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s10695-009-9321-y [doi]', '10.1007/s10695-009-9321-y [pii]']",ppublish,Fish Physiol Biochem. 2010 Sep;36(3):511-521. doi: 10.1007/s10695-009-9321-y.

In addressing this issue, we have developed two computational algorithms, CoExMiner and PathwayPro, to explore static features of gene co-expression and dynamic behaviors of gene networks. CoExMiner is based on B-spline approximation followed by the coefficient of determination (CoD) estimation for modeling gene co-expression patterns. The algorithm allows the exploration of transcriptional responses that involve coordinated expression of genes encoding proteins which work in concert in the cell. PathwayPro is based on a finite-state Markov chain model for mimicking dynamic behaviors of a transcriptional network. The algorithm allows quantitative assessment of a wide range of network responses, including susceptibility to disease, potential usefulness of a given drug, and consequences of such external stimuli as pharmacological interventions or caloric restriction. We demonstrated the applications of CoExMiner and PathwayPro by examining gene expression profiles of ligands and receptors in cancerous and non-cancerous cells and network dynamics of the leukemia-associated BCR-ABL pathway. The examinations disclosed both linear and nonlinear relationships of ligand-receptor interactions associated with cancer development, identified disease and drug targets of leukemia, and provided new insights into biology of the diseases. The analysis using these newly developed algorithms show the great usefulness of computational systems biology approaches for biological and medical research.","['Li, Huai', 'Sun, Yu', 'Zhan, Ming']","['Li H', 'Sun Y', 'Zhan M']","['Bioinformatics Unit, Branch of Research Resources, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health, Baltimore, MD, USA.']",,['eng'],['Z01 AG000619-01/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', 'Review']",,United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,IM,"['*Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Computational Biology/*methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology', 'Gene Regulatory Networks/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Models, Biological', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Interaction Mapping/methods', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology']",2009/04/22 09:00,2009/06/18 09:00,['2009/04/22 09:00'],"['2009/04/22 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/18 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-59745-243-4_12 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2009;541:249-67. doi: 10.1007/978-1-59745-243-4_12.,,,,36,PMC2786169,['NIHMS159644'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we provide further evidence, using cell-free assays, that the BH3 domain of Puma binds Bax at an activation site that comprises the first helix of Bax. We also show that, in yeast, Puma interacts with Bax and triggers its killing activity when Bcl-2 homologues are absent but not when Bcl-xL is expressed. Finally, endogenous Puma is involved in the apoptotic response of human colorectal cancer cells to the Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibitor ABT-737, even in conditions where the expression of Mcl-1 is down-regulated. Thus, Puma is competent to trigger Bax activity by itself, thereby promoting cellular dependence on prosurvival Bcl-2 family members.","['Gallenne, Tristan', 'Gautier, Fabien', 'Oliver, Lisa', 'Hervouet, Eric', 'Noel, Belinda', 'Hickman, John A', 'Geneste, Olivier', 'Cartron, Pierre-Francois', 'Vallette, Francois M', 'Manon, Stephen', 'Juin, Philippe']","['Gallenne T', 'Gautier F', 'Oliver L', 'Hervouet E', 'Noel B', 'Hickman JA', 'Geneste O', 'Cartron PF', 'Vallette FM', 'Manon S', 'Juin P']","['Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale Unite Mixte de Recherche 892, Departement de Recherche en Cancerologie, F-44035 Nantes, Cedex 01, France.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,IM,"['Apoptosis/physiology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Biphenyl Compounds/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Nitrophenols/metabolism', 'Piperazines/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Sulfonamides/metabolism', 'Yeasts/physiology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism']",2009/04/22 09:00,2009/05/16 09:00,['2009/04/22 09:00'],"['2009/04/22 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/16 09:00 [medline]']","['jcb.200809153 [pii]', '10.1083/jcb.200809153 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Biol. 2009 Apr 20;185(2):279-90. doi: 10.1083/jcb.200809153.,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BBC3 protein, human)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)']",,,,PMC2700382,,['J Cell Biol. 2009 Apr 20;185(2):189-91.

These observations led to the hypothesis that HTLV-1 specific CTLs are ineffective in controlling HTLV-1 replication but contribute to the pathogenesis of the inflammatory diseases. But evidence from host and viral immunogenetics and gene expression microarrays suggests that a strong CTL response is associated with a low proviral load and a low risk of HAM/TSP. Here, we quantified the frequency, lytic activity and functional avidity of HTLV-1-specific CD8(+) cells in fresh, unstimulated PBMCs from individuals with natural HTLV-1 infection. The lytic efficiency of the CD8(+) T cell response-the fraction of autologous HTLV-1-expressing cells eliminated per CD8(+) cell per day-was inversely correlated with both the proviral load and the rate of spontaneous proviral expression. The functional avidity of HTLV-1-specific CD8(+) cells was strongly correlated with their lytic efficiency. We conclude that efficient control of HTLV-1 in vivo depends on the CTL lytic efficiency, which depends in turn on CTL avidity of Ag recognition. CTL quality determines the position of virus-host equilibrium in persistent HTLV-1 infection.","['Kattan, Tarek', 'MacNamara, Aidan', 'Rowan, Aileen G', 'Nose, Hirohisa', 'Mosley, Angelina J', 'Tanaka, Yuetsu', 'Taylor, Graham P', 'Asquith, Becca', 'Bangham, Charles R M']","['Kattan T', 'MacNamara A', 'Rowan AG', 'Nose H', 'Mosley AJ', 'Tanaka Y', 'Taylor GP', 'Asquith B', 'Bangham CR']","['Department of Immunology, Wright-Fleming Institute, Imperial College London, United Kingdom.']",,['eng'],"['G0401616/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'G0601072/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigen Presentation/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology/*virology', 'Cell Adhesion/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chronic Disease', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/immunology/pathology/virology', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/immunology/pathology/virology', 'Proviruses/genetics/immunology', 'Rats', '*Viral Load']",2009/04/22 09:00,2009/06/16 09:00,['2009/04/22 09:00'],"['2009/04/22 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/16 09:00 [medline]']","['182/9/5723 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.0900069 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2009 May 1;182(9):5723-9. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.0900069.,"['0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The explanation for such differential sensitivity remains unknown. In this study, we report studies contrasting the response to PDE4 inhibitor treatment in CLL cells and normal human T and B cells. Affymetrix gene chip analysis in the three cell populations following treatment with the PDE4 inhibitor rolipram identified a set of up-regulated transcripts with unusually high fold changes in the CLL samples, several of which are likely part of compensatory negative feedback loops. The high fold changes were due to low basal transcript levels in CLL cells, suggesting that cAMP-mediated signaling may be unusually tightly regulated in this cell type. Rolipram treatment augmented cAMP levels and induced ATF-1/CREB serine 63/133 phosphorylation in both B lineage cell types but not T cells. As treatment with the broad-spectrum PDE inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine induced T cell CREB phosphorylation, we tested a series of family-specific PDE inhibitors for their ability to mimic 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine-induced ATF-1/CREB phosphorylation. Whereas PDE3 inhibitors alone had no effect, the combination of PDE3 and PDE4 inhibitors induced ATF-1/CREB serine 63/133 phosphorylation in T cells. Consistent with this observation, PDE3B transcript and protein levels were low in CLL cells but easily detectable in T cells. Combined PDE3/4 inhibition did not induce T cell apoptosis, suggesting that cAMP-mediated signal transduction that leads to robust ATF-1/CREB serine 63/133 phosphorylation is not sufficient to induce apoptosis in this lymphoid lineage.","['Meyers, John A', 'Su, Derrick W', 'Lerner, Adam']","['Meyers JA', 'Su DW', 'Lerner A']","['Evans Department of Medicine, Section of Hematology and Oncology, Boston Medical Center, Boston, MA 02118, USA.']",,['eng'],"['T32 HL007501-27/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA106705-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL007501/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL007501/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA106705/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA106705/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/cytology/*enzymology/pathology', 'Cell Lineage/genetics/immunology', 'Cyclic AMP/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/immunology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*enzymology/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic, T-Cell/*enzymology/*pathology', '*Phosphodiesterase 3 Inhibitors', '*Phosphodiesterase 4 Inhibitors', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*enzymology/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2009/04/22 09:00,2009/06/16 09:00,['2009/04/22 09:00'],"['2009/04/22 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/16 09:00 [medline]']","['182/9/5400 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.0804255 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2009 May 1;182(9):5400-11. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.0804255.,"['0 (Phosphodiesterase 3 Inhibitors)', '0 (Phosphodiesterase 4 Inhibitors)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)']",,,,PMC2676892,['NIHMS108934'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a monoclonal antibody we have first purified endogenous Bcr-Abl protein complexes from the CML K562 cell line and characterized the set of most tightly-associated interactors by MS. Nine interactors were subsequently subjected to tandem affinity purifications/MS analysis to obtain a molecular interaction network of some hundred cellular proteins. The resulting network revealed a high degree of interconnection of 7 ""core"" components around Bcr-Abl (Grb2, Shc1, Crk-I, c-Cbl, p85, Sts-1, and SHIP-2), and their links to different signaling pathways. Quantitative proteomics analysis showed that tyrosine kinase inhibitors lead to a disruption of this network. Certain components still appear to interact with Bcr-Abl in a phosphotyrosine-independent manner. We propose that Bcr-Abl and other drug targets, rather than being considered as single polypeptides, can be considered as complex protein assemblies that remodel upon drug action.","['Brehme, Marc', 'Hantschel, Oliver', 'Colinge, Jacques', 'Kaupe, Ines', 'Planyavsky, Melanie', 'Kocher, Thomas', 'Mechtler, Karl', 'Bennett, Keiryn L', 'Superti-Furga, Giulio']","['Brehme M', 'Hantschel O', 'Colinge J', 'Kaupe I', 'Planyavsky M', 'Kocher T', 'Mechtler K', 'Bennett KL', 'Superti-Furga G']","['Research Center for Molecular Medicine, Austrian Academy of Sciences, Lazarettgasse 19, 1090 Vienna, Austria.']",,['eng'],['P 18737/FWF_/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090420,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Cell Line', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Multienzyme Complexes/*antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Protein Interaction Mapping', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proteomics']",2009/04/22 09:00,2009/05/30 09:00,['2009/04/22 09:00'],"['2009/04/22 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/30 09:00 [medline]']","['0900653106 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0900653106 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2009 May 5;106(18):7414-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0900653106.

Both covalent modification of PML by the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) and non-covalent binding of SUMO to the PML SUMO binding domain (SBD) are necessary for PML NB formation and maturation. PML sumoylation and proteasome-dependent degradation induced by the E3 ubiquitin ligase, RNF4, are enhanced by the acute promyelocytic leukemia therapeutic agent, arsenic trioxide (As2O3). Here, we established a novel bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) assay to dissect and monitor PML/SUMO interactions dynamically in living cells upon addition of therapeutic agents. Using this sensitive and quantitative SUMO BRET assay that distinguishes PML sumoylation from SBD-mediated PML/SUMO non-covalent interactions, we probed the respective roles of covalent and non-covalent PML/SUMO interactions in PML degradation and interaction with RNF4. We found that, although dispensable for As2O3-enhanced PML sumoylation and RNF4 interaction, PML SBD core sequence was required for As2O3- and RNF4-induced PML degradation. As confirmed with a phosphomimetic mutant, phosphorylation of a stretch of serine residues, contained within PML SBD was needed for PML interaction with SUMO-modified protein partners and thus for NB maturation. However, mutation of these serine residues did not impair As2O3- and RNF4-induced PML degradation, contrasting with the known role of these phosphoserine residues for casein kinase 2-promoted PML degradation. Altogether, these data suggest a model whereby sumoylation- and SBD-dependent PML oligomerization within NBs is sufficient for RNF4-mediated PML degradation and does not require the phosphorylation-dependent association of PML with other sumoylated partners.","['Percherancier, Yann', 'Germain-Desprez, Delphine', 'Galisson, Frederic', 'Mascle, Xavier H', 'Dianoux, Laurent', 'Estephan, Patricia', 'Chelbi-Alix, Mounira K', 'Aubry, Muriel']","['Percherancier Y', 'Germain-Desprez D', 'Galisson F', 'Mascle XH', 'Dianoux L', 'Estephan P', 'Chelbi-Alix MK', 'Aubry M']","['From the CNRS FRE2937, Institut Andre Lwoff, Villejuif 94801, France.', 'Departement de Biochimie, Universite de Montreal, Montreal H3C 3J7, Canada.', 'From the CNRS FRE2937, Institut Andre Lwoff, Villejuif 94801, France.', 'Departement de Biochimie, Universite de Montreal, Montreal H3C 3J7, Canada.', 'From the CNRS FRE2937, Institut Andre Lwoff, Villejuif 94801, France.', 'Departement de Biochimie, Universite de Montreal, Montreal H3C 3J7, Canada.', 'From the CNRS FRE2937, Institut Andre Lwoff, Villejuif 94801, France.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: An individual patient data-based meta-analysis was performed on 180 adult patients with AML and t(11q23). These patients were identified by cytogenetics and/or molecular techniques and treated within eight prospective multicenter trials of the German AML Intergroup. The median follow-up time was 53 months. RESULTS: Complete remission rate was 71%. Favorable factors for induction success were the presence of a t(9;11), t(11q23) as a sole aberration, and de novo leukemia. OS rate at 4 years was 29%. Translocations other than t(9;11), platelets less than the median, secondary leukemia, and peripheral blasts greater than the median were adverse risk factors for OS. RFS rate at 4 years was 29%. The presence of a t(6;11) and peripheral blasts greater than the median had a negative impact on RFS. Three risk groups for OS and RFS could be defined by the combination of these factors with 4-year OS rates of 50%, 28%, and 5% and 4-year RFS rates of 37%, 26%, and 5%.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data from nine Cancer and Leukemia Group B trials that enrolled 1,296 men from 1991 to 2004 were pooled. Men were eligible if they had prostate cancer that had progressed during androgen deprivation therapy and did not receive prior treatment with chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or other nonhormonal therapy. Landmark analyses of PFS at 3 and 6 months from randomization/registration were performed to minimize lead time bias. The proportional hazards model was used to assess the significance effect of PFS rate at 3 and at 6 months in predicting OS. In addition, biochemical progression using the definitions of Prostate-Specific Antigen Working Group (PSAW) Criteria PSAWG1 and PSAWG2 were analyzed as time-dependent covariates in predicting OS. RESULTS: The median survival time among men who experienced progression at 3 months was 9.2 months (95% CI, 8.0 to 10.0 months) compared with 17.8 months in men who did not experience progression at 3 months (95% CI, 16.2 to 20.4 months; P < .0001). Compared with men who did not progress at 3 and at 6 months, the adjusted hazard ratios for death were 2.0 (95% CI, 1.7 to 2.4; P < .001) and 1.9 (95% CI, 1.6 to 2.4; P < .001) for men who experienced progression at 3 and 6 months, respectively. In addition, biochemical progression at 3 months predicted OS. The association between PFS and OS was 0.30 (95% confidence limits = 0.26, 0.32). CONCLUSION: PFS at 3 and 6 months and biochemical progression at 3 months predict OS. These observations require prospective validation.","['Halabi, Susan', 'Vogelzang, Nicholas J', 'Ou, San-San', 'Owzar, Kouros', 'Archer, Laura', 'Small, Eric J']","['Halabi S', 'Vogelzang NJ', 'Ou SS', 'Owzar K', 'Archer L', 'Small EJ']","['Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Duke University Medical Center, 2424 Erwin Rd, Durham, NC 27705, USA. susan.halabi@duke.edu']",,['eng'],['CA 36601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20090420,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Clinical Trials as Topic', '*Disease Progression', '*Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen/analysis', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*metabolism/*mortality/pathology/surgery', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/04/22 09:00,2009/07/10 09:00,['2009/04/22 09:00'],"['2009/04/22 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/10 09:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2008.18.9159 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2008.18.9159 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2009 Jun 10;27(17):2766-71. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2008.18.9159.

These exposures can derive, due to the effects of direct and scattered radiation, in deterministic effects (radiodermitis, aged skin, cataracts, telangiectasia in nasal region, vasocellular epitelioms, hands depilation) and/or stochastic ones (cancer incidence). A methodology has been proposed for estimating the radiation risk or detriment from a group of six exposed interventional radiologists of the Hospital Universitario La Fe (Valencia, Spain), which had developed general exposition symptoms attributable to deterministic effects of ionizing radiation. Equivalent doses have been periodically registered using TLD's and wrist dosimeters, H(p)(10) and H(p)(0.07), respectively, and estimated through the observation of translocations in lymphocytes of peripheral blood (biological methods), by extrapolating the yield of translocations to their respective dose-effect curves. The software RADRISK has been applied for estimating radiation risks in these occupational radiation exposures. This software is based on transport models from epidemiological studies of population exposed to external sources of ionizing radiation, such as Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bomb survivors [UNSCEAR, Sources and effects of ionizing radiation: 2006 report to the general assembly, with scientific annexes. New York: United Nations; 2006]. The minimum and maximum average excess ratio for skin cancer has been, using wrist physical doses, of [1.03x10(-3), 5.06x10(-2)], concluding that there is not an increased risk of skin cancer incidence. The minimum and maximum average excess ratio for leukemia has been, using TLD physical doses, of [7.84x10(-2), 3.36x10(-1)], and using biological doses, of [1.40x10(-1), 1.51], which is considerably higher than incidence rates, showing an excess radio-induced risk of leukemia in the group under study. Finally, the maximum radiological detriment in the group, evaluated as the total number of radio-induced cancers using physical dosimetry, has been of 2.18/1000 person-year (skin and leukemia), and using biological dosimetry of 9.20/1000 PY (leukemia). As a conclusion, this study has provided an assessment of the non-deterministic effects (rate of radio-induced cancer incidence) attributable to the group under study due to their professional activity.","['Ramos, M', 'Montoro, A', 'Almonacid, M', 'Ferrer, S', 'Barquinero, J F', 'Tortosa, R', 'Verdu, G', 'Rodriguez, P', 'Barrios, L L', 'Villaescusa, J I']","['Ramos M', 'Montoro A', 'Almonacid M', 'Ferrer S', 'Barquinero JF', 'Tortosa R', 'Verdu G', 'Rodriguez P', 'Barrios LL', 'Villaescusa JI']","['Department of Chemical and Nuclear Engineering, Polytechnic University of Valencia, 46022 Valencia, Spain.

The patients were diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, respectively, and both underwent nonmyeloablative conditioning with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine followed by PBSCT from their HLA-matched opposite-sex siblings. Post-transplant bone marrow cytogenetics showed full engraftment, and the early post-transplant studies demonstrated only normal donor metaphases. Subsequent studies of both patients, however, revealed a population of metaphase cells with abnormal, but apparently balanced, donor karyotypes. Chromosome studies performed on peripheral blood cells collected from both donors after transplantation were normal. Both patients remained in clinical remission during follow-up of approximately 8 years in one case, and 6 years in the other case, despite the persistence of the abnormal clones. Chromosomal abnormalities in residual recipient cells after bone marrow or PBSCT are not unusual. In contrast, only rare reports of chromosome abnormalities in donor cells exist, all of which have been associated with post-bone marrow transplant myelodysplastic syndrome or acute leukemias.

Panhandle polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using cDNA demonstrated the formation of an MLL-MLLT10 fusion transcript, although the 10p12 segment, at which the MLLT10 gene is located, was not involved in the breakpoint of the four-way translocation according to G-banding and spectral karyotyping analyses. Long-distance inverse PCR using genomic DNA revealed that intron 7 of MLL was fused with intron 8 of MLLT10, which was connected with a DNA segment of noncoding region on 15q.

Here we present the case of a 60-year-old man with radiation-associated MDS (r-MDS) carrying chromosome abnormalities, including t(8;11)(p11;p15) and del(1)(p22p32). Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis demonstrated that the NUP98 gene at 11p15 was split by the translocation. Southern blot analysis of bone marrow cells showed both rearrangements of NUP98 and NSD3 genes. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) followed by sequence analysis revealed the presence of both NUP98-NSD3 and NSD3-NUP98 fusion transcripts. Expression analysis by RT-PCR showed that NSD3 as well as NSD1 and NSD2 was ubiquitously expressed in leukemic cell lines and Epstein-Barr virus transformed B lymphocyte cell lines derived from the normal adult lymphocytes examined. Two isoforms of NSD3, NSD3S and NSD3L (but not NSD3L2), were expressed in leukemic cell lines and were fused to NUP98 in our patient, suggesting that qualitative change of these two isoforms of NSD3 by fusion with NUP98 might be related to leukemogenesis, although the function of each isoform of the NSD3 gene remains unclear.","['Taketani, Takeshi', 'Taki, Tomohiko', 'Nakamura, Hideo', 'Taniwaki, Masafumi', 'Masuda, Junichi', 'Hayashi, Yasuhide']","['Taketani T', 'Taki T', 'Nakamura H', 'Taniwaki M', 'Masuda J', 'Hayashi Y']","['Division of Blood Transfusion, Shimane University Hospital, Izumo, Shimane, Japan.']",,['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,IM,"['Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*genetics', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2009/04/22 09:00,2009/06/26 09:00,['2009/04/22 09:00'],"['2008/09/09 00:00 [received]', '2008/11/27 00:00 [revised]', '2008/12/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/04/22 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/26 09:00 [medline]']","['S0165-4608(09)00002-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2008.12.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2009 Apr 15;190(2):108-12. doi: 10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2008.12.008.,"['0 (NUP98-NSD3 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Nup98 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (NSD3 protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The MS-PCR technique was used to detect the methylation status of Id4 gene in different ratios of leukemia cells. The results indicated that the methylation specific amplification of Id4 gene with 155 bp was observed in HL-60 cells showing complete methylation of Id4 gene; while the unmethylation specific amplication of Id4 gene with 156 bp was found in Hek937 cells, showing complete unmethylation. The methylation specific amplification of Id4 gene with 155 bp and unmethylation specific amplification of Id4 gene with 156 bp were simultaneously detected in A, B and C groups, which showed the expression of Id4 gene methylation. In conclusion, the MS-PCR technique can detect the Id4 gene methylation in leukemia cell sample containing 0.1% of HL-60 cells, moreover the Id4 gene methylation in various leukemia cells shows no significant difference, thereby use of MS-PCR to detect the Id4 methylation level may be a potential approach for monitoring of MRD.

B7.1 gene was subcloned from the cloning vector using PCR. The PCR products and eukaryotic expressing vector (pHook) both were separately digested with ApaI, SalI and were ligated using T4 DNA ligase. The ligases products were transduced into DH-5alpha. B7.1 gene containing clones was selected by digestion with ApaI and SalI, and were further confirmed by sequencing of DNA. HL-60 cells were transfected with B7.1 by using lipofectamine and detected by immunofluorescence, SABC and FACS methods. The results showed that the size of PCR products was about 620 bp. Five clones were ampicillin-resistant and all could be digested by ApaI and SalI to produce 620 bp gene fragment that had the same size of B7.1, which means that the B7.1 recombinant vector has been constructed successfully. Further sequencing confirmed the validity of the construction. No nucleotide mutation was found, B7.1 effectively expressed on HL-60 cells with 70%, 65% and 92.7% by immunofluorescence, SABC and FACS respectively. It is concluded that the human B7.1 (CD80) eukaryotic expressing vector can be successfully constructed by molecular cloned methods and can stably effectively express on the membrane of B7.1-negative acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) cell line HL-60. It is inferred that the vaccine prepared by using this method may have immunotherapeutic and immuno-protective effects.","['Ma, Xiao-Rong', 'Zhang, Wang-Gang', 'Tian, Wei', 'Chen, Yin-Xia', 'Liu, Jie']","['Ma XR', 'Zhang WG', 'Tian W', 'Chen YX', 'Liu J']","[""Hematology Department, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Medical College, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, 710004, China.""]",,['chi'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,IM,"['B7-1 Antigen/*genetics', 'Cloning, Molecular', '*Genetic Vectors', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*genetics', 'Transfection']",2009/04/22 09:00,2011/07/13 06:00,['2009/04/22 09:00'],"['2009/04/22 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/13 06:00 [medline]']",['1009-2137(2009)02-0450-05 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2009 Apr;17(2):450-4.,"['0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The expression of Ahi-1 mRNA and protein were measured by Northern and Western blot respectively. The plasmid containing prototype Ahi-1 was constructed and transfected into Jurkat cells. The Jurkat-A and Jurkat-C cells which either over-expressed the prototype Ahi-1 or not were obtained by selection with G418. The proliferation of the cells was assayed by XTT. The colony formation potential of the leukemia cells was checked by semisolid agarose culture. The results showed that three different transcripts of Ahi-1 (6.5,4.2 and 2 kb) were expressed in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs), Jurkat and HUT78 cells. Ahi-1 protein with 140 kD localized in the cytoplasm majorly while traceless in the nucleus of Jurkat cells and PBLs from normal donor. Ahi-1 protein with 120 kD could be detected in the nucleus fraction of PBLs. Very low level of Ahi-1 protein with 120 kD was expressed in Jurkat cells. Up-regulating expression of Ahi-1 protein with 140 kD in the nucleus was found in Jurkat cells after exposure to meisoindigo, cytarabine, homoharringtonine, methotrexate and etoposide, down-regulating expression of Ahi-1 with 140 kD in the cytoplasm was observed after treatment with meisoindigo. The growth and colony formation potential were inhibited in the Jurkat-A cells, as compared to Jurkat-C cells. Total c-myb and phosphorylated AKT protein were continuously expressed in the Jurkat-C and Jurkat-A cells at similar level, but more phosphorylated c-myb was observed in Jurkat-A cells. It is concluded that three different transcripts of Ahi-1 at 6.5, 4.2 and 2 kb are detected in Jurkat cells; the Ahi-1 protein with 140 kD majorly expresses in the cytoplasm fraction and exposure to multiple chemotherapeutic compounds increased its expression in nucleus fraction.

Flow cytometry was used to determine the number of DCs and cell surface antigens before and after culture with monoclonal antibodies including CD83, CD1a, CD11c and CDw123. HL-60 and K562 were frozen-thawed, and released their tumor antigen peptides (TAP). The CTLs were produced by sensitizing T lymphocytes with DC-loaded HL-60 and K562 cell antigens. The test of (3)H-TdR incorporation was used to detect the immunostimulation activity of DCs. MTT assay was applied to evaluate specific cytotoxicity of CTL on leukaemia cells. The results indicated that the MNCs of UCBs cultured with GM-CSF, IL-3, EPO and SCF were shown to differentiate into CD1a(+) CD11c(+) CD83(+) CDw123(+) DCs. Numbers of DCs from UCBs remarkably increased in 2 - 4 weeks and then decreased. After culture with cytokines DCs increased (10.6 - 28.2) x 10(5)/ml in actual numbers. The CTL induced by DC pulsed with HL-60, K562 frozen-thawed lysates were effective to kill HL-60 and K562. Cytotoxicity of CTL to HL60 and K562 were (42.04 +/- 8.46)% and (31.25 +/- 11.07)% respectively. It is concluded that the MNCs of UCBs cultured with cytokines of GM-CSF, SCF, EPO and IL-3 can differentiate into CD1a(+), CD83(+), CD11c(+) and CDw123(+) DCs. The CTL induced by DCs pulsed with HL-60, K562 frozen-thawed lysates can effectively kill HL-60 and K562.

Genescan technique was applied to evaluate clonal expression of the TCRVbeta subfamilies, clonal characteristics of the CDR3 from peripheral blood of AML patients at different disease status. The application, clonal proliferation, cellular complexity of T-cells, and the variation of immunotypes of T-cells were compared. The results indicated that the lower and partial distribution of TCR Vbeta subfamily was found in all 11 patients when firstly diagnosed; the expression of TCR Vbeta subfamilies after induction in vitro increased; obvious elevation of TCR Vbeta subfamilies was observed in patients at complete remission although expression level was still lower than normal, whereas the significant descent of TCR Vbeta subfamilies was detected in 4 relapsed patients. Only 1 - 2 clonal proliferation of TCR Vbeta subfamilies existed in 9 out of 11 patients at initial diagnosis which increased at remission.

The reconstitution of NK cells and their surface receptors as well as the the recovery of T and B cells within 90 days after clinical engraftment following UCBT were measured and analysed by flow cytometry. The results indicated that the recovery of NK cells appears to be relatively early. CD3(-)56(+) NK cell count was (35.12 +/- 18.66)% of peripheral blood (PB) lymphocytes on the day of clinical engraftment and higher than that in normal. The peak of the NK cells reached to (37.8 +/- 17.52)% of lymphocyte at 30 days after clinical engraftment. NK count was (30.4 +/- 19.14)% at 60 days after clinical engraftment when the absolute NK cell count reached to the peak (up to 544 cells/microl) in PB. The activated receptor NKG2D was reconstituted fast and high expressed [(79.58 +/- 8.71)%] at the time of clinical engraftment with a tendency of gradual elevation, which reached to peak value (82.55 +/- 9.10)% at day 60. Another activated receptor NKp46 also reconstituted fast, and maintained at a high level even at 90 days after clinical engraftment. The expression of NKG2A was lower than that of the activated receptor of NK cells, which tendency lasted for at least 90 days after clinical engraftment. The reconstitution of T cells in PB after UCBT was relatively slow with lower expression rate. It is concluded that the reconstitution of NK cells in patients with acute leukemia is earlier following UCBT.

The mice were randomly divided into group A receiving normal saline, group B receiving DNR, group C receiving Fe(3)O(4)-magnetic nanoparticle, group D receiving Fe(3)O(4)-magnetic nanoparticle loaded with DNR and group E receiving Fe(3)O(4)-magnetic nanoparticle containing DNR with a magnetic field built on the surface of the tumor tissue.

The experiment was divided into 3 groups: control group, in which K562 cells were cultured in medium without 2-ME; the experimental group, in which K562 cells were cultured in medium containing different concentrations of 2-ME (1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 micromol/L) for 36 hours; the negative control group, in which K562 cells were replaced by distilled water without RNase in medium. The apoptosis rate, the protein and its mRNA expressions of caspase-3 and survivin of K562 cells was detected by TUNEL, flow cytometry (FCM), half-quantitative RT-PCR respectively. The results showed that the apoptosis rate of K562 cells in experimental group was significantly higher than that in control group (p < 0.05). The apoptosis rate of K562 cells detected by FCM was almost the same as that detected by TUNEL method (p < 0.01). The result detected by TUNEL methods was positively correlated with that detected by FCM (gamma = 0.845, p = 0.034). The expression of caspase-3 protein increased in a concentration-dependent manner, and also this expression level in the experimental group was higher than that in the control group (p < 0.05); the expression of survivin protein decreased along with the increasing of 2-ME concentration. and the difference between the experimental group and the control group was statistically significant (p < 0.05). The expression of caspase-3 mRNA was higher in the experimental group than that in the control group (p < 0.01), and the expression of survivin mRNA was lower in the experimental group than that in the control group (p < 0.01). The expression level of caspase-3 mRNA was negatively correlated with that of survivin (gamma = -0.966, p = 0.001).

Comparison between AML CD34(+)CD38(+) cells and AML MNC showed that the expression level of irf-1 and dapk were decreased dramatically (p < 0.05) while the rest 3 genes increased their expression with statistical significance (p < 0.05). The expression levels of these 5 genes were higher in CD34(+)CD38(-) cells than those in CD34(+)CD38(+) stem cells, and the increase of kdr and irf-1 expressions showed statistical difference (p < 0.05). These 5 genes expression levels were all higher than those in CD34(+)CD38(+) cells whether in AML CD34(+)CD38(-)CD7(+) cells or CD34(+)CD38(-)CD7(-) cells. The increase of kdr expression in CD34(+)CD38(-)CD7(+) cells as well as kdr and irf-1 expressions in CD34(+)CD38(-)CD7(-) cells were all of statistical significance (p < 0.05). In conclusion the expression level of kdr in NBM was highest in stem cells while dapk and irf-1 were highest in differentiated cells. The expression levels of these 5 genes in CD34(+)CD38(-)Lin(-) stem cells were higher than those in CD34(+)CD38(+) progenitor cells. The gene expressions in AML CD34(+)CD38(-)CD7(+) cells and CD34(+)CD38(-)CD7(-) cells are in accordance with the characteristics of stem cells.","['Wu, Hong-Hong', 'Cao, Hui', 'Wang, Ya-Zhe', 'Wang, Dong-Xia', 'Lin, Hai-Rong', 'Qin, Ya-Zhen', 'Chang, Yan', 'Hao, Le', 'Li, Ling-Di', 'Li, Jin-Lan', 'Ruan, Guo-Rui', 'Huang, Xiao-Jun', 'Liu, Yan-Rong']","['Wu HH', 'Cao H', 'Wang YZ', 'Wang DX', 'Lin HR', 'Qin YZ', 'Chang Y', 'Hao L', 'Li LD', 'Li JL', 'Ruan GR', 'Huang XJ', 'Liu YR']","['Iustitute of Hematology, People Hospital, Peking University, Beijing 100044, China.']",,['chi'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD7/immunology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*chemistry/immunology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/chemistry/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Stem Cells/*chemistry/immunology', 'Young Adult']",2009/04/22 09:00,2011/07/13 06:00,['2009/04/22 09:00'],"['2009/04/22 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/13 06:00 [medline]']",['1009-2137(2009)02-0298-06 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2009 Apr;17(2):298-303.,"['0 (Antigens, CD7)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The expressions of Na(+), K(+)-ATPase alpha1 subunit of leukemia cells were evaluated by RT-PCR and Western blot. The results showed that low concentration of ouabain (10 nmol/L) could increase the survival rates of lymphocytic leukemia Jhhan cell line and megakaryocytic leukemia M07e cell line, and could up-regulate the expression of Na(+), K(+)-ATPase alpha1 subunit.

The results of immunophenotyping demonstrated that the positive percentages of CD123, CD33 and CD9 in newly diagnosed APL patients were 100%, 99.1% and 96.0% respectively, and mean percentages of positive cells in positive patients were all around 90%. Although the positive rates of CD117, CD13, CD38 and CD64 were all above 96%, but the mean percentages of positive cells in different positive patients were diverse and average percentages of positive cells were about 70%.

It has been demon- started that over-expression of Bmi-1 occurs in a variety of cancers, including several types of leukemia. Bmi-1 gene plays a key role in regulation of self-renewal in normal and leukemic stem cells. Acute myeloid leukemic cells lacking Bmi-1 undergo proliferation arrest and show signs of differentiation and apoptosis, which leads to the proposal of Bmi-1 as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in leukemia. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting Bmi-1 on functions of K562 cell line. The shRNA eukaryotic expression vector targeting Bmi-1 was constructed and transfected into K562 cells through lipofectamine 2000. The mRNA and protein levels of Bmi-1 were detected by PCR and Western blot respectively. The proliferation of K562 after Bmi-1 silencing was measured by using MTT assay and clone formation assay. The cell cycle was detected by flow cytometry. The results indicated that among the four shRNA designed, there was a shRNA which efficiently interfered with the expression of Bmi-1. The results of PCR and Western blot validated that the Bmi-1 gene of K562 cells transfected with such a Bmi-1 shRNA was suppressed successfully. Although levels of Bmi-1 mRNA and protein were significantly reduced, delivery of this siRNAs had no effect on cell viability or growth. Flow cytometry analysis suggested that Bmi-1 inhibition did not affect the cell cycle. It is concluded that the suppression of Bmi-1 expression is not able to reduce proliferation of K562 cells, suggesting existence of some other parallel signaling pathways, which are fundamental for leukemic transformation and are independent of Bmi-1 over-expression. Bmi-1 over-expression may play a secondary role in chronic myeloid leukemia transformation.","['Chen, Xiao-Li', 'Ren, Qian', 'Chen, Zhen-Ping', 'Zhou, Ze-Ping', 'Zhao, Qin-Jun', 'Qiu, Zhi-Yong', 'Dong, Chun-Lan', 'Han, Zhong-Chao']","['Chen XL', 'Ren Q', 'Chen ZP', 'Zhou ZP', 'Zhao QJ', 'Qiu ZY', 'Dong CL', 'Han ZC']","['Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Tianjin 300020, China.']",,['chi'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,IM,"['Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', '*RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', 'Transfection']",2009/04/22 09:00,2011/07/13 06:00,['2009/04/22 09:00'],"['2009/04/22 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/13 06:00 [medline]']",['1009-2137(2009)02-0266-05 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2009 Apr;17(2):266-70.,"['0 (BMI1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Veterinary oncologists may not consider the possibility that the use of glucocorticoids may adversely affect response to chemotherapy. There is evidence that glucocorticoids can up-regulate the expression of multidrug resistance genes in some tissues. Whether or not glucocorticoid-induced expression of multidrug resistance proteins occurs in tumour cells is not presently known. The purpose of this study was to determine if dexamethasone induces P-glycoprotein (P-gp) or multidrug resistance-related protein 1 (MRP1) in tumour cell lines. A canine osteosarcoma cell line (OS2.4) and a human myeloid leukaemia cell line 60 (HL60) were treated in culture with dexamethasone. The presence of a glucocorticoid receptor was confirmed in both cell lines by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Western blots for P-gp and MRP1 expression were performed on vehicle-treated and dexamethasone-treated cells.

Cohort 2003-2007].",459-69,,"INTRODUCTION: Despite therapeutic advances, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in adults remains a disease with poor long term outcome and survival rates. Developing countries lack of information about this disease. On the other hand, infections are frequent complications related to mortality and some research studies do not show accurate rates of septic shock or other related factors. OBJECTIVE: To describe characteristics of adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, response to treatment, complications and to evaluate further survival related factors and to compare our experience with other reports of literature. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between September 2003 to November 2007, the entire cohort of patients with diagnosis of ALL was included. The treatment regimens used were MDACC HyperCVAD (HCVAD) and 0195 (institutional regimen). RESULTS: Of 40 patients included with the diagnosis of ALL, 92% was B phenotype and 8%, T phenotype, with a median age of 27 years. The median follow up was 28.5 months. Initially, 14% showed central nervous system infiltration; of 51% with available cytogenetics, 16.7% was Philadelphia chromosome positive. There were 36 patients who received treatment: 13 received HCVAD and 23 the 0195 protocol; 78% achieved global complete remission, 85% for the patients with HCVAD and 74% with 0195. The induction death rate was 2.8%. The median disease-free survival was 11.6 months (IC 95%, 2.5-20.8 months) and overall survival was 15 months (IC 95%, 10.6-19.4 months). In 95% of patients, no prophylactic antibiotic therapy was used and treatment related death was 8.4% (2.8% during induction and 5.6% during the rest of treatment). Factors associated with worse survival rate were hyperleukocytosis, T phenotype and lack of early complete remission. During induction, grade 3 to 4 non hematopoietic toxicity was 17%. Incidence of neutropenic febrile episodes was 61% and septic shock was 11%. CONCLUSIONS: With HCVAD, we observed worse complete remission, disease-free survival and overall survival rates compared with the original MDACC reports. Chemotherapy related death rates are similar to other early reports, despite prophylactic antibiotic was not used during myelosuppression.","['Arteaga-Ortiz, Luis', 'Buitron-Santiago, Natalie', 'Rosas-Lopez, Adriana', 'Rosas-Arzate, Guadalupe', 'Armengolt-Jimenez, Alicia', 'Aguayo, Alvaro', 'Lopez-Karpovitch, Xavier', 'Crespo-Solis, Erick']","['Arteaga-Ortiz L', 'Buitron-Santiago N', 'Rosas-Lopez A', 'Rosas-Arzate G', 'Armengolt-Jimenez A', 'Aguayo A', 'Lopez-Karpovitch X', 'Crespo-Solis E']","['Clinica de Leucemia Aguda, Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran.']",,['spa'],,['Journal Article'],,Mexico,Rev Invest Clin,Revista de investigacion clinica; organo del Hospital de Enfermedades de la Nutricion,9421552,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibiotic Prophylaxis/statistics & numerical data', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Mexico/epidemiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Platelet Transfusion', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Urban Population', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Young Adult']",2009/04/22 09:00,2009/05/15 09:00,['2009/04/22 09:00'],"['2009/04/22 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/15 09:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Rev Invest Clin. 2008 Nov-Dec;60(6):459-69.,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'CVAD protocol']",,,,,,,,,,,Experiencia del INCMNSZ en pacientes adultos con leucemia linfoide aguda.

Nevertheless, resistance to imatinib emerges as CML progresses to an acute deadly phase implying that physiopathologically relevant cellular targets should be validated to develop alternative therapeutic strategies. The NF-kappaB transcription factor that exerts pro-survival actions is found abnormally active in numerous hematologic malignancies. In the present study, using Bcr-Abl-transfected BaF murine cells, LAMA84 human CML cell line and primary CML, we show that NF-kappaB is active downstream of Bcr-Abl. Pharmacological blockade of NF-kappaB by the IKK2 inhibitor AS602868 prevented survival of BaF cells expressing either wild-type, M351T or T315I imatinib-resistant mutant forms of Bcr-Abl both in vitro and in vivo using a mouse xenograft model. AS602868 also affected the survival of LAMA84 cells and of an imatinib-resistant variant. Importantly, the IKK2 inhibitor strongly decreased in vitro survival and ability to form hematopoietic colonies of primary imatinib resistant CML cells including T315I cells. Our data strongly support the targeting of NF-kappaB as a promising new therapeutic opportunity for the treatment of imatinib resistant CML patients in particular in the case of T315I patients. The T315I mutation escapes all currently used Bcr-Abl inhibitors and is likely to become a major clinical problem as it is associated with a poor clinical outcome.","['Lounnas, Nadia', 'Frelin, Catherine', 'Gonthier, Nadege', 'Colosetti, Pascal', 'Sirvent, Anne', 'Cassuto, Jil-Patrice', 'Berthier, Frederic', 'Sirvent, Nicolas', 'Rousselot, Philippe', 'Dreano, Michel', 'Peyron, Jean-Francois', 'Imbert, Veronique']","['Lounnas N', 'Frelin C', 'Gonthier N', 'Colosetti P', 'Sirvent A', 'Cassuto JP', 'Berthier F', 'Sirvent N', 'Rousselot P', 'Dreano M', 'Peyron JF', 'Imbert V']","['INSERM U895/ C3M: Centre Mediterraneen de Medecine Moleculaire, Nice, France.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Genes, abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', '*Mutation', 'NF-kappa B/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology']",2009/04/21 09:00,2009/06/20 09:00,['2009/04/21 09:00'],"['2009/04/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/20 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.24294 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2009 Jul 15;125(2):308-17. doi: 10.1002/ijc.24294.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",,,,,,,['Copyright 2009 UICC.'],,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to report the experience of our department in the management of these aggressive lesions, as they require special diagnostic and therapeutic attention. METHODS: The case records of 3 patients with the diagnosis of lymphoma involving the larynx were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: The histopathological diagnosis revealed 1 case of marginal zone lymphoma mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue type, 1 case of T-lymphoblastic lymphoma, and 1 case of a rare coexistence of in situ squamous cell carcinoma with an isolated intravascular (angioimmunoblastic) lymphoma of peripheral T-cell origin. Details of the presentation, diagnostic procedures, treatment, and outcome of these patients were presented. CONCLUSIONS: Primary laryngeal lymphoma is a rare entity. Early symptoms are subtle and nonspecific, and confirmation of the diagnosis is often difficult. Because of the rarity of this tumor type, the optimal management remains controversial and it seems that should be managed not as a distinct disease entity but as an unusual presentation of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, according to the recent treatment trends.","['Markou, Konstantinos', 'Goudakos, John', 'Constantinidis, John', 'Kostopoulos, Ioannis', 'Vital, Victor', 'Nikolaou, Angelos']","['Markou K', 'Goudakos J', 'Constantinidis J', 'Kostopoulos I', 'Vital V', 'Nikolaou A']","['Department of Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, ENT Department, AHEPA University Hospital, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece.']",,['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Head Neck,Head & neck,8902541,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biopsy, Needle', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Laryngeal Neoplasms/diagnosis/*pathology/therapy', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/diagnosis/*pathology/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/diagnosis/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*pathology/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Radiotherapy, High-Energy/methods', 'Risk Assessment', 'Tracheotomy/methods']",2009/04/21 09:00,2010/06/17 06:00,['2009/04/21 09:00'],"['2009/04/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/hed.21104 [doi]'],ppublish,Head Neck. 2010 Apr;32(4):541-9. doi: 10.1002/hed.21104.,,,,50,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are reports indicating that Notch and Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF) signaling are involved in cell determination of NSC, either preventing differentiation or promoting astrocytic fate. In this work, we aimed to compare the astrocytogenic effect of activated Notch with that induced by LIF. To this end, rat cerebral cortex neural progenitors/NSC were transduced with retroviral vectors in order to express green fluorescent protein (GFP), or a fusion protein of GFP with the active Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD). In parallel, other cultures were treated with increasing concentrations of LIF. We confirmed, in proliferating NSC, that LIF activated intracellular effectors by measuring STAT3 phosphorylation and Socs3 transcription. In NICD-expressing cells, Hes5 mRNA was induced, an effect not present in GFP-transduced NSC. We quantified the proportion of cells expressing Nestin in the presence of Fibroblast Growth Factor-2 (FGF-2) with LIF or NICD treatments. LIF significantly increased the proportion of cells co-expresssing Nestin and Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP), an effect absent in cells with activated Notch. After FGF2 withdrawal to promote differentiation, Nestin was markedly down-regulated, and neuronal and glial markers appeared in control cultures.

The impact of targeted therapies on our dose selection strategies has been immense; however, defining the MTD in phase I oncology trials still provides valuable information for future drug development. But, the MTD should not be selected blindly as the recommended phase II dose for efficacy testing.

The adenoviral transduction of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines Kasumi-1 and HL-60 was increased by sCAR-PPA, indicating that a fraction of AML cells exposing mannose residues was detected by PPA. However, sCAR-PPA did not increase the adenoviral infection of KG-1 cells, suggesting the mannose exposure of AML cells may be cell type specific. Furthermore, the infectious efficiency of Ad-EGFP in chronic myeloid leukemia cell line K562 was significantly increased by sCAR-PPA as well. We, herein, report that PPA recognized a fraction of myeloid leukemia cells showing mannose-exposing phenotype.

It plays an important role in negatively regulating the proliferation of hematopoietic cells. The relationship between SHIP and the inhibition of tumor proliferation is rarely reported. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the apoptosis induced by SHIP gene in K562 cell line and to explore the involved signaling pathway. The K562 cells were transfected with human SHIP gene by using the lentiviral vector containing SHIP, and the transfection was verified by fluorescent quantitative PCR (FQ-PCR) and Western blot. Then the effects of SHIP protein expression on cell growth and apoptosis were measured. The levels of p-Akt, bcl-2 family, caspase and the activity of NFkappaB were assayed by Western blot and ELISA, respectively. The results are as follows: (1) Human leukemia cell line K562 was SHIP-negative; (2) Transfection with SHIP gene led to the re-expression of SHIP mRNA and protein in K562, as shown by FQ-PCR and Western blot; (3) The expression of SHIP protein inhibited cell growth and significantly increased apoptosis in K562 cells; (4) Compared to that in control group, the expression level of p-Akt-308 and p-Akt-473 in SHIP-expressing cell group decreased significantly (P<0.01); SHIP activated caspase-9, caspase-3, up-regulated protein levels of bad, p27, down-regulated expression of bcl-xL, while it had no effect on the expression of bcl-2 and bax. Furthermore, the inhibition of NF-kappaB was achieved along with the inactivation of Akt. These data suggest that SHIP gene has potential abilities to inhibit K562 leukemic cell proliferation and induce its apoptosis via inactivating PI3K/Akt pathway. The loss of SHIP might be the explanation of aberrant high-level p-Akt in human leukemia. It may be at least one of the mechanisms by which the loss of SHIP expression contributes to leukemia progression.","['Yang, Lin', 'Luo, Jian-Min', 'Liu, Xiao-Jun', 'Wen, Shu-Peng', 'Du, Xing-Yan', 'Yao, Li', 'Yang, Jing-Ci']","['Yang L', 'Luo JM', 'Liu XJ', 'Wen SP', 'Du XY', 'Yao L', 'Yang JC']","['Department of Hematology, the Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China.']",,['chi'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Sheng Li Xue Bao,Sheng li xue bao : [Acta physiologica Sinica],20730130R,IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Down-Regulation', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Inositol Polyphosphate 5-Phosphatases', 'K562 Cells', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Transfection']",2009/04/21 09:00,2015/05/20 06:00,['2009/04/21 09:00'],"['2009/04/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/20 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Sheng Li Xue Bao. 2009 Apr 25;61(2):146-54.,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.3.56 (Inositol Polyphosphate 5-Phosphatases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is responsible for 15% to 40% of mortality and is the major cause of morbidity after transplantation. Therefore, separation of GVHD and GVL partially or completely could improve the transplant outcomes. This study focuses on the effects of G-CSF on T cells in peripheral blood stem cell grafts and bone marrow grafts and its mechanisms after in vivo G-CSF application. The separation of GVHD and GVL effect and the mechanisms of which after in vivo G-CSF and interleukin-11 (IL-11) treatment of healthy donors were investigated. The main contributions of this research are listed as follows: (1) Immune tolerance of T cells was induced simultaneously in peripheral blood stem cell grafts and bone marrow grafts after in vivo G-CSF application; (2) T cell hyporesponsiveness and polarization of T cells from Th1 to Th2 were maintained after mixture of G-CSF-mobilized peripheral blood grafts (G-PB) and G-CSF-primed bone marrow grafts (G-BM) according to different proportions in vitro; (3) Treating donor with G-CSF and IL-11 decreased GVHD and retained GVL effect; (4) The incidence of acute GVHD was decreased after Allo-HSCT using G-PB and G-BM as allografts; (5) In combination with other techniques, the HLA barriers were overcomed using G-PB and G-BM as allografts; (6) The incidences of acute GVHD were significantly decreased and the GVL effects were retained or enhanced in relapsed patients after treatment by G-CSF-mobilized peripheral blood graft infusion compared with those received steady-state peripheral blood lymphocyte infusion, indicating that GVHD and GVL could be partially separated in clinical settings. Based on our results, we would conclude that the issues on the deficiency of donors are resolved, and novel strategies offered for the prophylaxis and treatment of patients with hematological malignancies who relapse after Allo-HSCT.

Forty-one haploidentical allogeneic hematopoietic SCT patients were analyzed according to the NK cell concentration in relation to acute GVHD (aGVHD), chronic GVHD (cGVHD), TRM and leukemia-free survival. The patients receiving a higher dose of CD56(bright) NK cells (>1.9 x 10(6)/kg) showed a higher incidence of grades II-IV aGVHD (hazard risk (HR), 2.872; P=0.022) and cGVHD (HR, 2.884; P=0.039). A higher CD56(dim)/CD56(bri) NK cell ratio (>8.0) was correlated with a decreased risk of III-IV aGVHD (HR, 0.290; P=0.065) and TRM (HR, 0.072; P=0.012), thereby increasing the rate of leukemia-free survival (HR, 0.174; P=0.007) after haploidentical transplantation without in vitro T-cell depletion.

A higher dose of CD56(bright) NK cells might be a predictor for a higher incidence of GVHD.","['Zhao, X-Y', 'Chang, Y-J', 'Xu, L-P', 'Liu, D-H', 'Liu, K-Y', 'Huang, X-J']","['Zhao XY', 'Chang YJ', 'Xu LP', 'Liu DH', 'Liu KY', 'Huang XJ']","[""Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, no. 11 Xizhimen South Street, Beijing, China.""]",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090420,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects', 'CD56 Antigen/immunology', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'HLA Antigens/immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization/*methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/cytology/*immunology/*transplantation', 'Male', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/04/21 09:00,2010/05/14 06:00,['2009/04/21 09:00'],"['2009/04/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/14 06:00 [medline]']","['bmt200973 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2009.73 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2009 Dec;44(11):721-8. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2009.73.

Modeling the expression dynamics in terms of predicted cis-regulatory sites, we identified the key transcription regulators, their time-dependent activities and target genes. Systematic siRNA knockdown of 52 transcription factors confirmed the roles of individual factors in the regulatory network. Our results indicate that cellular states are constrained by complex networks involving both positive and negative regulatory interactions among substantial numbers of transcription factors and that no single transcription factor is both necessary and sufficient to drive the differentiation process.","['Suzuki, Harukazu', 'Forrest, Alistair R R', 'van Nimwegen, Erik', 'Daub, Carsten O',

DESIGN AND METHODS: In an attempt to unveil unfavorable cellular properties linked to high ZAP70 expression, we used gene expression profiling to identify genes associated with disparities in B cells from chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients expressing high versus low ZAP70 mRNA, measured by quantitative real-time PCR. Two groups of 7 patients were compared, selected on the basis of either high or low ZAP70 mRNA expression. RESULTS: Twenty-seven genes were differentially expressed with an FDR<10%, and several genes were significant predictors of treatment-free survival (TFS) and/or overall survival; PDE8A and FCRL family genes (down-regulated in ZAP70(+) patients) could predict TFS and overall survival; ITGA4 mRNA (up-regulated in ZAP70(+) patients) could significantly predict overall survival. Importantly, gene set enrichment analysis revealed overrepresentation of adhesion/migration genes. We therefore investigated in vitro adhesion/migration capacity of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells into a stromal microenvironment or in response to conditioned medium. We showed that ZAP70(+) cells had better adhesion/migration capacities and only ZAP70(+) patient cells responded to microenvironment contact by CXCR4 downregulation. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that several prognostic factors are the reflection of microenvironment interactions and that the increased adhesion/migratory capacity of ZAP70(+) cells in their microenvironment can explain their better survival and thus the aggressiveness of the disease.","['Stamatopoulos, Basile', 'Haibe-Kains, Benjamin', 'Equeter, Carole', 'Meuleman, Nathalie', 'Soree, Anne', 'De Bruyn, Cecile', 'Hanosset, Delphine', 'Bron, Dominique', 'Martiat, Philippe', 'Lagneaux, Laurence']","['Stamatopoulos B', 'Haibe-Kains B', 'Equeter C', 'Meuleman N', 'Soree A', 'De Bruyn C', 'Hanosset D', 'Bron D', 'Martiat P', 'Lagneaux L']","[""Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Institut Jules Bordet, Laboratoire d'Hematologie Experimentale, Bruxelles, Belgium. bstamato@ulb.ac.be""]",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090418,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Aged', 'Antigens, CD/genetics/metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/genetics/metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Movement', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Lectins, C-Type', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, CXCR4/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Stromal Cells/pathology', 'Survival Analysis', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/*genetics/metabolism']",2009/04/21 09:00,2009/09/26 06:00,['2009/04/21 09:00'],"['2009/04/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/26 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2008.002626 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2008.002626 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2009 Jun;94(6):790-9. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2008.002626.

However, 20-25% of patients do not achieve durable complete cytogenetic responses. The mechanism underlying this primary resistance is unknown, but variations in BCR-ABL1 kinase activity may play a role and can be investigated by measuring the autophosphorylation levels of BCR-ABL1 or of a surrogate target such as Crkl. In this study we used flow cytometry to investigate the in vitro inhibition of Crkl phosphorylation by imatinib in CD34(+) cells in diagnostic samples from two groups of patients distinguished by their cytogenetic response. No difference in inhibition of Crkl phosphorylation was observed in the two groups.

We investigated whether molecular remissions could be attained after reduced intensity conditioning and allogeneic stem cell transplantation in patients with relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia and whether the assessment of minimal residual disease might be used to predict the clinical outcome. DESIGN AND METHODS: Minimal residual disease was monitored by polymerase chain reaction using the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene rearrangement as a molecular marker in 29 relapsed patients who achieved complete remission following reduced intensity conditioning and allogeneic stem cell transplantation. A nested-polymerase chain reaction with patient-specific primers derived from complementarity determining regions (CDR2 and CDR3) was carried out in all the patients. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed in patients whose nested reaction gave positive or mixed results. RESULTS: Three patterns of minimal residual disease were observed: negative (31%), mixed (24%), and always positive (45%). The cumulative incidence of relapse according to the minimal residual disease status at 6 and 12 months after transplantation was significantly different between polymerase chain reaction-negative and -positive patients (p=0.031 and p=0.04, respectively). Two-year disease-free survival was 93% and 46% for polymerase chain reaction-negative and -positive patients at 6 months after transplantation, respectively (p=0.012). Similarly, 2-year disease-free survival was 100% and 57% for polymerase chain reaction-negative and -positive patients at 12 months, respectively (p=0.037). No clinical or biological factors were predictive of the achievement of polymerase chain reaction negativity after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Graft-versus-host disease was more frequent in patients who did not relapse (p=0.04). Quantitative monitoring of minimal residual disease was able to identify polymerase chain reaction-positive patients with a higher risk of relapse. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that relapsed patients can achieve molecular remission after reduced intensity conditioning and allogeneic stem cell transplantation and suggest a minimal residual disease-driven intervention that might be useful to prevent overt hematologic relapse.","['Farina, Lucia', 'Carniti, Cristiana', 'Dodero, Anna', 'Vendramin, Antonio', 'Raganato, Anna', 'Spina, Francesco', 'Patriarca, Francesca', 'Narni, Franco', 'Benedetti, Fabio', 'Olivieri, Attilio', 'Corradini, Paolo']","['Farina L', 'Carniti C', 'Dodero A', 'Vendramin A', 'Raganato A', 'Spina F', 'Patriarca F', 'Narni F', 'Benedetti F', 'Olivieri A', 'Corradini P']","['Division of Hematology-Bone Marrow Transplantation, Istituto Nazionale per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori, Via Venezian 1, Milan, Italy. lucia.farina@istitutotumori.mi.it']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090418,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Graft vs Host Disease/diagnosis/genetics', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care/methods', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2009/04/21 09:00,2009/09/26 06:00,['2009/04/21 09:00'],"['2009/04/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/26 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2008.000273 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2008.000273 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2009 May;94(5):654-62. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2008.000273.

With rare exception, however, the resultant protein products have remained largely intractable as pharmacologic targets. One example is AML1-ETO, the most common translocation reported in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). To identify AML1-ETO modulators, we screened a small molecule library using a chemical genomic approach. Gene expression signatures were used as surrogates for the expression versus loss of the translocation in AML1-ETO-expressing cells. The top classes of compounds that scored in this screen were corticosteroids and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) inhibitors. In addition to modulating the AML1-ETO signature, both classes induced evidence of differentiation, dramatically inhibited cell viability, and ultimately induced apoptosis via on-target activity. Furthermore, AML1-ETO-expressing cell lines were exquisitely sensitive to the effects of corticosteroids on cellular viability compared with nonexpressers. The corticosteroids diminished AML1-ETO protein in AML cells in a proteasome- and glucocorticoid receptor-dependent manner. Moreover, these molecule classes demonstrated synergy in combination with standard AML chemotherapy agents and activity in an orthotopic model of AML1-ETO-positive AML. This work suggests a role for DHFR inhibitors and corticosteroids in treating patients with AML1-ETO-positive disease.","['Corsello, Steven M', 'Roti, Giovanni', 'Ross, Kenneth N', 'Chow, Kwan T', 'Galinsky, Ilene', 'DeAngelo, Daniel J', 'Stone, Richard M', 'Kung, Andrew L', 'Golub, Todd R', 'Stegmaier, Kimberly']","['Corsello SM', 'Roti G', 'Ross KN', 'Chow KT', 'Galinsky I', 'DeAngelo DJ', 'Stone RM', 'Kung AL', 'Golub TR', 'Stegmaier K']","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Children's Hospital Boston, Harvard Medical School, MA 02115, USA.""]",,['eng'],['Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090417,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Acetylation', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', '*Combinatorial Chemistry Techniques', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Genomics', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Histone Deacetylases/metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Myeloid Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2009/04/21 09:00,2009/07/17 09:00,['2009/04/21 09:00'],"['2009/04/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/17 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)37299-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-07-166090 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Jun 11;113(24):6193-205. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-07-166090.

As such, defects in this system can contribute to disease pathogenesis. In this pathway, E3 ubiquitin ligases provide platforms for binding specific substrates, thereby coordinating their ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation by the proteasome. Despite the identification of many E3 ubiquitin ligases, the identities of their specific substrates are still largely unresolved. The ankyrin repeat-containing protein with a suppressor of cytokine signaling box 2 (ASB2) gene that we initially identified as a retinoic acid-response gene in acute promyelocytic leukemia cells encodes the specificity subunit of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that is involved in hematopoietic cell differentiation. We have recently identified filamin A and filamin B as the first ASB2 targets and shown that ASB2 triggers ubiquitylation and proteasome-mediated degradation of these proteins. Here a global quantitative proteomics strategy is provided to identify substrates of E3 ubiquitin ligases targeted to proteasomal degradation. Indeed we used label-free methods for quantifying proteins identified by shotgun proteomics in extracts of cells expressing wild-type ASB2 or an E3 ubiquitin ligase-defective mutant of ASB2 under the control of an inducible promoter. Measurements of spectral count and mass spectrometric signal intensity demonstrated a drastic decrease of filamin A and filamin B in myeloid leukemia cells expressing wild-type ASB2 compared with cells expressing an E3 ubiquitin ligase-defective mutant of ASB2. Altogether we provide an original strategy that enables identification of E3 ubiquitin ligase substrates that have to be degraded.","['Burande, Clara F', 'Heuze, Melina L', 'Lamsoul, Isabelle', 'Monsarrat, Bernard', 'Uttenweiler-Joseph, Sandrine', 'Lutz, Pierre G']","['Burande CF', 'Heuze ML', 'Lamsoul I', 'Monsarrat B', 'Uttenweiler-Joseph S', 'Lutz PG']","['Institut de Pharmacologie et de Biologie Structurale (IPBS) CNRS 205 Route de Narbonne and IPBS, Universite Paul Sabatier Universite de Toulouse, Toulouse France.']",,['eng'],,"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090417,United States,Mol Cell Proteomics,Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,101125647,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Contractile Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Filamins', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism', 'Microfilament Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/*metabolism', 'Proteomics/*methods', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Talin/genetics/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/genetics/*metabolism']",2009/04/21 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/04/21 09:00'],"['2009/04/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S1535-9476(20)34048-2 [pii]', '10.1074/mcp.M800410-MCP200 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Proteomics. 2009 Jul;8(7):1719-27. doi: 10.1074/mcp.M800410-MCP200.

Ant colony optimization (ACO) is one such algorithm based on swarm intelligence and is derived from a model inspired by the collective foraging behavior of ants. Taking advantage of the ACO in traits such as self-organization and robustness, this paper investigates ant-based algorithms for gene expression data clustering and associative classification. METHODS AND MATERIAL: An ant-based clustering (Ant-C) and an ant-based association rule mining (Ant-ARM) algorithms are proposed for gene expression data analysis. The proposed algorithms make use of the natural behavior of ants such as cooperation and adaptation to allow for a flexible robust search for a good candidate solution. RESULTS: Ant-C has been tested on the three datasets selected from the Stanford Genomic Resource Database and achieved relatively high accuracy compared to other classical clustering methods. Ant-ARM has been tested on the acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)/acute myeloid leukemia (AML) dataset and generated about 30 classification rules with high accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Ant-C can generate optimal number of clusters without incorporating any other algorithms such as K-means or agglomerative hierarchical clustering. For associative classification, while a few of the well-known algorithms such as Apriori, FP-growth and Magnum Opus are unable to mine any association rules from the ALL/AML dataset within a reasonable period of time, Ant-ARM is able to extract associative classification rules.","['He, Yulan', 'Hui, Siu Cheung']","['He Y', 'Hui SC']","['Knowledge Media Institute, The Open University, Walton Hall, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, UK. y.l.he.01@cantab.net']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090418,Netherlands,Artif Intell Med,Artificial intelligence in medicine,8915031,IM,"['*Algorithms', 'Animals', '*Ants', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Feeding Behavior', '*Gene Expression']",2009/04/21 09:00,2009/11/17 06:00,['2009/04/21 09:00'],"['2008/03/26 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/17 00:00 [revised]', '2009/03/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/04/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0933-3657(09)00054-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.artmed.2009.03.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Artif Intell Med. 2009 Oct;47(2):105-19. doi: 10.1016/j.artmed.2009.03.004.

In epithelial cells, vacuolin-1 has been shown to inhibit Ca2+ ionophore-induced exocytosis depending on experimental conditions used but had no effect on repair of damaged membranes. However, it is not known whether vacuolin-1 could inhibit exocytosis induced by immunoreceptor triggering in professional secretory cells and whether there is any correlation between effect of vacuolin-1 on exocytosis and membrane repair in such cells. Here we show that in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells activated by the high-affinity IgE receptor (FcepsilonRI) triggering vacuolin-1 enhanced exocytosis. Under identical conditions of activation, vacuolin-1 inhibited exocytosis in mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs). This inhibition was not reflected by decreased phosphorylation of the FcepsilonRI alpha and beta subunits, linker for activation of T cells, non-T cell activation linker, Akt and MAP kinase Erk, and uptake of extracellular Ca2+, indicating that early activation events are not affected. In both cell types vacuolin-1 led to formation of numerous vacuoles, a process which was inhibited by bafilomycin A1, an inhibitor of vacuolar H+-ATPase. Thapsigargin- or Ca2+ ionophore A23187-induced exocytosis also showed different sensitivity to the inhibitory effect of vacuolin-1. Pretreatment of the cells with vacuolin-1 followed by permeabilization with bacterial toxin streptolysin O enhanced Ca2+-dependent repair of plasma membrane lesions in RBL-2H3 cells but inhibited it in BMMCs. Our data indicate that lysosomal exocytosis exhibits different sensitivity to vacuolin-1 depending on the cell type analyzed and mode of activation. Furthermore, our results support the concept that lysosomal exocytosis is involved in the repair of injured plasma membranes.","['Shaik, Gouse M', 'Draberova, Lubica', 'Heneberg, Petr', 'Draber, Petr']","['Shaik GM', 'Draberova L', 'Heneberg P', 'Draber P']","['Laboratory of Signal Transduction, Institute of Molecular Genetics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Prague, Czech Republic.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090417,England,Cell Signal,Cellular signalling,8904683,IM,"['Animals', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/physiology', 'Exocytosis/*drug effects', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, 4 or More Rings/*pharmacology', 'Mast Cells/*drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Phosphorylation', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/immunology/metabolism', 'Vacuoles/physiology']",2009/04/21 09:00,2009/07/11 09:00,['2009/04/21 09:00'],"['2009/03/01 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/30 00:00 [revised]', '2009/04/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/04/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/11 09:00 [medline]']","['S0898-6568(09)00135-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cellsig.2009.04.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Signal. 2009 Aug;21(8):1337-45. doi: 10.1016/j.cellsig.2009.04.001.

This study investigates the mechanisms responsible for increased Rac2 gene expression during myeloid cell differentiation. Treatment of K562 chronic myelogenous leukemia cells with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) induces megakaryocytic differentiation and Rac2 gene transcription following a lag of 6-12 h. Promoter/luciferase reporter gene assays reveal that a 135 bp cis-element located between -4223 and -4008 bp upstream of the Rac2 transcription start site is necessary and sufficient for PMA-induced gene expression. The AP1 transcription factor binds to three cis-elements within the 135 bp Rac2 gene regulatory region both in vitro and in vivo following PMA treatment, and mutagenesis of the AP1 binding sites ablates the PMA responsiveness of the 135 bp Rac2 gene regulatory region. Over-expression of AP1 is sufficient to induce expression of a transiently transfected Rac2 promoter/luciferase plasmid, but not the endogenous Rac2 gene. Induction of AP1 in vitro DNA-binding activity is apparent within 1 h of PMA stimulation. However, AP1 binding to the endogenous Rac2 promoter exhibits a lag of 5-9 h, which correlates with reduced histone H3-Lys9 methylation, increased histone H3 acetylation, and increased nuclease accessibility within the 135 bp Rac2 gene regulatory region. These results demonstrate that PMA induction of Rac2 expression during terminal myeloid differentiation requires the coordinate induction of transcription factors and remodeling of Rac2 gene chromatin structure.","['Muthukrishnan, Rajarajeswari', 'Skalnik, David G']","['Muthukrishnan R', 'Skalnik DG']","['Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research, Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.']",,['eng'],"['P01 HL069974-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 HL69974/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090417,Netherlands,Gene,Gene,7706761,IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly', '*Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Phorbol Esters/pharmacology', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'rac GTP-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism']",2009/04/21 09:00,2009/06/19 09:00,['2009/04/21 09:00'],"['2008/11/13 00:00 [received]', '2009/04/06 00:00 [revised]', '2009/04/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/04/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/19 09:00 [medline]']","['S0378-1119(09)00180-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.gene.2009.04.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene. 2009 Jul 1;440(1-2):63-72. doi: 10.1016/j.gene.2009.04.005.

In children with cancer the issue has not been investigated so far. DESIGN AND METHODS: To determine the diagnostic and prognostic roles of pre-treatment serum levels of IL-10 (Th2 cytokine), IL-12 (Th1) and their ratios (measured by the IL-10 and IL-12p70 ELISA kits; Endogen) in 91 children with soft tissue sarcomas (STS), Hodgkin's lymphomas (HL) and acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL). RESULTS: Median IL-10 and IL-12 levels were significantly higher in cancer patients than in healthy controls. Increased IL-10 indicated presence of general symptoms in HL and high risk group in ALL. Elevated IL-10 and IL-10/IL-12 ratios and decreased IL-12 correlated with poor-risk histology in STS, poor response to therapy, relapse and death from cancer. Multivariate analysis identified IL-10/IL-12 ratio>0.14 and IL-12<40 pg/mL as significant predictors for shorter EFS and OS, respectively. CONCLUSION: Pre-treatment serum levels of IL-10, IL-12 and IL-10/IL-12 balance in children with STS, HL and ALL may be of value as additional prognostic tools to predict the response to therapy and probability of EFS and OS.","['Bien, Ewa', 'Balcerska, Anna', 'Adamkiewicz-Drozynska, Elzbieta', 'Rapala, Malgorzata', 'Krawczyk, Malgorzata', 'Stepinski, Jan']","['Bien E', 'Balcerska A', 'Adamkiewicz-Drozynska E', 'Rapala M', 'Krawczyk M', 'Stepinski J']","['Department of Pediatrics, Hematology, Oncology and Endocrinology, Medical University of Gdansk, 7 Debinki Street, 80-211 Gdansk, Poland. ebien@amg.gda.pl']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090416,United States,Clin Biochem,Clinical biochemistry,0133660,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Blood Sedimentation', 'C-Reactive Protein/analysis', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/*blood/diagnosis/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-10/*blood', 'Interleukin-12/*blood', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/diagnosis/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Sarcoma/*blood/diagnosis/*therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/04/21 09:00,2009/08/29 09:00,['2009/04/21 09:00'],"['2008/12/22 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/19 00:00 [revised]', '2009/04/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/04/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/29 09:00 [medline]']","['S0009-9120(09)00182-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2009.04.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Biochem. 2009 Jul;42(10-11):1144-57. doi: 10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2009.04.004.

We demonstrate here that MPS VII mice accumulate massive amounts of the GAG chondroitin-4-sulfate (C4S) in their growth plates, the cartilaginous region near the ends of long bones responsible for growth. MPS VII mice also have only 60% of the normal number of chondrocytes in the growth plate and 55% of normal chondrocyte proliferation at 3weeks of age. We hypothesized that this reduction in proliferation was due to C4S-mediated overactivation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3). However, MPS VII mice that were FGFR3-deficient still had shortened bones, suggesting that FGFR3 is not required for the bone defect. Further study revealed that MPS VII growth plates had reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3, a pro-proliferative transcription factor. This was accompanied by a decrease in expression of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and other interleukin 6 family cytokines, and a reduction in phosphorylated tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2), Janus kinase 1 (JAK1), and JAK2, known activators of STAT3 phosphorylation. Intriguingly, loss of function mutations in LIF and its receptor leads to shortened bones. This suggests that accumulation of C4S in the growth plate leads to reduced expression of LIF and reduced STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation, which results in reduced chondrocyte proliferation and ultimately shortened bones.","['Metcalf, Jason A', 'Zhang, Yanming', 'Hilton, Matthew J', 'Long, Fanxin', 'Ponder, Katherine P']","['Metcalf JA', 'Zhang Y', 'Hilton MJ', 'Long F', 'Ponder KP']","['Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, Campus Box 8125, 660 South Euclid Avenue, Saint Louis, MO 63110, USA. jametcal@wustl.edu']",,['eng'],"['R56 DK066448/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 DK066448-06/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK52574/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK66448/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK54481/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 DK052574-10/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK054481/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK054481-14/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090325,United States,Mol Genet Metab,Molecular genetics and metabolism,9805456,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone and Bones/*pathology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Glycosaminoglycans/metabolism', 'Growth Plate/metabolism/pathology', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mucopolysaccharidosis VII/*pathology', 'Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 3/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tibia/pathology']",2009/04/21 09:00,2009/08/13 09:00,['2009/04/21 09:00'],"['2009/02/11 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/17 00:00 [revised]', '2009/03/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/04/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/13 09:00 [medline]']","['S1096-7192(09)00071-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ymgme.2009.03.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Genet Metab. 2009 Jul;97(3):202-11. doi: 10.1016/j.ymgme.2009.03.005.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data on 1788 patients aged 15-24 years were extracted from the Thames Cancer Registry, assigning each to a diagnostic group using the Birch and Marsden classification. Age-specific incidence rates in 5-year periods for the age groups 15-19 and 20-24 years were calculated for each diagnosis. Five-year relative survival estimates by diagnostic group were calculated for both age groups using 5-year periods of follow-up and non-overlapping years of diagnosis. To calculate overall survival estimates by socioeconomic group, the 10-year follow-up period 1993-2002 was used. RESULTS: Overall incidence rates were 162 per million person-years in 15-19 year olds and 261 in 20-24 year olds. We found a higher overall incidence in males, in 20-24 year olds and an increasing incidence over the last four decades, particularly in this age group. In both the 15-19 and 20-24 years age groups lymphomas were most common. The 5-year relative survival improved for all diagnostic groups, except bone tumours in the older age group, particularly for leukaemia and slightly more for the 20-24 than 15-19 years age group. Teenagers aged 15-19 years and living in more deprived areas had a significantly lower survival than those in more affluent areas. CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirm the increased incidence and improved outcome of cancer in teenagers and young adults. Future analyses should investigate trends in bone tumour survival across regions, survival by socioeconomic status and the influence of specialised care on further improvements in survival.","['Croucher, C', 'Whelan, J S', 'Moller, H', 'Davies, E A']","['Croucher C', 'Whelan JS', 'Moller H', 'Davies EA']","[""King's College London, Thames Cancer Registry, London SE1 3QD, UK.""]",,['eng'],['Department of Health/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090417,England,Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol),Clinical oncology (Royal College of Radiologists (Great Britain)),9002902,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'England/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/mortality/pathology', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Distribution', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Survival Rate/trends']",2009/04/21 09:00,2009/07/25 09:00,['2009/04/21 09:00'],"['2008/06/24 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/03 00:00 [revised]', '2009/02/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/04/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/25 09:00 [medline]']","['S0936-6555(09)00068-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clon.2009.02.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol). 2009 Jun;21(5):417-24. doi: 10.1016/j.clon.2009.02.006.

We extracted the data from the ""Registre regional des hemopathies malignes de Basse-Normandie (RRHMBN)"", a French registry which belongs to the Association of the French Cancer Registries (FRANCIM). All the malignant haematological diseases were coded using the third edition of the International Classification for Oncologic Diseases (ICD-O-3) and the ADICAP classification, a special version adapted in 2001 for haematology. Five thousand five hundred and ten new cases of malignant haematological disorders were registered over the period 1997-2004. Whatever the department constituting the Basse-Normandie (Calvados, Manche and Orne), no significant difference of incidence was detected. In men, the more frequent malignant disorders were non-Hodgkin's malignant lymphomas (NHML) followed by chronic lymphocytic leukemia and other mature neoplasms, myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), multiple myeloma (MM), myeloproliferative disorders (MPD), acute myeloid leukemias (AML), Hodgkin's lymphomas (HL), Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In women, MM is the third more frequent haematological disorders after NHML and lymphocytic leukaemia and other mature neoplasms, MPD, MDS, AML, Hodgkin's lymphomas, WM and ALL. The other haematological disorders are very rare.

Lnk, a negative regulator of cytokine signaling, plays critical nonredundant roles in hematopoiesis. By binding to phosphorylated tyrosine kinases, Lnk inhibits major cytokine receptor signaling, including c-KIT; erythropoietin receptor-Janus kinase 2 (JAK2); and MPL-JAK2. In the present study, we investigated Lnk expression and possible function in transformed hematopoietic cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Coimmunoprecipitations were performed to identify binding between Lnk and mutant tyrosine kinases. Proliferation assays were done to examine the affect of Lnk overexpression on cancer cell growth. Real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis was used to determine Lnk expression in patient samples. RESULTS: We show that, in parallel to binding wild-type JAK2 and c-KIT, Lnk associates with and is phosphorylated by mutant alleles of JAK2 and c-KIT. In contrast, Lnk does not bind to and is not phosphorylated by BCR-ABL fusion protein. Ectopic expression of Lnk strongly attenuates growth of some leukemia cell lines, while others as well as most solid tumor cancer cell lines are either moderately inhibited or completely insensitive to Lnk. Furthermore, Lnk-mediated growth inhibition is associated with differential downregulation of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin and mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling in leukemia cell lines. Surprisingly, analysis of Lnk in a large panel of myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia patient samples revealed high levels of Lnk in nearly half of the samples. CONCLUSION: Although how leukemic cells overcome the antiproliferative effects of Lnk is not yet clear, our data highlight the multifaceted role negative feedback mechanisms play in malignant transformation.","['Gery, Sigal', 'Gueller, Saskia', 'Nowak, Verena', 'Sohn, Julia', 'Hofmann, Wolf K', 'Koeffler, H Phillip']","['Gery S', 'Gueller S', 'Nowak V', 'Sohn J', 'Hofmann WK', 'Koeffler HP']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, Calif. 90048, USA. gerys@cshs.org']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Alleles', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/genetics/*metabolism', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases']",2009/04/21 09:00,2009/05/06 09:00,['2009/04/21 09:00'],"['2008/09/26 00:00 [received]', '2009/01/08 00:00 [revised]', '2009/01/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/04/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/06 09:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(09)00030-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2009.01.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2009 May;37(5):585-592.e2. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2009.01.009.,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (SH2B3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesized that methylation analysis of DNA recovered from gastric washes could be used to detect gastric cancer. METHODS: We studied 51 candidate genes in 7 gastric cancer cell lines and 24 samples (training set) and identified 6 for further studies. We examined the methylation status of these genes in a test set consisting of 131 gastric neoplasias at various stages. Finally, we validated the 6 candidate genes in a different population of 40 primary gastric cancer samples and 113 nonneoplastic gastric mucosa samples. RESULTS: Six genes (MINT25, RORA, GDNF, ADAM23, PRDM5, MLF1) showed frequent differential methylation between gastric cancer and normal mucosa in the training, test, and validation sets. GDNF and MINT25 were most sensitive molecular markers of early stage gastric cancer, whereas PRDM5 and MLF1 were markers of a field defect. There was a close correlation (r = 0.5-0.9, P = .03-.001) between methylation levels in tumor biopsy and gastric washes. MINT25 methylation had the best sensitivity (90%), specificity (96%), and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.961) in terms of tumor detection in gastric washes. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest MINT25 is a sensitive and specific marker for screening in gastric cancer. Additionally, we have developed a new method for gastric cancer detection by DNA methylation in gastric washes.","['Watanabe, Yoshiyuki', 'Kim, Hyun Soo', 'Castoro, Ryan J', 'Chung, Woonbok', 'Estecio, Marcos R H', 'Kondo, Kimie', 'Guo, Yi', 'Ahmed, Saira S', 'Toyota, Minoru', 'Itoh, Fumio', 'Suk, Ki Tae', 'Cho, Mee-Yon', 'Shen, Lanlan', 'Jelinek, Jaroslav', 'Issa, Jean-Pierre J']","['Watanabe Y', 'Kim HS', 'Castoro RJ', 'Chung W', 'Estecio MR', 'Kondo K', 'Guo Y', 'Ahmed SS', 'Toyota M', 'Itoh F', 'Suk KT', 'Cho MY', 'Shen L', 'Jelinek J', 'Issa JP']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",,['eng'],"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA098006-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA105346/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA098006-03S1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA098006/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '27302C0031/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA098006-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA105346/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA098006/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090416,United States,Gastroenterology,Gastroenterology,0374630,IM,"['Aged', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Early Detection of Cancer', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Precancerous Conditions/*genetics/pathology', 'Probability', 'ROC Curve', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Stomach Neoplasms/*genetics/*pathology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism']",2009/04/21 09:00,2009/07/09 09:00,['2009/04/21 09:00'],"['2008/03/24 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/21 00:00 [revised]', '2009/02/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/04/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/09 09:00 [medline]']","['S0016-5085(09)00553-8 [pii]', '10.1053/j.gastro.2009.02.085 [doi]']",ppublish,Gastroenterology. 2009 Jun;136(7):2149-58. doi: 10.1053/j.gastro.2009.02.085.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of ouabain at different concentrations on growth regulation in various kinds of leukemia cell lines and explore the pathogenesis of leukemia, the functions of Na+, K+ -ATPase as a signal transduction conductor and its effects on cell growth. METHODS: Using the MTT assay, the survival rates of leukemia cell lines were observed 6, 12 and 24 hrs after treatment with 1 or 10 nmol/L ouabain. The expression of Na+, K+ -ATPase alpha1 subunit of leukemia cells was detected by Western blot. RESULTS: The MTT results showed that ouabain at 1 nmol/L or 10 nmol/L induced proliferation of lymphocytic leukemia B95 and Jhhan cell lines, as well as megakaryocytic leukemia M07e and Meg01 cell lines. Ouabain at 1 nmol/L or 10 nmol/L increased the expression of Na+, K+ -ATPase alpha1 subunit.

This study investigated the allelic frequencies and distribution characters of single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the coding region (cSNPs) of TS gene in Chinese children with acute leukemia (AL) and normal control children in order to explore the possible relationship between the cSNP in human TS gene and chemotherapeutic effects of 5-fluorouracils. METHODS: Bone marrow samples from 53 children with AL and peripheral blood samples from 115 normal children were obtained to prepare complementary DNAs (cDNAs). The cDNAs were analyzed for the polymorphisms in TS gene by reverse transcriptase (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and direct sequencing. The distributive difference of each genotype between AL children and control children was evaluated. RESULTS: A polymorphism 381 A>G (E127E) in the coding region of TS gene was firstly identified in the Chinese population. The 381 A>G allelic frequency in AL children and control children was 12.3% and 13.5% respectively (P>0.05), which were similar to that in the International SNP Bank (12.3%).

Using PCR technique, T-cell receptor (TCR) or immunoglobulin gene rearrangements were identified in 26 of 27 patients (96.3%). Two or more monoclonal/ bi-allelic gene rearrangements were identified in 17 cases (65.4%). The majority (70%) of T-lineage ALL cases contained TCRVgammaI-Jgamma1.3/2.3. Cross-lineage TCR rearrangements were found in 57.1% of cases with B-lineage ALL. 3. Suitable MRD targets of immunophenotypic abnormalities or antigen receptor gene rearrangements were detected in 121 patients (96.0%). CONCLUSIONS: MRD targets were identified using tandem application of flow cytometry and PCR in almost of children with ALL. Cross-lineage TCR rearrangements and bi-allelic gene rearrangements were observed in many patients.","['Tie, Li-Jun', 'Gu, Long-Jun', 'Jiang, Li-Min', 'Zhao, Jin-Cai', 'Chen, Jing', 'Pan, Ci', 'Dong, Lu', 'Chen, Jing', 'Xue, Hui-Liang', 'Tang, Jing-Yan', 'Wang, Yao-Ping']","['Tie LJ', 'Gu LJ', 'Jiang LM', 'Zhao JC', 'Chen J', 'Pan C', 'Dong L', 'Chen J', 'Xue HL', 'Tang JY', 'Wang YP']","[""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200127, China.""]",,['chi'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics,100909956,IM,"['Child', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*immunology']",2009/04/21 09:00,2009/07/01 09:00,['2009/04/21 09:00'],"['2009/04/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/01 09:00 [medline]']",['1008-8830(2009)04-0246-05 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi. 2009 Apr;11(4):246-50.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study investigated the relationship of immunophenotypes with French-American-British (FAB) subtypes and chromosomal abnormalities and assessed the prognostic value of immunophenotyping in children with AML. METHODS: From January 1998 to May 2003, 75 children with newly diagnosed AML were enrolled on protocol AML-XH-99. Immunophenotypes were measured with the flow cytometry. According to the McAbs used, the patients were classified into five groups: panmyeloid antigens (CD13, CD33, and MPO), myeloid-lineage associated antigens (CD14, CD15), lineage-specific antigens (CD41, GlyA), progenitor-associated antigens (CD34, HLA-DR) and lymphoid-associated antigens (CD19, CD7). The probability of event-free survival (EFS) was estimated by Kaplan-Meier analysis. The distributions of EFS were compared using the log-rank test. Chi-square analysis or Fisher exact test was used to compare the differences in the distribution of biologic presenting features. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to identify independent prognostic factors. RESULTS: At least one of panmyeloid antigens CD13, CD33 and MPO was expressed in 72 patents (97.3%). Two or more panmyeloid antigens were expressed in 45 patients (60.8%). The proportion of children with AML expressing one or more of the lymphoid-associated antigens was 24.3%. Lymphoid-associated antigen CD19 was expressed by blast cells in most of FAB M2 patients. The patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia were characterized by the absence of HLA-DR and lymphoid-associated antigens CD19 and CD7. Monovariate analysis showed immunophenotypes were not related to the complete remission rate after the first induction course and the 5-year-EFS. Multivariate analysis suggested immunophenotyping had no independent prognostic value in AML. CONCLUSIONS: Immunophenotyping can not be used independently in the evaluation of risk classification in children with AML. However, it is useful in the reorganization of special types of AML.","['Gu, Long-Jun', 'Tie, Li-Jun', 'Jiang, Li-Min', 'Chen, Jing', 'Pan, Ci', 'Dong, Lu', 'Chen, Jing', 'Xue, Hui-Liang', 'Tang, Jing-Yan', 'Wang, Yao-Ping', 'Ye, Hui']","['Gu LJ', 'Tie LJ', 'Jiang LM', 'Chen J', 'Pan C', 'Dong L', 'Chen J', 'Xue HL', 'Tang JY', 'Wang YP', 'Ye H']","[""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200127, China. ljguscmc@hotmail.com""]",,['chi'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics,100909956,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*immunology/mortality', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2009/04/21 09:00,2009/07/01 09:00,['2009/04/21 09:00'],"['2009/04/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/01 09:00 [medline]']",['1008-8830(2009)04-0241-05 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi. 2009 Apr;11(4):241-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, we examined immunolabeling of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) in the endometrial tissue of 52 IVF patients, and found that LIF staining intensity was strongly correlated with successful pregnancy initiation. In the same set of patients, we have now examined endometrial CLDN4 expression, to see how expression intensity may vary with LIF. We examined CLDN4 in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, immediately preceding IVF treatment. Our aim was to compare expression of LIF and CLDN4 in the luteal phase, and document these patterns as putative biomarkers for pregnancy. METHODS: Endometrial tissue was collected from women undergoing IVF. Endometrial biopsies were obtained during the luteal phase preceding IVF, and were then used for tissue microarray (TMA) immunolabeling of CLDN4. Previously published LIF expression data were then combined with CLDN4 expression data, to determine CLDN4/LIF expression patterns. Associations between successful pregnancy after IVF and combined CLDN4/LIF expression patterns were evaluated. RESULTS: Four patterns of immunolabeling were observed in the endometrial samples: 16% showed weak CLDN4 and strong LIF (CLDN4-/LIF+); 20% showed strong CLDN4 and strong LIF (LIF+/CLDN4+); 28% showed strong CLDN4 and weak LIF (CLDN4+/LIF-); and 36% showed weak CLDN4 and weak LIF (CLDN4-/LIF-). Successful implantation after IVF was associated with CLDN4-/LIF+(p = 0.003). Patients showing this endometrial CLDN4-/LIF+ immunolabeling were also 6 times more likely to achieve pregnancy than patients with endometrial CLDN4+/LIF- immunolabeling (p = 0.007). CONCLUSION: The combined immunolabeling expression of CLDN4-/LIF+ in endometrial tissue is a potential biomarker for predicting successful pregnancy in IVF candidates.","['Serafini, Paulo C', 'Silva, Ismael D C G', 'Smith, Gary D', 'Motta, Eduardo L A', 'Rocha, Andre M', 'Baracat, Edmund C']","['Serafini PC', 'Silva ID', 'Smith GD', 'Motta EL', 'Rocha AM', 'Baracat EC']","['Department of Gynecology, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil. pserafini@huntington.com.br']",,['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20090419,England,Reprod Biol Endocrinol,Reproductive biology and endocrinology : RB&E,101153627,IM,"['Adult', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Birth Rate', 'Claudin-4', 'Embryo Implantation/physiology', 'Endometrium/*metabolism', 'Female', '*Fertilization in Vitro', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Infertility/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'Luteal Phase/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/04/21 09:00,2009/07/01 09:00,['2009/04/21 09:00'],"['2008/12/04 00:00 [received]', '2009/04/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/04/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/01 09:00 [medline]']","['1477-7827-7-30 [pii]', '10.1186/1477-7827-7-30 [doi]']",epublish,Reprod Biol Endocrinol. 2009 Apr 19;7:30. doi: 10.1186/1477-7827-7-30.,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (CLDN4 protein, human)', '0 (Claudin-4)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)']",,,,PMC2675529,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Azidomethyl fluorescein was newly synthesized and introduced into a probe. Azido-masked fluorescein on the probe showed a strong turn-on fluorescence signal upon oligonucleotide-templated Staudinger reduction. The catalytic reaction of the probe offered a turnover number of 50 as fluorescence readout within 4 h. Finally, probes were introduced into human leukemia HL-60 cells by use of streptolysin O pore-forming peptide. We successfully detected and quantitated the 28S rRNA and beta-Actin mRNA signal above the background by flow cytometry. In addition, the same RNA targets were imaged by fluorescence microscopy. The data suggest that a reduction-triggered amplification probe may be a powerful tool in analyzing the localization, transcription, or processing of RNA species in living eukaryotic cells.","['Furukawa, Kazuhiro', 'Abe, Hiroshi', 'Hibino, Kayo', 'Sako, Yasushi', 'Tsuneda, Satoshi', 'Ito, Yoshihiro']","['Furukawa K', 'Abe H', 'Hibino K', 'Sako Y', 'Tsuneda S', 'Ito Y']","['Nano Medical Engineering Laboratory, RIKEN Advanced Science Institute, Saitama, Japan.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Bioconjug Chem,Bioconjugate chemistry,9010319,IM,"['Azides/chemistry', 'Cell Survival', 'Coumarins/chemistry', 'DNA/chemistry', 'Drug Design', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescein/chemical synthesis/chemistry', 'Fluorescent Dyes/chemical synthesis/*chemistry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Molecular Imaging/*methods', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'RNA/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 28S/metabolism', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence']",2009/04/21 09:00,2010/09/16 06:00,['2009/04/21 09:00'],"['2009/04/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/bc900040t [doi]'],ppublish,Bioconjug Chem. 2009 May 20;20(5):1026-36. doi: 10.1021/bc900040t.,"['0 (Azides)', '0 (Coumarins)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Ribosomal, 28S)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'A4VZ22K1WT (coumarin)', 'TPY09G7XIR (Fluorescein)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously, we have shown that leukemic cells of most ATL patients express CCR4, a chemokine receptor known to be selectively expressed by T cell subsets such as Th2 cells, skin-homing memory/effector T cells, and regulatory T cells. Therefore, the expression of CCR4 suggests that ATL cells are mostly derived from one of these T cell subsets. We have also shown that Tax, the HTLV-1-encoded potent transcriptional activator, strongly induces the expression of CCL22, a CCR4 ligand, which promotes the cell-dependent transmission of HTLV-1 from HTLV-1-infected T cells to CCR4+ target T cells by inducing close cell-to-cell interactions. We have also shown that ATL cells aberrantly express the AP-1 family member Fra-2 which, by forming the heterodimer with JunD, potently induces the expression of not only CCR4 but also the genes such as c-Myb, MDM2 and Bcl-6, the well-known proto-oncogenes. Thus, Fra-2 is a novel oncogene of ATL, and CCR4 may be regarded as a useful tumor marker of ATL.","['Yoshie, Osamu']",['Yoshie O'],"['Department of Microbiology, Kinki University School of Medicine, Osaka 589-8511, Japan. o.yoshie@med.kindai.ac.jp']",,['jpn'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,Japan,Uirusu,Uirusu,0417475,IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Fos-Related Antigen-2/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*virology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogenes/genetics', '*Receptors, CCR4', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*virology']",2009/04/21 09:00,2009/06/03 09:00,['2009/04/21 09:00'],"['2009/04/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/03 09:00 [medline]']",['10.2222/jsv.58.125 [doi]'],ppublish,Uirusu. 2008 Dec;58(2):125-40. doi: 10.2222/jsv.58.125.,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Fos-Related Antigen-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Receptors, CCR4)']",,,65,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So far, several crystal structures of cellular DUBs have been solved. Structure comparison has been carried out to search for DUBs with a similar structure to that of PLpro, and we have tried to dock 6MP and 6TG into these DUBs to investigate the potential use of 6MP and 6TG as cellular DUB inhibitors. The best docking score and binding energy for 6MP and 6TG is against ubiquitin-specific protease (USP)14, suggesting that 6MP and 6TG are potential inhibitors of USP14.

In this study, we examined whether Rapamycin and Curcumin, two naturally occurring compounds shown to have apoptotic effects, could selectively induce apoptosis in resting B-CLL cells. Mononuclear cells isolated from patients with B-CLL were treated with these agents and analysed by AnnexinV/propidium iodide binding, caspase activity, and changes in bcl-2/Bax ratio. Rapamycin and curcumin significantly induced apoptosis in resting B-CLL cells obtained from patients with CLL. Furthermore, rapamycin and curcumin increased caspase 9, 3 and 7 activity, decreased anti-apoptotic bcl-2 levels, and increased the pro-apoptotic protein Bax. These data suggest rapamycin and curcumin may be an effective treatment for B-CLL and are of high clinical significance considering the growing population of patients and lack of efficient treatment for this malignant disease.","['Hayun, Rami', 'Okun, Eitan', 'Berrebi, Alain', 'Shvidel, Lev', 'Bassous, Lucette', 'Sredni, Benjamin', 'Nir, Uri']","['Hayun R', 'Okun E', 'Berrebi A', 'Shvidel L', 'Bassous L', 'Sredni B', 'Nir U']","['The Mina and Everard Goodman Faculty of Life Sciences, Safdie Institute for AIDS and Immunology Research, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan, Israel.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 7/metabolism', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Curcumin/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Sirolimus/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",2009/04/18 09:00,2009/09/26 06:00,['2009/04/18 09:00'],"['2009/04/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/26 06:00 [medline]']","['910512992 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190902789181 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2009 Apr;50(4):625-32. doi: 10.1080/10428190902789181.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 7)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to determine the prevalence of occult HBV infection (OBI) of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, defined as detection of sequences from >or=2 HBV genes in subjects lacking hepatitis B surface antigen, among patients with treatment-naive chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). HBV DNA sequences from four HBV genes (S, X, core and pol) were searched for in archival material obtained at diagnosis (N = 173), and from age and sex-matched controls. OBI was observed in 17/173 (10%) patients and 5/173 (3%) controls (OR = 3.6, 95% CI 1.37-9.79, p = 0.014). OBI was not associated with differences on 5-year survival and biological predictors, but patients with CLL with OBI had significantly lower peripheral blood lymphocyte count. After 8 years of observation without treatment, one OBI positive patient with CLL converted into positive HBsAg serology and developed active hepatitis. In conclusion, OBI is significantly more prevalent among patients with CLL than in age and sex-matched controls, and may contribute to the susceptibility of patients with CLL to HBV reactivation, whether exposed or not to biological agents.","['Rossi, Davide', 'Sala, Lisa', 'Minisini, Rosalba', 'Fabris, Carlo', 'Falleti, Edmondo', 'Cerri, Michaela', 'Burlone, Michela Emma', 'Toniutto, Pierluigi', 'Gaidano, Gianluca', 'Pirisi, Mario']","['Rossi D', 'Sala L', 'Minisini R', 'Fabris C', 'Falleti E', 'Cerri M', 'Burlone ME', 'Toniutto P', 'Gaidano G', 'Pirisi M']","['Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Eastern Piedmont A Avogadro, Novara, Italy.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Aged', 'DNA, Viral/chemistry/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Products, pol/genetics', 'Hepatitis B/*diagnosis/virology', 'Hepatitis B Antibodies/blood', 'Hepatitis B Surface Antigens/genetics', 'Hepatitis B virus/*genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/virology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/pathology/*virology', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prognosis', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors', 'Trans-Activators/genetics', 'Viral Core Proteins/genetics', 'Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins']",2009/04/18 09:00,2009/09/26 06:00,['2009/04/18 09:00'],"['2009/04/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/26 06:00 [medline]']","['910513033 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190902777673 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2009 Apr;50(4):604-11. doi: 10.1080/10428190902777673.,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, pol)', '0 (Hepatitis B Antibodies)', '0 (Hepatitis B Surface Antigens)', '0 (P protein, Hepatitis B virus)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Viral Core Proteins)', '0 (Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins)', '0 (hepatitis B virus X protein)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it is not clear the involvement of these well established prognostic factors in the clinical response of the patients with B-CLL to the chemotherapy. The possible association of the patient clinical-biological characteristics and the in vitro response to chemotherapic agents may serve to provide powerful predictive information to identify optimum treatment for patients. An apoptosis induction assay displays the patient in vitro responses to chemotherapy and the possible association with their clinical-biological characteristics. In this study, patients showed a significant better in vitro response to drugs when they were in the initial stages of the disease or with low beta(2) microglobulin serum level. Response to purine analogues was significantly higher in patients with long lymphocyte doubling time (LDT), few cells expressing CD38, normal karyotype or no p53 deletion, whereas there was no correspondence with ZAP-70 expression. Furthermore, a good correlation was shown between in vitro apoptosis induction assay and the patient clinical response to purine analogues.

We analysed five consecutive patients with post-transplant extramedullary relapse of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) out of a total of 24 patients (21%) undergoing allo-SCT. All five patients with extramedullary relapse had clonal evolution and a history of blast phase (BP). In particular, 56% of the patients in BP had extramedullary relapse with no extramedullary relapse in patients with chronic/accelerated phase. Most frequent manifestation sites were the skeletal system, the muscles/subcutaneous tissue and the central nervous system. In one case chloroma was mimicking myositis of the lower limbs.

Considerable knowledge has been recently gathered on the possible beneficial effects of n-3 PUFAs administered in combination with different antineoplastic drugs and radiotherapy against melanoma, leukemia, neuroblastoma, and colon, breast, prostate, and lung cancer. The efficacy of these combinations has been demonstrated both in vivo and in vitro, and clinical trials have also been conducted. The aim of this review is to analyze all the n-3 PUFA combinations investigated so far, their efficacy, and the possible molecular mechanisms involved. It would be highly auspicable that the detailed analysis of the literature in this field could further support the common use of n-3 PUFAs in combination with other chemopreventive agents and warrant more clinical investigations designed to test the effectiveness of n-3 PUFA treatments coupled with conventional antineoplastic therapies.","['Calviello, G', 'Serini, S', 'Piccioni, E', 'Pessina, G']","['Calviello G', 'Serini S', 'Piccioni E', 'Pessina G']","['Institute of General Pathology, Catholic University, L.go F.

We have previously shown that Rocaglamide(s), derived from the medicinal plant Aglaia, kills various leukemic cells through the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway with only minor toxicities to normal lymphocytes. Here, we show further that Rocaglamide preferentially promotes activation-induced cell death in malignant T cells by differential regulation of c-FLIP and CD95L expression. Rocaglamide enhances and also prolongs activation-induced JNK activation in malignant T cells leading to downregulation of c-FLIP but upregulation of CD95L expression. We also show that malignant T cells express a significantly higher amount of Bid - the molecular linker that bridges the receptor-mediated to the mitochondria-mediated apoptosis pathway. Conversely, a substantially lower amount of c-FLIP in response to T-cell stimulation compared to normal T cells is observed. This difference may provide a therapeutic window for cancer treatment. The effect of Rocaglamide on sensitization of activation-induced cell death in malignant T cells was further demonstrated in vivo in a mouse model. Our study demonstrates that Rocaglamide may be a potential anticancer drug that simultaneously targets both c-FLIP and CD95L expressions in tumor cells. This study may also provide a new clue to design a more efficient chemotherapy by using a combination of stimuli that engage the receptor-mediated and the mitochondria-mediated death pathway.","['Zhu, J Y', 'Giaisi, M', 'Kohler, R', 'Muller, W W', 'Muhleisen, A', 'Proksch, P', 'Krammer, P H', 'Li-Weber, M']","['Zhu JY', 'Giaisi M', 'Kohler R', 'Muller WW', 'Muhleisen A', 'Proksch P', 'Krammer PH', 'Li-Weber M']","['Tumorimmunology Program (D030), German Cancer Research Center, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090417,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein/metabolism', 'Benzofurans/*pharmacology', 'CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Fas Ligand Protein/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2009/04/18 09:00,2009/11/05 06:00,['2009/04/18 09:00'],"['2009/04/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/05 06:00 [medline]']","['cdd200942 [pii]', '10.1038/cdd.2009.42 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2009 Sep;16(9):1289-99. doi: 10.1038/cdd.2009.42.

We investigated whether advancing parental age increases childhood cancer risk. METHODS: We assessed the relationship between parental age and childhood cancer in a case-control study using pooled population-based data. Our pooling was based on linked cancer and birth registry records from New York, Washington, Minnesota, Texas, and California. Subjects included 17,672 cancer cases diagnosed at ages 0-14 years during 1980-2004 and 57,966 controls born during 1970-2004. Individuals with Down syndrome were excluded. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated by logistic regression for the association between parental age and childhood cancer after adjustment for sex, birth weight, gestational age, birth order, plurality, maternal race, birth year, and state. RESULTS: Positive linear trends per 5-year maternal age increase were observed for childhood cancers overall (odds ratio = 1.08 [95% confidence interval = 1.06-1.10]) and 7 of the 10 most frequent diagnostic groups: leukemia (1.08 [1.05-1.11]), lymphoma (1.06 [1.01-1.12]), central nervous system tumors (1.07 [1.03-1.10]), neuroblastoma (1.09 [1.04-1.15]), Wilms' tumor (1.16 [1.09-1.22]), bone tumors (1.10 [1.00-1.20]), and soft tissue sarcomas (1.10 [1.04-1.17]). No maternal age effect was noted for retinoblastoma, germ cell tumors, or hepatoblastoma. Paternal age was not independently associated with most childhood cancers after adjustment for maternal age. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that older maternal age increases risk for most common childhood cancers. Investigation into possible mechanisms for this association is warranted.","['Johnson, Kimberly J', 'Carozza, Susan E', 'Chow, Eric J', 'Fox, Erin E', 'Horel, Scott', 'McLaughlin, Colleen C', 'Mueller, Beth A', 'Puumala, Susan E', 'Reynolds, Peggy', 'Von Behren, Julie', 'Spector, Logan G']","['Johnson KJ', 'Carozza SE', 'Chow EJ', 'Fox EE', 'Horel S', 'McLaughlin CC', 'Mueller BA', 'Puumala SE', 'Reynolds P', 'Von Behren J', 'Spector LG']","['Division of Epidemiology/Clinical Research, Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.']",,['eng'],"['R01CA717450/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '(T32 CA099936/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA099936-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U58 DP000783/DP/NCCDPHP CDC HHS/United States', 'R01 CA092670/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01 CN005230/CN/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA092670-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U58DP000783-01/DP/NCCDPHP CDC HHS/United States', 'R01CA92670/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA071745-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA099936/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Epidemiology,"Epidemiology (Cambridge, Mass.)",9009644,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Odds Ratio', '*Parents', '*Risk Assessment', 'United States/epidemiology']",2009/04/18 09:00,2009/09/25 06:00,['2009/04/18 09:00'],"['2009/04/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/EDE.0b013e3181a5a332 [doi]'],ppublish,Epidemiology. 2009 Jul;20(4):475-83. doi: 10.1097/EDE.0b013e3181a5a332.,,,,,PMC2738598,['NIHMS136765'],,,,,,,,,,,,

To evade such host defenses, retroviruses have developed multiple strategies. This article reviews several proposed mechanisms of these viral counter-defenses. RECENT FINDINGS: Primate lentiviruses encode a virion-infectivity factor that induces targeted destruction of APOBEC3 proteins by hijacking the cellular ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Virion-infectivity factor molecules of HIV-1 and SIV are newly identified substrate receptor proteins that assemble with Cul5, ElonginB, ElonginC, and Rbx1 to form an E3 ubiquitin ligase and target selected APOBEC3 proteins for polyubiquitination. Foamy viruses use a different viral protein, BET, which binds and sequesters APOBEC3 away from the assembling virions. Simple retroviruses such as murine leukemia virus may avoid virion packaging of cognate APOBEC3 protein through yet another novel mechanism, in the absence of a viral regulatory factor. SUMMARY: APOBEC3 cytidine deaminases target broad retroelements. Contemporary retroviruses have developed multiple unique strategies to combat this powerful host defense system. As a result, these retroviruses and APOBEC3 proteins maintain an equilibrium that allows regulated viral replication. These viral counter-defenses thus represent vulnerable targets for the design of new classes of antiviral inhibitors.","['Yu, Xiao-Fang']",['Yu XF'],"['Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Curr Opin HIV AIDS,Current opinion in HIV and AIDS,101264945,,,2006/05/01 00:00,2006/05/01 00:01,['2009/04/18 09:00'],"['2009/04/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2006/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1097/01.COH.0000221590.03670.32 [doi]', '01222929-200605000-00002 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin HIV AIDS. 2006 May;1(3):187-93. doi: 10.1097/01.COH.0000221590.03670.32.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19372583,NLM,MEDLINE,20090514,20211020,1541-7786 (Print) 1541-7786 (Linking),7,4,2009 Apr,Mcl-1 is required for melanoma cell resistance to anoikis.,549-56,10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-08-0358 [doi],"Melanoma is a particularly aggressive tumor type that exhibits a high level of resistance to apoptosis. The serine/threonine kinase B-RAF is mutated in 50% to 70% of melanomas and protects melanoma cells from anoikis, a form of apoptosis induced by lack of adhesion or adhesion to an inappropriate matrix. Mutant B-RAF down-regulates two BH3-only proapoptotic proteins, Bim(EL) and Bad. BH3-only proteins act, at least in part, by sequestering prosurvival Bcl-2 family proteins and preventing them from inhibiting the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Several Bcl-2 proteins are up-regulated in melanoma; however, the mechanisms of up-regulation and their role in melanoma resistance to anoikis remain unclear. Using RNA interference, we show that depletion of Mcl-1 renders mutant B-RAF melanoma cells sensitive to anoikis. By contrast, minor effects were observed following depletion of either Bcl-2 or Bcl-(XL). Mcl-1 expression is enhanced in melanoma cell lines compared with melanocytes and up-regulated by the B-RAF-MEK-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 pathway through control of Mcl-1 protein turnover. Similar to B-RAF knockdown cells, adhesion to fibronectin protected Mcl-1 knockdown cells from apoptosis. Finally, expression of Bad, which does not sequester Mcl-1, further augmented apoptosis in nonadherent Mcl-1 knockdown cells. Together, these data support the notion that BH3 mimetic compounds that target Mcl-1 may be effective for the treatment of melanoma in combinatorial strategies with agents that disrupt fibronectin-integrin signaling.","['Boisvert-Adamo, Karen', 'Longmate, Whitney', 'Abel, Ethan V', 'Aplin, Andrew E']","['Boisvert-Adamo K', 'Longmate W', 'Abel EV', 'Aplin AE']","['Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA 19107, USA.']",,['eng'],"['GM067893/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM067893-05/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM067893-04/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM067893/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM067893-03/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Mol Cancer Res,Molecular cancer research : MCR,101150042,IM,"['*Anoikis', 'Cell Adhesion/physiology', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Fibronectins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Melanocytes/metabolism', 'Melanoma/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism/*physiology', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-Associated Death Protein/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/metabolism']",2009/04/18 09:00,2009/05/15 09:00,['2009/04/18 09:00'],"['2009/04/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/15 09:00 [medline]']","['7/4/549 [pii]', '10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-08-0358 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Res. 2009 Apr;7(4):549-56. doi: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-08-0358.,"['0 (BAD protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (bcl-Associated Death Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BRAF protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)']",,,,PMC2689141,['NIHMS117364'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Each compound was subsequently tested for its ability to inhibit Bcl-XL in an in vitro fluorescence polarization competition assay and exert single-agent proapoptotic activity in human cancer cell lines. The most potent compound BI79D10 binds to Bcl-XL, Bcl-2, and Mcl-1 with IC50 values of 190, 360, and 520 nmol/L, respectively, and potently inhibits cell growth in the H460 human lung cancer cell line with an EC50 value of 680 nmol/L, expressing high levels of Bcl-2. BI79D10 also effectively induces apoptosis of the RS11846 human lymphoma cell line in a dose-dependent manner and shows little cytotoxicity against bax-/-bak-/- mouse embryonic fibroblast cells, in which antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins lack a cytoprotective phenotype, implying that BI79D10 has little off-target effects. BI79D10 displays in vivo efficacy in transgenic mice, in which Bcl-2 is overexpressed in splenic B cells. Together with its improved plasma and microsomal stability relative to Apogossypol, BI79D10 represents a lead compound for the development of novel apoptosis-based therapies for cancer.","['Wei, Jun', 'Kitada, Shinichi', 'Rega, Michele F', 'Emdadi, Aras', 'Yuan, Hongbin', 'Cellitti, Jason', 'Stebbins, John L', 'Zhai, Dayong', 'Sun, Jiazhi', 'Yang, Li', 'Dahl, Russell', 'Zhang, Ziming', 'Wu, Bainan', 'Wang, Si', 'Reed, Tyler A', 'Wang, Hong-Gang', 'Lawrence, Nicholas', 'Sebti, Said', 'Reed, John C', 'Pellecchia, Maurizio']","['Wei J', 'Kitada S', 'Rega MF', 'Emdadi A', 'Yuan H', 'Cellitti J', 'Stebbins JL', 'Zhai D', 'Sun J', 'Yang L', 'Dahl R', 'Zhang Z', 'Wu B', 'Wang S', 'Reed TA', 'Wang HG', 'Lawrence N', 'Sebti S', 'Reed JC', 'Pellecchia M']","['Burnham Institute for Medical Research, 10901 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 90237, USA.']",,['eng'],"['U19 CA113318/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U19 CA113318-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA113318/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Female', 'Fluorescence Polarization', 'Gossypol/*analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Membranes, Artificial', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Microsomes, Liver', 'Models, Molecular', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Peptide Fragments/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/physiology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/physiology', 'bcl-X Protein/metabolism']",2009/04/18 09:00,2009/06/09 09:00,['2009/04/18 09:00'],"['2009/04/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/09 09:00 [medline]']","['8/4/904 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-08-1050 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2009 Apr;8(4):904-13. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-08-1050.,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bak1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Bax protein (53-86))', '0 (Bax protein, mouse)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Bcl2l11 protein, mouse)', '0 (Bcl2l11 protein, rat)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Membranes, Artificial)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (apogossypol)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'KAV15B369O (Gossypol)']",,,,PMC2750823,['NIHMS107825'],,,,,,,"['Mol Cancer Ther. 2009 Jul 1;8(7):2076.

Elevated Noxa and Bcl-2 levels directly correlated with sensitivity to ABT-737, whereas Mcl-1 levels were similar in all cell lines tested regardless of sensitivity. Transgenically enforced expression of Noxa but not Bcl-2 resulted in increased sensitivity to ABT-737 in multiple cell lines. This increase was especially pronounced in the H209 cell line in which expression of Noxa resulted in a proportionate decline in Mcl-1 expression. Although overexpression of Noxa enhanced sensitivity of the H526 and H82 cell lines to ABT-737, it did not result in altered Mcl-1 levels. Similarly, small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of Noxa expression in the H146 cell line, which increased resistance to ABT-737, did not result in altered Mcl-1 levels. Therefore, three of four cell lines studied failed to show Noxa-mediated regulation of Mcl-1 expression. However, despite failure to regulate Mcl-1 levels, Noxa blocked binding of Bim to Mcl-1 following its release from Bcl-2 by ABT-737. Finally, we observed that a 24-hour incubation of the H526 and WBA cell lines with ABT-737 resulted in increased Noxa expression, suggesting that Noxa may play a direct role in ABT-737-mediated apoptosis. These results indicate that Noxa expression is the critical determinant of ABT-737 sensitivity and loss of Noxa-mediated regulation of Mcl-1 expression may be an important feature of small cell lung cancer biology.","['Hauck, Paula', 'Chao, Bo H', 'Litz, Julie', 'Krystal, Geoffrey W']","['Hauck P', 'Chao BH', 'Litz J', 'Krystal GW']","['Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth Universityh and McGuire Veterans Affairs Medical Center (111K), 1201 Broad Rock Boulevard, Richmond, VA 23249, USA.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Biphenyl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Molecular Mimicry', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Nitrophenols/*pharmacology', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Small Cell Lung Carcinoma/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2009/04/18 09:00,2009/06/09 09:00,['2009/04/18 09:00'],"['2009/04/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/09 09:00 [medline]']","['8/4/883 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-08-1118 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2009 Apr;8(4):883-92. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-08-1118.,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bax protein (53-86))', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Sulfonamides)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Niacin deficiency, which is common in cancer patients, causes dramatic genomic instability in bone marrow cells in an in vivo rat model. From a mechanistic perspective, niacin deficiency delays excision repair and causes double strand break accumulation, which in turn favors chromosome breaks and translocations. Niacin deficiency also impairs cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to DNA damage, which combine to encourage the survival of cells with leukemogenic potential. Conversely, pharmacological supplementation of rats with niacin increases bone marrow poly(ADP-ribose) formation and apoptosis. Improvement of niacin status in rats significantly decreased nitrosourea-induced leukemia incidence. The data from our rat model suggest that niacin supplementation of cancer patients may decrease the severity of short- and long-term side effects of chemotherapy, and could improve tumor cell killing through activation of poly(ADP-ribose)-dependent apoptosis pathways.","['Kirkland, James B']",['Kirkland JB'],"['University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario, Canada, N1G 2W1. jkirklan@uoguelph.ca']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*etiology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Niacin/administration & dosage/deficiency/*physiology', 'Nutritional Status', 'Poly Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose/metabolism']",2009/04/18 09:00,2009/06/09 09:00,['2009/04/18 09:00'],"['2009/04/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/09 09:00 [medline]']","['8/4/725 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-09-0042 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2009 Apr;8(4):725-32. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-09-0042.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '26656-46-2 (Poly Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose)', '2679MF687A (Niacin)']",,,61,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We identified recurrent areas of somatic copy number-neutral loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and deletions of chromosome 4q24 in a large cohort of patients with myeloid malignancies including MDS and related mixed MDS/MPN syndromes using single nucleotide polymorphism arrays. We then investigated genes in the commonly affected area for mutations. When we sequenced TET2, we found homozygous and hemizygous mutations. Heterozygous and compound heterozygous mutations were found in patients with similar clinical phenotypes without LOH4q24. Clinical analysis showed most TET2 mutations were present in patients with MDS/MPN (58%), including CMML (6/17) or sAML (32%) evolved from MDS/MPN and typical MDS (10%), suggesting they may play a ubiquitous role in malignant evolution. TET2 mutations affected conserved domains and the N terminus. TET2 is widely expressed in hematopoietic cells but its function is unknown, and it lacks homology to other known genes. The frequency of mutations in this candidate myeloid regulatory gene suggests an important role in the pathogenesis of poor prognosis MDS/MPN and sAML and may act as a disease gene marker for these often cytogenetically normal disorders.","['Jankowska, Anna M', 'Szpurka, Hadrian', 'Tiu, Ramon V', 'Makishima, Hideki', 'Afable, Manuel', 'Huh, Jungwon', ""O'Keefe, Christine L"", 'Ganetzky, Rebecca', 'McDevitt, Michael A', 'Maciejewski, Jaroslaw P']","['Jankowska AM', 'Szpurka H', 'Tiu RV', 'Makishima H', 'Afable M', 'Huh J', ""O'Keefe CL"", 'Ganetzky R', 'McDevitt MA', 'Maciejewski JP']","['Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, OH 44195, USA.']",,['eng'],"['K24 HL077522/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL082983/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 RR019391/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'K24 HL-077522/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01HL-082983/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'S10 RR019391/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20090416,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4/*genetics/ultrastructure', 'Cohort Studies', 'Conserved Sequence', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Dioxygenases', 'Disease Progression', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/genetics', '*Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Young Adult']",2009/04/18 09:00,2009/07/21 09:00,['2009/04/18 09:00'],"['2009/04/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/21 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)37260-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-02-205690 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Jun 18;113(25):6403-10. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-02-205690.

However, there is no sufficient evidence to support its therapeutic use for other types of cancers. In this study, we investigated if, and how, 17-dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxy-geldanamycin (17-DMAG), an antagonist of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), and KNK437, a HSP synthesis inhibitor, potentiated the cytotoxic effect of ATO. Our results showed that cotreatment with ATO and either 17-DMAG or KNK437 significantly increased ATO-induced cell death and apoptosis. siRNA-mediated attenuation of the expression of the inducible isoform of HSP70 (HSP70i) or HSP90alpha/beta also enhanced ATO-induced apoptosis. In addition, cotreatment with ATO and 17-DMAG or KNK437 significantly increased ATO-induced mitotic arrest and ATO-induced BUBR1 phosphorylation and PDS1 accumulation. Cotreatment also significantly increased the percentage of mitotic cells with abnormal mitotic spindles and promoted metaphase arrest as compared to ATO treatment alone. These results indicated that 17-DMAG or KNK437 may enhance ATO cytotoxicity by potentiating mitotic arrest and mitotic apoptosis possibly through increased activation of the spindle checkpoint.","['Wu, Yi-Chen', 'Yen, Wen-Yen', 'Lee, Te-Chang', 'Yih, Ling-Huei']","['Wu YC', 'Yen WY', 'Lee TC', 'Yih LH']","['Institute of Cellular and Organismic Biology, Academia Sinica, Taipei 115, Taiwan, ROC.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090212,United States,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,0416575,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals', 'Benzhydryl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Benzoquinones/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Environmental Pollutants/toxicity', 'HeLa Cells', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic/*pharmacology', 'Mitosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Oxides/*toxicity', 'Pyrrolidinones/*pharmacology']",2009/04/18 09:00,2009/05/06 09:00,['2009/04/18 09:00'],"['2008/11/27 00:00 [received]', '2009/01/23 00:00 [revised]', '2009/02/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/04/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/06 09:00 [medline]']","['S0041-008X(09)00058-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.taap.2009.02.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol. 2009 Apr 15;236(2):231-8. doi: 10.1016/j.taap.2009.02.003.

The short half-life of Mcl-1 makes it an interesting target for therapeutic agents that negatively interfere with cellular protein biosynthesis, such as oncolytic viruses. Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) has been established as the oncolytic virus that efficiently disrupts de novo protein biosynthesis of infected cells. Here, we show that after VSV infection, Mcl-1 protein levels rapidly declined, whereas the expression of other members of the Bcl-2 family remained unchanged. Mcl-1 elimination was a consequence of proteasomal degradation, as overexpression of a degradation-resistant Mcl-1 mutant restored Mcl-1 levels. Mcl-1 rescue inhibited apoptosis and thereby confirmed that Mcl-1 downregulation contributes to VSV-induced apoptosis. In vitro, VSV virotherapy in combination with chemotherapy revealed an enhanced therapeutic effect compared with the single treatments, which could be reverted by Mcl-1 rescue or RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown of pro-apoptotic Bax and Bak proteins. Finally, in a tumor mouse model, combinations of doxorubicin and VSV showed a superior therapeutic efficacy compared with VSV or doxorubicin alone. In summary, our data indicate that VSV virotherapy is an attractive strategy to overcome tumor resistance against conventional chemotherapy by elimination of Mcl-1.","['Schache, P', 'Gurlevik, E', 'Struver, N', 'Woller, N', 'Malek, N', 'Zender, L', 'Manns, M', 'Wirth, T', 'Kuhnel, F', 'Kubicka, S']","['Schache P', 'Gurlevik E', 'Struver N', 'Woller N', 'Malek N', 'Zender L', 'Manns M', 'Wirth T', 'Kuhnel F', 'Kubicka S']","['Department of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Endocrinology, Medical School Hannover, Hannover, Germany.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090416,England,Gene Ther,Gene therapy,9421525,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Autophagy/drug effects/physiology', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytopathogenic Effect, Viral', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Doxorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/genetics', 'Drug Synergism', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/metabolism', '*Oncolytic Virotherapy', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus/genetics/growth & development/*physiology', 'Virus Replication/drug effects', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2009/04/17 09:00,2010/07/31 06:00,['2009/04/17 09:00'],"['2009/04/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/31 06:00 [medline]']","['gt200939 [pii]', '10.1038/gt.2009.39 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene Ther. 2009 Jul;16(7):849-61. doi: 10.1038/gt.2009.39.

Mcl-1 pre-mRNA can undergo alternative splicing to yield the short isoform, Mcl-1S, which resembles BH3-only pro-apoptotic proteins and induces apoptosis. Overexpression of Mcl-1 may play a role in various human tumors, and Mcl-1 may serve as a target in cancer therapy. In this study, we found an imbalance between the expression levels of Mcl-1L and Mcl-1S in the skin basal cell carcinoma (BCC) cell line when compared with primary keratinocytes. We showed that overexpression of Mcl-1S induces apoptosis in BCC cells. Finally, we showed that Mcl-1 antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (AMOs) can specifically target Mcl-1 pre-mRNA and shift the splicing pattern from Mcl-1L to Mcl-1S mRNA and protein. This shift increases the level of pro-apoptotic Mcl-1S and reduces the level of anti-apoptotic Mcl-1L, which induces apoptosis in BCC cells and AGS cells, a human gastric adenocarcinoma epithelial cell line. Thus, this report provides a strategy for cancer therapy in which AMOs change the alternative splicing pattern of Mcl-1 pre-mRNA and thereby induce apoptosis.","['Shieh, Jeng-Jer', 'Liu, Kuang-Ting', 'Huang, Shi-Wei', 'Chen, Yi-Ju', 'Hsieh, Tsu-Yi']","['Shieh JJ', 'Liu KT', 'Huang SW', 'Chen YJ', 'Hsieh TY']","['Institute of Medical Technology, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan. shiehjj@dragon.nchu.edu.tw']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090416,United States,J Invest Dermatol,The Journal of investigative dermatology,0426720,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/metabolism/pathology', 'Alternative Splicing/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Carcinoma, Basal Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Keratinocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics', 'Skin Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology', 'Stomach Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology']",2009/04/17 09:00,2009/09/25 06:00,['2009/04/17 09:00'],"['2009/04/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S0022-202X(15)34090-2 [pii]', '10.1038/jid.2009.83 [doi]']",ppublish,J Invest Dermatol. 2009 Oct;129(10):2497-506. doi: 10.1038/jid.2009.83.

Targeted inhibition of BCR/ABL by kinase inhibitors leads to complete remission. However, patients with advanced Ph+ leukemia relapse and acquire resistance, mainly due to point mutations in BCR/ABL. The 'gatekeeper mutation' T315I is responsible for a general resistance to small molecules. It seems not only to decrease the affinity for kinase inhibitors, but to also confer additional features to the leukemogenic potential of BCR/ABL. To determine the role of T315I in resistance to the inhibition of oligomerization and in the leukemogenic potential of BCR/ABL, we investigated its influence on loss-of-function mutants with regard to the capacity to mediate factor independence. Here, we show that T315I (i) requires autophosphorylation at tyrosine 177 in the BCR-portion to mediate resistance against the inhibition of oligomerization; (ii) restores the capacity to mediate factor-independent growth of loss-of-function mutants due to an increase in or activation of ABL-kinase; (iii) leads to phosphorylation of endogenous BCR, suggesting aberrant substrate activation by BCR/ABL harboring the T315I mutation.

We demonstrate that upregulation of FHL2 is associated with a subset of acute myeloid leukemia with a characteristic gene-expression signature, and abnormalities of chromosome 5. In mice, expression of endogenous Fhl2 is downregulated coordinately during the differentiation of hematopoietic cells. Upregulation of FHL2 enhances proliferation of myeloid progenitor cells, and serial-replating efficiency of hematopoietic cells in vitro. Chimeric mice with enforced expression of FHL2 in bone marrow cells, are characterized by an expanded pool of myeloid progenitor cells, enhanced granulopoiesis and megakaryocytopoiesis. In addition, enhanced expression of FHL2 promotes cell-cycle entry of myeloid progenitor cells and increases the frequency of apoptosis of bone marrow cells in vivo.

However, the clinical significance of vitamin C on bortezomib treatment is unclear. In this study, we examined whether daily oral intake of vitamin C inhibits antimultiple myeloma (MM) activities of bortezomib. Vitamin C, at orally achievable concentrations, inhibited in vitro MM cell cytotoxicity of bortezomib and blocked its inhibitory effect on 20S proteasome activity. Specifically, plasma collected from healthy volunteers taking 1 g/day vitamin C reduced bortezomib-induced MM cell death in vitro. This antagonistic effect of vitamin C against proteasome inhibitors is limited to the boronate class of inhibitors (bortezomib and MG262). In vivo activity of this combination treatment was then evaluated using our xenograft model of human MM in SCID (severe combined immune-deficient) mice. Bortezomib (0.1 mg/kg twice a week for 4 weeks) significantly inhibits in vivo MM cell growth, which was blocked by oral vitamin C (40 mg/kg/day). Therefore, our results for the first time show that vitamin C can significantly reduce the activity of bortezomib treatment in vivo; and importantly, suggest that patients receiving treatment with bortezomib should avoid taking vitamin C dietary supplements.","['Perrone, G', 'Hideshima, T', 'Ikeda, H', 'Okawa, Y', 'Calabrese, E', 'Gorgun, G', 'Santo, L', 'Cirstea, D', 'Raje, N', 'Chauhan, D', 'Baccarani, M', 'Cavo, M', 'Anderson, K C']","['Perrone G', 'Hideshima T', 'Ikeda H', 'Okawa Y', 'Calabrese E', 'Gorgun G', 'Santo L', 'Cirstea D', 'Raje N', 'Chauhan D', 'Baccarani M', 'Cavo M', 'Anderson KC']","['Department of Medical Oncology, LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics and Jerome Lipper Myeloma Center, Harvard Medical School, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090416,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Antioxidants/*pharmacology', 'Ascorbic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Boronic Acids/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Bortezomib', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy', 'Proteasome Inhibitors', 'Pyrazines/*antagonists & inhibitors']",2009/04/17 09:00,2009/09/24 06:00,['2009/04/17 09:00'],"['2009/04/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/24 06:00 [medline]']","['leu200983 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.83 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Sep;23(9):1679-86. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.83.

P-gp maintains sublethal intracellular drug concentrations by virtue of its drug efflux capacity. The cellular regulation of P-gp expression is currently known to occur at either pre- or post-transcriptional levels. In this study, we identify a 'non-genetic' mechanism whereby microparticles (MPs) serve as vectors in the acquisition and spread of MDR. MPs isolated from drug-resistant cancer cells (VLB(100)) were co-cultured with drug sensitive cells (CCRF-CEM) over a 4 h period to allow for MP binding and P-gp transfer. Presence of P-gp on MPs was established using flow cytometry (FCM) and western blotting. Whole-cell drug accumulation assays using rhodamine 123 and daunorubicin (DNR) were carried out to validate the transfer of functional P-gp after co-culture. We establish that MPs shed in vitro from drug-resistant cancer cells incorporate cell surface P-gp from their donor cells, effectively bind to drug-sensitive recipient cells and transfer functional P-gp to the latter. These findings serve to substantially advance our understanding of the molecular basis for the emergence of MDR in cancer clinically and lead to new treatment strategies which target and inhibit MP mediated transfer of P-gp during the course of treatment.","['Bebawy, M', 'Combes, V', 'Lee, E', 'Jaiswal, R', 'Gong, J', 'Bonhoure, A', 'Grau, G E R']","['Bebawy M', 'Combes V', 'Lee E', 'Jaiswal R', 'Gong J', 'Bonhoure A', 'Grau GE']","['The Faculty of Pharmacy, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia. maryb@pharm.usyd.edu.au']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090416,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell-Derived Microparticles/*physiology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Protein Transport']",2009/04/17 09:00,2009/09/24 06:00,['2009/04/17 09:00'],"['2009/04/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/24 06:00 [medline]']","['leu200976 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.76 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Sep;23(9):1643-9. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.76.

To better understand emergence of FeLV-C and potential FeLV intermediates that may arise, we characterized FeLV Env sequences from the primary FY981 FeLV isolate previously derived from an anemic cat. Here, we report the characterization of the novel FY981 FeLV Env that is highly related to FeLV-A Env but whose variable region A (VRA) receptor recognition sequence partially resembles the VRA sequence from the prototypical FeLV-C/Sarma Env. Pseudotype viruses bearing FY981 Env were capable of infecting feline, human, and guinea pig cells, suggestive of a subgroup C phenotype, but also infected porcine ST-IOWA cells that are normally resistant to FeLV-C and to FeLV-A. Analysis of the host receptor used by FY981 suggests that FY981 can use both the FeLV-C receptor FLVCR1 and the feline FeLV-A receptor THTR1 for infection. However, our results suggest that FY981 infection of ST-IOWA cells is not mediated by the porcine homologue of FLVCR1 and THTR1 but by an alternative receptor, which we have now identified as the FLVCR1-related protein FLVCR2. Together, our results suggest that FY981 FeLV uses FLVCR1, FLVCR2, and THTR1 as receptors. Our findings suggest the possibility that pathogenic FeLV-C arises in FeLV-infected cats through intermediates that are multitropic in their receptor use.","['Shalev, Zvi', 'Duffy, Simon P', 'Adema, Karen W', 'Prasad, Rati', 'Hussain, Naveen', 'Willett, Brian J', 'Tailor, Chetankumar S']","['Shalev Z', 'Duffy SP', 'Adema KW', 'Prasad R', 'Hussain N', 'Willett BJ', 'Tailor CS']","['Program in Cell Biology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario M5G 1X8, Canada.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090415,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cats', 'Cell Line', 'Cricetinae', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*genetics/isolation & purification/pathogenicity', 'Membrane Transport Proteins/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Receptors, Virus/*metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Swine', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*genetics']",2009/04/17 09:00,2009/06/19 09:00,['2009/04/17 09:00'],"['2009/04/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/19 09:00 [medline]']","['JVI.02317-08 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.02317-08 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2009 Jul;83(13):6706-16. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02317-08.

In some instances, such modification profoundly affects protein function, but the biological significance of many SUMOylation events remains unknown. Protein SUMOylation is modulated during many viral infections. Here we demonstrate that the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) pp71 protein promotes the SUMOylation of its cellular substrate, Daxx. A component of promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies, Daxx is a transcriptional corepressor that silences the expression of viral immediate-early (IE) genes at the start of both lytic and quiescent HCMV infections. pp71 is a tegument component delivered directly to cells by infecting HCMV virions. At the start of lytic infections, it travels to the nucleus and stimulates viral IE gene expression by displacing the chromatin remodeling protein ATRX from Daxx and by mediating Daxx degradation through a rare ubiquitin-independent, proteasome-dependent process. Here we report that pp71 also substantially increases the basal level of SUMOylated Daxx observed in cells. To date, consequences of Daxx SUMOylation have not been observed for cellular promoters, and we detected no qualitative change in viral IE gene expression in the absence of pp71-induced Daxx SUMOylation. Thus, while pp71 enhances the basal level of SUMOylated Daxx, the role that this modification plays in regulating Daxx activity in uninfected or HCMV-infected cells remains an enigma.","['Hwang, Jiwon', 'Kalejta, Robert F']","['Hwang J', 'Kalejta RF']","['Institute for Molecular Virology and McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI 53706, USA.']",,['eng'],"['R01 AI074984/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 AI064703/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-AI074984/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R56-AI064703/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090415,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*metabolism', 'Co-Repressor Proteins', 'Cytomegalovirus/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/*metabolism', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Viral Proteins/*metabolism']",2009/04/17 09:00,2009/06/19 09:00,['2009/04/17 09:00'],"['2009/04/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/19 09:00 [medline]']","['JVI.02639-08 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.02639-08 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2009 Jul;83(13):6591-8. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02639-08.

We analyzed the probability of achieving a CCyR, major molecular response, and progression in 258 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in early chronic phase at 3, 6, and 12 months from imatinib start. The initial imatinib dose was 800 mg/day in 208 (81%) and 400 mg/day in 50 (19%) patients. For patients not in CCyR, the probability of achieving CCyR (P = .002) or major molecular response (P = .004) significantly decreased, whereas the risk of progression increased (P = .16) at each time point. Patients with a BCR-ABL1/ABL1 ratio greater than 1% to 10% after 3 months of imatinib had a 92% probability of achieving CCyR with continued therapy, similar to the 98% for those with 1% or less, but their risk of progression (11%) was almost 3-fold that of patients with a BCR-ABL1/ABL1 transcript ratio of 1% or less (4%) and similar to that of patients with transcript levels more than 10% (13%). These results suggest that patients not in CCyR after 12 months on imatinib have a higher risk of progression. This risk is discernible as early as 3 months into imatinib therapy by molecular analysis and may provide the rationale to institute therapies that render higher rates of early response.","['Quintas-Cardama, Alfonso', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Jones, Dan', 'Shan, Jianqin', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'Thomas, Deborah', 'Kornblau, Steven', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Cortes, Jorge']","['Quintas-Cardama A', 'Kantarjian H', 'Jones D', 'Shan J', 'Borthakur G', 'Thomas D', 'Kornblau S', ""O'Brien S"", 'Cortes J']","['Departments of Leukemia, University of Texas M.

The highly potent and specific activation of all type I NKT cells with C20:2 failed to exacerbate and in most settings inhibited GVHD late after transplantation, whereas effects on GVL were variable. In contrast, the administration of KRN7000 induced hyperacute GVHD and early mortality in all models tested. Administration of KRN7000, but not C20:2, was found to result in downstream interleukin (IL)-12 and dendritic cell (DC)-dependent natural killer (NK)- and conventional T-cell activation. Specific depletion of host DCs, IL-12, or donor NK cells prevented this pathogenic response and the induction of hyperacute GVHD. These data demonstrate the ability of profound iNKT activation to modulate both the innate and adaptive immune response via the DC-NK-cell interaction and raise concern for the use of alpha-GalCer therapeutically to modulate GVHD and GVL effects.","['Kuns, Rachel D', 'Morris, Edward S', 'Macdonald, Kelli P A', 'Markey, Kate A', 'Morris, Helen M', 'Raffelt, Neil C', 'Banovic, Tatjana', 'Don, Alistair L J', 'Rowe, Vanessa', 'Burman, Angela C', 'Clouston, Andrew D', 'Farah, Camile', 'Besra, Gurdyal S', 'Illarionov, Petr A', 'Smyth, Mark J', 'Porcelli, Steven A', 'Hill, Geoffrey R']","['Kuns RD', 'Morris ES', 'Macdonald KP', 'Markey KA', 'Morris HM', 'Raffelt NC', 'Banovic T', 'Don AL', 'Rowe V', 'Burman AC', 'Clouston AD', 'Farah C', 'Besra GS', 'Illarionov PA', 'Smyth MJ', 'Porcelli SA', 'Hill GR']","['Queensland Institute of Medical Research, Brisbane, Australia.']",,['eng'],"['G0400421/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'R01 AI045889/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI45889/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090415,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis', 'Female', 'Galactosylceramides/*administration & dosage/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/drug effects', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects/immunology', 'Mice', 'Natural Killer T-Cells/*drug effects/immunology', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/04/17 09:00,2009/07/28 09:00,['2009/04/17 09:00'],"['2009/04/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/28 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)37357-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-10-183335 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Jun 4;113(23):5999-6010. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-10-183335.

Studies have demonstrated the benefits of dasatinib 70 mg twice daily in patients with accelerated-phase chronic myeloid leukemia intolerant or resistant to imatinib. A phase 3 study compared the efficacy and safety of dasatinib 140 mg once daily with the current twice-daily regimen. Here, results from the subgroup with accelerated-phase chronic myeloid leukemia (n = 317) with a median follow-up of 15 months (treatment duration, 0.03-31.15 months) are reported. Among patients randomized to once-daily (n = 158) or twice-daily (n = 159) treatment, rates of major hematologic and cytogenetic responses were comparable (major hematologic response, 66% vs 68%; major cytogenetic response, 39% vs 43%, respectively). Estimated progression-free survival rates at 24 months were 51% and 55%, whereas overall survival rates were 63% versus 72%. Once-daily treatment was associated with an improved safety profile. In particular, significantly fewer patients in the once-daily group experienced a pleural effusion (all grades, 20% vs 39% P < .001). These results demonstrate that dasatinib 140 mg once daily has similar efficacy to dasatinib 70 mg twice daily but with an improved safety profile.

As protein kinases reside at the nodes of phosphorylation-based signal transmission, comprehensive analysis of their cellular expression and site-specific phosphorylation can provide important insights into the architecture and functionality of signaling networks. However, in global proteome studies, low cellular abundance of protein kinases often results in rather minor peptide species that are occluded by a vast excess of peptides from other cellular proteins. These analytical limitations create a rationale for kinome-wide enrichment of protein kinases prior to mass spectrometry analysis. Here, we employed stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) to compare the binding characteristics of three kinase-selective affinity resins by quantitative mass spectrometry. The evaluated pre-fractionation tools possessed pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine-based kinase inhibitors as immobilized capture ligands and retained considerable subsets of the human kinome. Based on these results, an affinity resin displaying the broadly selective kinase ligand VI16832 was employed to quantify the relative expression of more than 170 protein kinases across three different, SILAC-encoded cancer cell lines. These experiments demonstrated the feasibility of comparative kinome profiling in a compact experimental format. Interestingly, we found high levels of cytoplasmic and low levels of receptor tyrosine kinases in MV4-11 leukemia cells compared with the adherent cancer lines HCT116 and MDA-MB-435S. The VI16832 resin was further exploited to pre-fractionate kinases for targeted phosphoproteomics analysis, which revealed about 1200 distinct phosphorylation sites on more than 200 protein kinases. This hitherto largest survey of site-specific phosphorylation across the kinome significantly expands the basis for functional follow-up studies on protein kinase regulation. In conclusion, the straightforward experimental procedures described here enable different implementations of kinase-selective proteomics with considerable potential for future signal transduction and kinase drug target analysis.","['Oppermann, Felix S', 'Gnad, Florian', 'Olsen, Jesper V', 'Hornberger, Renate', 'Greff, Zoltan', 'Keri, Gyorgy', 'Mann, Matthias', 'Daub, Henrik']","['Oppermann FS', 'Gnad F', 'Olsen JV', 'Hornberger R', 'Greff Z', 'Keri G', 'Mann M', 'Daub H']","['Department of Molecular Biology, Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry, Martinsried, Germany.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090415,United States,Mol Cell Proteomics,Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,101125647,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Mass Spectrometry/methods', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Structure', 'Peptides/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/chemistry/metabolism', '*Protein Kinases/chemistry/metabolism', 'Proteome/*analysis', 'Proteomics/*methods', 'Pyrimidines/chemistry', 'Sequence Alignment']",2009/04/17 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/04/17 09:00'],"['2009/04/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S1535-9476(20)34051-2 [pii]', '10.1074/mcp.M800588-MCP200 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Proteomics. 2009 Jul;8(7):1751-64. doi: 10.1074/mcp.M800588-MCP200.

We evaluated the association between metribuzin use and cancer risk in the Agricultural Health Study, a prospective cohort study of licensed pesticide applicators in Iowa and North Carolina. METHODS: Applicators (N=23,072) provided information on metribuzin use on a self-administered questionnaire at enrollment (1993-1997). Among metribuzin users (n=8,504), there were 554 incident cancer cases. We used multivariable Poisson regression to evaluate potential associations between metribuzin use and cancer incidence by using two quantitative exposure metrics, lifetime days and intensity-weighted lifetime days. RESULTS: Using intensity-weighted lifetime days, the rate ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the highest exposed tertile for lymphohematopoietic malignancies were 2.09 (95% CI: 0.99-4.29), p trend=0.02 and 2.42 (95% CI: 0.82-7.19), p trend=0.08 for leukemia. For non-Hodgkin lymphoma, the RR was 2.64 (95% CI: 0.76-9.11), p trend=0.13 for lifetime days and 2.52 (95% CI: 0.66-9.59), p trend=0.13 for intensity-weighted lifetime days. Patterns of association were similar for both exposure metrics, but associations were generally weaker than for intensity-weighted days. CONCLUSIONS: The results from this study suggest a potential association between metribuzin use and certain lymphohematopoietic malignancies; however, having not been observed previously, caution should be used in interpretation.","['Delancey, John Oliver L', 'Alavanja, Michael C R', 'Coble, Joseph', 'Blair, Aaron', 'Hoppin, Jane A', 'Austin, Harland D', 'Beane Freeman, Laura E']","['Delancey JO', 'Alavanja MC', 'Coble J', 'Blair A', 'Hoppin JA', 'Austin HD', 'Beane Freeman LE']","['Department of Epidemiology and Surveillance Research, American Cancer Society, USA.']",,['eng'],['Z01 CP010119-12/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],20090415,United States,Ann Epidemiol,Annals of epidemiology,9100013,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Agriculture', 'Carcinogens/toxicity', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Herbicides/*toxicity', 'Humans', 'Iowa/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'North Carolina/epidemiology', 'Occupational Exposure/*analysis', 'Risk Factors', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Triazines/*toxicity']",2009/04/17 09:00,2009/07/25 09:00,['2009/04/17 09:00'],"['2008/08/12 00:00 [received]', '2008/12/16 00:00 [revised]', '2008/12/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/04/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/25 09:00 [medline]']","['S1047-2797(09)00040-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.annepidem.2008.12.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Epidemiol. 2009 Jun;19(6):388-95. doi: 10.1016/j.annepidem.2008.12.018.

Clinical evaluation is relatively unreliable when attempting to assess rapidly and prospectively the outcome of treatment. Fluxes in released or circulating tumour marker levels are a useful but inconsistent marker of cytotoxic response. Serial measurement of circulating tumour cells appears to have some utility as a surrogate marker, but assay systems are expensive, and many cancers are not associated with the presence of circulating tumour cells. Because tissue breakdown is associated with release of nucleic acids and other cellular products, we reasoned that serial measurement of intra-tumoural pH may correlate with the extent of tumour lysis, and thus with outcomes of cytotoxic chemotherapy. Doxorubicin-sensitive and doxorubicin-resistant sublines of P388 murine monocytic leukaemia in C57BL/6 mice were treated with increasing concentrations of doxorubicin. Tumours were serially measured by conventional bi-dimensional methods and pH was sampled using a bevelled tip electrode. Mean and median pH changes were statistically different in responsive and resistant tumours, and amplitude of change correlated with long-term responses to doxorubicin. Serial sampling of pH in tumour masses may provide a useful surrogate of long-term response to chemotherapy.","['Lindner, D', 'Raghavan, D']","['Lindner D', 'Raghavan D']","['Cleveland Clinic, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA. lindned@ccf.org']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Doxorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Tolerance', 'Humans', '*Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL']",2009/04/16 09:00,2009/05/15 09:00,['2009/04/16 09:00'],"['2009/04/16 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/15 09:00 [medline]']","['6605022 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bjc.6605022 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2009 Apr 21;100(8):1287-91. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6605022.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",,,,PMC2676543,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: 61 index cases with NF1 clinical diagnosis but no identifiable NF1 mutation were screened for SPRED1 mutation. RESULTS: We describe one known SPRED1 mutation (c.190C>T leading to p.Arg64Stop) and four novel mutations (c.637C>T leading to p.Gln213Stop, c.2T>C leading to p.Met1Thr, c.46C>T leading to p.Arg16Stop, and c.1048_1060del leading to p.Gly350fs) in five French families. Their NF1-like phenotype was characterised by a high prevalence of cafe-au-lait spots, freckling, learning disability, and an absence of neurofibromas and Lisch nodules in agreement with the original description. However, we did not observe Noonan-like dysmorphy. It is noteworthy that one patient with the p.Arg16Stop mutation developed a monoblastic acute leukaemia. CONCLUSIONS: In our series, SPRED1 mutations occurred with a prevalence of 0.5% in NF1 patients and in 5% of NF1 patients displaying an NF1-like phenotype. SPRED1 mutated patients did not display any specific dermatologic features that were not present in NF1 patients, except for the absence of neurofibromas that seem to be a specific clinical feature of NF1. The exact phenotypic spectrum and the putative complications of this NF1 overlapping syndrome, in particular haematological malignancies, remain to be further characterised. NIH diagnostic criteria for NF1 must be revised in view of this newly characterised Legius syndrome in order to establish a specific genetic counselling.","['Pasmant, E', 'Sabbagh, A', 'Hanna, N', 'Masliah-Planchon, J', 'Jolly, E', 'Goussard, P', 'Ballerini, P', 'Cartault, F', 'Barbarot, S', 'Landman-Parker, J', 'Soufir, N', 'Parfait, B', 'Vidaud, M', 'Wolkenstein, P', 'Vidaud, D', 'France, R N F']","['Pasmant E', 'Sabbagh A', 'Hanna N', 'Masliah-Planchon J', 'Jolly E', 'Goussard P', 'Ballerini P', 'Cartault F', 'Barbarot S', 'Landman-Parker J', 'Soufir N', 'Parfait B', 'Vidaud M', 'Wolkenstein P', 'Vidaud D', 'France RN']","['UMR745 INSERM, Universite Paris Descartes, Faculte des Sciences Pharmaceutiques et Biologiques, Paris, France. eric.pasmant@etu.univ-paris5.fr']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090414,England,J Med Genet,Journal of medical genetics,2985087R,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'Gene Dosage', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', '*Germ-Line Mutation', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*genetics', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Neurofibromatosis 1/*genetics', 'Neurofibromin 1/*genetics', 'Pedigree']",2009/04/16 09:00,2009/09/24 06:00,['2009/04/16 09:00'],"['2009/04/16 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/24 06:00 [medline]']","['jmg.2008.065243 [pii]', '10.1136/jmg.2008.065243 [doi]']",ppublish,J Med Genet. 2009 Jul;46(7):425-30. doi: 10.1136/jmg.2008.065243.

Here, we show that the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis at much lower concentrations in Ton.B210 cells when driven by inducibly expressed BCR/ABL than when driven by interleukin-3. The increased sensitivity to sorafenib was also observed in cells inducibly expressing BCR/ABL with the imatinib-resistant E255K or T315I mutation. Sorafenib-induced apoptosis in these cells and Ph+ leukemic cells was synergistically enhanced by rottlerin, bortezomib, or ABT-737 and inhibited by the pan-caspase inhibitor BOC-d-fmk or the overexpression of Bcl-XL. It was further revealed that sorafenib activates Bax and caspase-3 and reduces mitochondrial membrane potential specifically in BCR/ABL-driven cells. Sorafenib also inhibited BCR/ABL-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of its cellular substrates and its autophosphorylation in Ton.B210. It was finally shown that sorafenib inhibits the kinase activity of BCR/ABL as well as its E255K and T315I mutants in in vitro kinase assays. These results indicate that sorafenib induces apoptosis of BCR/ABL-expressing cells, at least partly, by inhibiting BCR/ABL to activate the mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway. Thus, sorafenib may provide an effective therapeutic measure to treat Ph+ leukemias, particularly those expressing the T315I mutant, which is totally resistant to imatinib and the second generation BCR/ABL inhibitors.","['Kurosu, Tetsuya', 'Ohki, Manabu', 'Wu, Nan', 'Kagechika, Hiroyuki', 'Miura, Osamu']","['Kurosu T', 'Ohki M', 'Wu N', 'Kagechika H', 'Miura O']","['Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medicine, Institute of Biomaterials and Bioengineering, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090414,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Acetophenones/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Benzamides', 'Benzenesulfonates/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Benzopyrans/administration & dosage', 'Biphenyl Compounds/administration & dosage', 'Boronic Acids/administration & dosage', 'Bortezomib', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/physiology', 'Mutation', 'Niacinamide/analogs & derivatives', 'Nitrophenols/administration & dosage', 'Phenylurea Compounds', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis', 'Pyrazines/administration & dosage', 'Pyridines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Sorafenib', 'Sulfonamides/administration & dosage']",2009/04/16 09:00,2009/07/15 09:00,['2009/04/16 09:00'],"['2009/04/16 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/15 09:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-08-2978 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-2978 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2009 May 1;69(9):3927-36. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-2978.

In this study, we report the in vitro and in vivo activities of AZD1152, a compound that has selectivity for aurora B kinase, in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines, primary AML samples, and cord blood cells. AZD1152 exerted antiproliferative or cytotoxic effects in all cell lines studied, inhibited the phosphorylation of histone H3 (pHis H3) on Ser10 in a dose-dependent manner, and resulted in cells with >4N DNA content. THP-1 cells treated with AZD1152 accumulated in a state of polyploidy and showed a senescent response to the drug, in contrast to the apoptotic response seen in other cell lines. Accordingly, AZD1152 profoundly affected the growth of AML cell lines and primary AML in an in vivo xenotransplantation model. However, concentration-dependent effects on cell growth, apoptosis, and cell cycle progression were also observed when human cord blood and primary lineage-negative stem and progenitor cells were analyzed in vitro and in vivo. These data suggest that the inhibition of aurora B kinase may be a useful therapeutic strategy in the treatment of AML and that further exploration of dosing and treatment schedules is warranted in clinical trials.","['Oke, Adedayo', 'Pearce, Daniel', 'Wilkinson, Robert W', 'Crafter, Claire', 'Odedra, Rajesh', 'Cavenagh, Jamie', 'Fitzgibbon, Jude', 'Lister, Andrew T', 'Joel, Simon', 'Bonnet, Dominique']","['Oke A', 'Pearce D', 'Wilkinson RW', 'Crafter C', 'Odedra R', 'Cavenagh J', 'Fitzgibbon J', 'Lister AT', 'Joel S', 'Bonnet D']","[""Medical Oncology, St Bartholomew's Hospital and Medical School, London, UK.""]",,['eng'],['A3589/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090414,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Annexin A5/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Aurora Kinase B', 'Aurora Kinases', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Organophosphates/*pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Quinazolines/*pharmacology', 'U937 Cells/drug effects']",2009/04/16 09:00,2009/07/09 09:00,['2009/04/16 09:00'],"['2009/04/16 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/09 09:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-08-3203 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-3203 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2009 May 15;69(10):4150-8. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-3203.

Interleukin (IL)-15 is important for the development and progression of LGL leukemia and is a survival factor for normal NK and T memory cells. IL-15 alters expression of Bcl-2 family members, Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Bim, Noxa, and Mcl-1; however, effects on Bid have not been shown. Using an adoptive transfer model, we show that NK cells from Bid-deficient mice survive longer than cells from wild-type control mice when transferred into IL-15-null mice. In normal human NK cells, IL-15 significantly reduces Bid accumulation. Decreases in Bid are not due to alterations in RNA accumulation but result from increased proteasomal degradation. IL-15 up-regulates the E3 ligase HDM2 and we find that HDM2 directly interacts with Bid. HDM2 suppression by short hairpin RNA increases Bid accumulation lending further support for HDM2 involvement in Bid degradation. In primary leukemic LGLs, Bid levels are low but are reversed with bortezomib treatment with subsequent increases in LGL apoptosis. Overall, these data provide a novel molecular mechanism for IL-15 control of Bid that potentially links this cytokine to leukemogenesis through targeted proteasome degradation of Bid and offers the possibility that proteasome inhibitors may aid in the treatment of LGL leukemia.","['Hodge, Deborah L', 'Yang, Jun', 'Buschman, Matthew D', 'Schaughency, Paul M', 'Dang, Hong', 'Bere, William', 'Yang, Yili', 'Savan, Ram', 'Subleski, Jeff J', 'Yin, Xiao-Ming', 'Loughran, Thomas P Jr', 'Young, Howard A']","['Hodge DL', 'Yang J', 'Buschman MD', 'Schaughency PM', 'Dang H', 'Bere W', 'Yang Y', 'Savan R', 'Subleski JJ', 'Yin XM', 'Loughran TP Jr', 'Young HA']","['Laboratory of Experimental Immunology, Cancer and Inflammation Program, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute-Frederick, and SAIC Frederick, Frederick, Maryland 21702-1201, USA.']",,['eng'],"['N01CO12400/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ZIA BC009283-25/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20090414,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein/biosynthesis/deficiency/*immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-15/deficiency/*immunology/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/immunology/metabolism', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/enzymology/*immunology/metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/enzymology/*immunology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/*metabolism', 'Proteasome Inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/immunology/metabolism']",2009/04/16 09:00,2009/07/15 09:00,['2009/04/16 09:00'],"['2009/04/16 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/15 09:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-08-3735 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-3735 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2009 May 1;69(9):3986-94. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-3735.

Sunitinib is a clinically approved multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, c-KIT, and PDGFR, and has shown clinical activity in various solid tumors. Activation of PDGFR signaling has been described in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (PDGFRA mutations) as well as in chronic myeloid leukemia (BCR-PDGFRA translocation), and sunitinib can yield clinical benefit in both settings. However, the discovery of PDGFR activating mutations or gene rearrangements in other tumor types could reveal additional patient populations who might benefit from treatment with anti-PDGFR therapies, such as sunitinib. Using a high-throughput cancer cell line screening platform, we found that only 2 of 637 tested human tumor-derived cell lines show significant sensitivity to single-agent sunitinib exposure. These two cell lines [a non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and a rhabdomyosarcoma] showed expression of highly phosphorylated PDGFRA. In the sunitinib-sensitive adenosquamous NSCLC cell line, PDGFRA expression was associated with focal PFGRA gene amplification, which was similarly detected in a small fraction of squamous cell NSCLC primary tumor specimens. Moreover, in this NSCLC cell line, focal amplification of the gene encoding the PDGFR ligand PDGFC was also detected, and silencing PDGFRA or PDGFC expression by RNA interference inhibited proliferation. A similar codependency on PDGFRA and PDGFC was observed in the sunitinib-sensitive rhabdomyosarcoma cell line. These findings suggest that, in addition to gastrointestinal stromal tumors, rare tumors that show PDGFC-mediated PDGFRA activation may also be clinically responsive to pharmacologic PDGFRA or PDGFC inhibition.","['McDermott, Ultan', 'Ames, Rachel Y', 'Iafrate, A John', 'Maheswaran, Shyamala', 'Stubbs, Hannah', 'Greninger, Patricia', 'McCutcheon, Kaitlin', 'Milano, Randy', 'Tam, Angela', 'Lee, Diana Y', 'Lucien, Laury', 'Brannigan, Brian W', 'Ulkus, Lindsey E', 'Ma, Xiao-Jun', 'Erlander, Mark G', 'Haber, Daniel A', 'Sharma, Sreenath V', 'Settleman, Jeffrey']","['McDermott U', 'Ames RY', 'Iafrate AJ', 'Maheswaran S', 'Stubbs H', 'Greninger P', 'McCutcheon K', 'Milano R', 'Tam A', 'Lee DY', 'Lucien L', 'Brannigan BW', 'Ulkus LE', 'Ma XJ', 'Erlander MG', 'Haber DA', 'Sharma SV', 'Settleman J']","['Center for Molecular Therapeutics, Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center and Harvard Medical School, Charlestown, Massachusetts 02129, USA.']",,['eng'],"['P20 CA090578/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA115830-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 CA090578-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA090578/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA090578-060008/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090414,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Antibodies/immunology/pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Amplification', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Indoles/*pharmacology', 'Ligands', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics', 'Lymphokines/genetics/immunology', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/genetics/immunology', 'Pyrroles/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics', 'Sunitinib']",2009/04/16 09:00,2009/07/15 09:00,['2009/04/16 09:00'],"['2009/04/16 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/15 09:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-08-4327 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-4327 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2009 May 1;69(9):3937-46. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-4327.

Little is known about the molecular mechanism of Nanog function. Here we describe the role of the tryptophan repeat (WR) domain, one of the two transactivators at its C terminus, in regulating stem cell proliferation as well as pluripotency. We first created a supertransactivator, W2W3x10, by duplicating repeats W2W3 10 times and discovered that it can functionally substitute for wild type WR at sustaining pluripotency, albeit with a significantly slower cell cycle, phenocopying Nanog(9W) with the C-terminal pentapeptide (WNAAP) of WR deleted. ES cells carrying both W2W3x10 and Nanog(9W) have a longer G1 phase, a shorter S phase in cell cycle distribution and progression analysis, and a lower level of pAkt(Ser473) compared with wild type Nanog, suggesting that both mutants impact the cell cycle machinery via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway. Both mutants remain competent in dimerizing with Nanog but cannot form a complex with Nac1 efficiently, suggesting that WNAAP may be involved in Nac1 binding. By tagging Gal4DBD with WNAAP, we demonstrated that this pentapeptide is sufficient to confer Nac1 binding. Furthermore, we can rescue W2W3x10 by placing WNAAP at the corresponding locations. Finally, we found that Nanog and Nac1 synergistically up-regulate ERas expression and promote the proliferation of ES cells. These results suggest that Nanog interacts with Nac1 through WNAAP to regulate the cell cycle of ES cells via the ERas/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway, but not pluripotency, thus decoupling cell cycle control from pluripotency.","['Ma, Tianhua', 'Wang, Zhe', 'Guo, Yunqian', 'Pei, Duanqing']","['Ma T', 'Wang Z', 'Guo Y', 'Pei D']","['From the Laboratory of Stem Cell Biology, Department of Biological Sciences and Biotechnology, Institutes of Biomedicine, School of Medicine, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China; Stem Cell and Cancer Biology Group, Key Laboratory of Regenerative Biology, South China Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510663, China.', 'From the Laboratory of Stem Cell Biology, Department of Biological Sciences and Biotechnology, Institutes of Biomedicine, School of Medicine, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China; Stem Cell and Cancer Biology Group, Key Laboratory of Regenerative Biology, South China Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510663, China.', 'From the Laboratory of Stem Cell Biology, Department of Biological Sciences and Biotechnology, Institutes of Biomedicine, School of Medicine, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China; Stem Cell and Cancer Biology Group, Key Laboratory of Regenerative Biology, South China Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510663, China.', 'Stem Cell and Cancer Biology Group, Key Laboratory of Regenerative Biology, South China Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510663, China.

Previous studies showed that a synthetic peptide spanning an alpha helical domain of p13 alters mitochondrial membrane permeability to cations, resulting in swelling. The present study examined the effects of full-length p13 on isolated, energized mitochondria. Results demonstrated that p13 triggers an inward K(+) current that leads to mitochondrial swelling and confers a crescent-like morphology distinct from that caused by opening of the permeability transition pore. p13 also induces depolarization, with a matching increase in respiratory chain activity, and augments production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). These effects require an intact alpha helical domain and strictly depend on the presence of K(+) in the assay medium. The effects of p13 on ROS are mimicked by the K(+) ionophore valinomycin, while the protonophore FCCP decreases ROS, indicating that depolarization induced by K(+) vs. H(+) currents has different effects on mitochondrial ROS production, possibly because of their opposite effects on matrix pH (alkalinization and acidification, respectively). The downstream consequences of p13-induced mitochondrial K(+) permeability are likely to have an important influence on the redox state and turnover of HTLV-1-infected cells.","['Silic-Benussi, Micol', 'Cannizzaro, Enrica', 'Venerando, Andrea', 'Cavallari, Ilaria', 'Petronilli, Valeria', 'La Rocca, Nicoletta', 'Marin, Oriano', 'Chieco-Bianchi, Luigi', 'Di Lisa, Fabio', ""D'Agostino, Donna M"", 'Bernardi, Paolo', 'Ciminale, Vincenzo']","['Silic-Benussi M', 'Cannizzaro E', 'Venerando A', 'Cavallari I', 'Petronilli V', 'La Rocca N', 'Marin O', 'Chieco-Bianchi L', 'Di Lisa F', ""D'Agostino DM"", 'Bernardi P', 'Ciminale V']","['Department of Oncology and Surgical Sciences, University of Padova, I-35128 Padova, Italy.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090211,Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,IM,"['Calcium/pharmacology', 'Carbonyl Cyanide p-Trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone/pharmacology', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Ionophores/pharmacology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Mitochondrial Membrane Transport Proteins/*metabolism', 'Mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore', 'Mitochondrial Swelling/drug effects', 'Models, Biological', 'Permeability', 'Potassium/*metabolism', 'Potassium Channels/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Valinomycin/pharmacology']",2009/04/16 09:00,2009/08/14 09:00,['2009/04/16 09:00'],"['2008/11/26 00:00 [received]', '2009/01/31 00:00 [revised]', '2009/02/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/04/16 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/14 09:00 [medline]']","['S0005-2728(09)00050-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbabio.2009.02.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2009 Jul;1787(7):947-54. doi: 10.1016/j.bbabio.2009.02.001.

The targeting of the nanosensor is verified with a beta-hexosaminidase assay. It is also demonstrated that the targeted nanosensor is capable of making accurate cellular pH measurements in RBL-2H3 cells, out to ninety minutes after targeted nanosensor addition.

An increased risk of breast cancer among women exposed to benzene has also been suggested. The aim of this study was to analyze breast cancer risk in a cohort of 1,002 women exposed to benzene in a shoe factory in Florence, Italy, where an excess of leukemia in men was reported. METHODS: The cohort of women at work on January 1st, 1950, was followed from 1950 to 2003 for mortality and from 1985 to 2000 for incidence of breast cancer. For a sub-cohort of 797 women, cumulative exposure to benzene was available. RESULTS: Standardized mortality ratios were obtained for the 797 women for whom information on cumulative exposure was available. For those with < 30 years of latency the standardized mortality ratio was 58.5 (95% CI, 18.9-181.2, based on 3 deaths) and 151.1 (95% CI, 78.6-290.3, based on 9 deaths) for > or = 30 years of latency. In the > 40 ppm-year and > or = 30 year latency period category, the standardized mortality ratio was 166.0 (95% CI, 62.3-442.2, based on 4 deaths). The standardized incidence ratio for women with a latency period < 30 years was 140.9 (95% CI, 75.8-261.9, based on 10 cases) and 108.2 (95% CI, 64.1-182.7) for a latency period > or = 30 years.

Chloromas in blastic phase of CML at different body sites have been reported previously. CASE: A 53-year-old African American male presented to his primary care provider with multiple skin nodules. A complete blood cound showed a high white cell count, for which he was transferred to a university tertiary care center. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) of the skin lesion revealed cellular smears consisting of immature myeloid cells of CML. Based on these findings, and with clinical correlation, a preliminary diagnosis of chloroma was made and confirmed by ancillary studies. CONCLUSION: This rare manifestation should alert a clinician to include CML in chronic phase in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with multiple nonpigmented, nonpruritic skin nodules. FNA with ancillary studies can provide a rapid diagnosis.","['Nagarajarao, Harsha Santheshivara', 'Akhtar, Israh', 'Heard, Ken', 'Baliga, Mithra']","['Nagarajarao HS', 'Akhtar I', 'Heard K', 'Baliga M']","['Department ot Internal Medicine, Division of Cytopatology, University of Mississippi Medical Center, 2500 North State Street, Jackson, Mississippi 39216-4505, USA.']",,['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Switzerland,Acta Cytol,Acta cytologica,0370307,IM,"['Biopsy, Fine-Needle', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Sarcoma, Myeloid/genetics/*pathology', 'Skin Neoplasms/genetics/*pathology']",2009/04/16 09:00,2009/05/09 09:00,['2009/04/16 09:00'],"['2009/04/16 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/09 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1159/000325133 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Cytol. 2009 Mar-Apr;53(2):235-8. doi: 10.1159/000325133.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study explored the prevalence and clinical profile of NPM1 mutations in a cohort of 200 Indian adult and children with AML. NPM1 mutations were observed in 19.5% of all population and 34.2% of those with normal karyotype. Adults had a significantly higher incidence of NPM1 mutations than children [38 of 161 (23.6%) vs. 1 of 39 (2.5%), p = 0.002]. NPM1 mutations were significantly associated with normal karyotype (p = 0.001), high WBC count (p = 0.034), AML-M4 subtype (p = 0.039) and a gradient increase of mutation rate with the increase in age groups. Sequence analysis of 39 mutated cases revealed typical mutations (types A, B, D, Nm and H*) as well as two novel variations (types F1 and F2). Majority of the patients had mutation type A (69.2%), followed by B (5.1%), D (15.3%), H* (2.5%) and Nm (2.5%) all involving COOH terminal of the NPM1 protein. In conclusion, this study represents the first report of NPM1 mutation from Indian population and confirms that the incidence of NPM1 mutations varies considerably globally, with slightly lower incidence in Indian population compared to western countries. The current study also served to identify two novel NPM1 mutants that add new insights into the heterogeneity of genomic insertions at exon 12. More ongoing larger studies are warranted to elucidate the molecular pathogenesis of AML that arises in this part of the world. Furthermore, we believe that in light of its high prevalence worldwide, inclusion of NPM1 mutation detection assay in diagnostic evaluations of AML may improve the efficacy of routine genetic characterization and allow assignment of patients to better-defined risk categories.","['Ahmad, Firoz', 'Mandava, Swarna', 'Das, Bibhu Ranjan']","['Ahmad F', 'Mandava S', 'Das BR']","['Research and Development Division, SRL Ranbaxy Ltd., Andheri (E), Mumbai-400093, India.']",,['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Exons/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Global Health', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'India/epidemiology', 'Infant', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Young Adult']",2009/04/15 09:00,2009/06/24 09:00,['2009/04/15 09:00'],"['2009/04/15 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/24 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/hon.883 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2009 Jun;27(2):90-7. doi: 10.1002/hon.883.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Without adequate management, this may cause progressive damage to hepatic, endocrine, and cardiac organs, significantly affecting overall survival. Recent retrospective analyses have suggested that iron chelation provides a survival advantage in iron-overloaded patients with MDS who are given chelation therapy compared with those who are not. Nonetheless, it is evident that iron overload in many patients with MDS is not adequately managed. Clinical evaluation of the once-daily, oral iron chelator deferasirox in MDS populations has indicated that it provides dose-dependent reductions in body iron burden and is generally well tolerated, with a manageable safety profile in adult and pediatric patients. The most common treatment-related adverse events (AEs) included transient, mild-to-moderate gastrointestinal disturbances and skin rash, which rarely required drug discontinuation and resolved spontaneously in most cases. Adequate management of AEs and practical approaches such as patient education and counseling are necessary to ensure that patients remain compliant with therapy. Regular monitoring of serum ferritin levels is key to identifying patients who require iron chelation therapy, and to ensure maintenance of iron levels below the critical level of 1,000 microg/l. The flexible dosing regimen of deferasirox allows dose adjustments to be made in response to trends in serum ferritin, to changes in a patient's transfusional iron intake, and to the objectives of treatment, allowing the full benefit of transfusion therapy without the risks associated with iron overload.","['Jabbour, Elias', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Taher, Ali', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M']","['Jabbour E', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Taher A', 'Kantarjian HM']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX 77030, USA. ejabbour@mdanderson.org']",,['eng'],['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20090413,United States,Oncologist,The oncologist,9607837,IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Benzoates/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Deferasirox', 'Erythrocyte Transfusion/*adverse effects', 'Ferritins/blood', 'Humans', 'Iron/blood', 'Iron Chelating Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Iron Overload/*drug therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications/*therapy', 'Triazoles/adverse effects/*therapeutic use']",2009/04/15 09:00,2009/07/22 09:00,['2009/04/15 09:00'],"['2009/04/15 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/22 09:00 [medline]']","['theoncologist.2008-0154 [pii]', '10.1634/theoncologist.2008-0154 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncologist. 2009 May;14(5):489-96. doi: 10.1634/theoncologist.2008-0154.

However, little is know about the ability of hESC-derived NK cells to mediate an effective in vivo antitumor response. Using bioluminescent imaging, we now demonstrate that H9 line hESC-derived NK cells mediate effective clearance of human tumor cells in vivo. In addition to increased in vitro killing of diverse tumor targets, the in vivo tumor clearance by H9 hESC-derived NK cells was more effective compared with NK cells derived from umbilical cord blood (UCB). Phenotypic analysis demonstrates the hESC-derived NK cells are uniformly CD94+CD117(low/-), an NK-cell population characterized by potent cytolytic activity and thus more competent to mediate tumor clearance. These studies demonstrate that hESCs provide an important model to study human lymphocyte development and may serve as a novel source for antitumor immunotherapy.","['Woll, Petter S', 'Grzywacz, Bartosz', 'Tian, Xinghui', 'Marcus, Rebecca K', 'Knorr, David A', 'Verneris, Michael R', 'Kaufman, Dan S']","['Woll PS', 'Grzywacz B', 'Tian X', 'Marcus RK', 'Knorr DA', 'Verneris MR', 'Kaufman DS']","['Stem Cell Institute and Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.']",,['eng'],['T32 HD060536/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090413,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/immunology', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Fetal Blood/cytology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms/immunology/prevention & control/secondary', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Liver Neoplasms/immunology/prevention & control/secondary', 'Lung Neoplasms/immunology/prevention & control/secondary', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Stromal Cells/immunology']",2009/04/15 09:00,2009/07/17 09:00,['2009/04/15 09:00'],"['2009/04/15 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/17 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)37288-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-06-165225 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Jun 11;113(24):6094-101. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-06-165225.

The authors evaluated residential mobility patterns for a population-based series of childhood leukemia cases enrolled in the Northern California Childhood Leukemia Study. METHODS: Complete residential history from 1 year before birth to date of diagnosis was obtained for 380 cases diagnosed between 1995 and 2002. All residences were assigned U.S. Census block group designations using a geographic information system. RESULTS: Overall, two-thirds (65.8%) of children had moved between birth and diagnosis, and one-third (34.5%) moved during the first year of life. Approximately 25% of the mothers had moved during the year before the child's birth. Multivariable analysis indicated greater residential mobility to be associated with older age of the child at diagnosis, younger age of the mother at child's birth, and lower household income. Among those who had moved, residential urban/rural status for birth and diagnosis residences changed for about 20% of subjects, and neighborhood socioeconomic status for 35%. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that neighborhood attribute estimates in health studies should account for patterns of residential mobility. Estimates based on a single residential location at a single point in time may lead to different inferences.","['Urayama, Kevin Y', 'Von Behren, Julie', 'Reynolds, Peggy', 'Hertz, Andrew', 'Does, Monique', 'Buffler, Patricia A']","['Urayama KY', 'Von Behren J', 'Reynolds P', 'Hertz A', 'Does M', 'Buffler PA']","['School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94704, USA. kurayama@berkeley.edu']",,['eng'],"['R01 CA92674/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P42 ES04705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES009137-10/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES009137/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA092674/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P42 ES004705-210023/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P42 ES004705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES09137/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090411,United States,Ann Epidemiol,Annals of epidemiology,9100013,IM,"['Adolescent', 'California/epidemiology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Environmental Exposure/*statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Interviews as Topic', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Population Dynamics/*statistics & numerical data', 'Pregnancy', 'Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects/epidemiology', 'Prevalence', 'Rural Population/statistics & numerical data', 'Social Class', 'Urban Population/statistics & numerical data']",2009/04/15 09:00,2010/01/08 06:00,['2009/04/15 09:00'],"['2008/11/06 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/13 00:00 [revised]', '2009/03/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/04/15 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/08 06:00 [medline]']","['S1047-2797(09)00072-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.annepidem.2009.03.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Epidemiol. 2009 Nov;19(11):834-40. doi: 10.1016/j.annepidem.2009.03.001.

Studies in SCI patients have shown that for a treatment to be effective it must primarily improve their quality of life. Numerous studies have shown that stem cells represent an alternative treatment for various disorders and have shown promise in several disease/trauma states. For instance, the use of autologous CD34+ stem cells has been shown to ameliorate symptoms of several disorders such as leukemia, cardiomyopathy, diabetes, and several autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis. For the first time, we report eight case studies of SCI (four acute, four chronic) with approximately 2 years of follow-up that were administered bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) via multiple routes: directly into the spinal cord, directly into the spinal canal, and intravenous. Magnetic resonance imaging illustrated morphological changes in the spinal cord of some of the patients following BMSCs administration. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate improvements in ASIA, Barthel (quality of life), Frankel, and Ashworth scoring. Moreover, in order to assess bladder function, we designed a simple numerical clinical scoring system that demonstrates significant changes in bladder function following BMSCs administration.

METHODS: The cultured leukemia HL-60 cells were divided into three groups: control group, TPL group (cells were treated with 5 ng/ml TPL only), and PSCS+TPL cells group (cells treated with 5 ng/ml TPL and 100 microg/ml or 200 microg/ml PSCS for 18 h). Cell viability was tested by MTT assay and apoptotic cells were quantitatively measured by flow cytometry with Annexin V/PI double stain.The expressions of Caspase-3, 6, 7, 9 and NF-kappa B proteins were tested by Western blot. RESULT: MTT assay showed that different concentrations of PSCS inhibited the cell viability. Flow cytometry indicated that TPL markedly increased the apoptosis rate of the HL-60 cells, and PSCS enhanced the apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Western blot showed that TPL did not inhibit the expression of the Caspase-3, 6, 7, 9 and NF-kappa B proteins, and when cells were treated with PSCS, the expression of proteins decreased with the PSCS concentration rising. CONCLUSION: PSCS can enhance TPL-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells and inhibit the expression of NF-kappa B and Caspase 3,6,7,9,which might be the possible signaling pathway of inducing apoptosis.","['Shen, Yue-di', 'Shao, Xue-ting', 'Ni, You-di', 'Xu, Hang', 'Tong, Xiang-min']","['Shen YD', 'Shao XT', 'Ni YD', 'Xu H', 'Tong XM']","['The Clinical Medical School of Hangzhou Normal University, Hangzhou 310036, China.']",,['chi'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhejiang Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,Zhejiang da xue xue bao.

They hold the deaza skeleton of the antitumor drug temozolomide, although preliminary investigations indicated a different mechanism of action. To understand their mechanism(s) of action along with their target at molecular level, four derivatives were selected on the basis of their activity on a panel of human tumor cell lines and they were investigated in depth in a T leukemia cell line (Jurkat). METHODS AND RESULTS: Flow cytometric analysis of cell cycle after treatment with pyrrolotetrazinones has demonstrated that they were able to induce an arrest of the cell cycle in G2/M phase. This effect was accompanied by apoptosis of the treated cells which is further characterized by exposure of phosphatidylserine on the external surface of the cell membranes. Mitochondria were strongly involved in the apoptotic pathway as demonstrated by the induced mitochondrial depolarization, generation of reactive oxygen species, and activation of caspase-3. Western blot analysis showed that Bcl-2 expression was down regulated whereas the proapototic protein Bax was upregulated in a time dependent manner. Moreover, these compounds induced a clear increase in the mitotic index, and inhibited microtubule assembly in vitro indicating that pyrrolotetrazinones, at variance with temozolomide, involved an efficacious inhibition of tubulin polymerization in their mechanism of action. Interestingly compound 3 at the concentration of 50 mg/kg body weight significantly inhibited in vivo the growth of a syngeneic hepatocellular carcinoma in Balb/c mice. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that pyrrolotetrazinones inhibit microtubule polymerization, induce G2/M arrest of cell cycle and cause apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway identifying them as novel effective antimitotic agents with potential for clinical development.","['Viola, Giampietro', 'Cecconet, Laura', 'Leszl, Anna', 'Basso, Giuseppe', 'Brun, Paola', 'Salvador, Alessia', ""Dall'Acqua, Francesco"", 'Diana, Patrizia', 'Barraja, Paola', 'Cirrincione, Girolamo']","['Viola G', 'Cecconet L', 'Leszl A', 'Basso G', 'Brun P', 'Salvador A', ""Dall'Acqua F"", 'Diana P', 'Barraja P', 'Cirrincione G']","['Dipartimento di Scienze Farmaceutiche, University of Padova, Padua, Italy. giampietro.viola.1@unipd.it']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090411,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/drug therapy/pathology', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dacarbazine/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Gene Expression/drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Male', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Microtubules/chemistry/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylserines/metabolism', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Temozolomide', 'Tubulin/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Tubulin Modulators/chemistry/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/genetics/metabolism']",2009/04/14 09:00,2009/09/18 06:00,['2009/04/14 09:00'],"['2008/09/23 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/04/14 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00280-009-0994-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2009 Nov;64(6):1235-51. doi: 10.1007/s00280-009-0994-9.

We describe 15 consecutive patients (median age 69 years, range 60-75 years) with MDS (n=10) or AML (n=5) who all received first-line treatment with DAC and subsequent allografting (from sibling donor in four patients, unrelated donor in 11) after reduced-intensity conditioning with the FBM regimen.

A comprehensive diagnostic approach is needed, which combines cytomorphology, cytogenetics, FISH, molecular genetics and immunophenotyping. Whereas the categorization in three prognostic karyotype groups is well established, rare recurrent aberrations as the unfavorable t(8;16)(p11;p13), inv(3)(q21q26) and t(6;9)(p23;q34) must also be considered. In normal karyotype, PCR analyses reveal prognostically relevant mutations in >85% of cases, and a molecular data set composed of the FLT3-ITD, MLL-PTD, NPM1 and CEBPA mutations was found able to guide the selection of patients for allo-SCT. Some novel markers as the WT1 mutations might further contribute to risk stratification in normal karyotype. The panel of minimal residual disease parameters is being expanded at this time, for example, by quantitative PCR for the NPM1 mutations. Immunophenotyping allows the definition of leukemia-associated phenotypes in nearly all cases, but its position in the indication to allo-SCT has to be validated. Thus, the optimization of the indication to allo-SCT is an ongoing process that should remain in continuous interaction with the increasing panel of known genetic markers and diagnostic methods.","['Bacher, U', 'Haferlach, C', 'Schnittger, S', 'Kern, W', 'Kroeger, N', 'Zander, A R', 'Haferlach, T']","['Bacher U', 'Haferlach C', 'Schnittger S', 'Kern W', 'Kroeger N', 'Zander AR', 'Haferlach T']","['Clinic for Stem Cell Transplantation, University Cancer Center Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany. u.bacher@uke.de']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20090413,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Cytodiagnosis', 'Diagnostic Techniques and Procedures', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2009/04/14 09:00,2009/08/20 09:00,['2009/04/14 09:00'],"['2009/04/14 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/20 09:00 [medline]']","['bmt200954 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2009.54 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2009 May;43(10):745-56. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2009.54.

In this retrospective study, we analyzed 805 adult patients from the Italian Registry receiving HSCT for a haematological malignancy from January 1999 to June 2006 and correlated the degree of HLA matching with transplant outcome. All patient-donor pairs had high-resolution typing at HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1 and -DQB1. There was a significantly higher risk of overall mortality, non-relapse mortality, graft failure and acute GVHD (aGVHD) for patients receiving HSCT from an unrelated donor with one or more low- or high-resolution mismatch/es (Mm/s). When only a single HLA Mm is present (9/10 matched pairs), mortality risk is higher than among 10/10 matched pairs in patients transplanted with acute leukaemia in the first CR ('early' patients) but not in the other patients (advanced patients): HR=1.69, 95% CI=0.94-3.02, P=0.08; HR=1.03, 95% CI=0.80-1.32, P=0.82, for early and advanced patients, respectively. These results confirm that the advantage of a 10/10 match has a greater effect in early patients, thus suggesting that a 9/10 matched donor can be chosen in patients with advanced disease lacking a rapidly available 10/10 matched one.","['Crocchiolo, R', 'Ciceri, F', 'Fleischhauer, K', 'Oneto, R', 'Bruno, B', 'Pollichieni, S', 'Sacchi, N', 'Sormani, M P', 'Fanin, R', 'Bandini, G', 'Bonifazi, F', 'Bosi, A', 'Rambaldi, A', 'Alessandrino, P E', 'Falda, M', 'Bacigalupo, A']","['Crocchiolo R', 'Ciceri F', 'Fleischhauer K', 'Oneto R', 'Bruno B', 'Pollichieni S', 'Sacchi N', 'Sormani MP', 'Fanin R', 'Bandini G', 'Bonifazi F', 'Bosi A', 'Rambaldi A', 'Alessandrino PE', 'Falda M', 'Bacigalupo A']","['Department of Oncology, Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, S Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy. crocchiolo.roberto@hsr.it']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090413,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'HLA Antigens/genetics/*immunology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/immunology/*surgery', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Histocompatibility Testing/methods', 'Humans', 'Italy', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Tissue Donors', '*Transplantation Immunology', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2009/04/14 09:00,2010/03/03 06:00,['2009/04/14 09:00'],"['2009/04/14 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/03 06:00 [medline]']","['bmt200967 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2009.67 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2009 Nov;44(9):571-7. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2009.67.

Although a growing body of evidence demonstrates that the ALT mechanism is a post-replicative telomere recombination process, molecular details of this pathway are largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that MUS81, a DNA structure specific recombination endonuclease, has a key role in the maintenance of telomeres in human ALT cells. We find that MUS81 specifically localizes to ALT-associated promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) nuclear bodies (APBs) and associates with telomeric DNA in ALT cells, which is enriched during the G2 phase of the cell cycle. Depletion of MUS81 results in the reduction of ALT-specific telomere recombination and leads to proliferation arrest of ALT cells. In addition, the endonuclease activity of MUS81 is required for recombination-based ALT cell survival, and the interaction of MUS81 with the telomeric repeat-binding factor TRF2 regulates this enzymatic activity, thereby maintaining telomere recombination. Thus, our results suggest that MUS81 is involved in the maintenance of ALT cell survival at least in part by homologous recombination of telomeres.","['Zeng, Sicong', 'Xiang, Tao', 'Pandita, Tej K', 'Gonzalez-Suarez, Ignacio', 'Gonzalo, Susana', 'Harris, Curtis C', 'Yang, Qin']","['Zeng S', 'Xiang T', 'Pandita TK', 'Gonzalez-Suarez I', 'Gonzalo S', 'Harris CC', 'Yang Q']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, 4511 Forest Park, St. Louis, MO 63108, USA.']",,['eng'],"['CA10445/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA104457-040002/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS034746-06S1/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA104457-050002/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS034746/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA123232-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA123232/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA123232/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'Z01 BC005795-13/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA104457/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA129537/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090412,England,Nat Cell Biol,Nature cell biology,100890575,IM,"['Animals', 'Biocatalysis', 'Cell Cycle/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleolus/metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Endodeoxyribonucleases/metabolism', 'Endonucleases/*physiology', 'G2 Phase/physiology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Protein Binding/drug effects/physiology', 'RNA Interference', 'Recombination, Genetic/*physiology', 'Sister Chromatid Exchange/physiology', 'Telomerase/genetics', 'Telomere/*genetics/metabolism', 'Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 2/genetics/metabolism/pharmacology']",2009/04/14 09:00,2009/06/03 09:00,['2009/04/14 09:00'],"['2008/11/13 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/04/14 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/03 09:00 [medline]']","['ncb1867 [pii]', '10.1038/ncb1867 [doi]']",ppublish,Nat Cell Biol. 2009 May;11(5):616-23. doi: 10.1038/ncb1867.

We show here that chronic, low-level treatment with HU induces a variety of defects in telomere replication and maintenance. HU treatment preferentially decreased the rate of telomere DNA synthesis and altered the cell cycle timing of telomere replication. HU reduced the expression levels of telomere repeat RNA (TERRA). In some cells, HU caused a rapid loss of telomere restriction fragment length. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay indicated that telomere repeat binding factors TRF1 and TRF2 dissociate from telomere DNA after HU treatment. TRF2 protein purified from HU treated cells showed a modest reduction in DNA binding activity and a change in isoelectric point as measured by 2D gel electrophoresis. However, chronic low level HU treatment did not evoke a DNA replication checkpoint response, suggesting that the mechanism of action is distinct from the well-characterized S-phase checkpoint pathway. We conclude that therapeutic doses of HU preferentially effects telomere replication and maintenance, through a mechanism that may involve the direct modification of TRF2.

Despite the rapid cytoreduction achieved, serious acute and late complications are frequent, and resistance to chemotherapy develops. During the past decade, new strategies to kill cancer cells by nonapoptotic mechanisms have flourished and many mediators of alternate cell death pathways have been identified. In the present study we have evaluated the efficacy of an mTOR inhibitor, RAD001 (Everolimus), to induce autophagy in an in vivo model of childhood ALL. In particular we found that RAD001 increased Beclin 1 expression, the conversion of the soluble form of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) to the autophagic vesicle-associated form LC3-II and the occurence of lysosomes/autophagosomes. Focal degradation of cytoplasmic areas sequestered by autophagic structures was demonstrated by electron microscopy. This effect was associated with massive reduction of leukemic mass and a strong survival advantage for mice treated with RAD001. The discovery of alternative pathways involved in cell death execution and the role that it plays in leukemia suggest mTOR inhibitors should be included in future chemotherapy protocols of ALL.","['Crazzolara, Roman', 'Bradstock, Kenneth F', 'Bendall, Linda J']","['Crazzolara R', 'Bradstock KF', 'Bendall LJ']","['Department of Pediatrics, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090723,United States,Autophagy,Autophagy,101265188,IM,"['Animals', 'Autophagy/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Everolimus', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Sirolimus/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Tumor Burden/drug effects']",2009/04/14 09:00,2009/09/17 06:00,['2009/04/14 09:00'],"['2009/04/14 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/17 06:00 [medline]']","['8507 [pii]', '10.4161/auto.5.5.8507 [doi]']",ppublish,Autophagy. 2009 Jul;5(5):727-8. doi: 10.4161/auto.5.5.8507.

IM-induced autophagy did not involve c-Abl or Bcl-2 activity but was associated with ER stress and was suppressed by depletion of intracellular Ca2+, suggesting it is mechanistically nonoverlapping with IM-induced apoptosis. We further demonstrated that suppression of autophagy using either pharmacological inhibitors or RNA interference of essential autophagy genes enhanced cell death induced by IM in cell lines and primary CML cells. Critically, the combination of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), i.e., IM, nilotinib, or dasatinib, with inhibitors of autophagy resulted in near complete elimination of phenotypically and functionally defined CML stem cells.

In humans, prolonged and/or high dose exposure to arsenic can have a variety of outcomes, including the development of malignancies, severe gastrointestinal toxicities, diabetes, cardiac arrhythmias, and death. On the other hand, one arsenic derivative, arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)), has important antitumor properties. This agent is a potent inducer of antileukemic responses, and it is now approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia in humans. The promise and therapeutic potential of arsenic and its various derivatives have been exploited for hundreds of years. Remarkably, research focused on the potential use of arsenic compounds in the treatment of human diseases remains highly promising, and it is an area of active investigation. An emerging approach of interest and therapeutic potential involves efforts to target and block cellular pathways activated in a negative feedback manner during treatment of cells with As(2)O(3). Such an approach may ultimately provide the means to selectively enhance the suppressive effects of this agent on malignant cells and render normally resistant tumors sensitive to its antineoplastic properties.","['Platanias, Leonidas C']",['Platanias LC'],"['Robert H.

The sensor is based on the use of the ion-association complex of 4-NPP anion with nickel(II)-bathophenanthroline cation as an electroactive material and nitrophenyloctyl ether (NPOE) as a solvent mediator. The sensor displays good selectivity and stability and demonstrates a near-Nernstian response for 4-NPP over the concentration range 9.6x10(-6) to 1.0x10(-2) M with an anionic slope of 28.6+/-0.3 mV decade(-1) and a detection limit of 6.3x10(-6) M over the pH range 4.5-10. The sensor is used to measure the decrease of a fixed concentration of 4-NPP substrate as a function of acid and alkaline phosphatase enzyme activities at optimized conditions of pH and temperature. A linear relationship between the initial rate of 4-NPP substrate hydrolysis and enzyme activity holds over 0.05-3.0 and 0.03-3.4 IU L(-1) of ACP and ALP enzymes, respectively. Validation of the method by measuring the lower detection limit, range, accuracy, precision, within-day repeatability and between-day-variability reveals good performance characteristics of the proposed sensor. The sensor is used for the determination of acid and alkaline phosphatase enzyme activities in biological fluids of some patients suffering from alcoholic cirrhosis, acute myelocytic leukemia, pre-eclampsia and prostatic cancer. The sensor is also utilized for assessment of alkaline phosphatase enzyme in milk and dairy products.

This gene product is necessary and sufficient to explain the chronic phase of CML. The only known cause of CML is radiation exposure leading to a mutation of at least one HSC, although the vast majority of patients with CML do not have a history of radiation exposure. Nonetheless, in humans, significant radiation exposure (after exposure to atomic bomb fallout) leads to disease diagnosis in 3-5 years. In murine models, disease dynamics are much faster and CML is fatal over the span of a few months. Our objective is to develop a model that accounts for CML across all mammals. In the following, we combine a model of CML dynamics in humans with allometric scaling of hematopoiesis across mammals to illustrate the natural history of chronic phase CML in various mammals. We show how a single cell can lead to a fatal illness in mice and humans but a higher burden of CML stem cells is necessary to induce disease in larger mammals such as elephants. The different dynamics of the disease is rationalized in terms of mammalian mass.

Despite excellent penetration of fluconazole into the joint fluid and reports of successful outcome in patients with native joint cryptococcal infections as well as prosthetic joint infections due to Candida spp., suppressive fluconazole therapy failed.

Then, an electrochemical DNA biosensor was developed for detection of PML/RARA fusion gene in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) by using 18-mer single-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid as the capture probe. The capture probe was covalently attached through free amines on the DNA bases using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) and N-hydrosulfosuccinimide (NHS) cross-linking reaction on a carboxylate-terminated poly-CCA monolayer modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE). The covalent immobilized capture probe could selectively hybridize with its target DNA to form double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) on GCE surface. The aim of this work is to provide a well-defined recognition interface for the detection of DNA. Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) was used to monitor the hybridization reaction on the capture probe electrode. The decrease of the peak current of methylene blue (MB), an electroactive indicator, was observed upon hybridization of the probe with the target DNA. The results indicated that in pH 7.0 phosphate buffer solution (PBS), the oxidation peak current was linear with the concentration of complementary strand in the range of 1.0 x 10(-12) to 1.0 x 10(-11)M with a detection limit of 6.7 x 10(-13)M. This new method demonstrates its excellent specificity for single-base mismatch and complementary sequence (dsDNA) after hybridization, and it would be proposed to use in real sample.","['Wei, Na', 'Chen, Jinghua', 'Zhang, Jing', 'Wang, Kun', 'Xu, Xiongwei', 'Lin, Jianhua', 'Li, Guangwen', 'Lin, Xinhua', 'Chen, Yuanzhong']","['Wei N', 'Chen J', 'Zhang J', 'Wang K', 'Xu X', 'Lin J', 'Li G', 'Lin X', 'Chen Y']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Analysis, Fujian Medical University, 88 Jiaotong Road, Fuzhou 350004, China.']",,['eng'],,"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090115,Netherlands,Talanta,Talanta,2984816R,IM,"['Animals', 'Biosensing Techniques/instrumentation/*methods/standards', 'DNA Probes', 'Electrochemical Techniques', 'Electrodes', '*Genes, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/diagnosis', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics']",2009/04/14 09:00,2009/07/31 09:00,['2009/04/14 09:00'],"['2008/09/02 00:00 [received]', '2008/12/23 00:00 [revised]', '2008/12/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/04/14 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/31 09:00 [medline]']","['S0039-9140(09)00010-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.talanta.2008.12.053 [doi]']",ppublish,Talanta. 2009 Jun 15;78(4-5):1227-34. doi: 10.1016/j.talanta.2008.12.053.

PATIENT(S): There were 28 patients with adenomyosis and 27 control fertile women. INTERVENTION(S): Uterine flushing fluid and endometrial samples were collected during the implantation window, defined as 7 to 9 days after ovulation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Leukemia inhibitory factor levels in uterine flushing fluid were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Leukemia inhibitory factor messenger RNA expression in eutopic endometrium was quantified by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Leukemia inhibitory factor protein expression was evaluated with semiquantitative immunohistochemistry. RESULT(S): Leukemia inhibitory factor levels were significantly lower in the uterine flushing fluid of patients with adenomyosis with a history of infertility. Leukemia inhibitory factor messenger RNA and protein also were significantly lower in patients with adenomyosis, compared with control. Leukemia inhibitory factor immunostaining intensity was significantly lower in patients with adenomyosis, compared with control.

However, the mapping of receptor distribution and the monitoring of ligand-receptor interactions on live cells in a spatially and temporally ordered manner are challenging tasks. In this paper, we apply fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) to map receptor densities on live cell membranes by introducing fluorescently marked aptamer molecules, which specifically bind to certain cell-surface receptors. The femtoliter-sized (0.4 fL) observation volume created by FCS allows fluorescent-aptamer detection down to 2 molecules and appears to be an ideal and highly sensitive biophysical tool for studying molecular interactions on live cells. Fluorophore-labeled aptamers were chosen for receptor recognition because of their high binding affinity and specificity. Aptamer sgc8, generated for specific cell recognition by a process called cell systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment, was determined by FCS to have a binding affinity in the picomolar range (dissociation constant K(d)=790+/-150 pM) with its target membrane receptor, human protein tyrosine kinase-7 (PTK7), a potential cancer biomarker. We then constructed a cellular model and applied this aptamer-receptor interaction to estimate receptor densities and distributions on the cell surface. Specifically, different expression levels of PTK7 were studied by using human leukemia CCRF-CEM cells (1300+/-190 receptors microm(-2)) and HeLa cervical cancer cells (550+/-90 receptors microm(-2)). Competition studies with excess nonlabeled aptamers and proteinase treatment studies proved the validity of the density-estimation approach. With its intrinsic advantages of direct measurement, high sensitivity, fast analysis, and single-cell measurement, this FCS density-estimation approach holds potential for future applications in molecular-interaction studies and density estimations for subcellular structures and membrane receptors.","['Chen, Yan', 'Munteanu, Alina C', 'Huang, Yu-Fen', 'Phillips, Joseph', 'Zhu, Zhi', 'Mavros, Michael', 'Tan, Weihong']","['Chen Y', 'Munteanu AC', 'Huang YF', 'Phillips J', 'Zhu Z', 'Mavros M', 'Tan W']","['Department of Chemistry, Shands Cancer Center, UF Genetics Institute, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611, USA.']",,['eng'],['R01 GM079359/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,Germany,Chemistry,"Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",9513783,IM,"['Aptamers, Nucleotide/chemistry', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'SELEX Aptamer Technique/*methods', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence/*methods']",2009/04/11 09:00,2009/07/23 09:00,['2009/04/11 09:00'],"['2009/04/11 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/23 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/chem.200802305 [doi]'],ppublish,Chemistry. 2009;15(21):5327-36. doi: 10.1002/chem.200802305.,"['0 (Aptamers, Nucleotide)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)']",,,,PMC5525150,['NIHMS877280'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Potential target genes for these microRNAs were identified using computer tools, which included several autism susceptibility genes. Our preliminary results indicate microRNAs should be considered and evaluated in the etiology of autism. In addition, analysis of this class of noncoding RNAs in lymphoblastoid cells has the potential to reveal at least a subset of brain-related microRNAs implicated in autism.

In the appropriate patient with biologically aggressive disease, such as receptor poor breast cancer, it is reasonable to consider combination chemotherapy as part of an adjuvant program. If this approach is to be employed, the physician must also consider the patient's co-morbid conditions and status of function in society as potential indicators of toxicity or lack of benefit. In this case, a formal geriatric assessment is of value. A Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) trial of monotherapy vs combination cytotoxic therapy as adjuvant treatment for localized breast cancer patients over 65 years of age has determined that the combination approach is superior to single agent therapy. In an unplanned analysis of receptor rich and receptor poor tumors, the patients with receptor poor tumors seemed to achieve the greatest benefit from combination cytotoxic therapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy can also be considered for patients with high-risk receptor rich breast cancers. However, the use of chemotherapy in the elderly patient with breast cancer is largely based upon data emerging from trials in younger patients. Studies specifically for patients over 65 years of age are urgently needed in this population to provide evidence-based proof of the current approach.","['Leung, Mary', 'Shapira, Iulianna', 'Bradley, Thomas', 'Budman, Daniel R']","['Leung M', 'Shapira I', 'Bradley T', 'Budman DR']","['Don Monti Division of Oncology, Monter Cancer Center, New York University, 450 Lakeville Road, Lake Success, NY 11042, USA.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20090410,United States,Curr Treat Options Oncol,Current treatment options in oncology,100900946,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant/*methods', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Comorbidity', 'Early Detection of Cancer', 'Female', 'Geriatric Assessment', 'Humans', 'Medical Oncology/methods', 'Middle Aged']",2009/04/11 09:00,2010/01/12 06:00,['2009/04/11 09:00'],"['2009/01/14 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/04/11 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11864-009-0092-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Treat Options Oncol. 2009 Aug;10(3-4):144-58. doi: 10.1007/s11864-009-0092-6.

Our data suggest that Gfi1b may be an important factor to establish or maintain myeloid leukemia and myeloproliferative diseases and that, high expression levels of Gfi1b might be associated with the emergence of Philadelphia chromosome negative myeloid malignancies after imatinib withdrawal or after the development of imatinib resistance.","['Vassen, Lothar', 'Khandanpour, Cyrus', 'Ebeling, Peter', 'van der Reijden, Bert A', 'Jansen, Joop H', 'Mahlmann, Stefan', 'Duhrsen, Ulrich', 'Moroy, Tarik']","['Vassen L', 'Khandanpour C', 'Ebeling P', 'van der Reijden BA', 'Jansen JH', 'Mahlmann S', 'Duhrsen U', 'Moroy T']","['Institut fur Zellbiologie (Tumorforschung), IFZ, Universitatsklinikum Essen, Virchowstrasse 173, 45122, Essen, Germany.', 'Institut de recherches cliniques de Montreal, IRCM, 110 Avenue des Pins West, Montreal, QC, H2W 1R7, Canada.', 'Institut fur Zellbiologie (Tumorforschung), IFZ, Universitatsklinikum Essen, Virchowstrasse 173, 45122, Essen, Germany.', 'Institut de recherches cliniques de Montreal, IRCM, 110 Avenue des Pins West, Montreal, QC, H2W 1R7, Canada.', 'Department for Internal Medicine, Center for Cancer Research, Universitatsklinikum Essen, 45122, Essen, Germany.', 'Central Hematology Laboratory, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre for Molecular Life Sciences (NCMLS), PO Box 9101, 6500 HB, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Central Hematology Laboratory, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre for Molecular Life Sciences (NCMLS), PO Box 9101, 6500 HB, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and Hematology, Universitatsklinikum Essen, 45122, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and Hematology, Universitatsklinikum Essen, 45122, Essen, Germany.', 'Institut fur Zellbiologie (Tumorforschung), IFZ, Universitatsklinikum Essen, Virchowstrasse 173, 45122, Essen, Germany.

Patients received 2-h infusions of GO twice with an interval of approximately 14 days. Tolerability was assessed using the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria Version 2.0. Samples for pharmacokinetics were taken on day 1 and day 8 of the first treatment cycle. The dose was increased stepwise and, in each cohort, patients were treated at the same dose. Forty patients, median age 58 years (range 28-68) were treated; 20 and 20 patients were enrolled to the phase I and II parts, respectively. In the phase I part, dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were hepatotoxicities, and the recommended dose was established as 9 mg/m2 given as two intravenous infusions separated by approximately 14 days. The pharmacokinetic study revealed that Cmax and AUC were equivalent to those of non-Japanese patients. In the phase II part, complete remission was observed in 5 patients, and one patient had complete remission without platelet recovery. Four of these 6 in remission and one in the phase I are long-term survivors (alive for at least 44 months). GO is safe and effective as a single agent among Japanese CD33-positive AML patients. Remission lasted longer in a subset of patients than in non-Japanese patients in earlier studies. Further studies of this agent are warranted to establish standard therapy.","['Kobayashi, Yukio', 'Tobinai, Kensei', 'Takeshita, Akihiro', 'Naito, Kensuke', 'Asai, Osamu', 'Dobashi, Nobuaki', 'Furusawa, Shinpei', 'Saito, Kenji', 'Mitani, Kinuko', 'Morishima, Yasuo', 'Ogura, Michinori', 'Yoshiba, Fumiaki', 'Hotta, Tomomitsu', 'Bessho, Masami', 'Matsuda, Shin', 'Takeuchi, Jin', 'Miyawaki, Shuichi', 'Naoe, Tomoki', 'Usui, Noriko', 'Ohno, Ryuzo']","['Kobayashi Y', 'Tobinai K', 'Takeshita A', 'Naito K', 'Asai O', 'Dobashi N', 'Furusawa S', 'Saito K', 'Mitani K', 'Morishima Y', 'Ogura M', 'Yoshiba F', 'Hotta T', 'Bessho M', 'Matsuda S', 'Takeuchi J', 'Miyawaki S', 'Naoe T', 'Usui N', 'Ohno R']","['Hematology Division, National Cancer Center Hospital, 5-1-1 Tsukiji, Chuo-ku, Tokyo, 104-0045, Japan. ykkobaya@ncc.go.jp.', 'Hematology Division, National Cancer Center Hospital, 5-1-1 Tsukiji, Chuo-ku, Tokyo, 104-0045, Japan.', 'The Third Department of Internal Medicine, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Hamamatsu, Japan.', 'The Third Department of Internal Medicine, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Hamamatsu, Japan.', 'Hamamatsu Medical Center, Hamamatsu, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Oncology and Hematology, School of Medicine, The Jikei University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Oncology and Hematology, School of Medicine, The Jikei University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Dokkyo Medical School of Medicine, Tochigi, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Dokkyo Medical School of Medicine, Tochigi, Japan.', 'Saito Clinic, Tochigi, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Dokkyo Medical School of Medicine, Tochigi, Japan.', 'Hematology and Cell Therapy Division, Aichi Cancer Center Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Hematology and Cell Therapy Division, Aichi Cancer Center Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Nagoya Daini Red Cross Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Tokai University School of Medicine, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Tokai University School of Medicine, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'National Nagoya Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Saitama Medical University, School of Medicine, Saitama, Japan.', 'Center for Hematopoietic Disorders, Ohta Nishinouchi Hospital, Koriyama, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Rheumatology, Nihon University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Leukemia Treatment Center, Saiseikai Maebashi Hospital, Maebashi, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Oncology and Hematology, School of Medicine, The Jikei University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Hematology and Cell Therapy Division, Aichi Cancer Center Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Aichi Shukutoku University, Nagoya, Japan.']",,['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090410,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aminoglycosides/adverse effects/immunology/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/adverse effects/immunology/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antigens, CD/*immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/*immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/immunology/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*immunology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Gemtuzumab', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3']",2009/04/11 09:00,2009/06/23 09:00,['2009/04/11 09:00'],"['2008/07/09 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/02/04 00:00 [revised]', '2009/04/11 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/23 09:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12185-009-0298-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-009-0298-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2009 May;89(4):460-469. doi: 10.1007/s12185-009-0298-1.

WNT2B is expressed in several types of human cancer, such as basal cell carcinoma, gastric cancer, breast cancer, head/neck squamous cell carcinoma, cervical cancer and leukemia. WNT2B is one of canonical WNTs transducing signals through Frizzled (FZD) and LRP5/LRP6 receptors to beta-catenin-TCF/LEF signaling cascade. Here, refined integrative genomic analyses on WNT2B orthologs were carried out to elucidate its transcriptional mechanisms. GLI-, double FOX-, HES/HEY-, bHLH-, and Sp1-binding sites within mammalian WNT2B promoter were well conserved. Because GLI1, FOXA2, FOXC2, FOXE1, FOXF1 and FOXL1 are direct target genes of Hedgehog-GLI2 signaling cascade, Hedgehog signals should induce WNT2B upregulation through GLI family members as well as FOX family members. Notch, BMP and Hedgehog signals inhibit WNT2B expression via HES/HEY-binding to N-box, whereas BMP and WNT signals inhibit bHLH transcription factor-induced WNT2B expression via ID1, ID2, ID3, MSX1 or MSX2. Together these facts indicate that Hedgehog signals and bHLH transcription factors are involved in WNT2B upregulation, which is counteracted by BMP, WNT and Notch signals. Mesenchymal BMP induces IHH expression in gastrointestinal epithelial cells, and then epithelial Hedgehog induces WNT2B and BMP4 expression in mesenchymal cells. NF-kappaB signals induce SHH upregulation, and WNT2B is upregulated in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). BMP-IHH and inflammation-SHH signaling loops are involved in WNT2B up-regulation during embryogenesis, adult tissue homeostasis, and carcinogenesis.","['Katoh, Masuko', 'Katoh, Masaru']","['Katoh M', 'Katoh M']","['M&M Medical BioInformatics, Hongo 113-0033, Japan. mkatoh-kkr@umin.ac.jp']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Bone Morphogenetic Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Computational Biology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Regulatory Networks/physiology', 'Glycoproteins/*genetics', 'Hedgehog Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Receptors, Notch/metabolism/*physiology', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Wnt Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology']",2009/04/11 09:00,2009/08/04 09:00,['2009/04/11 09:00'],"['2009/04/11 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/04 09:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2009 May;34(5):1411-5.,"['0 (Bone Morphogenetic Proteins)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Hedgehog Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '0 (WNT2B protein, human)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mouse and human bone marrow were subjected to colony forming (CFU-GM) assays over a 5-log concentration range in culture. NCI-60 cell line screening data were compared. In vivo, a range of clofarabine doses was compared with fludarabine for efficacy in several human tumor xenografts. The IC90 concentrations for fludarabine and cladribine for mouse CFU-GM were >30 and 0.93 microM, and for human CFU-GM were 8 and 0.11 microM, giving mouse to human differentials of >3.8- and 8.5-fold. Clofarabine produced IC90s of 1.7 microM in mouse and 0.51 microM in human CFU-GM, thus a 3.3-fold differential between species. In the NCI-60 cell line screen, fludarabine and cladribine showed selective cytotoxicity toward leukemia cell lines while for clofarabine there was no apparent selectivity based upon origin of the tumor cells. In vivo, clofarabine produced a dose-dependent increase in tumor growth delay in the RL lymphoma, the RPMI-8226 multiple myeloma, and HT-29 colon carcinoma models. The PC3 prostate carcinoma was equally responsive to clofarabine and fludarabine.

Because siglecs are endocytic receptors, they are well suited for a 'Trojan horse' strategy, whereby therapeutic agents conjugated to an antibody, or multimeric glycan ligand, bind to the siglec and are efficiently carried into the cell. Although the rapid internalization of unmodified siglec antibodies reduces their utility for induction of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity or complement-mediated cytotoxicity, antibody binding of Siglec-8, Siglec-9 and CD22 has been demonstrated to induce apoptosis of eosinophils, neutrophils and depletion of B cells, respectively.

Using a short probe-based microarray comparative genomic hybridization (mCGH) technology, we identified a common microdeletion cluster in 7q21.3 subband, which is adjacent to 'hot deletion region' thus far identified by conventional methods. This common microdeletion cluster contains three poorly characterized genes; Samd9, Samd9L, and a putative gene LOC253012, which we named Miki. Gene copy number assessment of three genes by real-time PCR revealed heterozygous deletion of these three genes in adult patients with AML and MDS at high frequency, in addition to JMML patients. Miki locates to mitotic spindles and centrosomes and downregulation of Miki by RNA interference induced abnormalities in mitosis and nuclear morphology, similar to myelodysplasia. In addition, a recent report indicated Samd9 as a tumor suppressor. These findings indicate the usefulness of the short probe-based CGH to detect microdeletions.

The myeloid leukaemia protein SET/TAF-Ibeta belongs to the NAP1 family of histone chaperones and participates in several chromatin-based mechanisms, such as chromatin assembly, nucleosome reorganisation and transcriptional activation. To better understand the histone chaperone function of SET/TAF-Ibeta, we designed several SET/TAF-Ibeta truncations, examined their structural integrity by circular Dichroism and assessed qualitatively and quantitatively the histone binding properties of wild-type protein and mutant forms using GST-pull down experiments and fluorescence spectroscopy-based binding assays. RESULTS: Wild type SET/TAF-Ibeta binds to histones H2B and H3 with Kd values of 2.87 and 0.15 microM, respectively. The preferential binding of SET/TAF-Ibeta to histone H3 is mediated by its central region and the globular part of H3. On the contrary, the acidic C-terminal tail and the amino-terminal dimerisation domain of SET/TAF-Ibeta, as well as the H3 amino-terminal tail, are dispensable for this interaction. CONCLUSION: This type of analysis allowed us to assess the relative affinities of SET/TAF-Ibeta for different histones and identify the domains of the protein required for effective histone recognition. Our findings are consistent with recent structural studies of SET/TAF-Ibeta and can be valuable to understand the role of SET/TAF-Ibeta in chromatin function.","['Karetsou, Zoe', 'Emmanouilidou, Anastasia', 'Sanidas, Ioannis', 'Liokatis, Stamatis', 'Nikolakaki, Eleni', 'Politou, Anastasia S', 'Papamarcaki, Thomais']","['Karetsou Z', 'Emmanouilidou A', 'Sanidas I', 'Liokatis S', 'Nikolakaki E', 'Politou AS', 'Papamarcaki T']","['Laboratory of Biological Chemistry, Medical School, University of Ioannina, 451 10 Ioannina, Greece. zkarets@cc.uoi.gr']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090409,England,BMC Biochem,BMC biochemistry,101084098,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Circular Dichroism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Histone Chaperones', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Molecular Chaperones/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutant Proteins/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/*metabolism']",2009/04/11 09:00,2009/06/03 09:00,['2009/04/11 09:00'],"['2008/10/24 00:00 [received]', '2009/04/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/04/11 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/03 09:00 [medline]']","['1471-2091-10-10 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2091-10-10 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Biochem. 2009 Apr 9;10:10. doi: 10.1186/1471-2091-10-10.,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histone Chaperones)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (SET protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,PMC2676315,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we examined the effects of RNA interference-mediated FAK silencing on leukemogenesis induced by a BCR/ABL-transformed cell line. Transduction of BCR/ABL-BaF3 cells with FAK shRNA inhibited FAK expression and reduced STAT5 phosphorylation, but induced caspase-3 activation. In vitro studies showed that treatment with FAK shRNA resulted in impaired cell proliferation and colony formation, while increasing cell apoptosis. Mice that received transplants of BCR/ABL-BaF3 cells with FAK shRNA displayed significantly prolonged survival time and diminished leukemia progression. In addition, FAK silencing enhanced in vitro and in vivo efficacy of ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib in BCR/ABL-BaF3 cells.

This study reviews retrospectively cases of lymphoreticular diseases seen at a tertiary institution in Nigeria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective study in which biopsies from the bone marrow, spleen, lymph nodes and extranodal lymphoid tissues reported within a period of 16 years were reviewed with respect to age, sex and pathological diagnosis. Statistical analysis was performed for differences in proportion using Chi square by SPSS version 12. RESULTS: Nine hundred and forty four cases comprising 559 biopsies from lymph nodes and extranodal lymphoid tissues, 272 bone marrow biopsies and 113 spleen biopsies were studied. Non Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and tuberculosis were the most common lesions in lymph nodes and extranodal lymphoid tissues. The axillary and cervical nodes accounted for most cases of metastasis. Breast cancer accounted for the majority of metastasis to lymph nodes. The most common pathological changes in bone marrow were NHL and reactive hyperplasia. Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) had the highest mean age, which was significantly higher than in those with NHL (p=.001, 95% confidence interval -27.91 to -7.76). The most common finding in the spleen was splenic rupture and haemoperitoneum from road traffic accident. CONCLUSION: NHL and tuberculosis should be high on the list of differential diagnosis of lymphadenopathy in Nigerians. Whereas trauma from RTA was the major reason for splenectomy in Nigerians, in the elderly splenic biopsy would likely show CLL.","['Adelusola, Kayode A', 'Sabageh, Donatus O', 'Ukah, Cornelius O']","['Adelusola KA', 'Sabageh DO', 'Ukah CO']","['Department of Morbid Anatomy and Forensic Medicine, Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Nigeria. kadelman02@yahoo.com']",,['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,Uganda,Afr Health Sci,African health sciences,101149451,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', '*Burkitt Lymphoma/diagnosis/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', '*Lymphadenitis/diagnosis/pathology', 'Lymphatic Metastasis/pathology', 'Lymphoid Tissue/pathology', '*Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/diagnosis/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nigeria', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Spleen/pathology', 'Splenectomy', '*Tuberculosis, Lymph Node/diagnosis/pathology']",2009/04/10 09:00,2009/06/06 09:00,['2009/04/10 09:00'],"['2009/04/10 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/06 09:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Afr Health Sci. 2008 Mar;8(1):20-4.,,,,,PMC2408537,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Western blot analysis of blast cells from patients with C-RAF germline mutations revealed loss of the tumor and metastasis suppressor RAF kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP). Immunohistochemistry of the patients' primary tumors revealed normal RKIP expression levels, indicating that the loss of RKIP is a somatic, t-AML-specific event. In focus formation assays, the oncogenic potential of human mutant C-RAF was strongly influenced by expression levels of RKIP. Although the number of colonies formed by C-RAF(S427G) was significantly increased by RKIP silencing, the opposite was observed after RKIP overexpression. These results show that the loss of RKIP is a functional somatic event in carriers of C-RAF germline mutations, which contributes to the development of t-AML.","['Zebisch, A', 'Haller, M', 'Hiden, K', 'Goebel, T', 'Hoefler, G', 'Troppmair, J', 'Sill, H']","['Zebisch A', 'Haller M', 'Hiden K', 'Goebel T', 'Hoefler G', 'Troppmair J', 'Sill H']","['Division of Hematology, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria.']",,['eng'],"['W 1101/FWF_/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria', 'CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090409,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Blast Crisis/pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', '*Germ-Line Mutation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*etiology', 'Male', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*etiology', 'Phosphatidylethanolamine Binding Protein/*deficiency', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf/*genetics']",2009/04/10 09:00,2009/07/08 09:00,['2009/04/10 09:00'],"['2009/04/10 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/08 09:00 [medline]']","['leu200968 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.68 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Jun;23(6):1049-53. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.68.

We also showed that this homing-promoting effect is not C3a receptor (C3aR) dependent. Herein, we report our new observation that transplantation of C3aR(-/-) HSPCs into lethally irradiated recipients results in: (1) approximately 5-7 day delay in recovery of platelets and leukocytes; (2) decrease in formation of day 12 colony-forming units-spleen; and (3) decrease in the number of donor-derived CFU-granulocyte-macrophage progenitors detectable in the bone marrow cavities at day 16 after transplantation. In agreement with the murine data, blockage of C3aR on human umbilical cord blood CD34(+) cells by C3aR antagonist SB290157 impairs their engraftment in non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient mice. However, HSPCs from C3aR(-/-) mice stimulated by C3a still better responded to SDF-1 gradient, after exposure to C3a, they secrete less matrix metalloprotease-9 and show impaired adhesion to stroma cells. We conclude that C3a, in addition to enhancing responsiveness of HSPCs to SDF-1 gradient in a C3aR independent manner, may also directly modulate HSPC homing by augmenting C3aR-mediated secretion of matrix metalloprotease-9 and cell adhesion.","['Wysoczynski, M', 'Reca, R', 'Lee, H', 'Wu, W', 'Ratajczak, J', 'Ratajczak, M Z']","['Wysoczynski M', 'Reca R', 'Lee H', 'Wu W', 'Ratajczak J', 'Ratajczak MZ']","['Stem Cell Biology Program at the James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY 40202, USA.']",,['eng'],"['R01 CA106281/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA106281-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK074720/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK074720-03/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090409,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cell Adhesion/physiology', 'Cell Movement/*physiology', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Complement C3a/*physiology', 'Fetal Blood/cytology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/enzymology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/genetics/pathology/surgery', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, SCID', 'Radiation Chimera', 'Receptors, Complement/deficiency/genetics/*physiology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",2009/04/10 09:00,2009/09/22 06:00,['2009/04/10 09:00'],"['2009/04/10 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/22 06:00 [medline]']","['leu200973 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.73 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Aug;23(8):1455-61. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.73.

Whereas ND-MSCs were devoid of genomic imbalances, several non-recurrent chromosomal gains and losses (>1 Mb size) were detected in MM-MSCs. Using real-time reverse transcription PCR, we found correlative deregulated expression for five genes encoded in regions for which genomic imbalances were detected using array-CGH. In addition, only MM-MSCs showed a specific pattern of 'hot-spot' regions with discrete (<1 Mb) genomic alterations, some of which were confirmed using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Within MM-MSC samples, unsupervised cluster analysis did not correlate with particular clinicobiological features of MM patients. We also explored whether cytogenetic abnormalities present in myelomatous plasma cells (PCs) were shared by matching MSCs from the same patients using FISH. All MM-MSCs were cytogenetically normal for the tested genomic alterations.

In this study, microarray analysis revealed that c-Jun, a monopoiesis-promoting transcription factor, was downregulated in CML neutrophils. BCR-ABL directly inhibited c-Jun expression, as c-Jun downregulation in primary CML neutrophils and in the CML blast cell lines, KCL22 and K562, was reversed by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib. We established a myeloid differentiation model in KCL22 cells using zinc-inducible CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)alpha (KCL22/alpha). Myeloid differentiation was observed in C/EBP-induced KCL22/alpha cells. Imatinib-induced c-Jun upregulation promoted the monocytic differentiation of KCL22/alpha cells. c-Jun knockdown in KCL22/alpha cells by a short interfering RNA redirected their differentiation from the monocytic to the neutrophilic lineage, even after imatinib treatment. A blockade of PI3K-Akt signaling with an Akt inhibitor upregulated c-Jun and induced the monocytic differentiation of KCL22, K562, and C/EBP-induced KCL22/alpha cells. Thus, BCR-ABL downregulates c-Jun expression by activating the PI3K-Akt pathway during CML-CP, thereby allowing C/EBPs to promote neutrophil differentiation.","['Kobayashi, S', 'Kimura, F', 'Ikeda, T', 'Osawa, Y', 'Torikai, H', 'Kobayashi, A', 'Sato, K', 'Motoyoshi, K']","['Kobayashi S', 'Kimura F', 'Ikeda T', 'Osawa Y', 'Torikai H', 'Kobayashi A', 'Sato K', 'Motoyoshi K']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Defense Medical College, Tokorozawa, Saitama, Japan.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090409,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Benzamides', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Down-Regulation', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*pathology', 'Neutrophils/*cytology/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/physiology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology']",2009/04/10 09:00,2009/09/24 06:00,['2009/04/10 09:00'],"['2009/04/10 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/24 06:00 [medline]']","['leu200974 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.74 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Sep;23(9):1622-7. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.74.

It also adds entities-some defined principally by genetic features-that have only recently been characterized. In this paper, the classification of myeloid neoplasms and acute leukemia is highlighted with the aim of familiarizing hematologists, clinical scientists, and hematopathologists not only with the major changes in the classification but also with the rationale for those changes.","['Vardiman, James W', 'Thiele, Juergen', 'Arber, Daniel A', 'Brunning, Richard D', 'Borowitz, Michael J', 'Porwit, Anna', 'Harris, Nancy Lee', 'Le Beau, Michelle M', 'Hellstrom-Lindberg, Eva', 'Tefferi, Ayalew', 'Bloomfield, Clara D']","['Vardiman JW', 'Thiele J', 'Arber DA', 'Brunning RD', 'Borowitz MJ', 'Porwit A', 'Harris NL', 'Le Beau MM', 'Hellstrom-Lindberg E', 'Tefferi A', 'Bloomfield CD']","['Department of Pathology, University of Chicago, IL, USA. james.vardiman@uchospitals.edu']",,['eng'],,"['Consensus Development Conference', 'Guideline', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20090408,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Bone Marrow Examination/standards', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Lineage', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Eosinophilia/classification', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/classification', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*classification/diagnosis/genetics/pathology', 'Mastocytosis, Systemic/classification', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*classification/diagnosis/genetics/pathology', 'Myelodysplastic-Myeloproliferative Diseases/classification/diagnosis/genetics/pathology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*classification/diagnosis/genetics/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Preleukemia/classification', 'Terminology as Topic', 'World Health Organization']",2009/04/10 09:00,2009/09/22 06:00,['2009/04/10 09:00'],"['2009/04/10 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)42165-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-03-209262 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Jul 30;114(5):937-51. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-03-209262.

We compared the outcomes of 107 patients with leukemia undergoing HLA-identical sibling (n=51) or related HLA-haploidentical (n=56) HSCT performed during the same time period. Patients received BU-CY/CY-TBI in HLA-identical sibling HSCT or TBI+Ara-C+CY+ATG/CCNU+Ara-C+Bu+CY+ATG in haploidentical HSCT as conditioning regimens, followed by unmanipulated marrow and/or peripheral blood (PB) transplantation. All patients achieved full engraftment. The cumulative incidence of grades II through IV acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD) in the matched and haploidentical cohorts was 13.7% and 26.8% (P<0.05), respectively. The risk of developing cGvHD was not different between HLA-matched and haploidentical patients (P>0.05). The two-year incidence of treatment-related mortality for matched and haploidentical patients was 7.8% and 12.5%, respectively, with P>0.05, and the incidence of relapse was 17% and 22%, respectively, with P>0.05. The two-year adjusted leukemia-free survival for matched versus haploidentical patients was 76% and 68%, respectively, with P>0.05, and the overall survival for matched versus haploidentical patients was 80% and 70%, respectively, with P>0.05.

Some evidence indicates that polyunsaturated fatty acid can kill cells by apoptosis. In the current study, we tested the apoptotic effect of GLA on human chronic myelogenous leukemia K562 cells. GLA induced K562 cell death in a dose-dependent manner. Typical apoptotic nuclei were shown by staining of K562 cells with DNA-binding fluorochrome Hoechst 33342, characterized by chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation. Flow cytometric analysis also demonstrated that GLA caused dose-dependent apoptosis of K562 cells. The apoptosis could be inhibited by a pancaspase inhibitor (z-VAD-fmk), suggesting the involvement of caspases. Further, release of cytochrome c, activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of PARP were found in GLA-induced apoptosis. GLA treatment could also elevate lipid peroxidation in K562 cells, and antioxidant alpha-tocopherol could reverse the cytotoxicity of GLA. The saturated fatty acid SA, which did not exhibit significant increase in lipid peroxidation, also did not induce cytotoxicity. Intracellular GSH was also determined, and there was no marked change of GSH levels in cells after incubation with GLA compared with the control. These results demonstrate that GLA could induce apoptosis in K562 cells. Apoptosis is mediated by release of cytochrome c, activation of caspase-3. Lipid peroxidation may play a role in GLA cytotoxicity.","['Ge, Haitao', 'Kong, Xiuqin', 'Shi, Limei', 'Hou, Lijuan', 'Liu, Zhili', 'Li, Ping']","['Ge H', 'Kong X', 'Shi L', 'Hou L', 'Liu Z', 'Li P']","['Ministry of Education and Department of Pharmacognosy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, PR China.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090207,England,Cell Biol Int,Cell biology international,9307129,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Benzimidazoles/chemistry', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Collagen Type XI/metabolism', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Fluorescent Dyes/chemistry', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism/pathology', 'Lipid Peroxidation/*drug effects', 'gamma-Linolenic Acid/*pharmacology']",2009/04/10 09:00,2009/07/14 09:00,['2009/04/10 09:00'],"['2008/06/16 00:00 [received]', '2008/11/17 00:00 [revised]', '2009/01/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/04/10 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/14 09:00 [medline]']","['S1065-6995(09)00015-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cellbi.2009.01.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Biol Int. 2009 Mar;33(3):402-10. doi: 10.1016/j.cellbi.2009.01.014.

The roles of PBX1 and PBX2, a highly homologous transcription factor to PBX1, for expression of VCP were examined in the cell lines from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The effects of PBX1 and PBX2 on VCP expression were examined with siRNA in A549 and PC14 NSCLC cell lines. Expression levels of PBX2 and VCP were immunohistochemically examined and compared with each other in 206 NSCLC cases. Subsequently, significance of PBX expression in clinical behavior of NSCLC patients was evaluated. Expression levels of VCP mRNA significantly decreased when PBX2 but not PBX1 expression was knocked down in NSCLC cell lines. Immunohistochemically, staining intensity of PBX2 was correlated with that of VCP in clinical samples. Then correlation of PBX2 expression and clinical behavior of NSCLC patients was evaluated. Univariate analysis revealed high expression levels of PBX2 and VCP to be poor prognosticators for overall and disease-free survival. Multivariate analysis revealed that high expression of VCP but not PBX2 to be an independent prognostic factor. PBX2 is a transcription factor for VCP in NSCLC. Because high levels of PBX2 expression correlated with prognosis of NSCLC, PBX2 could be a target molecule for treatment of NSCLC.","['Qiu, Ying', 'Morii, Eiichi', 'Tomita, Yasuhiko', 'Zhang, Binglin', 'Matsumura, Akihide', 'Kitaichi, Masanori', 'Okumura, Meinoshin', 'Aozasa, Katsuyuki']","['Qiu Y', 'Morii E', 'Tomita Y', 'Zhang B', 'Matsumura A', 'Kitaichi M', 'Okumura M', 'Aozasa K']","['Department of Pathology, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200092, China.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090312,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphatases/genetics/metabolism', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lung Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Valosin Containing Protein']",2009/04/10 09:00,2009/09/10 06:00,['2009/04/10 09:00'],"['2009/04/10 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/10 06:00 [medline]']","['CAS1156 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.2009.01156.x [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2009 Jul;100(7):1198-209. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2009.01156.x.

A total of 11 Toll-like receptors have now been described in humans. Toll-like receptors are expressed on virtually every type of cell, including immunocompetent cells. Ligand binding triggers signaling cascade that leads to the induction of key proinflammatory mediators that contribute to an immune response. Additionally, TLR induction results in the activation and shaping of the adaptive immune reaction. TLRs have also been identified as potential therapeutic targets. Their capability to augment antigen presentation or induce the expression of target molecules has rendered them plausible therapeutic agents. Recently, synthetic ligands have been described and some of them have already been established in the treatment of skin cancer (TLR7 agonist) and as anti-hepatitis B virus vaccine adjuvants (TLR4 agonists). Furthermore, many clinical trials on TLR agonists as potent enhancers of anti-tumor response in solid tumors are currently on going. Considering that TLRs are widely expressed on transformed cells of the immune system (from blasts to memory cells), they may become a promising candidate for developing effective therapeutic options in hematologic malignancies as many in vitro studies have shown the intact functionality of TLRs in transformed cells. Moreover, a few clinical trials investigating the safety of synthetic TLR agonists are currently ongoing. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct further studies in order to assess the clinical relevance of the applicability of TLR-aimed therapy in the treatment of hematologic malignancies.","['Wolska, Anna', 'Lech-Maranda, Ewa', 'Robak, Tadeusz']","['Wolska A', 'Lech-Maranda E', 'Robak T']","['Department of Hematology, Medical University of Lodz, Poland.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,Netherlands,Curr Mol Med,Current molecular medicine,101093076,IM,"['Animals', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism', 'Ligands', 'Lymphoma/metabolism', 'Multiple Myeloma/metabolism', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Toll-Like Receptors/*metabolism']",2009/04/10 09:00,2009/05/27 09:00,['2009/04/10 09:00'],"['2009/04/10 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/27 09:00 [medline]']",['10.2174/156652409787847182 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Mol Med. 2009 Apr;9(3):324-35. doi: 10.2174/156652409787847182.,"['0 (Ligands)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptors)']",,,169,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: By a combination of genetic, biochemical, and ultrastructural approaches, we provide here compelling evidence for the involvement of lipid raft aggregates containing recruited Fas/CD95 death receptor, Fas-associated death domain-containing protein (FADD), and procaspase-8 in the induction of apoptosis in human T-cell leukemia Jurkat cells by the antitumor drug edelfosine, the prototype compound of a promising family of synthetic antitumor lipids named as synthetic alkyl-lysophospholipid analogues. Co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed that edelfosine induced the generation of the so-called death-inducing signaling complex (DISC), made up of Fas/CD95, FADD, and procaspase-8, in lipid rafts. Electron microscopy analyses allowed to visualize the formation of raft clusters and their co-localization with DISC components Fas/CD95, FADD, and procaspase-8 following edelfosine treatment of Jurkat cells. Silencing of Fas/CD95 by RNA interference, transfection with a FADD dominant-negative mutant that blocks Fas/CD95 signaling, and specific inhibition of caspase-8 prevented the apoptotic response triggered by edelfosine, hence demonstrating the functional role of DISC in drug-induced apoptosis. By using radioactive labeled edelfosine and a fluorescent analogue, we found that edelfosine accumulated in lipid rafts, forming edelfosine-rich membrane raft clusters in Jurkat leukemic T-cells. Disruption of these membrane raft domains abrogated drug uptake and drug-induced DISC assembly and apoptosis. Thus, edelfosine uptake into lipid rafts was critical for the onset of both co-aggregation of DISC in membrane rafts and subsequent apoptotic cell death. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This work shows the involvement of DISC clusters in lipid raft aggregates as a supramolecular and physical entity responsible for the induction of apoptosis in leukemic cells by the antitumor drug edelfosine.

As new sources of human beta-cells are developed (e.g., stem cell-derived tissue), transplanting them in a durable device could obviate the need for immunosuppression, while also protecting the patient from any risk of tumorigenicity. Here, we studied (1) the survival and function of encapsulated human beta-cells and their progenitors and (2) the engraftment of encapsulated murine beta-cells in allo- and autoimmune settings. METHODS: Human islets and human fetal pancreatic islet-like cell clusters were encapsulated in polytetrafluorethylene devices (TheraCyte) and transplanted into immunodeficient mice. Graft survival and function was measured by immunohistochemistry, circulating human C-peptide levels, and blood glucose levels. Bioluminescent imaging was used to monitor encapsulated neonatal murine islets. RESULTS: Encapsulated human islet-like cell clusters survived, replicated, and acquired a level of glucose responsive insulin secretion sufficient to ameliorate hyperglycemia in diabetic mice. Bioluminescent imaging of encapsulated murine neonatal islets revealed a dynamic process of cell death followed by regrowth, resulting in robust long-term allograft survival. Further, in the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse model of type I diabetes, encapsulated primary beta-cells ameliorated diabetes without stimulating a detectable T-cell response. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate for the first time that human beta-cells function is compatible with encapsulation in a durable, immunoprotective device. Moreover, our study suggests that encapsulation of beta-cells before terminal differentiation will be a successful approach for new cell-based therapies for diabetes, such as those derived from stem cells.","['Lee, Seung-Hee', 'Hao, Ergeng', 'Savinov, Alexei Y', 'Geron, Ifat', 'Strongin, Alex Y', 'Itkin-Ansari, Pamela']","['Lee SH', 'Hao E', 'Savinov AY', 'Geron I', 'Strongin AY', 'Itkin-Ansari P']","['Development and Aging Program, Burnham Institute for Medical Research, La Jolla, CA, USA.']",,['eng'],"['R21 DK071956/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 DK071956-02/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Survival', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental/surgery', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Glucose/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hyperglycemia/prevention & control', 'Insulin/*metabolism', 'Insulin Secretion', 'Insulin-Secreting Cells/immunology/pathology/*physiology/*transplantation', 'Luciferases/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",2009/04/09 09:00,2009/05/15 09:00,['2009/04/09 09:00'],"['2009/04/09 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/15 09:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/TP.0b013e31819c86ea [doi]', '00007890-200904150-00006 [pii]']",ppublish,Transplantation. 2009 Apr 15;87(7):983-91. doi: 10.1097/TP.0b013e31819c86ea.,"['0 (Insulin)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",,,,PMC2715156,['NIHMS94048'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we report a patient who developed t-AML with 11q23 abnormality and bone marrow metastasis after breast cancer treatment with paclitaxel. The patient was a 61-year-old female who developed breast cancer at the age of 54 years. Four years after resection, lung and bone metastases were detected. Weekly therapy with paclitaxel at 80 mg/m2 was administered for 10 weeks (total dose: 1,200 mg), and radiotherapy was performed; thereafter, the extent of bone metastasis increased. Pancytopenia was noted 3 years after paclitaxel therapy. Bone marrow aspiration suggested AML (M4) with (11;19)(q23;p13) chromosome abnormalities. Histopathologically, bone marrow metastasis from breast cancer was detected in the same bone marrow specimen. This patient had not received any other anticancer drugs.

At a low concentration (0.5 microM), compound 3 caused cell cycle arrest at the mitotic phase and induced apoptosis. At a higher concentration (>1.0 microM), it induced an arrest in the G(2)/M phase, leading to apoptosis. In many cells blocked at the M phase, the organization of microtubules was affected, indicating depolymerization of the microtubule network. Western blotting demonstrated that compound 3 depolymerized microtubules similar to colchicine and nocodazole. Experiments in vitro also showed that compound 3 inhibited the assembly of purified tubulin in a concentration-dependent manner by interacting with the colchicine-binding site of tubulin through its SH groups.

The factors that regulate these interactions are, at the present time, incompletely understood. Recent studies showing preferences in binding between synthetic Bcl-2 homology domain 3 and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members in vitro have suggested that the antiapoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and Bcl-x(L), but not Bcl-2, restrain proapoptotic Bak from inducing mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and apoptosis. Here we show that Bak protein has a much higher affinity than the 26-amino acid Bak Bcl-2 homology domain 3 for Bcl-2, that some naturally occurring Bcl-2 allelic variants have an affinity for full-length Bak that is only 3-fold lower than that of Mcl-1, and that endogenous levels of these Bcl-2 variants (which are as much as 40-fold more abundant than Mcl-1) restrain part of the Bak in intact lymphoid cells. In addition, we demonstrate that Bcl-2 variants can, depending on their affinity for Bak, substitute for Mcl-1 in protecting cells. Thus, the ability of Bcl-2 to protect cells from activated Bak depends on two important contextual variables, the identity of the Bcl-2 present and the amount expressed.","['Dai, Haiming', 'Meng, X Wei', 'Lee, Sun-Hee', 'Schneider, Paula A', 'Kaufmann, Scott H']","['Dai H', 'Meng XW', 'Lee SH', 'Schneider PA', 'Kaufmann SH']","['Division of Oncology Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota 55905, USA.']",,['eng'],"['R01 CA069008/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA69008/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090407,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Apoptosis/*immunology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/physiology', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Down-Regulation/immunology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Lymphocytes/*cytology/*physiology', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Mutagenesis', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Protein Binding/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Surface Plasmon Resonance', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/physiology', 'Transfection', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/genetics/metabolism']",2009/04/09 09:00,2009/10/29 06:00,['2009/04/09 09:00'],"['2009/04/09 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)55592-0 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M109.004770 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2009 Jul 3;284(27):18311-22. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M109.004770.

These findings lend compelling weight for the application of PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitors in T-ALL. However, our knowledge of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling in T-ALL is limited and it is not clear whether it could be an effective target for innovative therapeutic strategies. Here, we have analyzed the therapeutic potential of the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor PI-103, a small synthetic molecule of the pyridofuropyrimidine class, on both T-ALL cell lines and patient samples, which displayed constitutive activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling. PI-103 inhibited the growth of T-ALL cells, including 170-kDa P-glycoprotein overexpressing cells. PI-103 cytotoxicity was independent of p53 gene status. PI-103 was more potent than inhibitors that are selective only for PI3K (Wortmannin, LY294002) or for mTOR (rapamycin). PI-103 induced G(0)-G(1) phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, which was characterized by activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9.

Our previous work showed that RIG-G possessed a potent antiproliferative activity. However, the mechanism for the transcriptional regulation of RIG-G gene remains unknown. Here, we report that signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 2 together with IFN regulatory factor (IRF)-9 can effectively drive the transcription of RIG-G gene by their functional interaction through a STAT1-independent manner, even without the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT2. The complex IRF-9/STAT2 is both necessary and sufficient for RIG-G gene expression. In addition, IRF-1 is also able to induce RIG-G gene expression through an IRF-9/STAT2-dependent or IRF-9/STAT2-independent mechanism. Moreover, the induction of RIG-G by retinoic acid in NB4 cells resulted, to some extent, from an IFNalpha autocrine pathway, a finding that suggests a novel mechanism for the signal cross-talk between IFNalpha and retinoic acid. Taken together, our results provide for the first time the evidence of the biological significance of IRF-9/STAT2 complex, and furnish an alternative pathway modulating the expression of IFN-stimulated genes, contributing to the diversity of IFN signaling to mediate their multiple biological properties in normal and tumor cells.","['Lou, Ye-Jiang', 'Pan, Xiao-Rong', 'Jia, Pei-Min', 'Li, Dong', 'Xiao, Shu', 'Zhang, Zhang-Lin', 'Chen, Sai-Juan', 'Chen, Zhu', 'Tong, Jian-Hua']","['Lou YJ', 'Pan XR', 'Jia PM', 'Li D', 'Xiao S', 'Zhang ZL', 'Chen SJ', 'Chen Z', 'Tong JH']","[""Shanghai Institute of Hematology and State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Rui-Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.""]",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090407,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interferon Regulatory Factor-1/genetics/metabolism', 'Interferon-Stimulated Gene Factor 3, gamma Subunit/*metabolism', 'Interferon-alpha/metabolism', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'STAT2 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",2009/04/09 09:00,2009/06/20 09:00,['2009/04/09 09:00'],"['2009/04/09 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/20 09:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-08-4922 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-4922 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2009 Apr 15;69(8):3673-80. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-4922.

Given this critical role, the function of transcription factors is normally regulated closely, often through transient phosphorylation. Although transcription factors are not often directly modified by mutations in cancer cells, they frequently become activated constitutively through mutations affecting ""upstream"" pathways. By continually driving the expression of key target genes, these oncogenic transcription factors play a central role in tumor pathogenesis. One such transcription factor is the cAMP-regulatory element-binding protein (CREB), which can be activated through phosphorylation by a number of kinases, including Akt, p90Rsk, protein kinase A, and calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinases and regulates genes whose deregulated expression promotes oncogenesis, including cyclins, Bcl-2 family members, and Egr-1. CREB is overexpressed and constitutively phosphorylated in a number of forms of human cancer, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and non-small cell lung cancer, and appears to play a direct role in disease pathogenesis and prognosis. Although transcription factors have not been a central focus of drug development, recent advances suggest that CREB and other such proteins may be worthwhile targets for cancer therapy.","['Sakamoto, Kathleen M', 'Frank, David A']","['Sakamoto KM', 'Frank DA']","[""Division of Hematology-Oncology, Gwynne Hazen Cherry Memorial Laboratories, Mattel Children's Hospital UCLA, Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA.""]",,['eng'],"['R01 HL075826-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL083077-03S1/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL83077/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL75826/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL075826-02S1/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL083077-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL083077-02/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL075826-03/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL083077-04S1/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL075826-04/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL083077-03/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL075826/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL075826-02S2/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL083077-04/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL083077/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL075826-02/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20090407,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Cell Proliferation', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics/physiology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Myelopoiesis/physiology', 'Phosphorylation/physiology', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology']",2009/04/09 09:00,2009/06/06 09:00,['2009/04/09 09:00'],"['2009/04/09 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/06 09:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-08-1137 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-1137 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2009 Apr 15;15(8):2583-7. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-1137.

Our purpose was to characterize the molecular mechanisms underlying for the selective IkappaB kinase inhibitor BMS-345541 in CLL cells together with the analysis of its combination with several antineoplasic drugs. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Primary cells from 34 CLL patients were incubated with different doses of BMS-345541. NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity was analyzed by ELISA-based kits and the characterization of the apoptotic pathway was done by flow cytometry, immunoblotting, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, and immunofluorescence techniques. RESULTS: BMS-345541 selectively induced apoptosis in CLL cells in the low micromolar range irrespective of p53 status. Noteworthy, the high ZAP-70 group was significantly more sensitive to BMS-345541 than the low ZAP-70 group, in correlation with high levels of p65 phosphorylation and DNA-binding activity. Following NF-kappaB inhibition, BMS-345541 led to induction of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway and activation of both caspase-dependent and caspase-independent factors. Moreover, BMS-345541-induced apoptosis was accompanied by down-regulation of several antiapoptotic NF-kappaB-target genes, including both BCL2 family members and apoptotic endogenous inhibitors. In addition, we showed a strong synergism between BMS-345541 and conventional chemotherapeutics such as mitoxantrone and dexamethasone as well as with new promising drugs such as the BH3-mimetic GX15-070/Obatoclax or the anti-TRAIL-R1 monoclonal antibody mapatumumab. CONCLUSIONS: These data confirm that NF-kappaB is a relevant target in CLL and indicate that inhibitors of IkappaB kinase, alone or in combination, represent a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of CLL patients, especially for the group with high ZAP-70.","['Lopez-Guerra, Monica', 'Roue, Gael', 'Perez-Galan, Patricia', 'Alonso, Roberto', 'Villamor, Neus', 'Montserrat, Emili', 'Campo, Elias', 'Colomer, Dolors']","['Lopez-Guerra M', 'Roue G', 'Perez-Galan P', 'Alonso R', 'Villamor N', 'Montserrat E', 'Campo E', 'Colomer D']","[""Authors' Affiliations: Hematopathology Unit, Department of Pathology and Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.""]",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090407,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Imidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Quinoxalines/*pharmacology', 'Transcription Factor RelA/*metabolism', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/*metabolism']",2009/04/09 09:00,2009/06/06 09:00,['2009/04/09 09:00'],"['2009/04/09 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/06 09:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-08-2382 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-2382 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2009 Apr 15;15(8):2767-76. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-2382.

WT1 peptide-based cancer vaccines have been reported but have limited application due to HLA restriction of the peptides. We sought to vaccinate using adenoviral (Ad) vectors encoding tumor-associated antigens such as WT1 that can stimulate tumor-associated antigen-specific immunity across a broad array of HLA types and multiple class I and class II epitopes. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We developed a novel Ad vector encoding a truncated version of WT1 (Ad-tWT1) lacking the highly conserved COOH terminus zinc finger domains and tested its ability to stimulate WT1-specific immune responses and antitumor immunity in two murine models of WT1-expressing tumors. RESULTS: Despite encoding a transcription factor, we found that Ad-tWT1-transduced murine and human dendritic cells showed cytoplasmic expression of the truncated WT1 protein. In addition, vaccination of C57BL/6 mice with Ad-tWT1 generated WT1-specific cell-mediated and humoral immune responses and conferred protection against challenge with the leukemia cell line, mWT1-C1498. Moreover, in a tumor therapy model, Ad-tWT1 vaccination of TRAMP-C2 tumor-bearing mice significantly suppressed tumor growth. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of a WT1-encoding Ad vector that is capable of inducing effective immunity against WT1-expressing malignancies. Based on these findings, Ad-tWT1 warrants investigation in human clinical trials to evaluate its applications as a vaccine for patients with WT1-expressing cancers.","['Osada, Takuya', 'Woo, Christopher Y', 'McKinney, Matthew', 'Yang, Xiao Yi', 'Lei, Gangjun', 'Labreche, Heather G', 'Hartman, Zachary C', 'Niedzwiecki, Donna', 'Chao, Nelson', 'Amalfitano, Andrea', 'Morse, Michael A', 'Lyerly, H Kim', 'Clay, Timothy M']","['Osada T', 'Woo CY', 'McKinney M', 'Yang XY', 'Lei G', 'Labreche HG', 'Hartman ZC', 'Niedzwiecki D', 'Chao N', 'Amalfitano A', 'Morse MA', 'Lyerly HK', 'Clay TM']","['Department of Surgery, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710, USA.']",,['eng'],"['P01-CA047741/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA047741/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK069884/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA078673/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01DK-069884/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090407,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Animals', 'Cancer Vaccines/genetics/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia/immunology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'WT1 Proteins/genetics/*immunology']",2009/04/09 09:00,2009/06/06 09:00,['2009/04/09 09:00'],"['2009/04/09 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/06 09:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-08-2589 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-2589 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2009 Apr 15;15(8):2789-96. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-2589.

However, only a few papers have investigated the electric-induced rotation of particles in a stationary alternating (AC) electric field instead of a rotating electric field. In this study, a microchip composed of a top-grounded electrode, flow chamber and bottom chess-type electrode arrays was used to construct a stationary non-uniform AC electric field for the manipulation of cells by dielectrophoretic force. We focused on the effects of metal and dielectric nanoparticles uptaken by cells under ER, by using human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60), 13 nm Au and 19 nm SiO(2) nanoparticles. As revealed by the experimental results, both the percentage of cells in rotation and the range of rotational (ROT) frequency for the uptake of Au nanoparticle cells were higher and wider than in the case of SiO(2) nanoparticles. In addition, the rotation of lone cells and pearl-chain cells under non-uniform and uniform electric field were quantitatively investigated, respectively. The membrane capacitance and membrane conductance of HL-60 cells can be extracted from the ROT spectra as 10.18+/-1.92 mF/m(2) and 1500+/-321 S/m(2), respectively. In general, the ER of cells in a stationary AC electric field can be attributed to the highly non-uniform electric field and non-uniform dispersion of nanoparticles within cells; therefore, the electrical properties of uptaken nanoparticles and the aggregation phenomenon have significant influences on the resulting electrical torque.","['Chuang, Cheng-Hsin', 'Hsu, You-Ming', 'Yeh, Chen-Che']","['Chuang CH', 'Hsu YM', 'Yeh CC']","['Department of Mechanical Engineering & Institute of Nanotechnology, Southern Taiwan University, Tainan, Taiwan. chchuang@mail.stut.edu.tw']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,Electrophoresis,Electrophoresis,8204476,IM,"['Cell Aggregation/physiology', '*Cell Physiological Phenomena', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Electric Capacitance', 'Electric Conductivity', 'Electromagnetic Fields', 'Electrophoresis/*instrumentation', 'Equipment Design', 'Gold/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', '*Metal Nanoparticles', 'Microfluidic Analytical Techniques/instrumentation', 'Rotation', 'Silicon Dioxide/metabolism', 'Torque']",2009/04/08 09:00,2009/09/01 06:00,['2009/04/08 09:00'],"['2009/04/08 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/elps.200800682 [doi]'],ppublish,Electrophoresis. 2009 May;30(9):1449-56. doi: 10.1002/elps.200800682.,"['7440-57-5 (Gold)', '7631-86-9 (Silicon Dioxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: HLA class I (-A and -B) low resolution typing was carried out by polymerase chain reaction-sequence specific oligonucleotide, PCR-SSO). HLA class II low resolution typing was performed by PCR-sequence specific primer (PCR-SSP). And HLA class I and II high resolution typing was done by sequencing-based typing (SBT). Then the recombination event was analyzed by family study. RESULTS: The 2 haplotypes of the patient were A*3101-B*1301-DRB1*0701 and A*3303-B*4403-DRB1*1302. His father's 2 haplotypes were A*3001-B*1302-DRB1*0701 and A*3101-B*1301-DRB1*1501. Family study demonstrated that the HLA-A*3101-B*1301 was from one of his father's chromosome and the DRB1*0701 was from the other chromosome of his father. So the result indicated that the recombination event occurred between the HLA-B and -DRB1 loci during meiosis of his father and resulted in a new HLA haplotype that was transferred to the son. CONCLUSION: A HLA-B/DR recombination event occurring between the HLA-B and -DRB1 loci has been found in a Chinese family, which may help further study of the mechanism of HLA recombination.","['Liu, Na', 'Shan, Xiao-yan', 'Li, Wei', 'Wang, Lijun', 'He, Xiao-mei', 'Wang, Dong-mei', 'Ni, Lei', 'Cui, Shuang', 'Wang, Lin', 'Gong, Zhi-yin', 'Zhao, Bo-tao', 'Zhang, Zhi-xin']","['Liu N', 'Shan XY', 'Li W', 'Wang L', 'He XM', 'Wang DM', 'Ni L', 'Cui S', 'Wang L', 'Gong ZY', 'Zhao BT', 'Zhang ZX']","[""HLA Laboratory, Beijing Red Cross Blood Center, Beijing, People's Republic of China.""]",,['chi'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Yi Chuan Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue yi chuan xue za zhi = Zhonghua yixue yichuanxue zazhi = Chinese journal of medical genetics,9425197,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Asians/*genetics', 'Crossing Over, Genetic/genetics', 'Family', 'Female', 'HLA-A Antigens/*genetics', 'HLA-B Antigens/*genetics', 'HLA-DQ Antigens/*genetics', 'HLA-DQ beta-Chains', 'HLA-DR Antigens/*genetics', 'HLA-DRB1 Chains', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Pedigree', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Recombination, Genetic']",2009/04/08 09:00,2009/07/29 09:00,['2009/04/08 09:00'],"['2009/04/08 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/29 09:00 [medline]']","['940626047 [pii]', '10.3760/cma.j.issn.1003-9406.2009.02.022 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Yi Chuan Xue Za Zhi. 2009 Apr;26(2):216-8. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.1003-9406.2009.02.022.,"['0 (HLA-A Antigens)', '0 (HLA-B Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DQ Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DQ beta-Chains)', '0 (HLA-DQB1 antigen)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DRB1 Chains)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Chromosome preparation was made by using 24-hour culture. FISH technique using dual color dual fusion (DC-DF) BCR/ABL probe was performed in all 158 cases and R-banding was also employed for karyotyping in some patients. RESULTS: Among the 158 cases, 98 cases were Ph positive, of which 69 cases (70.4%) were typical FISH pattern (1R1G2F), the other 29 cases (29.6%) showed 12 different types of atypical FISH pattern. The most frequent atypical patterns found were 1R1G1F in 7 cases (7.1%), 2R1G1F in 5 cases (5.1%), 1R1G2F and 1R1G3F in 4 cases (4.1%), 2R2G1F in 3 cases (3.1%). Karyotype analysis on 18 CML cases with atypical FISH patterns demonstrated that the atypical FISH patterns were due to variant translocation in 3 cases; the additional third signal was because of a supernumerary Ph chromosome. The karyotyping results did not conform to FISH results in four cases suggesting the conceivable mistakes in karyotyping. The 1R1G1F signal pattern seen in 3 cases with classical t(9;22) resulted from the deletion of derivative chromosome 9. The 1R1G2F signal pattern detected in 40% to 64% of interphase cells of 3 cases without Ph chromosome by conventional cytogenetic analysis suggested a submicroscopic translocation. Three cases treated with Glivec or bone marrow transplantation showed normal karyotypes with a small amount of BCR/ABL positive cells by FISH detection. CONCLUSION: FISH technique is of great value for the diagnosis of CML and confirmation of variant translocation, occult Ph translocation, derivative chromosome 9 deletion, therapeutic effect of interferon and Glivec as well as detection of minimal residual disease after bone marrow transplantation.","['Qiu, Hai-rong', 'Miao, Kou-rong', 'Wang, Rong', 'Qiao, Chun', 'Zhang, Jian-fu', 'Zhang, Su-jiang', 'Qian, Si-xuan', 'Xu, Wei', 'Li, Jian-yong']","['Qiu HR', 'Miao KR', 'Wang R', 'Qiao C', 'Zhang JF', 'Zhang SJ', 'Qian SX', 'Xu W', 'Li JY']","[""Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China.""]",,['chi'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Yi Chuan Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue yi chuan xue za zhi = Zhonghua yixue yichuanxue zazhi = Chinese journal of medical genetics,9425197,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/*methods', '*Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Young Adult']",2009/04/08 09:00,2009/07/29 09:00,['2009/04/08 09:00'],"['2009/04/08 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/29 09:00 [medline]']","['940626045 [pii]', '10.3760/cma.j.issn.1003-9406.2009.02.020 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Yi Chuan Xue Za Zhi. 2009 Apr;26(2):207-10. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.1003-9406.2009.02.020.,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A 33-year-old Chinese woman was referred to our hospital. Hematologic data showed WBC 42.7 x 10(9)/L with monocytosis (monocyte counts 7.296 x 10(9)/L). Bone marrow aspirate was hypercellular with 4.5% monoblasts and 7.5% promonocytes. At first she was diagnosed with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) according to the FAB criteria. Initially the patient received supportive care only, but her general condition rapidly became worse three months later. The monoblasts and promonocytes in the bone marrow rose to 20.5%. After two cycles of combined chemotherapy she obtained complete remission. METHODS: Chromosome specimens were prepared by short-term culture of bone marrow cells. Karyotype analysis was carried out by R-banding technique. Three fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses were performed using AML1-ETO dual color, dual fusion probe, whole chromosome painting 8 and 21 probes, and cen-8 and Tel 21qter probes, respectively. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for detecting the AML1-ETO fusion transcript was also performed. RESULTS: Conventional cytogenetic analysis showed a karyotype of 46,XX,ins(8;21) (q22;q22.1q22.3)[7]/46,XX[3]. FISH tests confirmed the insertion. RT-PCR analysis detected the AML1-ETO fusion transcript.

METHODS: Six ALL patients who received sex-mismatched allo-HSCT and manifested extravisceral lymphadenectasis or local lump were investigated. The sex chromosome chimeric status in tumor tissues and bone marrows (BM) were monitored by FISH, and EBV-RNA in the tumor tissues were detected by in situ hybridization (ISH). RESULTS: The sex chromosomes in BM of all 6 patients were 100% donor-derived. Among the sex chromosome chimeric status of tumor tissues, three patients were mainly recipient-derived, and the percentage of sex chromosomes derived from recipients were 100%, 100% and 98.0%, respectively, and then they were diagnosed leukemic extramedullary relapse. The other 3 patients were donor-derived, the percentage was 98.5%, 96.0% and 91.5%, respectively, and were diagnosed PTLD. EBV-RNA and latent membrane protein (LMP-1) were positive in 2 patients with PTLD and negative in the other 4 patients. One patient with extramedullary relapse obtained partial remission, one with PTLD gained complete remission, and the others died eventually after therapy.

The response rates for 102 patients in chronic phase were: complete hematologic, 94.1%; complete cytogenetic, 69.6%; and complete molecular response, 54.9%. For 14 patients in the accelerated phase, the respective response rates were 85.7, 35.7 and 28.6%. The 3-year progression-free survival and 5-year overall survival were 73.3 and 74.8%. Although skin hypopigmentation occurs as the most common side effect (77.6%), imatinib is still well tolerated. In addition to the known pretreatment characteristics of spleen size, leukocyte and platelet counts, disease phase and Sokal scores, we found that delayed therapy, variant Philadelphia chromosome translocations and IM-related grade 3/4 leucopenia were associated with an inferior cytogenetic response. Four factors emerged as predictors of disease progression: molecular response, cytogenetic response, disease phase and disease duration prior to imatinib treatment, but only the latter three remained significant after multivariate analysis. The results indicate that the suboptimal outcome in Chinese patients is associated with delayed imatinib therapy, so the importance of the optimal treatment opportunity for CML should be emphasized.","['Zhao, Yanmin', 'Liu, Lizhen', 'Wang, Yingjia', 'Wu, Gongqiang', 'Lai, Xiaoyu', 'Cao, Weijie', 'Luo, Yi', 'Tan, Yamin', 'Shi, Jimin', 'Xie, Wanzhuo', 'Ye, Xiujin', 'Cai, Zhen', 'Lin, Maofang', 'Huang, He']","['Zhao Y', 'Liu L', 'Wang Y', 'Wu G', 'Lai X', 'Cao W', 'Luo Y', 'Tan Y', 'Shi J', 'Xie W', 'Ye X', 'Cai Z', 'Lin M', 'Huang H']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, 79 Qingchun Road, 310003, Hangzhou, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, 79 Qingchun Road, 310003, Hangzhou, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, 79 Qingchun Road, 310003, Hangzhou, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, 79 Qingchun Road, 310003, Hangzhou, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, 79 Qingchun Road, 310003, Hangzhou, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, 79 Qingchun Road, 310003, Hangzhou, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, 79 Qingchun Road, 310003, Hangzhou, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, 79 Qingchun Road, 310003, Hangzhou, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, 79 Qingchun Road, 310003, Hangzhou, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, 79 Qingchun Road, 310003, Hangzhou, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, 79 Qingchun Road, 310003, Hangzhou, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, 79 Qingchun Road, 310003, Hangzhou, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, 79 Qingchun Road, 310003, Hangzhou, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, 79 Qingchun Road, 310003, Hangzhou, China. hehuang@medmail.com.cn.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090407,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Child', 'China', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Pyrimidines/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/04/08 09:00,2009/06/23 09:00,['2009/04/08 09:00'],"['2008/11/02 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/01/18 00:00 [revised]', '2009/04/08 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/23 09:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12185-009-0292-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-009-0292-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2009 May;89(4):445-451. doi: 10.1007/s12185-009-0292-7.

We previously established a mouse bone marrow-derived HF6, an IL-3-dependent cell line, that was immortalized by a class II mutation MLL/SEPT6 and can be fully transformed by class I mutations such as FLT3 mutants. To understand the molecular mechanism of leukemogenesis, particularly progression of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) to acute leukemia, we made cDNA libraries from the samples of patients and screened them by expression-cloning to detect class I mutations that render HF6 cells factor-independent. We identified RasGRP4, an activator of Ras, as a candidate for class I mutation from three of six patients (MDS/MPD = 1, MDS-RA = 1, MDS/AML = 2, CMMoL/AML = 1 and AML-M2 = 1). To investigate the potential roles of RasGRP4 in leukemogenesis, we tested its in vivo effect in a mouse bone marrow transplantation (BMT) model. C57BL/6J mice transplanted with RasGRP4-transduced primary bone marrow cells died of T cell leukemia, myeloid leukemia, or myeloid leukemia with T cell leukemia. To further examine if the combination of class I and class II mutations accelerated leukemic transformation, we performed a mouse BMT model in which both AML1 mutant (S291fsX300) and RasGRP4 were transduced into bone marrow cells. The double transduction led to early onset of T cell leukemia but not of AML in the transplanted mice when compared to transduction of RasGRP4 alone. Thus, we have identified RasGRP4 as a gene potentially involved in leukemogenesis and suggest that RasGRP4 cooperates with AML1 mutations in T cell leukemogenesis as a class I mutation.","['Watanabe-Okochi, Naoko', 'Oki, Toshihiko', 'Komeno, Yukiko', 'Kato, Naoko', 'Yuji, Koichiro', 'Ono, Ryoichi', 'Harada, Yuka', 'Harada, Hironori', 'Hayashi, Yasuhide', 'Nakajima, Hideaki', 'Nosaka, Tetsuya', 'Kitaura, Jiro', 'Kitamura, Toshio']","['Watanabe-Okochi N', 'Oki T', 'Komeno Y', 'Kato N', 'Yuji K', 'Ono R', 'Harada Y', 'Harada H', 'Hayashi Y', 'Nakajima H', 'Nosaka T', 'Kitaura J', 'Kitamura T']","['Division of Cellular Therapy, Advanced Clinical Research Center, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo, 108-8639, Japan.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, Advanced Clinical Research Center, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo, 108-8639, Japan.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, Advanced Clinical Research Center, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo, 108-8639, Japan.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, Advanced Clinical Research Center, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo, 108-8639, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular Therapy, Advanced Clinical Research Center, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Microbiology, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, Tsu-shi, Japan.', 'International Radiation Information Center, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.', ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Gunma Children's Medical Center, Shibukawa, Japan."", 'Division of Cellular Therapy, Advanced Clinical Research Center, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo, 108-8639, Japan.', 'Department of Microbiology, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, Tsu-shi, Japan.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, Advanced Clinical Research Center, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo, 108-8639, Japan.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, Advanced Clinical Research Center, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo, 108-8639, Japan. kitamura@ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090407,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Polymorphism, Genetic/genetics', 'ras Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/genetics/*metabolism']",2009/04/08 09:00,2009/06/23 09:00,['2009/04/08 09:00'],"['2009/01/25 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/02/24 00:00 [revised]', '2009/04/08 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/23 09:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12185-009-0299-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-009-0299-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2009 May;89(4):470-481. doi: 10.1007/s12185-009-0299-0.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This study included 56 patients with CML and 55 sex- and age-matched healthy controls. All participants underwent abdominal ultrasonography and the main clinical and laboratory characteristics were recorded. RESULTS: Gallbladder stones were detected in 13 (23.6%) patients with CML and in 3 (5.4%) control individuals (p < 0.05). The mean follow-up period of CML patients after diagnosis was 54.6 months, range 3-120 months. Hemoglobin levels were higher in the control group than in CML patients. However, total bilirubin, unconjugated bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase levels, leukocyte and thrombocyte counts, frequency of splenomegaly and hepatomegaly were higher in the CML than in the control group (p < 0.05). Other clinical and laboratory values were not significantly different between the groups. CML patients with and without GBS were also compared for clinical and laboratory values. Age and follow-up period of CML patients after diagnosis were higher in the CML patients with GBS (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Higher prevalence of GBS in CML patients than in healthy controls was detected. We suggest that CML may increase the frequency of GBS, apart from other well-known risk factors. This risk is probably related to increased unconjugated bilirubin, which determines hemolysis, older age and long follow-up period of CML patients after diagnosis.","['Ates, Fehmi', 'Erkurt, Mehmet Ali', 'Karincaoglu, Melih', 'Aladag, Murat', 'Aydogdu, Ismet']","['Ates F', 'Erkurt MA', 'Karincaoglu M', 'Aladag M', 'Aydogdu I']","['Department of Gastroenterology, Inonu University School of Medicine, Malatya, Turkey. drfehmiates@hotmail.com']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090406,Switzerland,Med Princ Pract,"Medical principles and practice : international journal of the Kuwait University, Health Science Centre",8901334,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Gallstones/blood/*complications/diagnostic imaging/*epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*complications', 'Liver Function Tests', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prevalence', 'Risk Factors', 'Turkey/epidemiology', 'Ultrasonography']",2009/04/08 09:00,2009/08/06 09:00,['2009/04/08 09:00'],"['2008/06/05 00:00 [received]', '2009/04/08 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/06 09:00 [medline]']","['000204346 [pii]', '10.1159/000204346 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Princ Pract. 2009;18(3):175-9. doi: 10.1159/000204346.

Nonadherence is more prevalent than patients, physicians, and family members believe it is, and therefore should be assessed routinely. It is associated with poorer response to imatinib.

Progression along the T cell lineage further requires cooperative signaling provided by the interleukin 7 receptor (IL-7R), but the molecular mechanisms responsible for the dynamic and lineage-specific regulation of IL-7R during thymopoiesis are unknown. We show that active Notch1 binds to a conserved CSL-binding site in the human IL7R gene promoter and critically regulates IL7R transcription and IL-7R alpha chain (IL-7Ralpha) expression via the CSL-MAML complex. Defective Notch1 signaling selectively impaired IL-7Ralpha expression in T-lineage cells, but not B-lineage cells, and resulted in a compromised expansion of early human developing thymocytes, which was rescued upon ectopic IL-7Ralpha expression. The pathological implications of these findings are demonstrated by the regulation of IL-7Ralpha expression downstream of Notch1 in T cell leukemias. Thus, Notch1 controls early T cell development, in part by regulating the stage- and lineage-specific expression of IL-7Ralpha.","['Gonzalez-Garcia, Sara', 'Garcia-Peydro, Marina', 'Martin-Gayo, Enrique', 'Ballestar, Esteban', 'Esteller, Manel', 'Bornstein, Rafael', 'de la Pompa, Jose Luis', 'Ferrando, Adolfo A', 'Toribio, Maria L']","['Gonzalez-Garcia S', 'Garcia-Peydro M', 'Martin-Gayo E', 'Ballestar E', 'Esteller M', 'Bornstein R', 'de la Pompa JL', 'Ferrando AA', 'Toribio ML']","['Centro de Biologia Molecular Severo Ochoa, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Spain.']",,['eng'],"['R01 CA120196/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA120196-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090406,United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', 'Fetal Blood/immunology', 'Fetus/immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/genetics/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Organ Culture Techniques', 'Receptor, Notch1/immunology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-7/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Thymus Gland/growth & development/*immunology']",2009/04/08 09:00,2009/05/15 09:00,['2009/04/08 09:00'],"['2009/04/08 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/15 09:00 [medline]']","['jem.20081922 [pii]', '10.1084/jem.20081922 [doi]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2009 Apr 13;206(4):779-91. doi: 10.1084/jem.20081922.

The diagnosis and treatment of cockroach allergy has been impeded by the lack of standardized cockroach extracts. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the utility of a mediator release assay based on rat basophil leukemia (RBL) cells for comparing the potency of German cockroach extracts. METHODS: RBL cells (line 2H3) transfected with human FcepsilonRI were passively sensitized with sera from subjects with cockroach allergy and stimulated with serial dilutions of 3 commercial cockroach extracts (1:10 weight/volume). In addition, the in-house prepared extract was tested in separate experiments with pooled sera that produced optimal performance in the RBL assay. N-hexosaminidase release (NHR) was used as a marker of RBL cell degranulation and was examined in relation to the intradermal skin test (ID(50)EAL) and serum cockroach-specific and total IgE levels. RESULTS: The median cockroach-specific IgE concentration in 60 subjects was 0.72 kU(A)/L (interquartile range, 0.35-2.97 kU(A)/L); 19 sera (responders) produced a minimum 10% NHR to more than 1 extract. Responders had higher median cockroach-specific IgE (7.4 vs 1.0 kU(A)/L) and total IgE (429 vs 300 kU/L) levels than nonresponders. Ranking of extract potency was consistent between the mediator release assay and the ID(50)EAL. For the in-house prepared cockroach extract, the dose-response curves were shifted according to the concentration of the extract. NHR was reproducible between different experiments by using pooled sera. CONCLUSION: The mediator release assay measures biologic potency and correlates with the ID(50)EAL. It should be further evaluated to determine whether it could be used to replace intradermal skin test titration for assessing the potency of cockroach extract.","['Nowak-Wegrzyn, Anna H', 'Bencharitiwong, Ramon', 'Schwarz, John', 'David, Gloria', 'Eggleston, Peyton', 'Gergen, Peter J', 'Liu, Andrew H', 'Pongracic, Jacqueline A', 'Sarpong, Sampson', 'Sampson, Hugh A']","['Nowak-Wegrzyn AH', 'Bencharitiwong R', 'Schwarz J', 'David G', 'Eggleston P', 'Gergen PJ', 'Liu AH', 'Pongracic JA', 'Sarpong S', 'Sampson HA']","['Division of Pediatric Allergy and Immunology, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY 10029, USA. anna.nowak-wegrzyn@mssm.edu']",,['eng'],"['N01-AI-25482/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'N01AI25496/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'N01 AI025482/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'K23 AI059318/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'N01AI25482/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'K23 AI059318-01A1/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-AI-25496/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'N01 AI025496/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI 059318/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,J Allergy Clin Immunol,The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,1275002,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Allergens/*immunology', 'Animals', 'Basophils/*physiology', 'Cell Degranulation', 'Cell Line', 'Cockroaches/*immunology', 'Hexosaminidases/*metabolism', 'Histamine Release', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin E/blood', 'Middle Aged', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/physiology', 'Reproducibility of Results']",2009/04/08 09:00,2009/04/23 09:00,['2009/04/08 09:00'],"['2008/10/07 00:00 [received]', '2009/01/12 00:00 [revised]', '2009/01/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/04/08 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/23 09:00 [medline]']","['S0091-6749(09)00334-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jaci.2009.01.070 [doi]']",ppublish,J Allergy Clin Immunol. 2009 Apr;123(4):949-955.e1. doi: 10.1016/j.jaci.2009.01.070.,"['0 (Allergens)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', 'EC 3.2.1.- (Hexosaminidases)']",,,,PMC2952833,['NIHMS109184'],,,,,,,,,,,,

However, MT-I+II are downregulated in other types of tumors (e.g. hepatocellular, gastric, colorectal, central nervous system (CNS), and thyroid cancers) where MT-I+II is either inversely correlated or unrelated to mortality. Large discrepancies exist between different tumor types, and no distinct and reliable association exists between MT-I+II expression in tumor tissues and prognosis and therapy resistance. Furthermore, a parallel has been drawn between MT-I+II expression as a potential marker for prognosis, and MT-I+II's role as oncogenic factors, without any direct evidence supporting such a parallel.

The apoptotic genes (caspases, Bax, and TNF-alpha) were induced, and differentiation-related genes (CD14, ITGAM, and VIM) were increased. For acute phase protein genes, some were increased (TP53, JUN) while others were suppressed (c-myc, cyclin E). The expression of anti-angiogenesis genes THBS1 and CD36 and genes involved in tumor cell migration such as tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases, were also increased by JS-K.

Moreover, they promote cell survival of neurons, axons, and oligodendrocytes, as well as their precursors, in vitro and in lesional paradigms. In recent years, several functions of neurotrophic factors outside the nervous system have been described, with a special focus on the immune system as well as on models of autoimmune demyelination, such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). In the family of neurotrophins, nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were investigated. NGF may influence B-cell as well as T-cell function and particularly plays a role in macrophage migration into inflamed lesions. BDNF is produced by several immune-cell subtypes in vitro and also in multiple sclerosis (MS) plaques. This observation gave rise to the concept of neuroprotective autoimmunity, implying that immune-cell infiltration in the nervous system may not only be detrimental but may also play a beneficial role, for example, through the production of neurotrophic factors. In the family of neurotrophic cytokines, ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) share some common protective roles in axons and oligodendrocytes. In EAE, endogenous CNTF targets myelin, oligodendroglial cells, and axons. In contrast, LIF exerts protective functions on oligodendrocytes in some models but is also able to interact with the immune response and may modulate T-cell, monocyte and neutrophil functions. In summary, neurotrophic factors have distinct roles in the immune system during autoimmunity and may modulate immune responses as well as the susceptibility of the target tissue.","['Linker, Ralf', 'Gold, Ralf', 'Luhder, Fred']","['Linker R', 'Gold R', 'Luhder F']","['Department of Neurology, St. Josef Hospital Bochum, Ruhr-University Bochum, 44791 Bochum, Germany. ralf.linker@rub.de']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Crit Rev Immunol,Critical reviews in immunology,8914819,IM,"['Animals', 'Autoimmunity/immunology', 'Axons/*immunology/metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'Brain Diseases/*immunology/metabolism', 'Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/immunology/metabolism', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/immunology/metabolism', 'Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/*immunology/metabolism', 'Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/immunology/metabolism', 'Nerve Growth Factor/immunology/metabolism', 'Nerve Growth Factors/immunology/metabolism', 'Oligodendroglia/*immunology/metabolism', 'Oncostatin M/immunology/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism']",2009/04/08 09:00,2009/06/13 09:00,['2009/04/08 09:00'],"['2009/04/08 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/13 09:00 [medline]']","['00def2ef66921bbd,56b17d885eb0bb27 [pii]', '10.1615/critrevimmunol.v29.i1.20 [doi]']",ppublish,Crit Rev Immunol. 2009;29(1):43-68. doi: 10.1615/critrevimmunol.v29.i1.20.,"['0 (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '9061-61-4 (Nerve Growth Factor)']",,,267,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using this animal model, great progress in understanding the immunopathogenic mechanisms of uveitis was achieved not only in EAU, but also in many inflammatory disorders in humans. Intraocular inflammation is mediated by activated CD4+ T cells. However, the eye has a unique regional immune system which protects intraocular tissues from these pathogenic activated CD4+ T cells and contributes to the homeostasis of the intraocular microenvironment. In the present review article, the role of T cells in immunopathogenic mechanisms of ocular inflammatory disorders as well as in the regional defense system of the eye is highlighted. 1. Immunopathogenic mechanisms of EAU: Experiments using athymic nude rats as well as adoptive transfer of EAU by S-antigen-sensitized T lymphocytes into naive Lewis rats disclosed that T lymphocytes, particularly CD4+ T lymphocytes, play a central role in the immunopathogenic mechanisms of EAU. In addition, immunopharmacological studies showing the intense effects of cyclosporine on EAU with selective immunosuppression to T lymphocytes allowed us to use clinically the agent to treat patients with refractory uveitis of non-infectious origins, such as Behcet's disease. 2. Immunopathogenic mechanisms of uveitis in human: Two clinical uveitis entities commonly seen in Japan, i. e. Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease and human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) uveitis, were studied for their pathogenic mechanisms. (1) VKH disease: We established T cell clones from infiltrating cells in the eyes of VKH patients using limiting dilution methods. CD4+ T cell clones from VKH disease, but not from other uveitis entities, responded to tyrosinase, a melanocyte-associated antigen, and produced inflammatory cytokines, and the response was specific to tyrosinase. Furthermore, DataBank analysis disclosed that tyrosinase had a structural homology with an exogenous antigen, a glycoprotein peptide of cytomegalovirus (CMV). CD4+ T lymphocytes from VKH patients, but not from other diseases, which responded to both tyrosinase and CMV peptide. This indicates that molecular mimicry between CMV peptide and tyrosinase plays an important role in the immunopathogenic mechanisms by which CD4+ T lymphocytes are sensitized to autoantigen of tyrosinase and cause inflammation in VKH disease. (2) HTLV-1 uveitis: Similar to adult T cell leukemia and HTLV-1 associated myelopathy, uveitis in asymptomatic carriers of HTLV-1, prevalent in southern Kyushu, is a distinct clinical entity associated with HTLV-1, a human retrovirus. We analyzed ocular infiltrating cells and found that (a) HTLV-1-infected CD4+ T lymphocytes were significantly accumulated in the eye, and (b) HTLV-1-infected CD4+ T lymphocytes produced a large amount of various inflammatory cytokines. Thus, CD4+ T lymphocytes play a central role in the pathogenic mechanisms of HTLV-1 uveitis. 3. Regional defense system of the eye: As described above, CD4+ T lymphocytes made active by either autoantigens or exogenous pathogens, enter the eye and cause inflammatory responses. However, the eye is known to be an immune privileged site. We focused on ocular pigment epithelial cells because they form a blood-ocular barrier, and they may protect the eye immunologically from infiltrating inflammatory cells. Our major findings by in vitro experiments in mice are (a) ocular pigment epithelial cells have the capacity to suppress activated CD4+ T lymphocytes; (b) the mode of action of iris pigment epithelial cells (IPE) and retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE) are different: T lymphocyte suppression by IPE requires cell-to-cell contact, whereas suppression by RPE requires soluble factors, but not cell-to-cell contact; (c) both IPE and RPE have the capacity to generate regulatory T cells(Treg), thereby enhancing immune regulation in the eye. In conclusion, CD4+ T lymphocytes activated by either autoantigens or infectious agents play a central role in the pathogenic mechanisms of ocular inflammation, and ocular resident cells such as IPE and RPE suppress the pathogenic activated CD4+ T lymphocytes, thereby contributing to homeostasis of the eye.","['Mochizuki, Manabu']",['Mochizuki M'],"['Department of Ophthalmology & Visual Science, Tokyo Medical and Dental University Graduate School, Japan. m.manabu.oph@tmd.ac.jp']",,['jpn'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,Japan,Nippon Ganka Gakkai Zasshi,Nippon Ganka Gakkai zasshi,7505716,IM,"['Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Eye/*immunology', 'HTLV-I Infections/immunology', 'Homeostasis/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Uveitis/*immunology', 'Uveomeningoencephalitic Syndrome/immunology']",2009/04/08 09:00,2009/05/20 09:00,['2009/04/08 09:00'],"['2009/04/08 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/20 09:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Nippon Ganka Gakkai Zasshi. 2009 Mar;113(3):344-77; discussion 378.,,,,145,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interestingly, in most cases, the stem cell exhaustion due to oncogenic alterations is preceded by an abnormal expansion of stem/progenitor cells. This preceding stem/progenitor cell expansion may be a key feature that still promotes cancer development, along with cooperating hits that rescue stem cell exhaustion.

GM-CSF also enhances antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity against CLL cells.

Here we review recent evidence that cases with TP53 mutation in the absence of the deletion of 17p have a similar clinical and biological course as cases carrying the deletion 17p. In addition, other principal components of the DNA damage pathway reportedly are de-regulated by mutation (ATM), deletion (ATM) or potentially more complex down-regulation (miR-34a) in CLL. Nonetheless, challenges remain because we can only explain resistance in a proportion of the cases that are resistant to first line treatment.

They have essential roles in development, cell differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis and chromosome structure. MiRNAs constitute about 3-5% of predicted genes in the human genome (i.e. about 1000); and 20-30% of the protein-coding genes are estimated to be regulated by the miRNAs. The primary evidence that miRNAs possibly act as a novel class of oncogenes/tumor-suppressors comes from the discovery of the miR-15a and miR-16-1 in 13q14 region deleted in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Moreover, miRNA signatures have been used to classify tumor types. There have recently been several reports on the miRNAs role in CLL pathogenesis and disease subtypes (according to IgV(H) mutation status). In this report, we will review the published observations and present our miRNA profiling data in aggressive CLL with TP53 abnormalities (deletion and/or mutation of p53 gene). We have identified a deregulated miRNA expression pattern (down regulation of miR-34a, miR-29 and miR-17-5p) in these samples, compared to cells with wild-type TP53. It has previously been shown that miR-34a is directly regulated by p53 and targets BCL-2, miR-29c regulates the MCL-1 and TCL-1 proto-oncogenes and the miR-17-5p targets important cell cycle regulatory molecules.

Despite extensive investigations, no point mutations have been found in the remaining allele that would inactivate one of the candidate tumor suppressor genes and explain the pathomechanism postulated for this region. However, the genes in the region are significantly down-regulated in CLL cells, more than would be expected by gene dosage, and recently a complex epigenetic regulatory mechanism was identified for 13q14.3 in non-malignant cells that involves asynchronous replication timing and monoallelic expression of candidate tumor suppressor genes. Here, we propose a model of a multigenic pathomechanism in 13q14.3, where several tumor suppressor genes, including the miRNA genes miR-16-1 and miR-15a, are co-regulated by the two long non-coding RNA genes DLEU1 and DLEU2 that span the critical region. Furthermore, we propose these co-regulated genes to be involved in the same molecular pathways, thereby also forming a functional gene cluster. Elucidating the molecular and cellular function of the 13q14.3 candidate genes will shed light on the underlying pathomechanism of CLL.","['Mertens, Daniel', 'Philippen, Angela', 'Ruppel, Melanie', 'Allegra, Danilo', 'Bhattacharya, Nupur', 'Tschuch, Cordula', 'Wolf, Stephan', 'Idler, Irina', 'Zenz, Thorsten', 'Stilgenbauer, Stephan']","['Mertens D', 'Philippen A', 'Ruppel M', 'Allegra D', 'Bhattacharya N', 'Tschuch C', 'Wolf S', 'Idler I', 'Zenz T', 'Stilgenbauer S']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany. daniel.mertens@uniklinik-ulm.de']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/etiology/*genetics', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Models, Biological', 'RNA, Long Noncoding', 'Transferases', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics']",2009/04/07 09:00,2009/08/18 09:00,['2009/04/07 09:00'],"['2009/04/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/18 09:00 [medline]']","['910217687 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190902763509 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2009 Mar;50(3):502-5. doi: 10.1080/10428190902763509.,"['0 (DLEU1 lncRNA, human)', '0 (DLEU2 lncRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN15 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN16 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.- (Transferases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this context, TOSO, also known as Fas-inhibitory molecule 3, was identified as a candidate gene over-expressed in CLL. TOSO is a transmembrane protein that inhibits Fas-mediated apoptosis by binding Fas-associated death domain via its C-terminal intracellular domain. In CLL, high levels of TOSO expression have been correlated with more aggressive disease, being associated with high leukocyte count, advanced Binet stage, need for chemotherapy and unmutated IgV(H) gene status. Also, the CD38(+) CLL subset with proliferative activity showed enhanced TOSO expression. B-cell receptor-stimulation was identified as positive regulator of TOSO expression, potentially providing a functional mechanism for aberrant TOSO expression in CLL. In contrast, CD40-ligand signalling reduces expression of TOSO, possibly explaining previously observed Fas-sensitisation by CD40-ligand in gene therapy trials. Both the association with unmutated IgV(H) gene status and the specific induction of TOSO via the BCR suggest autoreactive BCR signalling involving TOSO as a mediator of resistance to apoptosis in CLL. Further studies will reveal the functional context of TOSO in CLL and B cell biology. Surface expression of TOSO will enable antibody-based targeting of this novel CLL-antigen.","['Pallasch, Christian Philipp', 'Wendtner, Clemens Martin']","['Pallasch CP', 'Wendtner CM']","['Laboratory of Cellular Immunotherapy, Clinic I of Internal Medicine, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany. christian.pallasch@uk-koeln.de']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis']",2009/04/07 09:00,2009/08/18 09:00,['2009/04/07 09:00'],"['2009/04/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/18 09:00 [medline]']","['910219141 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190902763491 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2009 Mar;50(3):498-501. doi: 10.1080/10428190902763491.,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (FCMR protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",,,13,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The clinical implications of MBL may differ depending on whether an individual with a normal lymphocyte count is identified via a screening assay (screening MBL) or identified through clinical evaluation of lymphocytosis (clinical MBL). The B-cell count used to distinguish between clinical MBL (<5 x 10(9)/L) and CLL (> or = 5 x 10(9)/L) was selected largely based on tradition and technological advances and it is unknown whether the natural history of 'clinical MBL' differs from that of patients with Rai stage 0 CLL. Since, a diagnosis of 'leukemia' may lead to profound psychologic distress for patients, we believe the diagnosis of CLL should be based on an individual's risk of developing symptoms, requiring chemotherapeutic treatment and/or dying of disease.

Despite a phenotype similar to chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the possibility exists that most cases are not necessarily a pre-leukemic condition. This is suggested by the fact that MBL is at least 100 times more frequent than CLL and the diagnosis of CLL is not an inevitable fate, even among MBL cases with lymphocytosis, where it occurs only in 1.1% of the cases per year. The high incidence of MBL, if coupled with the possibility of evolution into a frank leukemic state, poses evident clinical and health system concerns. MBL in the general population usually accounts for a very low number of all circulating B-cells, being <10% of all B lymphocytes. This creates the need for a better characterisation of MBL at molecular level, aiming to identify biological features that may define which cases are more likely to progress towards clinically overt CLL. This approach should also help to avoid unnecessary and prolonged follow-ups in all individuals carrying MBL, excluding those who are extremely unlikely to develop CLL.","['Dagklis, Antonis', 'Fazi, Claudia', 'Scarfo, Lydia', 'Apollonio, Benedetta', 'Ghia, Paolo']","['Dagklis A', 'Fazi C', 'Scarfo L', 'Apollonio B', 'Ghia P']","['Department of Oncology and Division of Molecular Oncology, Laboratory and Unit of Lymphoid Malignancies, Universita Vita-Salute San Raffaele e Istituto Scientifico San Raffaele, Milano, Italy.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Clone Cells', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Lymphocytosis/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Mass Screening']",2009/04/07 09:00,2009/08/18 09:00,['2009/04/07 09:00'],"['2009/04/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/18 09:00 [medline]']","['910218458 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190902763475 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2009 Mar;50(3):490-2. doi: 10.1080/10428190902763475.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aberrant methylation in the sample of patients with CLL was shown for secreted frizzled-related protein 1 (68.8%), secreted frizzled-related protein 2 (65.6%), death-associated protein kinase 1 (50.0%), E-cadherin (21.9%), secreted frizzled-related protein 4 (15.6%), p15 (9.4%), p16 (6.3%), retinoic acid receptor beta2 (3.1%), secreted frizzled-related protein 5 (3.1%) and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases 3 (3.1%).

The ability to isolate, maintain, and characterize tumor-specific T cells is a prerequisite to studying anticancer immune response and developing novel strategies for cancer immunotherapy. However, the life span of human T cells in vitro is usually short and is limited by the onset of cellular senescence. To establish long-term, antigen-specific T-cell lines and clones, we selectively immortalized antigen-responsive T cells from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). PBMCs were stimulated with antigens, and then infected with a murine leukemia virus-based retroviral vector carrying an immortalizing gene, the human telomerase-reverse transcriptase gene. Since such vectors can only integrate in dividing cells, only antigen-activated T cells are efficiently transduced. Using this approach, we generated immortalized T-cell lines that maintained strictly IL-2-dependent growth and MHC-restricted, antigen-specific responsiveness, some of which have been in continuous culture for longer than 1 year, far in excess of the survival of parallel control nonimmortalized cultures. These lines showed antigen-specific proliferation with induced cytokine and chemokine production, and, in the case of CD8+ T-cell lines, antigen-specific cytolytic activity. When applied to the tumor antigen-specific T cells, the approach provides a convenient, reproducible means for generating a stable, continuously renewable source of antigen-specific T lymphocytes for a variety of studies on anticancer immunity.","['Barsov, Eugene V']",['Barsov EV'],"['AIDS Vaccine Program, SAIC-Frederick/NCI-Frederick, Frederick, MD, USA.']",,['eng'],['N01-CO-12400/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,IM,"['*Cell Culture Techniques', '*Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Separation/methods', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', '*Neoplasms/immunology/pathology', 'Retroviridae/genetics/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology/immunology', 'Telomerase/genetics/metabolism']",2009/04/07 09:00,2009/05/19 09:00,['2009/04/07 09:00'],"['2009/04/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/19 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-59745-447-6_6 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2009;511:143-58. doi: 10.1007/978-1-59745-447-6_6.,['EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The replication-incompetent viruses induce rapid malignant transformation of erythroid precursor cells. Transformed cell lines from mice infected with the complex can be induced to undergo erythrodifferentiation in vitro. However, lines containing the anemia-type virus require erythropoietin and another agent such as dimethyl sulfoxide for optimal erythrodifferentiation, whereas those containing the polycythemia-type virus do not require or respond to erythropoietin. Mice infected with the original Friend virus isolates were anemic, so sub-lines derived from these mice should be erythropoietin-dependent for induction of erythrodifferentiation. However, many of the widely studied sub-lines are erythropoietin-independent. In order to clarify this apparent anomaly, the genomes of viruses present in two commonly used erythropoietin-independent sub-lines were sequenced. Sequence analysis demonstrates that they contain the polycythemia-type virus and not the anemia-type virus.","['Scher, William', 'Jing, Yongkui', 'Lu, Min', 'Bishop, David F', 'Scher, Barbara M']","['Scher W', 'Jing Y', 'Lu M', 'Bishop DF', 'Scher BM']","['Department of Pathology, Mount Sinai Medical Center, 1194, One Gustave L.

After this, she developed fluctuations in her level of consciousness and seizures. After cessation of therapy with posaconazole, a complete resolution of the above occurred within 7 days. This case illustrates the possibility of vincristine toxicity exacerbated by coadministration of posaconazole. As posaconazole is an inhibitor of the isoenzyme CYP3A4, interactions with drugs that are metabolized via this pathway, such as vincristine, can be anticipated. Another possibility is that, like itraconazole, posaconazole may also inhibit P-glycoprotein-mediated vincristine efflux.

We retrospectively identified all positive blood cultures in oncology patients at the British Columbia Children's Hospital for a period of 54 months. VGS was the second most commonly isolated pathogen, present in 19% of all the positive blood cultures. Susceptibility analysis of 46 VGS isolates from that period was performed using the Etest method for penicillin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and piperacillin/tazobactam. The geometric mean minimal inhibitory concentration for ceftazidime was found to be 9 to 12-fold higher than for any other beta-lactam antibiotic. Penicillin resistance was of 13% with an additional 20% of samples with intermediate susceptibility. The study underscores the prevalence of VGS bacteremia in pediatric patients, especially with acute myeloid leukemia or postallogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and the in vitro inferiority of ceftazidime compared with other beta-lactams in that context. We conclude that monotherapy with ceftazidime, or its use along with an aminoglycoside, is not an optimal therapy in pediatric oncology patients with febrile neutropenia.","['Paulus, Stephane', 'Dobson, Simon', 'Rassekh, Shahrad', 'Blondel-Hill, Edith']","['Paulus S', 'Dobson S', 'Rassekh S', 'Blondel-Hill E']","[""Division of Immunological and Infectious Diseases, Department of Paediatrics, British Columbia Children's Hospital, Vancouver, BC, Canada. scfpaulus@gmail.com""]",,['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,IM,"['Aminoglycosides/pharmacology', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology', 'Bacteremia/complications/*drug therapy/microbiology', 'Cefotaxime/pharmacology', 'Ceftazidime/*pharmacology', 'Child', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Penicillanic Acid/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Penicillins/pharmacology', 'Piperacillin/pharmacology', 'Piperacillin, Tazobactam Drug Combination', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Streptococcal Infections/complications/*drug therapy/microbiology', 'Viridans Streptococci/*drug effects/growth & development', 'beta-Lactam Resistance']",2009/04/07 09:00,2009/04/30 09:00,['2009/04/07 09:00'],"['2009/04/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/30 09:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MPH.0b013e31819a5d40 [doi]', '00043426-200904000-00006 [pii]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2009 Apr;31(4):267-9. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e31819a5d40.,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Penicillins)', '157044-21-8 (Piperacillin, Tazobactam Drug Combination)', '87-53-6 (Penicillanic Acid)', '9M416Z9QNR (Ceftazidime)', 'N2GI8B1GK7 (Cefotaxime)', 'X00B0D5O0E (Piperacillin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PURPOSE: To assess (1) the effect of a home-based nutrition and exercise intervention program on cardiovascular fitness, strength, and flexibility in children with ALL during maintenance therapy and (2) the feasibility of conducting and evaluating a home-based exercise and nutrition program in this patient population. DESIGN: Children ages 4 to 10 years with standard-risk ALL were randomized when starting maintenance therapy to a 12-month home-based exercise and nutrition program (n=6, 3 males/3 females) or control (n=7, 4 males/3 females) group. Assessment of anthropometrics, dietary intake, physical activity, and fitness was performed at baseline and 6 and 12 months of study. RESULTS: Although age, body size, and nutrient intakes were similar between both subject groups at 0, 6, and 12 months, exercise and nutrition program children had greater improvement in physical activity and cardiovascular fitness between 6 and 12 months than control children. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that a home-based exercise intervention during maintenance therapy encouraged greater physical activity and improved cardiovascular fitness in children with standard-risk ALL. Further investigation involving larger populations of children with ALL is warranted.","['Moyer-Mileur, Laurie J', 'Ransdell, Lynda', 'Bruggers, Carol S']","['Moyer-Mileur LJ', 'Ransdell L', 'Bruggers CS']","['Department of Pediatrics, Center for Pediatric Nutrition Research, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', '*Child Nutritional Physiological Phenomena', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Diet Records', 'Eating', '*Exercise', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Motor Activity', 'Nutrition Assessment', 'Physical Fitness', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diet therapy/*drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/04/07 09:00,2009/04/30 09:00,['2009/04/07 09:00'],"['2009/04/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/30 09:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MPH.0b013e3181978fd4 [doi]', '00043426-200904000-00005 [pii]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2009 Apr;31(4):259-66. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e3181978fd4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As can be seen in the summaries of the individual presentations, significant progress has been made in developing preclinical models of pediatric tumors and a variety of novel immunobiologic therapies are approaching, or already in, the clinic. Although there is much excitement about the potential utility of these agents, a great deal of challenges lie ahead in improving the efficacy of each of these modalities and getting them to patients in a timely fashion.

AIM: Study incidence and subtypes of BAL, correlate with age, morphology, and cytogenetic findings and correlate the clinico-hematological data with the treatment response. St Jude's and the EGIL's criteria have been compared for their diagnostic and clinical relevance. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Diagnosis was based on WHO classification, including clinical details, morphology, cytochemistry, immunophenotyping, and molecular genetics. We included those cases, which fulfilled the European Group for the Immunological Characterization of Acute Leukemia's (EGIL's) scoring system criteria for the diagnosis of BAL, as per recommendation of the WHO classification. RESULTS: There were 32 patients diagnosed with BAL, based on EGIL's criteria. Incidence of BAL was 1.2%. B-Myeloid (14 cases) followed by T-Myeloid BAL (13 cases) were the commonest subtypes. Polymorphous population of blasts (16 cases) was commonly associated with T-Myeloid BAL (10 cases). BCR ABL fusion positivity was a common cytogenetic abnormality (seven cases). Fifteen patients received chemotherapy; eight achieved complete remission (CR) at the end of the induction period. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric BAL and T-B lymphoid BAL have a better prognosis. A comprehensive panel of reagents is required, including cytoplasmic markers; to diagnose BAL. St Jude's criteria is a simple, easy, and cost-effective method to diagnose BAL. The outcome-related prognostic factors include age, HLA-DR, CD34 negativity, and subtype of BAL.

Instead, our data indicate that Gfi1 loss of function deregulates 2 separable transcriptional programs, one of which controls the accumulation and lineage specification of myeloid progenitors, but not terminal granulopoiesis. We demonstrate that Gfi1 directly represses HoxA9, Pbx1, and Meis1 during normal myelopoiesis. Gfi1-/- progenitors exhibit elevated levels of HoxA9, Pbx1 and Meis1, exaggerated HoxA9-Pbx1-Meis1 activity, and progenitor transformation in collaboration with oncogenic K-Ras. Limiting HoxA9 alleles corrects, in a dose-dependent manner, in vivo and in vitro phenotypes observed with loss of Gfi1 in myeloid progenitor cells but did not rescue Gfi1-/- blocked granulopoiesis. Thus, Gfi1 integrates 2 events during normal myeloid differentiation; the suppression of a HoxA9-Pbx1-Meis1 progenitor program and the induction of a granulopoietic transcription program.","['Horman, Shane R', 'Velu, Chinavenmeni S', 'Chaubey, Aditya', 'Bourdeau, Tristan', 'Zhu, Jinfang', 'Paul, William E', 'Gebelein, Brian', 'Grimes, H Leighton']","['Horman SR', 'Velu CS', 'Chaubey A', 'Bourdeau T', 'Zhu J', 'Paul WE', 'Gebelein B', 'Grimes HL']","[""Division of Immunobiology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, OH 45229, USA.""]",,['eng'],"['R01 HL079574/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA105152/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL079574/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA105152/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090403,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Embryonic Development/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Granulocyte Precursor Cells/metabolism/*physiology', 'Granulocytes/metabolism/*physiology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic/physiology']",2009/04/07 09:00,2009/06/17 09:00,['2009/04/07 09:00'],"['2009/04/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/17 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)37384-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-09-179747 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 May 28;113(22):5466-75. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-09-179747.

However, because few Scl target genes have been validated to date, the underlying mechanisms have remained largely unknown. In this study, we have used ChIP-Seq technology (coupling chromatin immunoprecipitation with deep sequencing) to generate a genome-wide catalog of Scl-binding events in a stem/progenitor cell line, followed by validation using primary fetal liver cells and comprehensive transgenic mouse assays. Transgenic analysis provided in vivo validation of multiple new direct Scl target genes and allowed us to reconstruct an in vivo validated network consisting of 17 factors and their respective regulatory elements. By coupling ChIP-Seq in model cell lines with in vivo transgenic validation and sophisticated bioinformatic analysis, we have identified a widely applicable strategy for the reconstruction of stem cell regulatory networks in which biologic material is otherwise limiting. Moreover, in addition to revealing multiple previously unrecognized links to known HSC regulators, as well as novel links to genes not previously implicated in HSC function, comprehensive transgenic analysis of regulatory elements provided substantial new insights into the transcriptional control of several important hematopoietic regulators, including Cbfa2t3h/Eto2, Cebpe, Nfe2, Zfpm1/Fog1, Erg, Mafk, Gfi1b, and Myb.","['Wilson, Nicola K', 'Miranda-Saavedra, Diego', 'Kinston, Sarah', 'Bonadies, Nicolas', 'Foster, Samuel D', 'Calero-Nieto, Fernando', 'Dawson, Mark A', 'Donaldson, Ian J', 'Dumon, Stephanie', 'Frampton, Jonathan', ""Janky, Rekin's"", 'Sun, Xiao-Hong', 'Teichmann, Sarah A', 'Bannister, Andrew J', 'Gottgens, Berthold']","['Wilson NK', 'Miranda-Saavedra D', 'Kinston S', 'Bonadies N', 'Foster SD', 'Calero-Nieto F', 'Dawson MA', 'Donaldson IJ', 'Dumon S', 'Frampton J', 'Janky R', 'Sun XH', 'Teichmann SA', 'Bannister AJ', 'Gottgens B']","['University of Cambridge, Department of Haematology, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Cambridge, United Kingdom.']",,['eng'],"['G0800784/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_U105161047/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",20090403,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/metabolism/*physiology', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Embryo, Mammalian/blood supply', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Genome', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Models, Biological', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2009/04/07 09:00,2009/06/17 09:00,['2009/04/07 09:00'],"['2009/04/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/17 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)37383-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-01-200048 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 May 28;113(22):5456-65. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-01-200048.

Bioinformatics identified 111 transmembrane proteins, some of which were profiled in primary MCL cases, MCL-derived cell lines, and normal B cells using RT-PCR and Western blotting. Several transmembrane proteins, including CD27, CD70, and CD31 (PECAM-1), were overexpressed when compared with normal B cells. CD70 was up-regulated (>10-fold) in three of five MCL patients along with its cognate receptor CD27, which was up-regulated (4-9-fold) in five of five patients, suggesting that MCL cells may undergo autocrine stimulation via this signaling pathway. Activated calpain I and protein kinase C betaII were also detected in the plasma membranes, suggesting that these proteins are constitutively active in MCL. Protein kinase C betaII has been associated with lipid rafts, and shotgun proteomics/protein profiling revealed that key lipid raft proteins, raftlin (four of five patients) and CSK (C-terminal Src kinase)-binding protein (Cbp)/phosphoprotein associated with glycosphingolipid-enriched microdomains (PAG) (four of four patients) were down-regulated in MCL. Levels of other known lipid raft proteins, such as Lyn kinase and flotillin 1, were similar to normal B cells. However, 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO), a key enzyme in leukotriene biosynthesis, was associated with lipid rafts and was up-regulated approximately 7-fold in MCL compared with normal B cells. Significantly inhibitors of 5-LO activity (AA861) and 5-LO-activating protein (FLAP) (MK886, its activating enzyme) induced apoptosis in MCL cell lines and primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells, indicating an important role for the leukotriene biosynthetic pathway in MCL and other B cell malignancies. Thus, using shotgun proteomics and mRNA and protein expression profiling we identified a subset of known and unknown transmembrane proteins with aberrant expression in MCL plasma membranes. These proteins may play a role in the pathology of the disease and are potential therapeutic targets in MCL.","['Boyd, Robert S', 'Jukes-Jones, Rebekah', 'Walewska, Renata', 'Brown, David', 'Dyer, Martin J S', 'Cain, Kelvin']","['Boyd RS', 'Jukes-Jones R', 'Walewska R', 'Brown D', 'Dyer MJ', 'Cain K']","['Medical Research Council, University of Leicester, Leicester, United Kingdom.']",,['eng'],['MC_U132670597/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090402,United States,Mol Cell Proteomics,Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,101125647,IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase/metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Computational Biology', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/analysis', 'Lipoxygenase Inhibitors', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/*chemistry/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Microdomains/chemistry', 'Membrane Proteins/*analysis', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis', 'Protein Array Analysis/*methods', 'Protein Kinase C/analysis', 'Protein Kinase C beta', 'Proteomics/methods', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2009/04/07 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/04/07 09:00'],"['2009/04/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S1535-9476(20)34031-7 [pii]', '10.1074/mcp.M800515-MCP200 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Proteomics. 2009 Jul;8(7):1501-15. doi: 10.1074/mcp.M800515-MCP200.

Almost nothing however, is known about the cytotoxic effects of dihydrosanguinarine, a metabolite of sanguinarine. We compared the cytotoxicity of sanguinarine and dihydrosanguinarine in human leukemia HL-60 cells. Sanguinarine produced a dose-dependent decline in cell viability with IC(50) (inhibitor concentration required for 50% inhibition of cell viability) of 0.9 microM as determined by MTT assay after 4h exposure. Dihydrosanguinarine showed much less cytotoxicity than sanguinarine: at the highest concentration tested (20 microM) and 24h exposure, dihydrosanguinarine decreased viability only to 52%. Cytotoxic effects of both alkaloids were accompanied by activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway since we observed the dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential, induction of caspase-9 and -3 activities, the appearance of sub-G(1) DNA and loss of plasma membrane asymmetry. This aside, sanguinarine also increased the activity of caspase-8. As shown by flow cytometry using annexin V/propidium iodide staining, 0.5 microM sanguinarine induced apoptosis while 1-4 microM sanguinarine caused necrotic cell death.

Primary monocytes or monocyte-derived macrophages do not proliferate on a suitable scale so that their use for functional studies in vitro is limited. Immortal proliferating cell lines, such as the human THP-1 monocytic leukemia cell line, are therefore often used instead of primary cells. Transfection is a useful tool to study the function of gene products, but transfection of THP-1 monocytes and pre-differentiated THP-1 macrophages with subsequent differentiation into mature THP-1 macrophages using phorbol esters is usually accompanied by a progressive loss of cell viability. In this study, we describe a simple and rapid approach for efficient transfection of THP-1 monocytes and pre-differentiated THP-1 macrophages using a modified Nucleofection-based approach.

We aimed to systematically add back genetically engineered donor lymphocytes to facilitate immune reconstitution and prevent late mortality. METHODS: In a phase I-II, multicentre, non-randomised trial of haploidentical stem-cell transplantation, we infused donor lymphocytes expressing herpes-simplex thymidine kinase suicide gene (TK-cells) after transplantation. The primary study endpoint was immune reconstitution defined as circulating CD3+ count of 100 cells per muL or more for two consecutive observations. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00423124. FINDINGS: From Aug 13, 2002, to March 26, 2008, 50 patients (median age 51 years, range 17-66) received haploidentical stem-cell transplants for high-risk leukaemia. Immune reconstitution was not recorded before infusion of TK-cells. 28 patients received TK-cells starting 28 days after transplantation; 22 patients obtained immune reconstitution at median 75 days (range 34-127) from transplantation and 23 days (13-42) from infusion. Ten patients developed acute GVHD (grade I-IV) and one developed chronic GVHD, which were controlled by induction of the suicide gene. Overall survival at 3 years was 49% (95% CI 25-73) for 19 patients who were in remission from primary leukaemia at the time of stem-cell transplantation. After TK-cell infusion, the last death due to infection was at 166 days, this was the only infectious death at more than 100 days. No acute or chronic adverse events were related to the gene-transfer procedure.

The quenching mechanism was suggested to be static quenching according to the fluorescence measurement. The thermodynamic parameters, enthalpy change (DeltaH) and entropy change (DeltaS) were calculated to be -19.89KJ/mol and 26.23J/mol/K, according to the Van't Hoff equation. These data suggested that hydrophobic interaction was the predominant intermolecular forces stabilizing the complex, which was in good agreement with the results of molecular modeling study. The effect of CDNR on the conformation of HSA was analyzed using synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy and UV/vis absorption spectroscopy.

When MDS progress towards AML (AML/MDS), additional genetic lesions cause a block in differentiation and an accumulation of blast cells. Hence, both pathophysiologically and clinically the MDS and AML/MDS phases are distinguishable. Leukemia cell lines are key resources for modelling hematological malignancies. Characterization of these cell lines has provided a rich vein of insights into the mechanisms underlying malignant transformation. Some 31 cell lines have been described in the literature purportedly established from patients with MDS. However, a significant minority of these has proved false after DNA profiling which revealed their cross-contamination with older established leukemia cell lines. Most remaining (""authentic"") MDS cell lines were established during the leukemic phase of the disease progression rather than during the MDS phase. Based on these data we have assigned the 31 candidate MDS cell lines to one of the three categories: (1) false (cross-contaminated) cell lines and non-malignant cell lines; (2) malignant cell lines established in the AML/MDS leukemic phase; and (3) apparently legitimate MDS cell lines established during the MDS phase. While MDS and AML/MDS cell lines both provide singular resources for modelling pathology, mining oncogenically modified macromolecules, and testing druggability, we contend these groups should be considered separately.","['Drexler, Hans G', 'Dirks, Willy G', 'Macleod, Roderick A F']","['Drexler HG', 'Dirks WG', 'Macleod RA']","['DSMZ, German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Department of Human and Animal Cell Lines, Braunschweig, Germany. hdr@dsmz.de']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20090402,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Genomic Instability', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Models, Biological', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes']",2009/04/07 09:00,2009/05/29 09:00,['2009/04/07 09:00'],"['2009/02/05 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/07 00:00 [revised]', '2009/03/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/04/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/29 09:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(09)00115-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2009.03.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2009 Aug;33(8):1011-6. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2009.03.005.

The mechanism underlying this induced protection is likely a general mechanism of endogenous protection which has been demonstrated in heart and brain using ischemia and reperfusion. While multiple factors like bFGF, CNTF, LIF and BDNF have been hypothesized to play a role in preconditioning-induced endogenous neuroprotection, it has not yet been demonstrated which factors or receptors are playing an essential role. Using quantitative PCR techniques we provide evidence that in the retina, LIFR activating cytokines leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1) and cardiotrophin like cytokine (CLC) are strongly upregulated in response to preconditioning with bright cyclic light leading to robust activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) in a time-dependent manner. Further, we found that blocking LIFR activation during preconditioning using a LIFR antagonist (LIF05) attenuated the induced STAT3 activation and also resulted in reduced preconditioning-induced protection of the retinal photoreceptors. These data demonstrate that LIFR and its ligands play an essential role in endogenous neuroprotective mechanisms triggered by preconditioning-induced stress.","['Chollangi, Srinivas', 'Wang, Jiangang', 'Martin, Aaron', 'Quinn, John', 'Ash, John D']","['Chollangi S', 'Wang J', 'Martin A', 'Quinn J', 'Ash JD']","['Department of Bioengineering, The University of Oklahoma, Norman, OK, USA.']",,['eng'],"['P20 RR017703/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 EY016459/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 EY016459-04/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 EY012190/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 EY016459-03/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090401,United States,Neurobiol Dis,Neurobiology of disease,9500169,IM,"['Analysis of Variance', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Electroretinography', 'Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', '*Oxidative Stress', 'Photic Stimulation', 'Photoreceptor Cells, Vertebrate/physiology', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism/toxicity', 'Retina/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism']",2009/04/07 09:00,2009/08/18 09:00,['2009/04/07 09:00'],"['2009/02/20 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/13 00:00 [revised]', '2009/03/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/04/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/18 09:00 [medline]']","['S0969-9961(09)00065-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.nbd.2009.03.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Neurobiol Dis. 2009 Jun;34(3):535-44. doi: 10.1016/j.nbd.2009.03.012.

In short, all the results showed that xanthone 1 had a significant cytotoxic effect and could induce proliferation inhibition and apoptosis in HL-60 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. It was possible that xanthone 1 could induce DNA damage in HL-60 cells, which resulted in G1 phase arrest at the lower concentrations and G2/M phase arrest at the higher concentrations, thus inhibiting the cell proliferation, and irreparable DNA damage at the higher concentrations might be responsible for the occurrence of apoptosis.","['Ding, Lan', 'Liu, Bo', 'Qi, Lin-Lin', 'Zhou, Qi-Yin', 'Hou, Qian', 'Li, Juan', 'Zhang, Qiong']","['Ding L', 'Liu B', 'Qi LL', 'Zhou QY', 'Hou Q', 'Li J', 'Zhang Q']","['College of Life Sciences, Northwest Normal University, No. 967 Anning East Road, Lanzhou 730070, PR China. dinglan@nwnu.edu.cn']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090122,England,Toxicol In Vitro,Toxicology in vitro : an international journal published in association with BIBRA,8712158,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Comet Assay', 'DNA Damage', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Gentianaceae/*chemistry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Plant Extracts/pharmacology', 'Plants, Medicinal/*chemistry', 'Tibet', 'Xanthones/isolation & purification/*pharmacology']",2009/04/07 09:00,2009/06/12 09:00,['2009/04/07 09:00'],"['2008/07/31 00:00 [received]', '2008/12/08 00:00 [revised]', '2009/01/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/04/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/12 09:00 [medline]']","['S0887-2333(09)00013-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.tiv.2009.01.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol In Vitro. 2009 Apr;23(3):408-17. doi: 10.1016/j.tiv.2009.01.010.

For hitherto unexplained reasons, deltaretroviruses cause hematological malignancies only in a minority of naturally infected organisms and after a very prolonged period of clinical latency. RESULTS: Here we demonstrate that the development of malignancies in sheep experimentally infected with the deltaretrovirus bovine leukemia virus (BLV) depends only on the level of BLV replication. Animals were experimentally infected with leukemogenic or attenuated, but infectious, BLV molecular clones and monitored prospectively through 8 months for viral replication. As early as 2 weeks after infection and subsequently at any time during follow-up, leukemogenic viruses produced significantly higher absolute levels of reverse transcription (RT), clonal expansion of infected cells, and circulating proviruses with RT- and somatic-dependent mutations than attenuated viruses. These differences were only quantitative, and both kinds of viruses triggered parallel temporal fluctuations of host lymphoid cells, viral loads, infected cell clonality and proliferation. CONCLUSION: Deltaretrovirus-associated leukemogenesis in sheep appears to be a two-hit process over time depending on the amounts of first horizontally and then vertically expanded viruses.","['Pomier, Carole', 'Alcaraz, Maria Teresa Sanchez', 'Debacq, Christophe', 'Lancon, Agnes', 'Kerkhofs, Pierre', 'Willems, Lucas', 'Wattel, Eric', 'Mortreux, Franck']","['Pomier C', 'Alcaraz MT', 'Debacq C', 'Lancon A', 'Kerkhofs P', 'Willems L', 'Wattel E', 'Mortreux F']","['CNRS FRE-3011-Universite Lyon I, Oncovirologie et Biotherapies, Centre Leon Berard, Lyon, France. ptepoms@yahoo.fr']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090403,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'DNA, Viral', '*Deltaretrovirus Infections/pathology/virology', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/genetics/*pathogenicity/*physiology', '*Leukemia, Experimental/pathology/virology', 'Sheep', '*Sheep Diseases/pathology/virology', '*Virus Replication']",2009/04/07 09:00,2009/06/06 09:00,['2009/04/07 09:00'],"['2008/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2009/04/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/04/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/06 09:00 [medline]']","['1742-4690-6-30 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-6-30 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2009 Apr 3;6:30. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-6-30.,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",,,,PMC2670259,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In AML11, cytogenetic group, age, white blood count, performance status and type of AML (de novo, secondary) were all highly significantly related to prognosis in multivariate analysis. The regression coefficients were used to define good, standard and poor risk groups, with 1-year survival of 53%, 43% and 16% respectively (P < 0.0001). The risk index showed very good discrimination in both AML14I and AML14NI (both P < 0.0001), thereby providing validation, although survival in all groups was very poor in AML14NI. The risk factors for survival in older AML patients were similar to those in younger ones and discrimination of patient groups with relatively good to very poor prognosis was possible. These risk groups apply to both intensively and non-intensively treated patients.

Although ABCB1 (MDR1) overexpression represents a critical mechanism of drug resistance, modulation of ABCB1 shows unsatisfactory clinical outcome. Recent studies showed that MCL1 was upregulated in numerous haematological and solid tumour malignancies. The present study found that patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed/refractory leukaemia expressed higher MCL1 levels than patients that were in complete remission. We demonstrated that overexpression of MCL1 decreased sensitivity of human leukaemia cell lines to cytotoxic drugs and inhibited drug-induced apoptosis. Specific downregulation of MCL1 via RNA interference sensitized multidrug resistant leukaemia cells towards chemotherapy and induced apoptosis. Our study also demonstrated that MCL1 and ABCB1 mediated drug resistance through different mechanisms and the depletion of both MCL1 and ABCB1 showed an additive effect in reversing drug resistance and promoting drug-induced apoptosis. Thus, this study documented an important role of MCL1 in drug resistance and apoptosis. Simultaneous targeting of MCL1 and ABCB1 could be a novel approach to overcome drug resistance in leukaemia.","['Ji, Min', 'Li, Jie', 'Yu, Haiqing', 'Ma, Daoxin', 'Ye, Jingjing', 'Sun, Xiulian', 'Ji, Chunyan']","['Ji M', 'Li J', 'Yu H', 'Ma D', 'Ye J', 'Sun X', 'Ji C']","['Department of Haematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, 107 West Wenhua Road, Jinan, Shandong, China.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090330,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*genetics', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western/methods', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chi-Square Distribution', '*Down-Regulation', 'Doxorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Transfection/methods']",2009/04/07 09:00,2009/08/04 09:00,['2009/04/07 09:00'],"['2009/04/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/04 09:00 [medline]']","['BJH7678 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.07678.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2009 Jun;145(5):648-56. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.07678.x.

This study investigated the in vivo homing of human B cell progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) cells to the femoral bone marrow of non-obese diabetic severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice. It was demonstrated that patient ALL cells use the chemokine axis, chemokine (CXC motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4)/ chemokine (CXC motif) ligand 12 (CXCL12), to home to the femoral marrow. CXCL12-mediated signalling through p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) was required for optimal homing. In contrast, the homing of normal peripheral blood CD34(+) cells and the cytokine-dependent CD34(+) cell line Mo7e was independent of p38MAPK, consistent with the dependence of these cells, as well as normal CD34(+) CD19(+) B cell progenitors, on PI-3K/AKT signalling. Altogether, our data provide clarification of the direct role of CXCL12 in the bone marrow homing of ALL cells and demonstrate unique signalling molecule usage that may have therapeutic implications for this disease.","['Juarez, Julius G', 'Thien, Marilyn', 'Dela Pena, Aileen', 'Baraz, Rana', 'Bradstock, Kenneth F', 'Bendall, Linda J']","['Juarez JG', 'Thien M', 'Dela Pena A', 'Baraz R', 'Bradstock KF', 'Bendall LJ']","['Westmead Institute for Cancer Research, University of Sydney at the Westmead Millennium Institute, Westmead Hospital, Westmead, NSW, Australia.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090306,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Benzylamines', 'Bone Marrow/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chemokine CXCL12/metabolism', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte/drug effects/*physiology', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Cyclams', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Heterocyclic Compounds/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, CXCR4/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism']",2009/04/07 09:00,2009/07/01 09:00,['2009/04/07 09:00'],"['2009/04/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/01 09:00 [medline]']","['BJH7648 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.07648.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2009 May;145(4):491-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.07648.x.

Aiming to better understand the diversity of genetic aberrations in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), pioneer studies investigated and confirmed the predictability of many cytogenetic and molecular subclasses in AML and ALL. In addition, GEP can define new prognostic subclasses within distinct leukaemia subgroups, as illustrated in AML with normal karyotype. Another approach is the development of treatment-specific sensitivity assays, which might contribute to targeted therapy studies. Finally, GEP might enable the detection of new molecular targets for therapy in patients with acute leukaemia. Meanwhile, large multicentre studies, e.g. the Microarray Innovations in LEukaemia (MILE) study, prepare for a standardised introduction of GEP in leukaemia diagnostic algorithms, aiming to translate this novel methodology into clinical routine for the benefit of patients with the complex disorders of AML and ALL.","['Bacher, Ulrike', 'Kohlmann, Alexander', 'Haferlach, Torsten']","['Bacher U', 'Kohlmann A', 'Haferlach T']","['Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, University Cancer Center Hamburg, Hamburg.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20090316,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/genetics']",2009/04/07 09:00,2009/08/04 09:00,['2009/04/07 09:00'],"['2009/04/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/04 09:00 [medline]']","['BJH7656 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.07656.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2009 Jun;145(5):555-68. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.07656.x.

Many haematological malignancies have aberrant activation of the mTOR and related signalling pathways. Accordingly, mTOR inhibitors, a class of signal transduction inhibitors that were originally developed as immunosuppressive agents, are being investigated in preclinical models and clinical trials for a number of haematological malignancies. Sirolimus and second-generation mTOR inhibitors, such as temsirolimus and everolimus, are safe and relatively well-tolerated, making them potentially attractive as single agents or in combination with conventional cytotoxics and other targeted therapies. Promising early clinical data suggests activity of mTOR inhibitors in a number of haematological diseases, including acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, chronic myeloid leukaemia, mantle cell lymphoma, anaplastic large cell lymphoma, and lymphoproliferative disorders. This review describes the rationale for using mTOR inhibitors in a variety of haematological diseases with a focus on their use in leukaemia.","['Teachey, David T', 'Grupp, Stephan A', 'Brown, Valerie I']","['Teachey DT', 'Grupp SA', 'Brown VI']","[""Division of Paediatric Hematology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, 3615 Civic Centre Boulevard, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA. teacheyd@email.chop.edu""]",,['eng'],"['K08 CA104882/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1K08 CA1 04882-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA102646/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 1116660/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 CA104882-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 102646/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20090316,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Autoimmune Diseases/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sirolimus/*therapeutic use', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases']",2009/04/07 09:00,2009/08/04 09:00,['2009/04/07 09:00'],"['2009/04/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/04 09:00 [medline]']","['BJH7657 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.07657.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2009 Jun;145(5):569-80. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.07657.x.

The ligand binds to a target cell antigen, and the target cell internalizes the immunotoxin, allowing the toxin to migrate to the cytoplasm where it can kill the cell. In the case of recombinant immunotoxins, the ligand and toxin are encoded in DNA that is then expressed in bacteria, and the purified immunotoxin contains the ligand and toxin fused together. Among the most active recombinant immunotoxins clinically tested are those that are targeted to hematologic malignancies. One agent, containing human interleukin-2 and truncated diphtheria toxin (denileukin diftitox), has been approved for use in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, and has shown activity in other hematologic malignancies, including leukemias and lymphomas. Diphtheria toxin has also been targeted by other ligands, including granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin-3, to target myelogenous leukemia cells. Single-chain antibodies containing variable heavy and light antibody domains have been fused to truncated Pseudomonas exotoxin to target lymphomas and lymphocytic leukemias. Recombinant immunotoxins anti-Tac(Fv)-PE38 (LMB-2), targeting CD25, and RFB4(dsFv)-PE38 (BL22, CAT-3888), targeting CD22, have each been tested in patients. Major responses have been observed after failure of standard chemotherapy.

Their serum concentrations show a wide interindividual variability. This study investigated whether the concentration of MBL and MASP-2 is associated with prognosis in pediatric patients with cancer. METHODS: In this retrospective multicenter study, MBL and MASP-2 were measured by commercially available ELISA in frozen remnants of serum taken at diagnosis. Associations of overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) with MBL and MASP-2 were assessed by multivariate Cox regression accounting for prognostically relevant clinical variables. RESULTS: In the 372 patients studied, median serum concentration of MBL was 2,808 microg/L (range, 2-10,060) and 391 microg/L (46-2,771) for MASP-2. The estimated 4-year EFS was 0.60 (OS, 0.78). In the entire, heterogeneous sample, MBL and MASP-2 were not significantly associated with OS or EFS. In patients with hematologic malignancies, however, higher MASP-2 was associated with better EFS in a significant and clinically relevant way (hazard ratio per tenfold increase (HR), 0.22; 95% CI, 0.09-0.54; P = 0.001). This was due to patients with lymphoma (HR, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.03-0.47; P = 0.003), but less for those with acute leukemia (HR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.11-1.15; P = 0.083). CONCLUSION: In this study, higher MASP-2 was associated with better EFS in pediatric patients with hematologic malignancies, especially lymphoma. Whether MASP-2 is an independent prognostic factor affecting risk stratification and anticancer therapy needs to be assessed in prospective, disease-specific studies.","['Zehnder, Aina', 'Fisch, Urs', 'Hirt, Andreas', 'Niggli, Felix K', 'Simon, Arne', 'Ozsahin, Hulya', 'Schlapbach, Luregn J', 'Ammann, Roland A']","['Zehnder A', 'Fisch U', 'Hirt A', 'Niggli FK', 'Simon A', 'Ozsahin H', 'Schlapbach LJ', 'Ammann RA']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*blood/*mortality', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mannose-Binding Lectin/*blood', 'Mannose-Binding Protein-Associated Serine Proteases/*metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",2009/04/04 09:00,2009/06/03 09:00,['2009/04/04 09:00'],"['2009/04/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/03 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22028 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2009 Jul;53(1):53-7. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22028.,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Mannose-Binding Lectin)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (MASP2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Mannose-Binding Protein-Associated Serine Proteases)']",,,,,,,"['Copyright 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,

Using this assay, we serially monitored T315I bcr-abl transcripts in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients whose bcr-abl transcripts were still detectable at 6 months after starting imatinib therapy. Although, we continued to monitor bcr-abl transcripts in 14 CML patients (13 chronic phases and 1 accelerated phase) for up to 12 months, there were no patients who were apparently resistant to imatinib due to the T315I mutation. In contrast, in a case of Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoid leukemia being treated with chemotherapy including imatinib, we monitored both wild-type and T315I bcr-abl transcripts, and found increased levels of T315I transcripts during relapse (0% at the time of diagnosis and 54.8% at relapse). Thus, our new approach could be a useful tool to study the kinetics of mutant clones and the pharmacokinetics of drug resistance with regard to the T315I mutation.","['Yamamoto, Masahide', 'Kakihana, Kazuhiko', 'Ohashi, Kazuteru', 'Yamaguchi, Toshikazu', 'Tadokoro, Kenichi', 'Akiyama, Hideki', 'Sakamaki, Hisashi']","['Yamamoto M', 'Kakihana K', 'Ohashi K', 'Yamaguchi T', 'Tadokoro K', 'Akiyama H', 'Sakamaki H']","['Hematology Division, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center, Komagome Hospital, 3-18-22 Honkomagome, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8677, Japan.', 'Hematology Division, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center, Komagome Hospital, 3-18-22 Honkomagome, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8677, Japan.', 'Hematology Division, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center, Komagome Hospital, 3-18-22 Honkomagome, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8677, Japan. k.ohashi@cick.jp.', 'Development of Clinical Genomics, BML, Saitama, Japan.', 'Development of Clinical Genomics, BML, Saitama, Japan.', 'Hematology Division, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center, Komagome Hospital, 3-18-22 Honkomagome, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8677, Japan.', 'Hematology Division, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center, Komagome Hospital, 3-18-22 Honkomagome, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8677, Japan.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090403,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*analysis/*genetics', '*Genetic Techniques', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/genetics']",2009/04/04 09:00,2009/06/23 09:00,['2009/04/04 09:00'],"['2008/09/19 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/02/17 00:00 [revised]', '2009/04/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/23 09:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12185-009-0290-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-009-0290-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2009 May;89(4):482-488. doi: 10.1007/s12185-009-0290-9.

The harbinger of CML is a chromosomal translocation that results in the synthesis of the BCR-ABL fusion protein, a constitutively active tyrosine kinase. The advent of imatinib, an inhibitor targeted specifically for BCR-ABL, represented a significant medical advance in CML therapy. However, patients with CML can exhibit varying responses to first-line treatment with imatinib. While most patients respond to treatment, some may experience a loss of response or require treatment discontinuation due to toxicity. Frequent monitoring for resistance or intolerance is a requirement for recognition of suboptimal response. Mutational analysis of the patient's BCR-ABL alleles is also informative and may be predictive of a response to therapy. Published physician guidelines have highlighted these recommendations, but it is not clear if these guidelines are universally followed. One option in patients showing poor response to standard-dose imatinib of 400 mg is to escalate the dose. However, this option should be reserved for patients with minimal disease burden. Clinically available options mainly include second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as dasatinib and nilotinib. Allogenic stem cell transplantations (for eligible patients) also should be considered. The disease and patient characteristics at the time of imatinib failure should be evaluated before choosing second-line therapy to optimize the therapeutic benefit without unnecessary delay.","['Jabbour, Elias', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Kantarjian, Hagop']","['Jabbour E', 'Cortes J', 'Kantarjian H']","['Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA. ejabbour@mdanderson.org']",,['eng'],['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20090130,France,Target Oncol,Targeted oncology,101270595,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Dasatinib', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Utilization', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology/*therapy', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Thiazoles/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Failure']",2009/04/04 09:00,2009/05/29 09:00,['2009/04/04 09:00'],"['2008/10/22 00:00 [received]', '2008/12/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/04/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/29 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11523-008-0100-y [doi]'],ppublish,Target Oncol. 2009 Jan;4(1):3-10. doi: 10.1007/s11523-008-0100-y.

Although research in this area may potentially translate into applications for human health, a basic understanding of the elasmobranch immune system components and how they function is essential. As in higher vertebrates, elasmobranch fishes possess thymus and spleen, but in the absence of bone marrow and lymph nodes, these fish have evolved unique lymphomyeloid tissues, namely epigonal and Leydig organs. As conditions for short-term culture of elasmobranch immune cells have become better understood, the opportunity to examine functional activity of cytokine-like factors derived from conditioned culture medium has resulted in the identification of growth inhibitory activity against a variety of tumor cell lines. Specifically, the medium enriched by short term culture of bonnethead shark (Sphyrna tiburo) epigonal cells (epigonal conditioned medium, ECM) has been shown to inhibit the growth of mammalian tumor cell lines, including fibrosarcoma (WEHI-164), melanoma (A375.S2), B-cell lymphoma (Daudi), T-cell leukemia (Jurkat), pancreatic cancer (PANC-1), ovarian cancer (NIH:OVCAR-3), and three breast carcinoma cell lines (MCF7, HCC38, Hs578T). Of the cell lines tested, WEHI-164, A375.S2, Daudi, and Jurkat cells were among the most sensitive to growth inhibitory activity of ECM whereas PANC-1 and NIH:OVCAR-3 cells were among the least sensitive. In addition, ECM demonstrated preferential growth inhibition of malignant cells in assays against two different malignant/non-malignant cell line pairs (HCC38/HCC38 BL and Hs 578T/Hs 578Bst). Separation of protein components of ECM using SDS-PAGE resulted in a very reproducible pattern of three major bands corresponding to molecular sizes of approximately 40-42 kD, 24 kD, and 17 kD. Activity is lost after heating at 75 degrees C for 30 min, and can be diminished by treatment with proteinase K and protease. Activity is not affected by treating with trypsin, DNase I or RNase A.","['Walsh, Catherine J', 'Luer, Carl A', 'Bodine, A B', 'Smith, Clayton A', 'Cox, Heather L', 'Noyes, David R', 'Maura, Gasparetto']","['Walsh CJ', 'Luer CA', 'Bodine AB', 'Smith CA', 'Cox HL', 'Noyes DR', 'Maura G']","['Mote Marine Laboratory, 1600 Ken Thompson Parkway, Sarasota, FL 34236, USA.']",,['eng'],"['R21 CA100523/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA100523-01A2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA100523-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],,England,Integr Comp Biol,Integrative and comparative biology,101152341,,,2006/12/01 00:00,2006/12/01 00:01,['2009/04/04 09:00'],"['2009/04/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2006/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.1093/icb/icl041 [doi]'],ppublish,Integr Comp Biol. 2006 Dec 1;46(6):1072-1081. doi: 10.1093/icb/icl041.,,,,,PMC2664222,['NIHMS89677'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The exact mechanism of bufalin-induced apoptosis is, however, still not clear. In this study, we demonstrated that bufalin inhibited the proliferation of gastric cancer MGC803 cells in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. At a low concentration (20 nmol/l), bufalin induced M-phase cell cycle arrest, whereas at a high concentration (80 nmol/l) it induced apoptosis in MGC803 cells. Bufalin increased the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and activated caspase-3 during the apoptotic process of MGC803 cells. It should be noted that bufalin transiently activated the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway and then inhibited it completely, and upregulated the Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl) family of ubiquitin ligases, upstream modulators of PI3K. A combination of bufalin and LY294002, a PI3K-specific inhibitor, enhanced apoptosis, but PD98059, an extracellular-regulated protein kinase-specific inhibitor, had no significant effect on bufalin-induced apoptosis. These results suggested that the PI3K/Akt pathway might play a key role in bufalin-induced apoptosis in gastric cancer MGC803 cells.","['Li, Dan', 'Qu, Xiujuan', 'Hou, Kezuo', 'Zhang, Ye', 'Dong, Qian', 'Teng, Yuee', 'Zhang, Jingdong', 'Liu, Yunpeng']","['Li D', 'Qu X', 'Hou K', 'Zhang Y', 'Dong Q', 'Teng Y', 'Zhang J', 'Liu Y']","['Department of Medical Oncology, the First Hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang, China.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Bufanolides/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Stomach Neoplasms/*enzymology/pathology', 'Time Factors', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",2009/04/04 09:00,2009/06/06 09:00,['2009/04/04 09:00'],"['2009/04/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/06 09:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/CAD.0b013e3283160fd6 [doi]', '00001813-200901000-00008 [pii]']",ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2009 Jan;20(1):59-64. doi: 10.1097/CAD.0b013e3283160fd6.,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Bufanolides)', '0 (Chromones)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (CBLB protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (CBL protein, human)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'U549S98QLW (bufalin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we investigate the possibility of improving the selectivity of chemotherapy by coadministering targeted biological modifier peptides. We show that the 22-amino acid metal-binding transporter domain (MBD) derived from insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 selectively targets cancer cells. The rate of MBD uptake by cells was measured using a panel of 54 human cancer cell lines and correlated with MBD cross-linking to cell surface transferrin receptor, caveolin 1, and integrin beta. Gene array data show that MBD uptake correlates with the expression of genes associated with cellular stress-coping mechanisms commonly upregulated in cancer (nuclear factor-kappaB, Hsp-70B). MBD-tagged peptides designed to inhibit such mechanisms have cytotoxic effects on a broad range of human cancer cell lines. The discriminant validity of these peptides as potential cotherapeutic agents was investigated by comparing their cytotoxicity to cancer cell lines versus normal human cell counterparts. Synergies between these peptides and marginally cytotoxic levels of 5-fluorouracil were demonstrated. Biodistribution data from in-vivo experiments in mice and rats confirm that MBD-tagged peptides and proteins preferably localize to specific tissues, such as kidney and pancreas. Intracardial injection of CCRF-CEM T-cell leukemia or MDA-MB-435 cells into Rag-2 mice establishes disseminated disease within 7 days. Twenty-five-day subcutaneous administration of a three-peptide cocktail (3 mg/kg) in combination with 5-fluorouracil in Rag-2 mice with established CCRF-CEM leukemia significantly reduces splenomegaly and bone marrow cancer cell burden. In a similar experiment using MDA-MB-435 cells, MBD-tagged peptides reduced human cell burden in bone marrow. Taken together, these data suggest that MBD-tagged molecules can be used as highly selective chemosensitizers in the treatment of hematological and disseminated malignancies.","['Huq, Anja', 'Singh, Baljit', 'Meeker, Thea', 'Mascarenhas, Desmond']","['Huq A', 'Singh B', 'Meeker T', 'Mascarenhas D']","['Mayflower Organization for Research and Education bProtigen Inc., Sunnyvale, California 94085, USA.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/metabolism', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/deficiency/genetics', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Drug Carriers', 'Fluorouracil/*administration & dosage/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Injections, Subcutaneous', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3/*administration & dosage/chemistry/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Peptide Fragments/*administration & dosage/metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Rats', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2009/04/04 09:00,2009/06/06 09:00,['2009/04/04 09:00'],"['2009/04/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/06 09:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/CAD.0b013e3283144610 [doi]', '00001813-200901000-00004 [pii]']",ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2009 Jan;20(1):21-31. doi: 10.1097/CAD.0b013e3283144610.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Rag2 protein, mouse)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They received oral 6TG 100 mg/m2 body surface area twice daily for 4 days. Etoposide, 100 mg/m2/24 h, and cytarabine, 200 mg/m2/24 h, were administered concomitantly by intravenous infusion. On day 5, doxorubicin 75 mg/m2 was given as an 8-h infusion. The concentration of thioguanine nucleotides (TGN) in erythrocytes, the active metabolites of 6TG, was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. The mean TGN concentration from 72, 95, and 106-h samples was used as a measure of drug exposure for each individual. The median TGN concentration in non-DS children above 2 years of age was 2.30 micromol/mmol Hb (range 0.57-25.3). The TGN concentrations varied widely (30-fold) also after dose normalization. We found no correlation with demographic, clinical, or biochemical parameters, and differences in bioavailability might be the most important explanation to interpatient variability. Children with high TGN concentration tended to have longer treatment interval to the next course, but we found no correlation with our predefined parameters for clinical response, that is, remission and relapse rate. Therefore, 6TG does not seem to be a candidate for therapeutic drug monitoring by TGN measurement, at least not in the setting of short multidrug treatment courses. Children with DS had significantly higher TGN concentrations, indicating that dose reduction might be considered to reach the same drug exposure as in non-DS children.","['Palle, Josefine', 'Frost, Britt-Marie', 'Petersson, Curt', 'Hasle, Henrik', 'Hellebostad, Marit', 'Kanerva, Jukka', 'Schmiegelow, Kjeld', 'Lonnerholm, Gudmar']","['Palle J', 'Frost BM', 'Petersson C', 'Hasle H', 'Hellebostad M', 'Kanerva J', 'Schmiegelow K', 'Lonnerholm G']","[""Department of Women's and Children's Health, University Children's Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden. josefine.palle@akademiska.se""]",['Nordic Society for Paediatric Haematology and Oncology'],['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Down Syndrome/blood/*complications', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Monitoring/methods', 'Erythrocytes/metabolism', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Guanine Nucleotides/blood', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/complications/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Registries', 'Scandinavian and Nordic Countries', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Thionucleotides/blood', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/04/04 09:00,2009/06/06 09:00,['2009/04/04 09:00'],"['2009/04/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/06 09:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/CAD.0b013e32831bc086 [doi]', '00001813-200901000-00002 [pii]']",ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2009 Jan;20(1):7-14. doi: 10.1097/CAD.0b013e32831bc086.,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotides)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '15867-02-4 (6-thioguanylic acid)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,"['Anticancer Drugs. 2010 Jan;21(1):130.

Here, we report a novel approach by fusing allogeneic dendritic cells (DCs) and CD34CD38 AML progenitor cells, through which specific CTLs were effectively induced, leading to the cytolysis to AML-initiating cells. Fusion of either DC/CD34CD38 AML cell or DC/CD34 AML cell could effectively induce the proliferation and activation of CTLs. However, only the former CTLs could effectively attack AML progenitor cells, and result in the unkilled progenitor/initiating cells losing the abilities of active proliferation in vitro and engraftment in NOD-SCID mice. These findings suggest that AML progenitor/initiating cell-specific CTLs may be generated based on allogeneic DC/progenitor cell fusion strategy; the induced CTLs may potentially eradicate AML by targeting L-ICs directly or indirectly.","['Lei, Zhang', 'Zhang, Gui-Mei', 'Hong, Mei', 'Feng, Zuo-Hua', 'Huang, Bo']","['Lei Z', 'Zhang GM', 'Hong M', 'Feng ZH', 'Huang B']","[""Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, The People's Republic of China.""]",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Immunother,"Journal of immunotherapy (Hagerstown, Md. : 1997)",9706083,IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/immunology', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/immunology', 'Cell Fusion', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/metabolism/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology/metabolism']",2009/04/04 09:00,2009/06/20 09:00,['2009/04/04 09:00'],"['2009/04/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/20 09:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/CJI.0b013e3181a01abb [doi]', '00002371-200905000-00010 [pii]']",ppublish,J Immunother. 2009 May;32(4):408-14. doi: 10.1097/CJI.0b013e3181a01abb.,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nearly 90% of newly diagnosed patients treated with imatinib in the chronic phase of the disease achieve a complete cytogenetic response. However, more than 95% of these patients retain detectable levels of BCR-ABL mRNA and patients discontinuing imatinib therapy almost invariably relapse, demonstrating that an imatinib insensitive population of leukemia-initiating cells (LICs) persists in nearly all patients. These findings underscore the need for treatments specifically targeting the leukemia-initiating population of CML cells. While mounting evidence suggests that the LIC in the chronic phase of CML is the BCR-ABL positive hematopoietic stem cell, several recent publications suggest that during CML blast crisis, a granulocyte-macrophage progenitor (GMP) population also acquires LIC properties through activation of the beta-catenin pathway. Characterization of these cells and evaluation of their sensitivity to imatinib is critical to our understanding and treatment of CML blast crisis.","['Stuart, Scott A', 'Minami, Yosuke', 'Wang, Jean Y J']","['Stuart SA', 'Minami Y', 'Wang JY']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of California at San Diego, School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.']",,['eng'],"['R01 CA043054/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA043054-23/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA067754/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20090517,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,IM,"['Animals', 'Benzamides', '*Biological Evolution', 'Blast Crisis/drug therapy', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Progenitor Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/*pathology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",2009/04/04 09:00,2009/06/06 09:00,['2009/04/04 09:00'],"['2009/04/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/06 09:00 [medline]']","['8209 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.8.9.8209 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2009 May 1;8(9):1338-43. doi: 10.4161/cc.8.9.8209.

Discriminatory pathways guide differentiation of these lymphocytes into either regulatory (Treg) or effector (Teff) T cells, influenced by cues from the naive T cell's immediate micro-environment as it responds to cognate antigen. Reciprocal pathways may lead to commitment of naive T cells into either the protective tolerance-promoting Treg, or to the pro-inflammatory Th17 effector phenotype. Primary activation of CD4(+) lymphocytes stimulates their release of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and Treg continue to release LIF in response to antigen, implying a role for LIF in tolerance. In contrast, interleukin- 6 (IL-6), although very closely related to LIF, promotes maturation of Th17 cells. Here we show that LIF and IL-6 behave as polar opposites in promoting commitment to the Treg and Th17 lineages. Unlike IL6, LIF supported expression of Foxp3, the Treg lineage transcription factor, and LIF opposed IL6 by suppressing IL-6-induced IL-17A protein release. In striking contrast, we found that IL6 effectively inhibited LIF signalling, repressing transcription of the LIF receptor gp190, and strongly inducing axotrophin/MARCH-7, a novel E3 ubitquitin ligase that we discovered to be active in degradation of gp190 protein. In vivo, anti-LIF treatment reduced donor-specific Treg in recipients of foreign spleen cells. Conversely, a single dose of biodegradable LIF nanoparticles, targeted to CD4, successfully manipulated the LIF/IL6 axis towards development of donor-specific Foxp3(+) Treg. The implications for therapy are profound, harnessing endogenous immune regulation by paracrine delivery of LIF to CD4(+) cells in vivo.","['Gao, Wenda', 'Thompson, Lorraine', 'Zhou, Qiang', 'Putheti, Prabhakar', 'Fahmy, Tarek M', 'Strom, Terry B', 'Metcalfe, Su M']","['Gao W', 'Thompson L', 'Zhou Q', 'Putheti P', 'Fahmy TM', 'Strom TB', 'Metcalfe SM']","['The Transplant Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.']",,['eng'],"['P01 AI041521/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 AI041521-130009/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'BHF_/British Heart Foundation/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20090504,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Lineage/*drug effects', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Immunological', 'Phenotype', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/*cytology/*drug effects', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*cytology/*drug effects', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/metabolism']",2009/04/04 09:00,2009/06/06 09:00,['2009/04/04 09:00'],"['2009/04/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/06 09:00 [medline]']","['8348 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.8.9.8348 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2009 May 1;8(9):1444-50. doi: 10.4161/cc.8.9.8348.

During development in the thymus, CD4(+)CD8(+) Valpha14i NKT precursors recognizing endogenous CD1d-associated glycolipids on other CD4(+)CD8(+) thymocytes are selected to undergo a maturation program involving sequential expression of CD44 and NK-related markers such as NK1.1. The molecular requirements for Valpha14i NKT cell maturation, particularly at early developmental stages, remain poorly understood. In this study, we show that CD4-Cre-mediated T cell-specific inactivation of c-Myc, a broadly expressed transcription factor with a wide range of biological activities, selectively impairs Valpha14i NKT cell development without perturbing the development of conventional T cells. In the absence of c-Myc, Valpha14i NKT cell precursors are blocked at an immature CD44(low)NK1.1(-) stage in a cell autonomous fashion. Residual c-Myc-deficient immature Valpha14i NKT cells appear to proliferate normally, cannot be rescued by transgenic expression of BCL-2, and exhibit characteristic features of immature Valpha14i NKT cells such as high levels of preformed IL-4 mRNA and the transcription factor promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger.

The levels of various MMPs as well as TIMPs have been shown to increase in response to certain cytokines. These include leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and Oncostatin M (OSM), both of which have been detected in the synovial fluids of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, the role of LIF and OSM in the regulation of various MMPs and TIMPs is still incompletely understood. The aims of this study were to examine the effects of LIF and OSM on MMP-1, MMP-3, and TIMP-1 production. In addition, the capacity of the LIF antagonist, MH35-BD, to block LIF and OSM induced MMP expression was examined. Primary chondrocytes, isolated from porcine metacarpophalangeal cartilage, were cultured in the presence and absence of LIF and OSM, with and without a predetermined concentration of the LIF antagonist. We analysed the levels of MMP-1, MMP-3 and TIMP-1 expression using qRT-PCR, Northern blot, and ELISA assays.

AML with t(8;21) is the most dependent subtype on VEGF with both VEGFR1 and VEGFR2. t(15;17)AML cells depend on VEGF with VEGFR1. AML cells with 11q23 abnormalities showed variable dependence on VEGF. The growth of t(11;19)AML cells are most extensively inhibited by anti-VEGFR1 antibody. Then, the growth of Kasumi-1, a t(8;21) cell line was suppressed by either anti-VEGFR1 antibody (p=0.0022) or anti-VEGFR2 antibody (p=0.0029) in a dose-dependent manner.

These results are quite concordant with the results of clinical samples with t(8;21) or t(15;17). In addition, anti-VEGFR2 monoclonal antibody significantly potentiated the growth inhibitory effect of idarubicin for Kasumi-1. As for downstream signals, we have shown that VEGFR2 transduce growth and survival signals through phosphorylation of Akt and MEK in leukemia cells (Kasumi-1). However, VEGFR1 transduce growth and survival signals through pathways other than MEK and Akt (NB4), although Akt phosphorylation may account for some of the VEGFR1 signals (Kasumi-1).

Most primary cases are of B-cell phenotype and only rare cases are of T-cell phenotype. Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) is a rare T-cell lymphoma typically seen in children and young adults with the breast being one of the least common locations. There are a total of eleven cases of primary ALCL of the breast described in the literature. Eight of these cases occurred in proximity to breast implants, four in relation to silicone breast implant and three in relation to saline filled breast implant with three out of the eight implant related cases having previous history of breast cancer treated surgically. Adjuvant postoperative chemotherapy is given in only one case. Secondary hematological malignancies after breast cancer chemotherapy have been reported in literature. However in contrast to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the association between lymphoma and administration of chemotherapy has never been clearly demonstrated. CASE PRESENTATION: In this report we present a case of primary ALCL of the breast arising in reconstruction mammoplasty capsule of saline filled breast implant after radical mastectomy for infiltrating ductal carcinoma followed by postoperative chemotherapy twelve years ago. CONCLUSION: Primary ALK negative ALCL arising at the site of saline filled breast implant is rare. It is still unclear whether chemotherapy and breast implantation increases risk of secondary hematological malignancies significantly. However, it is important to be aware of these complications and need for careful pathologic examination of tissue removed for implant related complications to make the correct diagnosis for further patient management and treatment. It is important to be aware of this entity at this site as it can be easily misdiagnosed on histologic grounds and to exclude sarcomatoid carcinoma, malignant melanoma and pleomorphic sarcoma by an appropriate panel of immunostains to arrive at the correct diagnosis of ALCL.","['Bishara, Mona R Y', 'Ross, Cathy', 'Sur, Monalisa']","['Bishara MR', 'Ross C', 'Sur M']","['Department of Anatomical Pathology, Henderson Hospital, 711 Concession Street, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. mona.bishara@medportal.ca']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090402,England,Diagn Pathol,Diagnostic pathology,101251558,,,2009/04/04 09:00,2009/04/04 09:01,['2009/04/04 09:00'],"['2009/01/19 00:00 [received]', '2009/04/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/04/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/04 09:01 [medline]']","['1746-1596-4-11 [pii]', '10.1186/1746-1596-4-11 [doi]']",epublish,Diagn Pathol. 2009 Apr 2;4:11. doi: 10.1186/1746-1596-4-11.,,,,,PMC2678081,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The numerous advantages of BSs have prompted applications not only in the food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries but also in environmental protection and energy-saving technology. Among BSs, glycolipid types are the most promising, owing to their high productivity from renewable resources and versatile biochemical properties. MELs (mannosylerythritol lipids), which are glycolipid BSs abundantly produced by basidiomycetous yeasts such as strains of Pseudozyma, exhibit not only excellent interfacial properties, but also remarkable differentiation-inducing activities against human leukaemia cells. MELs also show high binding affinity towards different immunoglobulins and lectins. Recently, a cationic liposome bearing MEL has been demonstrated to increase dramatically the efficiency of gene transfection into mammalian cells. These features of BSs should broaden their application in new advanced technologies. In the present review the current status of research and development on glycolipid BSs, especially their production by Pseudozyma yeasts, is described.","['Morita, Tomotake', 'Fukuoka, Tokuma', 'Imura, Tomohiro', 'Kitamoto, Dai']","['Morita T', 'Fukuoka T', 'Imura T', 'Kitamoto D']","['Research Institute for Innovations in Sustainable Chemistry, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Tukuba Central 5-2, Higashi 1-1, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8565, Japan.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Biotechnol Appl Biochem,Biotechnology and applied biochemistry,8609465,IM,"['Basidiomycota/classification/genetics/*metabolism', 'Chemical Phenomena', '*Glycolipids/chemistry/metabolism', 'Phylogeny', '*Surface-Active Agents/chemistry/metabolism', 'Transfection']",2009/04/04 09:00,2009/05/22 09:00,['2009/04/04 09:00'],"['2009/04/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/22 09:00 [medline]']","['BA20090033 [pii]', '10.1042/BA20090033 [doi]']",ppublish,Biotechnol Appl Biochem. 2009 May;53(Pt 1):39-49. doi: 10.1042/BA20090033.,"['0 (Glycolipids)', '0 (Surface-Active Agents)', '0 (mannosylerythritol lipid)']",,,70,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Few data are available linking these abnormalities to specific risk factors present during ALL treatment. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study with prospective follow-up. Subjects had been diagnosed with ALL at ages 1-18 years and had been off chemotherapy for >9 months. Oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) was performed and these results compared to demographic, treatment, and anthropomorphic data from medical records. RESULTS: Twenty-seven subjects (11 female) were evaluated. Mean (+/-SD) diagnosis age 5.7 +/- 3.5 years, mean study age 11.3 +/- 3.7 years, mean time off therapy 2.8 +/- 1.5 years. Six subjects had transient hyperglycemia during ALL treatment. At study time, one subject had prediabetes; eight (29.6%) had insulin resistance. Insulin resistance was not predicted by glucose levels during treatment, cumulative steroid or asparaginase dose, or type of steroid received. Body mass index (BMI) for age correlated significantly with several measures of insulin resistance, including fasting insulin, HOMA index, Matsuda index and insulin AUC (P = 0.001-0.009). Waist/hip ratio and BMI at ALL diagnosis also correlated with insulin resistance, but these factors' effects could not be separated from BMI at study time. CONCLUSIONS: Variations in ALL therapy and presence of transient hyperglycemia do not appear to increase risk of glucose intolerance or insulin resistance in the first few years after completion of therapy. Elevated BMI strongly predicted insulin resistance in this study, as it does in the general population.","['Lowas, Stefanie', 'Malempati, Suman', 'Marks, Daniel']","['Lowas S', 'Malempati S', 'Marks D']","[""Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Doernbecher Children's Hospital, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon, USA. stefanie.r.lowas@vanderbilt.edu""]",,['eng'],"['UL1 RR024140/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 RR024140-03/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Area Under Curve', '*Body Mass Index', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Comorbidity', 'Diabetes Mellitus/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hyperglycemia/*epidemiology', 'Infant', '*Insulin Resistance', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Obesity/epidemiology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survivors/*statistics & numerical data']",2009/04/03 09:00,2009/06/03 09:00,['2009/04/03 09:00'],"['2009/04/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/03 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.21993 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2009 Jul;53(1):58-63. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21993.,,,,,PMC3804011,['NIHMS123017'],,"['Copyright 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,

However, relatively few studies have been addressed on hematopoietic malignancies. We previously found that ZD55, a serotype 5 (Ad5)-based, E1B 55-kDa deleted CRAd, inhibited leukemic cell growth and induced apoptosis. In the present study, we employed SG235, a new CRAd with both an E1B 55-kDa deletion and an Ad5/F35 chimeric fiber, for the treatment of B-cell tumors. METHODS: CRAd SG235 was engineered not to express adenovirus E1B 55-kDa gene, and the wild-type Ad5 fiber was replaced by a chimeric Ad5/35 fiber containing an Ad5 tail, an Ad35 shaft and an Ad35 knob. Using in vitro and in vivo experiments, the infectivity and selective cytotoxicity of SG235 on B-cell tumor lines were evaluated. Apoptosis-related signaling elements were investigated. RESULTS: SG235 significantly suppressed malignant B-cell growth in vitro and in vivo. In addition to selective cytolysis, SG235-induced apoptosis in the tumor cells. Upon SG235 infection, levels of cleaved forms of caspase-3 and poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase increased, suggesting that SG235 induces apoptosis in malignant B-cells by activating a caspase cascade. Furthermore, SG235 infection resulted in an up-regulated level of Bax, as well as down-regulated levels of xIAP, cIAP and survivin, suggesting that infection of SG235 induces apoptosis in B-cell tumor lines by affecting both apoptosis-promoting and -inhibiting intracellular signaling elements. CONCLUSIONS: CRAd SG235 may serve as a potential anticancer agent, or a therapeutic vehicle for harboring anticancer genes, in B-cell tumor treatment.","['Wang, Guohua', 'Li, Gongchu', 'Liu, Hui', 'Yang, Chunmei', 'Yang, Xiudi', 'Jin, Jie', 'Liu, Xinyuan', 'Qian, Qijun', 'Qian, Wenbin']","['Wang G', 'Li G', 'Liu H', 'Yang C', 'Yang X', 'Jin J', 'Liu X', 'Qian Q', 'Qian W']","['Institute of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Zhejiang, China.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Gene Med,The journal of gene medicine,9815764,IM,"['Adenoviridae/*genetics/metabolism', 'Adenovirus E1B Proteins/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Oncolytic Virotherapy', 'Oncolytic Viruses/*genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Virus Replication']",2009/04/03 09:00,2009/09/02 06:00,['2009/04/03 09:00'],"['2009/04/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jgm.1326 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gene Med. 2009 Jun;11(6):477-85. doi: 10.1002/jgm.1326.,"['0 (Adenovirus E1B Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",,,,,,,"['(c) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,

Gene targeting has been and will remain a valuable approach to the generation of clinically relevant mouse models from which to elucidate the underlying molecular basis. However, as the aetiology of the majority of these conditions is still unknown, a reverse approach based on large-scale random chemical mutagenesis is now being used in an attempt to identify new genes and associated signalling pathways that control neuronal cell death and survival. Here, we review the characterisation of a novel model of autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia which shows general growth retardation and develops adult-onset region-specific Purkinje cell loss as well as cataracts and defects in early T-cell maturation. We have previously established that the mutated protein Af4, which is a member of the AF4/LAF4/FMR2 (ALF) family of transcription cofactors frequently translocated in childhood leukaemia, undergoes slower proteasomal turnover through the ubiquitin pathway and abnormally accumulates in Purkinje cells of the cerebellum. We have also shown that Af4 functions as part of a large multiprotein complex that stimulates RNA polymerase II elongation and mediates chromatin remodelling during transcription. With the forthcoming identification of the gene targets that trigger Purkinje cell death in the robotic cerebellum, and the functional conservation among the ALF proteins, the robotic mouse promises to deliver important insights into the pathogenesis of human ataxia, but also of mental retardation to which FMR2 and LAF4 have been linked.","['Bitoun, Emmanuelle', 'Davies, Kay E']","['Bitoun E', 'Davies KE']","['MRC Functional Genomics Unit, Department of Physiology, Anatomy and Genetics, University of Oxford, Oxford OX1 3QX, UK.']",,['eng'],['MC_U137761449/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20090402,United States,Cerebellum,"Cerebellum (London, England)",101089443,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Cerebellar Ataxia/genetics/*pathology/*physiopathology', '*Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Mice', '*Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Mutagenesis/physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Purkinje Cells/*physiology']",2009/04/03 09:00,2009/11/10 06:00,['2009/04/03 09:00'],"['2008/09/26 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/04/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12311-009-0101-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Cerebellum. 2009 Sep;8(3):175-83. doi: 10.1007/s12311-009-0101-0.

In contrast, few studies have been devoted to the influence of these factors on clinical outcome in responding patients after therapy. We here propose to analyse the impact of IGHV gene status, LPL and ADAM29 gene expression on disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in 41 stage B or C CLL patients in remission after oral fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide. The median follow-up was of 64 (16-74) months. Sequencing of IGHV showed mutated (M) VH genes in 16 of 41 cases and unmutated (UM) in 25 cases. Analysis of LPL and ADAM29 expression in 35 of 41 cases showed overexpression of ADAM29 in 17 cases (14 M and three UM) and LPL in 18 cases (all UM). Patients expressing UM IGHV and LPL had shorter DFS and OS when compared to patients expressing M IGHV and/or ADAM29. Furthermore, blood minimal residual disease (MRD) evaluation using four-colour flow cytometry was performed in 33 out the 41 patients. We showed that patients who achieved phenotypic remission displayed longer DFS than those with MRD(+). Our results support the use of LPL and ADAM29 gene expression associated to IGHV mutational status for predicting the clinical outcome of patients treated by oral fludarabine + cyclophosphamide and could be considered for treatment strategies.","['Maloum, Karim', 'Settegrana, Catherine', 'Chapiro, Elise', 'Cazin, Bruno', 'Lepretre, Stephane', 'Delmer, Alain', 'Leporrier, Michel', 'Dreyfus, Brigitte', 'Tournilhac, Olivier', 'Mahe, Beatrice', 'Nguyen-Khac, Florence', 'Lesty, Claude', 'Davi, Frederic', 'Merle-Beral, Helene']","['Maloum K', 'Settegrana C', 'Chapiro E', 'Cazin B', 'Lepretre S', 'Delmer A', 'Leporrier M', 'Dreyfus B', 'Tournilhac O', 'Mahe B', 'Nguyen-Khac F', 'Lesty C', 'Davi F', 'Merle-Beral H']","[""Service d'Hematologie Biologique, CHU Pitie-Salpetriere, Paris, France. karim.maloum@psl.aphp.fr""]",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090402,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,"['ADAM Proteins/*genetics', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Cyclophosphamide/*therapeutic use', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain/*genetics', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/genetics', 'Lipoprotein Lipase/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",2009/04/03 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/04/03 09:00'],"['2008/07/11 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/04/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-009-0742-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2009 Dec;88(12):1215-21. doi: 10.1007/s00277-009-0742-6.

Pediatric pathologic femoral neck fractures are particularly rare. Until now, all reported cases have been isolated cases, small series, or cases reported in series of adult pathologic hip fractures. The present article is the first report of a relatively large series of pathologic femoral neck fractures in a pediatric population. We identified pathologic femoral neck fractures, including 2 basicervical fractures, in 15 children (9 boys, 6 girls) ranging in age from 18 months to 15 years (mean age, 9 years) and treated between 1960 and 2000. The pathologic diagnoses were fibrous dysplasia (5 children), unicameral bone cyst (2), Ewing's sarcoma (2), osteomyelitis (2), leukemia (1), rhabdomyosarcoma (1), osteogenesis imperfecta (1), and osteopetrosis (1). Treatment methods, including time to reduction and fixation, were reviewed in detail. One patient was lost to follow-up. All others were followed until union; mean long-term follow-up was 7 years (range, 1-16 years). All patients ultimately went on to union. Mean time to union was 19 weeks (range, 5-46 weeks). However, 2 patients died before 2 years. There was a 40% complication rate, with limb-length discrepancy being the most common (4 children). No patient developed avascular necrosis. Pathologic femoral neck fractures are rare in children. Pediatric patients who present with a pathologic hip fracture are at significant risk for complications. Physicians and family should be alerted to the prolonged course involved in treating these fractures to union.","['Shrader, M Wade', 'Schwab, Joseph H', 'Shaughnessy, William J', 'Jacofsky, David J']","['Shrader MW', 'Schwab JH', 'Shaughnessy WJ', 'Jacofsky DJ']","['Department of Orthopedics, Mayo Clinic, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Am J Orthop (Belle Mead NJ),"American journal of orthopedics (Belle Mead, N.J.)",9502918,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Femoral Neck Fractures/etiology/*pathology/surgery', 'Femur Neck/injuries/*pathology', 'Fracture Healing', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', '*Orthopedic Procedures', 'Postoperative Complications']",2009/04/03 09:00,2009/06/10 09:00,['2009/04/03 09:00'],"['2009/04/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/10 09:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Am J Orthop (Belle Mead NJ). 2009 Feb;38(2):83-6; discussion 86.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated the effect of LynDeltaN overexpression on imatinib sensitivity of the chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cell line K562. Therefore, we generated stable cells that express plasmids encoding LynDeltaN or its catalytically inactive counterpart LynDeltaNKD. We established that Lyn is cleaved in imatinib-treated parental K562 cells in a caspase-dependent manner. Lyn cleavage also occurred following BCR-ABL silencing by specific short hairpin RNA (sh-RNA). Imatinib-induced apoptosis was abrogated in LynDeltaN-overexpressing cells, but not in cells overexpressing its inactive counterpart. Conversely, the overexpression of LynDeltaN failed to affect the differentiation of K562 cells. Importantly, the protective effect of LynDeltaN was suppressed by two inhibitors of Lyn activity. LynDeltaN also inhibits imatinib-mediated caspase-3 activation in the small proportion of nilotinib-resistant K562 cells overexpressing Lyn that can engage an apoptotic program upon imatinib stimulation. Finally, Lyn knockdown by sh-RNA altered neither imatinib-mediated apoptosis nor differentiation. Taken together, our data show that the caspase-cleaved form of Lyn exerts a negative feedback on imatinib-mediated CML cell apoptosis that is entirely dependent on its kinase activity and likely on the BCR-ABL pathway.","['Gamas, P', 'Marchetti, S', 'Puissant, A', 'Grosso, S', 'Jacquel, A', 'Colosetti, P', 'Pasquet, J-M', 'Mahon, F-X', 'Cassuto, J-P', 'Auberger, P']","['Gamas P', 'Marchetti S', 'Puissant A', 'Grosso S', 'Jacquel A', 'Colosetti P', 'Pasquet JM', 'Mahon FX', 'Cassuto JP', 'Auberger P']","['Team 2: Cell Death Differentiation and Cancer, INSERM U895, Nice, France.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090402,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Caspase 3/*metabolism', 'Caspase 9/genetics/*metabolism', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Erythropoiesis/drug effects', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'K562 Cells/drug effects/enzymology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*enzymology/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Piperazines/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'src-Family Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/genetics/*physiology']",2009/04/03 09:00,2009/09/22 06:00,['2009/04/03 09:00'],"['2009/04/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/22 06:00 [medline]']","['leu200960 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.60 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Aug;23(8):1500-6. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.60.

Alterations in ubiquitination have been implicated in hematological cancer. The ubiquitin ligase Triad1 controls the proliferation of myeloid cells. Here, we show that two RING (really interesting new gene) domains in Triad1 differentially bind ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, UbcH7 and Ubc13. UbcH7 and Ubc13 are known to catalyze the formation of different poly-ubiquitin chains. These chains mark proteins for proteasomal degradation or serve crucial non-proteolytic functions, respectively. In line with the dual Ubc interactions, we observed that Triad1 catalyzes the formation of both types of ubiquitin chains. The biological relevance of this finding was studied by testing Triad1 mutants in myeloid clonogenic assays. Full-length Triad1 and three mutants lacking conserved domains inhibited myeloid colony formation by over 50%. Strikingly, deletion of either RING finger completely abrogated the inhibitory effect of Triad1 in clonogenic growth. We conclude that Triad1 exhibits dual ubiquitin ligase activity and that both of its RING domains are crucial to inhibit myeloid cell proliferation. The differential interaction of the RINGs with Ubcs strongly suggests that the ubiquitination mediated through UbcH7 as well as Ubc13 plays a major role in myelopoiesis.","['Marteijn, J A', 'van der Meer, L T', 'Smit, J J', 'Noordermeer, S M', 'Wissink, W', 'Jansen, P', 'Swarts, H G', 'Hibbert, R G', 'de Witte, T', 'Sixma, T K', 'Jansen, J H', 'van der Reijden, B A']","['Marteijn JA', 'van der Meer LT', 'Smit JJ', 'Noordermeer SM', 'Wissink W', 'Jansen P', 'Swarts HG', 'Hibbert RG', 'de Witte T', 'Sixma TK', 'Jansen JH', 'van der Reijden BA']","['Central Hematology Laboratory, Nijmegen Centre for Molecular Life Sciences, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090402,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Humans', 'Kidney', 'Mice', 'Myelopoiesis/*physiology', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Protein Binding', '*Protein Interaction Mapping', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', '*RING Finger Domains', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques', 'U937 Cells/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Ubiquitination']",2009/04/03 09:00,2009/09/22 06:00,['2009/04/03 09:00'],"['2009/04/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/22 06:00 [medline]']","['leu200957 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.57 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Aug;23(8):1480-9. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.57.

The aim of this extensive analysis carried out on 401 CLL patients was to assess TL conclusively as a prognostic biomarker. Our study included two cohorts used as learning (191 patients) and blinded validation series (210 patients). A TL cutoff of 5000 bp was chosen by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and Youden's index in the learning series. In this series, TL< or =5000 bp was independently associated to a worse outcome for both overall survival (OS; 105.5 vs 281 months, P<0.001) and treatment-free survival (TFS; 24.6 vs 73 months, P<0.001). In the blinded validation series, TL< or =5000 bp was confirmed as an independent outcome predictor for OS (79.8 vs not reached, P<0.001) and TFS (15.2 vs 130.8 months, P<0.001). Moreover, TL< or =5000 bp independently predicted the risk of Richter's syndrome (5-year risk: 18.9 vs 6.4%, P=0.016). Within CLL subsets defined by biological predictors, TL consistently identified patient subgroups harboring unfavorable prognosis. These results demonstrate that TL is a powerful independent predictor of multiple outcomes in CLL, and contributes to refine the prognostic assessment of this disease when utilized in combination with other prognostic markers. We thus believe that this prognostic biomarker has the potential for a more widespread use in CLL.","['Rossi, D', 'Lobetti Bodoni, C', 'Genuardi, E', 'Monitillo, L', 'Drandi, D', 'Cerri, M', 'Deambrogi, C', 'Ricca, I', 'Rocci, A', 'Ferrero, S', 'Bernocco, E', 'Capello, D', 'De Paoli, L', 'Bergui, L', 'Boi, M', 'Omede, P', 'Massaia, M', 'Tarella, C', 'Passera, R', 'Boccadoro, M', 'Gaidano, G', 'Ladetto, M']","['Rossi D', 'Lobetti Bodoni C', 'Genuardi E', 'Monitillo L', 'Drandi D', 'Cerri M', 'Deambrogi C', 'Ricca I', 'Rocci A', 'Ferrero S', 'Bernocco E', 'Capello D', 'De Paoli L', 'Bergui L', 'Boi M', 'Omede P', 'Massaia M', 'Tarella C', 'Passera R', 'Boccadoro M', 'Gaidano G', 'Ladetto M']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Amedeo Avogadro University of Eastern Piedmont, Novara, Italy.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090402,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications/*diagnosis/mortality', '*Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis', 'Telomere/*pathology']",2009/04/03 09:00,2009/07/08 09:00,['2009/04/03 09:00'],"['2009/04/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/08 09:00 [medline]']","['leu2008399 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.399 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Jun;23(6):1062-72. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.399.

We investigated whether bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) derived from stem cells might be responsible for the increase in microvascular density (MVD), and compared 13 bone marrow samples from AL patients with 23 samples from patients in complete remission (controls). We demonstrated that AL-derived BMSC secreted more insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and SDF-1alpha than controls. In addition, in contrast to normal adherent BMSCs, adherent BMSCs derived from CD133+/CD34+ stem cells from AL patients were able to form capillary-like structures ('vasculogenic mimicry') on Matrigel. The increase in vasculogenic mimicry occurred through PI3 kinase and rho GTPase pathway as inhibitors of these signaling pathways (wortmannin and GGTI-298, respectively) were able to reduce or prevent capillary tube formation. In normal BMSC, addition of exogenous IGF-1 generated capillary-like tubes through the same pathway as observed spontaneously in AL-derived BMSC.

In T-ALL lymphoblasts, we identified high-frequency mutations in NOTCH1 (n=16), FBW7 (n=5) and PTEN (n=26). NOTCH1 mutations resulted in 1.3- to 3.3-fold increased transactivation of an HES1 reporter construct over wild-type NOTCH1; mutant FBW7 resulted in further augmentation of reporter gene activity. NOTCH1 and FBW7 mutations were accompanied by increased median transcripts for NOTCH1 target genes (HES1, DELTEX1 and cMYC). However, none of these mutations were associated with treatment outcome. Elevated HES1, DELTEX1 and cMYC transcripts were associated with significant increases in transcript levels of several chemotherapy relevant genes, including MDR1, ABCC5, reduced folate carrier, asparagine synthetase, thiopurine methyltransferase, BCL2 and dihydrofolate reductase. PTEN transcripts positively correlated with HES1 and cMYC transcript levels. Our results suggest that (1) multiple factors should be considered with attempting to identify molecular-based prognostic factors for pediatric T-ALL, and (2) depending on the NOTCH1 signaling status, modifications in the types or dosing of standard chemotherapy drugs for T-ALL, or combinations of agents capable of targeting NOTCH1, AKT and/or mTOR with standard chemotherapy agents may be warranted.","['Larson Gedman, A', 'Chen, Q', 'Kugel Desmoulin, S', 'Ge, Y', 'LaFiura, K', 'Haska, C L', 'Cherian, C', 'Devidas, M', 'Linda, S B', 'Taub, J W', 'Matherly, L H']","['Larson Gedman A', 'Chen Q', 'Kugel Desmoulin S', 'Ge Y', 'LaFiura K', 'Haska CL', 'Cherian C', 'Devidas M', 'Linda SB', 'Taub JW', 'Matherly LH']","['Graduate Program in Cancer Biology, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, USA.']",,['eng'],"['R01 CA076641-10/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-CA009531/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA076641/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA76641/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009531-22/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009531/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009531-21/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090402,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'F-Box Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*genetics', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Homeodomain Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/*genetics/physiology', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Receptor, Notch1/*genetics/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Transcription Factor HES-1', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*genetics/physiology', 'Young Adult']",2009/04/03 09:00,2009/09/22 06:00,['2009/04/03 09:00'],"['2009/04/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/22 06:00 [medline]']","['leu200964 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.64 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Aug;23(8):1417-25. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.64.

In the HIV-negative setting, high-dose therapy with autologous stem cell transplantation has been a long accepted treatment for certain malignancies such as lymphoma and leukemia. Early transplant trials excluded older patients and patients with comorbidities such as HIV infection. The procedure-related mortality of transplantation, however, has decreased both due to the use of peripheral blood stem cells instead of bone marrow and due to the use of new reduced intensity conditioning regimens. During this same era, the treatment of HIV infection has also become more effective. Patients are no longer dying of opportunistic infections and in addition, their hematologic function has improved. With these advances in HIV therapy, it is possible for HIV-infected patients to mobilize an adequate number of stem cells for an autologous transplant. In addition, with appropriate antiretroviral therapy and infection prophylaxis, the HIV-infected patient can tolerate intensive doses of chemotherapy. This review will summarize clinical trials of autologous stem cell transplantation in HIV-positive patients. Furthermore, the field of solid-organ transplantation has grown to also include HIV-positive patients. The challenges in solid-organ transplantation are similar to allogeneic stem cell transplantation, namely that patients require chronic immunosuppression. This article will also review some of the approaches to allogeneic stem cell transplantation in the HIV-positive patient and provide a rationale for the broader use of stem cell transplantation for appropriate HIV-related hematologic malignancies.","['Krishnan, Amrita']",['Krishnan A'],"['City of Hope Medical Center, Department of Heme/HCT, Duarte, California 91010, USA. akrishnan@coh.org']",,['eng'],"['CA30206/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'AI 38592/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'M01 RR-43/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA033572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA030206/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin HIV AIDS,Current opinion in HIV and AIDS,101264945,IM,"['Animals', 'Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'HIV Infections/*therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Lymphoma, AIDS-Related/*therapy', 'Organ Transplantation', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2009/04/03 09:00,2009/05/07 09:00,['2009/04/03 09:00'],"['2009/04/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/07 09:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/COH.0b013e32831a6fc9 [doi]', '01222929-200901000-00004 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin HIV AIDS. 2009 Jan;4(1):11-5. doi: 10.1097/COH.0b013e32831a6fc9.,,,,35,PMC3537512,['NIHMS94537'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytoreductive therapies have been used for the prevention of tumor lysis syndrome, but the outcomes have been variable and their benefits have not been proven in controlled clinical trials. This condition needs further investigation to develop effective therapeutic strategies. METHODS: In the present prospective trial, 15 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and hyperleukocytosis (range 101-838 x 10(9)/l) were treated with intravenous low-dose prednisone continuous infusion (6 mg/m(2)/24 h). Doses were increased daily and on approximately the fifth day, the full dose of prednisone (60 mg/m(2)/day) was applied. RESULTS: The mean reduction in white blood cell count achieved by this treatment was 34.4% on first day, 56.9% on second day and 76.6% on third day. The treatment was well tolerated. None of the 15 patients developed life-threatening metabolic disorders or required dialysis. CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous low-dose prednisone continuous infusion treatment can prevent the progression to tumor lysis syndrome and it may be used for the patients presenting with white blood cell counts between 100 and 400 x 10(9)/l in centers where leukoapheresis is not readily available.","['Ozdemir, Mehmet Akif', 'Karakukcu, Musa', 'Patiroglu, Turkan', 'Torun, Yasemin Altuner', 'Kose, Mehmet']","['Ozdemir MA', 'Karakukcu M', 'Patiroglu T', 'Torun YA', 'Kose M']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Gevher Nesibe Hospital, Erciyes University Faculty of Medicine, Kayseri, Turkey.']",,['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20090402,Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/*administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukocytosis/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prednisone/*administration & dosage', 'Prospective Studies', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tumor Lysis Syndrome/*prevention & control']",2009/04/03 09:00,2009/05/06 09:00,['2009/04/03 09:00'],"['2008/08/11 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/04/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/06 09:00 [medline]']","['000210392 [pii]', '10.1159/000210392 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2009;121(1):56-62. doi: 10.1159/000210392.

To model such heterogeneity, we produced genetically and pathologically accurate mouse models of common forms of human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and developed methods to mimic standard induction chemotherapy and efficiently monitor therapy response. We see that murine AMLs harboring two common human AML genotypes show remarkably diverse responses to conventional therapy that mirror clinical experience. Specifically, murine leukemias expressing the AML1/ETO fusion oncoprotein, associated with a favorable prognosis in patients, show a dramatic response to induction chemotherapy owing to robust activation of the p53 tumor suppressor network. Conversely, murine leukemias expressing MLL fusion proteins, associated with a dismal prognosis in patients, are drug-resistant due to an attenuated p53 response. Our studies highlight the importance of genetic information in guiding the treatment of human AML, functionally establish the p53 network as a central determinant of chemotherapy response in AML, and demonstrate that genetically engineered mouse models of human cancer can accurately predict therapy response in patients.","['Zuber, Johannes', 'Radtke, Ina', 'Pardee, Timothy S', 'Zhao, Zhen', 'Rappaport, Amy R', 'Luo, Weijun', 'McCurrach, Mila E', 'Yang, Miao-Miao', 'Dolan, M Eileen', 'Kogan, Scott C', 'Downing, James R', 'Lowe, Scott W']","['Zuber J', 'Radtke I', 'Pardee TS', 'Zhao Z', 'Rappaport AR', 'Luo W', 'McCurrach ME', 'Yang MM', 'Dolan ME', 'Kogan SC', 'Downing JR', 'Lowe SW']","['Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York 11724, USA.']",,['eng'],"['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HHMI/Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, ras/genetics/physiology', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology/physiopathology', 'Mice', '*Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics']",2009/04/03 09:00,2009/04/16 09:00,['2009/04/03 09:00'],"['2009/04/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/16 09:00 [medline]']","['23/7/877 [pii]', '10.1101/gad.1771409 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Dev. 2009 Apr 1;23(7):877-89. doi: 10.1101/gad.1771409.,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (MLL-ENL oncoprotein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)']",,,,PMC2666344,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The P2Y(14)-R was stably expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 and C6 rat glioma cells by retroviral infection. Nucleotide sugar-dependent P2Y(14)-R activation was examined by measuring inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation. The effect of P2Y(14)-R activation on mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling also was studied in P2Y(14)-HEK293 cells and in differentiated HL-60 human myeloid leukemia cells. UDP-Glc, UDP-galactose, UDP-glucuronic acid, and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine promoted inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in P2Y(14)-HEK293 and P2Y(14)-C6 cells, and this signaling effect was abolished by pretreatment of cells with pertussis toxin. Inhibition of cAMP formation by nucleotide sugars also was observed in direct assays of adenylyl cyclase activity in membranes prepared from P2Y(14)-C6 cells. UDP-Glc promoted concentration-dependent and pertussis toxin-sensitive extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 phosphorylation in P2Y(14)-HEK293 cells. P2Y(14)-R mRNA was not observed in wild-type HL-60 cells but was readily detected in dimethyl sulfoxide-differentiated cells. Consistent with this observation, no effect of UDP-Glc was observed in wild-type HL-60 cells, but UDP-Glc-promoted pertussis toxin-sensitive activation of ERK1/2 occurred after differentiation. These results illustrate that the human P2Y(14)-R signals through G(i) to inhibit adenylyl cyclase, and P2Y(14)-R activation also leads to ERK1/2 activation. This work also identifies two stable P2Y(14)-R-expressing cell lines and differentiated HL-60 cells as model systems for the study of P2Y(14)-R-dependent signal transduction.","['Fricks, Ingrid P', 'Carter, Rhonda L', 'Lazarowski, Eduardo R', 'Harden, T Kendall']","['Fricks IP', 'Carter RL', 'Lazarowski ER', 'Harden TK']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of North Carolina, School of Medicine, Chapel Hill, NC 27599, USA.']",,['eng'],"['GM38213/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HL34322/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090401,United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Colforsin/pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gi-Go/*physiology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects/genetics', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Purinergic P2/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Uridine Diphosphate Sugars/pharmacology']",2009/04/03 09:00,2009/07/28 09:00,['2009/04/03 09:00'],"['2009/04/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/28 09:00 [medline]']","['jpet.109.150730 [pii]', '10.1124/jpet.109.150730 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2009 Jul;330(1):162-8. doi: 10.1124/jpet.109.150730.

In addition, these proteins might function in a common biological mechanism, because at least two different nucleoporins, Nup98 and Nup214, as well as PML, can become aberrantly expressed as oncogenic fusion proteins in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. Here we show that PML and nucleoporins become directed to common cytoplasmic compartments during the mitosis-to-G1 transition of the cell cycle. These protein assemblies, which we have termed CyPNs (cytoplasmic assemblies of PML and nucleoporins), move on the microtubular network and become stably connected to the nuclear membrane once contact with the nucleus has been made. The ability of PML to target CyPNs depends on its nuclear localization signal, and loss of PML causes an increase in cytoplasmic-bound versus nuclear-membrane-bound nucleoporins. CyPNs are also targeted by the acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) fusion protein PML-RARalpha and can be readily detected within the APL cell line NB4. These results provide insight into a dynamic pool of cytoplasmic nucleoporins that form a complex with the tumor suppressor protein PML during the G1 phase of the cell cycle.","['Jul-Larsen, Asne', 'Grudic, Amra', 'Bjerkvig, Rolf', 'Boe, Stig Ove']","['Jul-Larsen A', 'Grudic A', 'Bjerkvig R', 'Boe SO']","['Department of Biomedicine, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,IM,"['CREB-Binding Protein/metabolism', '*Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cytoplasm/drug effects/*metabolism', 'G1 Phase', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Microtubules/metabolism', 'Mitosis', 'Nocodazole/pharmacology', 'Nuclear Envelope/metabolism', 'Nuclear Localization Signals/metabolism', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Transport', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tubulin Modulators/pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",2009/04/03 09:00,2009/06/12 09:00,['2009/04/03 09:00'],"['2009/04/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/12 09:00 [medline]']","['122/8/1201 [pii]', '10.1242/jcs.040840 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Sci. 2009 Apr 15;122(Pt 8):1201-10. doi: 10.1242/jcs.040840.,"['0 (Nuclear Localization Signals)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tubulin Modulators)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREB-Binding Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREBBP protein, human)', 'SH1WY3R615 (Nocodazole)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The neurovirulence of these viruses has long been known to be determined by the sequence of the viral envelope protein, although the nature of the neurotoxicity remains to be clarified. Studies on the neurovirulent viruses FrCas(NC) and Moloney murine leukemia virus ts1 indicate that the nascent envelope protein misfolds, is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and induces an unfolded protein response. In the present study we constructed a series of viruses with chimeric envelope genes containing segments from virulent and avirulent retroviruses. Each of the viruses studied was highly neuroinvasive but differed in the severity of the neurological disease they induced. Only viruses that contained the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the neurovirulent virus induced neurological disease. Likewise, only viruses containing the RBD of the neurovirulent virus exhibited increased binding of the ER chaperone BiP to the envelope precursor protein and induced the unfolded protein response. Thus, the RBD determined both neurovirulence and folding instability. Among viruses carrying the neurovirulent RBD, the severity of the disease was increased when envelope sequences from the neurovirulent virus outside the RBD were also present. Interestingly, these sequences appeared to further increase the degree of folding instability (BiP binding) of the viral envelope protein. These results provide strong support for the hypothesis that this spongiform neurodegenerative disease represents a virus-induced protein folding disorder.","['Portis, J L', 'Askovich, P', 'Austin, J', 'Gutierrez-Cotto, Y', 'McAtee, F J']","['Portis JL', 'Askovich P', 'Austin J', 'Gutierrez-Cotto Y', 'McAtee FJ']","['Laboratory of Persistent Viral Diseases, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, NIAID, National Institutes of Health, Hamilton, Montana 59840-2932, USA. jportis@niaid.nih.gov']",,['eng'],['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20090401,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Neurodegenerative Diseases/*virology', '*Protein Folding', 'RNA, Viral/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Retroviridae Infections/*virology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Virulence']",2009/04/03 09:00,2009/05/29 09:00,['2009/04/03 09:00'],"['2009/04/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/29 09:00 [medline]']","['JVI.02647-08 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.02647-08 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2009 Jun;83(12):6079-86. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02647-08.

The main outcome measure was the percentage of derivable mES cell lines, based on the number of blastocysts initially cultured. Three experiments demonstrated the following: (1) For the addition of individual single factor, only LIF yielded mES cell lines (6.2%), whereas a combination of all three factors resulted in the greatest number of mES cell lines (31.3%). (2) The advantages of a combination of multiple factors (LIF+PD98059+BIO) were manifested only when they were used during the first stage of the culture and not during the second stage (31.6% vs. 6.2%, respectively). (3) The quality of the inner cell mass (ICM) outgrowth obtained from first-stage culture was studied. After alkaline phosphatase and Oct-4 staining, which documented pluripotency of the embryonic stem cells, outgrowths cultured in multiple factors (LIF+PD98059+BIO) stained much stronger and in higher proportions than did those obtained after supplementation only with LIF (80% vs. 30%, respectively).","['Doungpunta, J', 'Santhi, A', 'Sathanawongs, A', 'Jarujinda, Y', 'Oranratnachai, A']","['Doungpunta J', 'Santhi A', 'Sathanawongs A', 'Jarujinda Y', 'Oranratnachai A']","['Human & Animal Biotechnology Unit, The Graduate School, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090331,United States,Theriogenology,Theriogenology,0421510,IM,"['Animals', 'Blastocyst/cytology', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Culture Media', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts', 'Flavonoids/administration & dosage', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Indoles/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/administration & dosage', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Oximes/administration & dosage', 'Pregnancy']",2009/04/03 09:00,2009/09/04 06:00,['2009/04/03 09:00'],"['2008/10/16 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/02 00:00 [revised]', '2009/02/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/04/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S0093-691X(09)00104-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.theriogenology.2009.02.020 [doi]']",ppublish,Theriogenology. 2009 Jul 15;72(2):232-42. doi: 10.1016/j.theriogenology.2009.02.020.

These results indicate that MK-0457 is effective in CML cells by the down-regulation of HSPs which may relate to BCR-ABL stability, and offer new information regarding the molecular basis of strategy against to CML.","['Okabe, Seiichi', 'Tauchi, Tetsuzo', 'Ohyashiki, Junko H', 'Ohyashiki, Kazuma']","['Okabe S', 'Tauchi T', 'Ohyashiki JH', 'Ohyashiki K']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Tokyo Medical University, 6-7-1 Nishi-shinjuku, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 160-0023, Japan. okabe@tokyo-med.ac.jp']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090129,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*enzymology', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects']",2009/04/03 09:00,2009/04/29 09:00,['2009/04/03 09:00'],"['2009/01/26 00:00 [received]', '2009/01/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/04/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/29 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-291X(09)00197-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2009.01.141 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2009 Mar 20;380(4):775-9. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2009.01.141.

Recently, evaluation of changes in surface marker expression induced in dendritic cells (DC) or DC surrogate cell lines following exposure to chemicals represents one approach for in vitro test methods. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to test the change of expression patterns of surface markers on THP-1 cells by chemicals as a predictive in vitro method for contact sensitization. METHODS: We investigated the expression of CD54, CD86, CD83, CD80, and CD40 after a 1-day exposure to sensitizers (1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene; 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene; benzocaine; 5-chloro-2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one; hexyl cinnamic aldehyde; eugenol; nickel sulfate hexahydrate; potassium dichromate; cobalt sulfate; 2-mercaptobenzothiazole; and ammonium tetrachloroplatinate) and non-sensitizers (sodium lauryl sulfate, benzalkonium chloride, lactic acid, salicylic acid, isopropanol, and dimethyl sulphoxide). The test concentrations were 0.1x, 0.5x, and 1x of the 50% inhibitory concentration, and the relative fluorescence intensity was used as an expression indicator. RESULT AND CONCLUSION: By evaluating the expression patterns of CD54, CD86, and CD40, we could classify the chemicals as sensitizers or non-sensitizers, but CD80 and CD83 showed non-specific patterns of expression. These data suggest that the THP-1 cells are good model for screening contact sensitizers and CD40 could be a useful marker complementary to CD54 and CD86.","['An, Susun', 'Kim, Seoyoung', 'Huh, Yong', 'Lee, Tae Ryong', 'Kim, Han-Kon', 'Park, Kui-Lea', 'Eun, Hee Chul']","['An S', 'Kim S', 'Huh Y', 'Lee TR', 'Kim HK', 'Park KL', 'Eun HC']","['AmorePacific Corporation R&D Center, Yongin-si, Seoul, Korea.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Contact Dermatitis,Contact dermatitis,7604950,IM,"['Allergens/classification/*toxicity', 'Animal Testing Alternatives/methods', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'B7-1 Antigen/metabolism', 'B7-2 Antigen/metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'CD40 Antigens/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Dermatitis, Contact/diagnosis/immunology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Skin/*drug effects', 'Skin Irritancy Tests/*methods', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2009/04/03 09:00,2009/08/06 09:00,['2009/04/03 09:00'],"['2009/04/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/06 09:00 [medline]']","['COD1528 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0536.2009.01528.x [doi]']",ppublish,Contact Dermatitis. 2009 Apr;60(4):185-92. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0536.2009.01528.x.,"['0 (Allergens)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (B7-2 Antigen)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (Cytokines)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At present, the OD No. 1303 covers heterogeneous diseases and various chemical agents triggering these diseases. The members of the medical advisory board specializing in ODs within the Ministry of Employment and Social Affairs recently proposed excluding ""diseases of the blood, the hematopoietic and lymphatic system caused by benzene"" from OD No. 1303 and classifying them as a separate OD. Benzene is generally acknowledged as a cause of acute myeloid leukemia, proven by numerous epidemiologic studies. However, there is less epidemiologic evidence of its association with other hematologic neoplasms, notably non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). To clarify this issue, the experts evaluated international literature and concluded that all kinds of myeloid and lymphoid malignancies including their prestages can be caused by occupational benzene exposure. Hence, physicians should ask patients about occupational benzene exposure and report any kind of diagnosed hematologic neoplasms, including their prestages, as suspected OD. The advisory board considered that a dose range starting from 10 ppm-years (cumulative benzene exposure) is sufficient for a > 50% probability of causing leukemias according to the WHO classification, including chronic lymphatic leukemia, and the potential preleukemias aplastic anemia and myelodysplastic syndrome, but excluding chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). For NHL and myeloproliferative diseases (including CML) the present epidemiologic evidence is considered not to be sufficient to describe a precise dose-effect relationship.","['Beelte, Stefanie', 'Haas, Rainer', 'Germing, Ulrich', 'Jansing, Paul-Josef']","['Beelte S', 'Haas R', 'Germing U', 'Jansing PJ']","['Landesinstitut fur Gesundheit und Arbeit des Landes Nordrhein-Westfalen, Zentrum fur Gesundheit in der Arbeit, Dusseldorf.']",,['ger'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20090401,Germany,Med Klin (Munich),"Medizinische Klinik (Munich, Germany : 1983)",8303501,IM,"['Air Pollutants, Occupational/*toxicity', 'Benzene/*toxicity', 'Body Burden', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Expert Testimony/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Germany', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*chemically induced/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Occupational Diseases/*chemically induced/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Risk Assessment', ""Workers' Compensation/legislation & jurisprudence""]",2009/04/02 09:00,2009/08/29 09:00,['2009/04/02 09:00'],"['2008/07/03 00:00 [received]', '2009/01/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/04/02 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/29 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00063-009-1032-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Klin (Munich). 2009 Mar 15;104(3):197-203. doi: 10.1007/s00063-009-1032-8.

To explore the risk factors involved, we tested the oncogenic potential of human gammaC in new strains of transgenic mice expressing the gene under the control of the CD2 promoter and locus control region (LCR). These mice demonstrated mildly perturbed T-cell development, with an increased proportion of thymic CD8 cells, but showed no predisposition to tumor development even on highly tumor prone backgrounds or after gamma-retrovirus infection. The human CD2-gammaC transgene rescued T and B-cell development in gammaC(-/-) mice but with an age-related delay, mimicking postnatal reconstitution in SCID-X1 gene therapy subjects. However, we noted that gammaC(-/-) mice are acutely susceptible to murine leukemia virus (MLV) leukemogenesis, and that this trait was not corrected by the gammaC transgene. We conclude that the SCID-X1 phenotype can be corrected safely by stable ectopic expression of gammaC and that the transgene is not significantly oncogenic when expressed in this context. However, an underlying predisposition conferred by the SCID-X1 background appears to collaborate with insertional mutagenesis to increase the risk of tumor development.","['Scobie, Linda', 'Hector, Ralph D', 'Grant, Louise', 'Bell, Margaret', 'Nielsen, Anne A', 'Meikle, Sharon', 'Philbey, Adrian', 'Thrasher, Adrian J', 'Cameron, Ewan R', 'Blyth, Karen', 'Neil, James C']","['Scobie L', 'Hector RD', 'Grant L', 'Bell M', 'Nielsen AA', 'Meikle S', 'Philbey A', 'Thrasher AJ', 'Cameron ER', 'Blyth K', 'Neil JC']","['Division of Pathological Sciences, Institute of Comparative Medicine, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK. linda.scobie@gcal.ac.uk']",,['eng'],"['WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'HTH/011/025/009/DH_/Department of Health/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090331,United States,Mol Ther,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,100890581,IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'CD2 Antigens/genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genetic Therapy/*adverse effects', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interleukin Receptor Common gamma Subunit/genetics/*physiology', 'Lymphoma/*etiology/*genetics/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Retroviridae/genetics/*physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Thymus Gland/metabolism', 'X-Linked Combined Immunodeficiency Diseases/*genetics/*therapy']",2009/04/02 09:00,2009/08/08 09:00,['2009/04/02 09:00'],"['2009/04/02 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/08 09:00 [medline]']","['S1525-0016(16)31809-3 [pii]', '10.1038/mt.2009.59 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Ther. 2009 Jun;17(6):1031-8. doi: 10.1038/mt.2009.59.

RESULTS: Most patients with CML respond well to TKIs given as up-front therapy. Available retrospective data suggest that allogenic HCT is safe after TKI therapy. Work is ongoing regarding salvage of postallogeneic HCT failures using TKIs with and without donor lymphocyte infusion. CONCLUSIONS: While allogeneic HCT therapy remains useful, the timing of its application in CML has changed, and it is now considered as second- or third-line therapy.","['Fernandez, Hugo F', 'Kharfan-Dabaja, Mohamed A']","['Fernandez HF', 'Kharfan-Dabaja MA']","['Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation at the H.

METHODS: This review summarizes the recent advances in the field of immunology in CML, specifically in tumor antigen discovery, that have been incorporated into the design of new clinical trials. RESULTS: Multiple vaccine approaches are currently under clinical investigation. Recent laboratory and clinical data also point to a unique interaction of TKIs with the immune system.

METHODS: The authors have reviewed both the preclinical and the clinical data concerning second-generation TKIs intended to circumvent or ameliorate issues with imatinib intolerance or resistance. RESULTS: Two second-generation TKIs, dasatinib and nilotinib, are currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Both have shown significant clinical activity in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who are resistant or intolerant to imatinib or other therapies.

We analyzed RIS near proto-oncogene TSS before (n = 157) and after (n = 129) chemotherapy in dogs that received MGMTP140K gene-modified cells and identified no overall increase of RIS near proto-oncogene TSS after chemotherapy. We also wanted to determine whether in vivo selected cells retained fundamental characteristics of hematopoietic stem cells. To that end, we performed secondary transplantation of MGMTP140K gene-modified cells after in vivo selection in dog leukocyte antigen (DLA)-matched dogs. Gene-modified cells achieved multilineage repopulation, and we identified the same gene-modified clone in both dogs more than 800 and 900 days after transplantation. These data suggest that MGMTP140K selection is well tolerated and should allow clinically for selection of gene-corrected cells in genetic or infectious diseases or chemoprotection for treatment of malignancy.","['Beard, Brian C', 'Sud, Reeteka', 'Keyser, Kirsten A', 'Ironside, Christina', 'Neff, Tobias', 'Gerull, Sabine', 'Trobridge, Grant D', 'Kiem, Hans-Peter']","['Beard BC', 'Sud R', 'Keyser KA', 'Ironside C', 'Neff T', 'Gerull S', 'Trobridge GD', 'Kiem HP']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98109-1024, USA.']",,['eng'],"['HL092554/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL74162/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 DK056465/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK56465/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK47754/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'RL1 HL092554/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 DK047754/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL36444/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL074162/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 HL036444/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090331,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Lineage', 'Dogs', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Genetic Vectors', '*Graft Survival', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase/*genetics', 'Retroviridae/genetics']",2009/04/02 09:00,2009/06/18 09:00,['2009/04/02 09:00'],"['2009/04/02 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/18 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)39085-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-09-176412 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 May 21;113(21):5094-103. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-09-176412.

Here, we report that CLL B cells express constitutive levels of HIF-1alpha under normoxia. We have examined the status of the von Hippel-Lindau gene product (pVHL) that is responsible for HIF-1alpha degradation and found it to be at a notably low level in CLL B cells compared with normal B cells. We demonstrate that the microRNA, miR-92-1, overexpressed in CLL B cells, can target the VHL transcript to repress its expression. We found that the stabilized HIF-1alpha can form an active complex with the transcriptional coactivator p300 and phosphorylated-STAT3 at the VEGF promoter and recruit RNA polymerase II. This is initial evidence that pVHL, without any genetic alteration, can be regulated by microRNA and explains the aberrant autocrine VEGF secretion in CLL.","['Ghosh, Asish K', 'Shanafelt, Tait D', 'Cimmino, Amelia', 'Taccioli, Cristian', 'Volinia, Stefano', 'Liu, Chang-gong', 'Calin, George A', 'Croce, Carlo M', 'Chan, Denise A', 'Giaccia, Amato J', 'Secreto, Charla', 'Wellik, Linda E', 'Lee, Yean K', 'Mukhopadhyay, Debabrata', 'Kay, Neil E']","['Ghosh AK', 'Shanafelt TD', 'Cimmino A', 'Taccioli C', 'Volinia S', 'Liu CG', 'Calin GA', 'Croce CM', 'Chan DA', 'Giaccia AJ', 'Secreto C', 'Wellik LE', 'Lee YK', 'Mukhopadhyay D', 'Kay NE']","['Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",,['eng'],"['P01CA76259/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA081534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA076259/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01CA81534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA116237/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090331,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Hydroxylation/genetics', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1/*genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/*physiology', 'Mixed Function Oxygenases/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/genetics', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/*genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Von Hippel-Lindau Tumor Suppressor Protein/*genetics/metabolism', 'p300-CBP Transcription Factors/metabolism']",2009/04/02 09:00,2009/06/17 09:00,['2009/04/02 09:00'],"['2009/04/02 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/17 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)37395-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-10-185686 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 May 28;113(22):5568-74. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-10-185686.

The role of hematopoietic growth factors as adjunct to treatment in these patients is unclear. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing treatment with immunosuppressive therapy and hematopoietic growth factors to immunosuppressive therapy alone in patients with aplastic anemia. Two reviewers appraised the quality of trials and extracted data. For each trial, results were expressed as relative risks with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous data. The addition of hematopoietic growth factors yielded no difference in overall mortality at 100 days, one year and five years [relative risks 1.33 (95% CI 0.56-3.18), relative risks 0.90 (95% CI 0.50-1.63) and relative risks 0.89 (95% CI 0.55-1.46), respectively]. There was no difference in overall hematologic response and in the occurrence of infections. HGF significantly decreased the risk for relapse, relative risks 0.45 (95% CI 0.30-0.68, 3 trials). Hematopoietic growth factors were not associated with higher occurrence of myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia or paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. The addition of hematopoietic growth factors does not affect mortality, response rate or infections occurrence. Therefore, it should not be recommended routinely as an adjunct to the immunosuppressive therapy for patients with aplastic anemia.","['Gurion, Ronit', 'Gafter-Gvili, Anat', 'Paul, Mical', 'Vidal, Liat', 'Ben-Bassat, Isaac', 'Yeshurun, Moshe', 'Shpilberg, Ofer', 'Raanani, Pia']","['Gurion R', 'Gafter-Gvili A', 'Paul M', 'Vidal L', 'Ben-Bassat I', 'Yeshurun M', 'Shpilberg O', 'Raanani P']","['Institute of Hematology, Davidoff Center, Beilinson Hospital, Rabin Medical Center, Petah-Tikva, Israel. shay_gr@hotmail.com']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20090331,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Erythropoietin/therapeutic use', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/therapeutic use', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/04/02 09:00,2009/09/26 06:00,['2009/04/02 09:00'],"['2009/04/02 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/26 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2008.002170 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2008.002170 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2009 May;94(5):712-9. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2008.002170.

DATA SOURCES: Literature published between July 2008 and December 2008 was accessed via MEDLINE, the Proceedings of the American Society of Hematology, and the Proceedings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology using the key words chronic myelogenous leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, dasatinib, imatinib, nilotinib, pharmacokinetics, and regimen. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Meeting abstracts and reports of major Phase 1-3 studies published in English are included. DATA SYNTHESIS: Imatinib is the standard first-line therapy for CML; however, some patients develop resistance or are intolerant to the drug. Dasatinib was approved for the treatment of imatinib-resistant/intolerant patients with CML or Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia at the dosage of 70 mg twice daily. A Phase 3 dose-optimization study was performed to compare this regimen with others, including dasatinib 100 mg once daily, in patients with CP CML. Results of this study showed that there was no significant difference in efficacy between these 2 regimens. The safety profile was improved in the 100-mg once-daily dasatinib arm with significantly reduced frequencies of grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia and all-grade pleural effusions. The number of patients who had to discontinue, reduce, or interrupt their dosage was also less among patients taking dasatinib 100 mg once daily. CONCLUSIONS: Dasatinib 100 mg once daily has a more favorable risk to benefit assessment compared with the previous 70 mg twice-daily regimen and is now the recommended schedule for patients with CP CML.","['Tyler, Timothy']",['Tyler T'],"['Comprehensive Cancer Center, Desert Regional Medical Center, 1180 N.

DATA SOURCES: A systematic search of PubMed (1949-November 2008) and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (to November 2008) was conducted using the following search terms: osteoporosis, osteopenia, pediatrics, cancer, neoplasms, chemotherapy, bisphosphonates, calcium, vitamin D, calcitonin, and physical therapy. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All prospective studies that evaluated various osteoporosis treatment options in pediatric patients undergoing chemotherapy were included. Results from studies evaluating bisphosphonates and other treatments in children with osteoporosis due to other causes were also included if important safety and efficacy data were provided. Most commonly reported primary efficacy endpoints included comparisons of bone density parameters measured before and after treatment. DATA SYNTHESIS: Four clinical studies and 2 case reports describing treatment with bisphosphonates, specifically alendronate and pamidronate, for osteoporosis or osteopenia in pediatric cancer patients were identified. Results from the trials showed that these medications were efficacious in reducing bone mineral density loss during cancer therapy and were well tolerated in this special population. Primary efficacy endpoints included improvements in Z-scores measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans. The most commonly reported adverse effects included hypocalcemia, mild stomach upset, and infusion-related hyperpyrexia. Four additional clinical trials involving the treatment of osteoporosis or osteopenia in children and adolescents who developed bone degeneration after chronic steroid therapy are also included. In these trials, treatment options such as calcitonin, and calcium and vitamin D supplementation were also shown to be beneficial. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical trials published to date are limited to only a few conducted in small populations of patients diagnosed with lymphoblastic leukemia or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. However, alendronate and pamidronate both appeared to be effective options in improving bone mineral density scores with minimal adverse effects.","['Bryant, Michele L', 'Worthington, Mary A', 'Parsons, Kerry']","['Bryant ML', 'Worthington MA', 'Parsons K']","[""Children's Hospital, Birmingham, AL, USA. michele.bryant@chsys.org""]",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20090331,United States,Ann Pharmacother,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,9203131,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bone Diseases, Metabolic/complications/*therapy', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications/*therapy', 'Lymphoma/complications/*therapy', 'Osteoporosis/complications/*therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/04/02 09:00,2010/01/05 06:00,['2009/04/02 09:00'],"['2009/04/02 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/05 06:00 [medline]']","['aph.1L567 [pii]', '10.1345/aph.1L567 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Pharmacother. 2009 Apr;43(4):714-20. doi: 10.1345/aph.1L567.

METHODS: To estimate the national prevalence of survivors of childhood cancers, we used data from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results program from 1975 to 2004. Long-term childhood cancer survivors, diagnosed before 1975, were estimated using incidence and survival models extrapolated into years before 1975. RESULTS: We estimated that there are a total of 328,652 survivors of childhood cancer in the United States as of January 1, 2005, of these, 24% have survived >30 years since diagnosis. The cancer sites with the largest number of survivors are brain (51,650), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (49,271), germ cell tumors (34,169), and Hodgkin lymphoma (31,598). Sites with higher proportions of survivors diagnosed >30 years ago are germ cell (43%), soft tissue (38%), renal (34%), and bone (26%). Historical trends from Connecticut data show major improvements in survival for all of the childhood cancer sites. CONCLUSION: The number of survivors of childhood cancers is expected to increase in the future consequent to the lifesaving advances in treatment introduced after 1970, especially for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Because this population is at increased risk for illness-related morbidity and mortality, appreciating the number of survivors who were treated as children is important both to determining the national cancer burden and planning for the future health care needs of these individuals.","['Mariotto, Angela B', 'Rowland, Julia H', 'Yabroff, K Robin', 'Scoppa, Steve', 'Hachey, Mark', 'Ries, Lynn', 'Feuer, Eric J']","['Mariotto AB', 'Rowland JH', 'Yabroff KR', 'Scoppa S', 'Hachey M', 'Ries L', 'Feuer EJ']","['National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892-7344, USA. mariotta@mail.nih.gov']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090331,United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Mortality/*trends', 'Neoplasms/*mortality/therapy', 'Registries', 'SEER Program', 'Survival Rate', '*Survivors', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",2009/04/02 09:00,2009/06/17 09:00,['2009/04/02 09:00'],"['2009/04/02 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/17 09:00 [medline]']","['1055-9965.EPI-08-0988 [pii]', '10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-08-0988 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2009 Apr;18(4):1033-40. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-08-0988.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cytokine antibody array was used to detect cytokine profiles in two cell lines of EOC (SKOV3 and CaoV3), primarily cultured EOC and OSE cells. The levels of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), interleukin-10 (IL-10), IL-4, and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) in peritoneal fluids and sera in the patients with EOC and benign gynecological tumors were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: The levels of LIF, IL-10, and IL-4 were detected two times higher in the culture supernatants of the EOC cell lines than those in OSE cells by cytokine antibody array. Both LIF and IL-10 levels were more increased in ascites of EOC patients than in those in benign gynecological tumor patients (P < 0.05). The level of IL-4 was not detectable in any samples of ascites or sera. No difference of TGF-beta1 value was detected between patients with EOC and benign gynecological tumors. CONCLUSION: Epithelium ovarian carcinoma cells can produce more LIF, IL-10 and IL-4 than OSE cells, and contribute to the elevated levels of those cytokines in EOC patients, which probably participates in the development of immune deficiency in the peritoneal cavity of EOC patients.","['Chen, Li-li', 'Ye, Feng', 'Lu, Wei-Guo', 'Yu, Yan', 'Chen, Huai-zheng', 'Xie, Xing']","['Chen LL', 'Ye F', 'Lu WG', 'Yu Y', 'Chen HZ', 'Xie X']","[""Women's Reproductive Health Laboratory of Zhejiang Province, Women's Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Xueshi, Hangzhou, China.""]",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Australia,J Obstet Gynaecol Res,The journal of obstetrics and gynaecology research,9612761,IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytokines/*analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-10/analysis', 'Interleukin-4/analysis', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/analysis', 'Neoplasms, Glandular and Epithelial/*immunology', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*immunology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1/analysis']",2009/04/02 09:00,2009/09/09 06:00,['2009/04/02 09:00'],"['2009/04/02 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/09 06:00 [medline]']","['JOG935 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1447-0756.2008.00935.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Obstet Gynaecol Res. 2009 Apr;35(2):212-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1447-0756.2008.00935.x.,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta1)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, therapies directed towards eliminating B-cells will play an important role as CD20 is exclusively expressed in B-lymphocytes and its modulation by monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab has improved outcomes in lymphoproliferative and autoimmune disorders. Ofatumumab is a new, fully human anti-CD20 antibody and has been shown to be effective and safe, but its role in these conditions is still unclear. OBJECTIVES: To describe the preclinical and clinical data available on ofatumumab for the treatment of lymphoproliferative and autoimmune disorders. METHODS: An extensive search of published articles and abstracts on preclinical and clinical studies with ofatumumab was undertaken. CONCLUSIONS: Ofatumumab is a second-generation anti-CD20 antibody that has been demonstrated to be safe and efficacious in patients with lymphoproliferative and autoimmune disorders. Ofatumumab is fully human, attaches to a newly identified epitope and shows lower off-rates and improved complement-dependent cytotoxicity. Initial data present ofatumumab as an attractive agent with lower rates of infusion-related events than rituximab.

Tumor cell migration and metastasis share many similarities with leukocyte trafficking, which is critically regulated by chemokine receptors and adhesion molecules. SCLC cells express high levels of CXCR4 (CD184), a seven-transmembrane G-protein-coupled chemokine receptor. Stromal cells within the bone marrow microenvironment and at extramedullary sites constitutively secrete stromal cell-derived factor-1 (CXCL12), the ligand for CXCR4. Activation of CXCR4 induces SCLC cell migration and adhesion to stromal cells that secrete CXCL12, which in turn provides growth- and drug resistance-signals to the tumor cells. CXCR4 antagonists, such as Plerixafor (AMD3100) and T140 analogues (TN14003/ BKT140), disrupt CXCR4-mediated SCLC cell-adhesion to stromal cells. In stromal cell co-cultures, CXCR4 antagonists also sensitize SCLC cells to cytotoxic drugs, such as etoposide, and thereby antagonize cell adhesion-mediated drug resistance. Therefore, targeting the CXCR4-CXCL12 axis is a novel, attractive therapeutic approach in SCLC. Here, we summarize preclinical data about CXCR4 in SCLC, and the current status of the preclinical and clinical development of CXCR4 antagonists.","['Burger, Jan A', 'Stewart, David J']","['Burger JA', 'Stewart DJ']","['University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Department of Leukemia, Houston, TX 77230-1402, USA. jaburger@mdanderson.org']",,['eng'],['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,9434197,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', '*Drug Design', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Receptors, CXCR4/*antagonists & inhibitors/immunology/metabolism', 'Small Cell Lung Carcinoma/*drug therapy/immunology/*metabolism']",2009/04/02 09:00,2009/07/08 09:00,['2009/04/02 09:00'],"['2009/04/02 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/08 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/13543780902804249 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2009 Apr;18(4):481-90. doi: 10.1517/13543780902804249.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)']",,,132,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Information was principally gathered from the databases ClinicalTrials.gov and PubMed.gov. RESULTS/CONCLUSION: The major improvements in AML treatment during the last two decades has not been the introduction of new therapeutic agents, but rather the more optimal use of well-known drugs (e.g., high-dose cytarabine therapy, the use of ATRA in maintenance therapy of acute promyelocytic leukaemia) and improvement in the diagnosis and treatment of potentially life-threatening complications in patients treated with allogeneic stem cell transplantation. However, further investigations based on specific targeted therapy and stratification of patients according to knowledge of the individual disease and health status will probably be necessary in future studies of new targeted therapy.","['Stapnes, Camilla', 'Gjertsen, Bjorn Tore', 'Reikvam, Hakon', 'Bruserud, Oystein']","['Stapnes C', 'Gjertsen BT', 'Reikvam H', 'Bruserud O']","['Institute of Medicine, University of Bergen and Section for Haematology, Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.

The nucleotide sequence of the polymorphic region of exon 2 of this allele has been determined and submitted in the GeneBank database under accession number DQ486519. The submitted sequence has maximum homology (92%) with the previously described sequence DRB3-mRNA from Bos indicus (AccN X79346) and differs from it by 24 nucleotide substitutions which result in 16 amino acid substitutions. The peptide (on the basis of the reconstructed amino acid sequence) has 89% identity to the sequence encoded by the BIDRBF 188 locus (Bos indicus). The results obtained permit the sequence described by us to be considered as a new allele of the BoLA-DRB3 gene (DRB3.2**X). The total frequency of the main six alleles (DRB3.2*X, *10, *11, *20, *34 and *X) occurring with a frequency of over 5% is about 60% in Iranian Sistani cattle. Fifteen alleles have <1% frequency. The highest frequency was observed for DRB3.2*8 allele (21.54%) like in other previously described breeds of Bos indicus (up to 23.07%). The Iranian breed Sistani has a high level of similarity by the spectrum of BoLA-DRB3 alleles and their frequencies to other Bos indicus breeds and significantly differs by these criteria from the Bos taurus breeds. The Iranian Sistani herd under study includes alleles associated with to resistance to leukemia (DRB3.2*ll and *23) and to different forms of mastitis (DRB3.2*2, *7, *11, *23 and *24) although their frequencies are low (from 0.77 to 5.37%).

Gene mutation is proposed to be one of the disease-defining genetic abnormalities of MDS/AML. Most of the mutants lose trans-activation potential, which leads to a loss of normal function indicating that AML1/RUNX1 dysfunction is one of the major pathogenic mechanisms of MDS/AML. However, N-terminal in-frame mutations (Ni-type) and C-terminal truncated mutations (Ct-type) of AML1/RUNX1 show a dominant-negative effect on the trans-activation activity, suggesting that these types of mutants may have some oncogenic potential in addition to the loss of normal function. The patients with Ni-type mutations have hypoplastic marrows with other genetic abnormalities, whereas the patients with Ct-type mutations display hyperplastic marrows without other mutations. Although biological analysis using a mouse bone marrow transplantation model transduced with Ni-type of D171N or Ct-type of S291fsX300 mutants has partially confirmed the oncogenic ability of AML1 mutants, it could not explain the mutant specific clinical features of MDS/AML. Biological analysis using human CD34(+) cells revealed that the two types exhibited distinct molecular mechanisms.

The present study describes the effects of GLC756 on cellular adenosine 3', 5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) in relation to TNF-alpha production on LPS-stimulated human acute monocytic leukemia cells. METHODS: A human peripheral blood acute monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1) was activated via LPS. THP-1 cells were incubated with GLC756 or betamethasone (positive control) at concentrations of 1, 10, and 30 microM. The TNF-alpha concentration in supernatant and cAMP levels in cellular extract were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 0,1, 2.5, 4.5, 7, and 24 h post-activation. RESULTS: Compared with LPS controls, both GLC756 at 30 muM and betamethasone at > or =1 microM had a significant inhibitory effect on TNF-alpha release from THP-1 cells 2.5 to 24 h post-activation. Parallel to the TNF-alpha decrease, GLC756 induced significant increases of cellular cAMP 2.5 and 7 h post-activation. Betamethasone had no effect on the cellular cAMP level. CONCLUSION: Intracellular signaling pathway leading to inhibition of the production of the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha after GLC756 treatment might be mediated through the second messenger cAMP.","['Laengle, Ulrich W', 'Markstein, Rudolf', 'Cazaubon, Cecile', 'Roman, Danielle']","['Laengle UW', 'Markstein R', 'Cazaubon C', 'Roman D']","['Department of Toxicology & Pathology, Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland.

Furthermore, infusion of CLL cells into young Emu-TCL1 mice induced defects comparable to those seen in mice with developed leukemia, demonstrating a causal relationship between leukemia and the T-cell defects. Altered pathways involved genes regulating actin remodeling, and T cells exhibited dysfunctional immunological synapse formation and T-cell signaling, which was reversed by the immunomodulatory drug lenalidomide.

SV40 T-antigen expression appeared to result from retention of the targeted germline allele and concomitant antisense transcription of SV40 large T in mature B cells, leading to chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Although B-cell development was unperturbed in young mice, aging mice showed accumulation of a monoclonal B-cell population in which the targeted IgH allele was in germline configuration and the wild-type IgH allele had a productive V(D)J recombination. These leukemic B cells were IgD(low)CD5(+) and manifested nonrandom usage of V, D, and J segments. V(H) regions were either unmutated, with preferential usage of the VH11 family, or manifested extensive somatic hypermutation. Our findings provide an animal model for B-CLL and show that pathways activated by SV40 T antigen play important roles in the pathogenesis of B-CLL.","['ter Brugge, Petra J', 'Ta, Van B T', 'de Bruijn, Marjolein J W', 'Keijzers, Guido', 'Maas, Alex', 'van Gent, Dik C', 'Hendriks, Rudi W']","['ter Brugge PJ', 'Ta VB', 'de Bruijn MJ', 'Keijzers G', 'Maas A', 'van Gent DC', 'Hendriks RW']","['Departments of Immunology, Erasmus MC Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090330,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Alleles', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Polyomavirus Transforming/*genetics', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/virology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression', 'Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics/immunology/virology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/immunology/*virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Simian virus 40/*genetics/immunology/*pathogenicity', 'Somatic Hypermutation, Immunoglobulin', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/deficiency/genetics']",2009/04/01 09:00,2009/07/25 09:00,['2009/04/01 09:00'],"['2009/04/01 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/25 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)37144-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-01-198937 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Jul 2;114(1):119-27. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-01-198937.

In this study, we optimized the cell density of embryonic stem (ES) cells for developing cystic EB-Vs in a low-adherence 96-well plate. When ES cells were seeded at a density of 4000 cells/well, the cystic EB-Vs were most efficiently developed from ES cells via forming multicellular spherical aggregates called embryoid bodies (EBs). The suspension culture in the low-adherence plate was preferable for developing EBs into cystic EB-Vs rather than the attachment culture in the plate coated with 0.1% gelatin. The seeding cell density of 4000 cells/well was always superior to 1000 cells/well in the efficiency of cystic EB-V development. Because the high-cell density culture generally raises the limitation of oxygen and nutrient supplies, we investigated the effects of low-oxygen and low-nutrient conditions on the development of cystic EB-Vs. It was found that low oxygen tension was not a factor for promoting the development of cystic EB-Vs. It was suggested that a low-nutrient medium is preferred for developing cystic EB-Vs rather than a sufficient-nutrient medium. In conclusion, the suspension culture in the low-adherence 96-well plate seeded with 4000 ES cells/well was optimum for developing cystic EB-Vs. The low-nutrient condition may be one of the factors for promoting the development of cystic EB-Vs.","['Yasuda, Emiko', 'Seki, Yuji', 'Higuchi, Takatoshi', 'Nakashima, Fumio', 'Noda, Tomozumi', 'Kurosawa, Hiroshi']","['Yasuda E', 'Seki Y', 'Higuchi T', 'Nakashima F', 'Noda T', 'Kurosawa H']","['Division of Medicine and Engineering Science, Interdisciplinary Graduate School of Medicine and Engineering, University of Yamanashi, 4-3-11 Takeda, Kofu, Yamanashi, Japan.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Japan,J Biosci Bioeng,Journal of bioscience and bioengineering,100888800,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Culture Media', 'DNA Primers', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/ultrastructure', 'GATA4 Transcription Factor/genetics', 'Gelatin', 'Glyceraldehyde 3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (NADP+)/genetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/physiology', 'Mice', 'Oxygen/pharmacology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2009/04/01 09:00,2009/07/30 09:00,['2009/04/01 09:00'],"['2008/10/17 00:00 [received]', '2008/12/03 00:00 [revised]', '2008/12/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/04/01 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/30 09:00 [medline]']","['S1389-1723(08)00114-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.jbiosc.2008.12.004 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biosci Bioeng. 2009 Apr;107(4):442-6. doi: 10.1016/j.jbiosc.2008.12.004.,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (GATA4 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '9000-70-8 (Gelatin)', 'EC 1.2.1.9 (Glyceraldehyde 3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (NADP+))', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overexpression of the drug-efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is a key factor contributing to tumor drug resistance. Third generation P-gp inhibitors like tariquidar have shown promising efficacy in early clinical trials. However, for maximum efficacy, it is important to limit the exposure of normal cells and tissues to the efflux inhibitor and the anticancer drug, and temporally colocalize the drug-inhibitor combination in the tumor cells. In this study, we investigated simultaneous and targeted delivery of anticancer drug, paclitaxel, with P-gp modulator, tariquidar, using poly(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide) nanoparticles to overcome tumor drug resistance. Nanoparticles were surface functionalized with biotin for active tumor targeting. Dual agent nanoparticles encapsulating the combination of paclitaxel and tariquidar showed significantly higher cytotoxicity in vitro than nanoparticles loaded with paclitaxel alone. Enhanced therapeutic efficacy of dual agent nanoparticles could be correlated with increased accumulation of paclitaxel in drug-resistant tumor cells. In vivo studies in a mouse model of drug-resistant tumor demonstrated significantly greater inhibition of tumor growth following treatment with biotin-functionalized nanoparticles encapsulating both paclitaxel and tariquidar at a paclitaxel dose that was ineffective in the absence of tariquidar. Taken together, these results suggest that the use of targeted, dual agent nanoparticles delivering a combination of P-gp modulator and anticancer drug is a very promising approach to overcome tumor drug resistance.","['Patil, Yogesh', 'Sadhukha, Tanmoy', 'Ma, Linan', 'Panyam, Jayanth']","['Patil Y', 'Sadhukha T', 'Ma L', 'Panyam J']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Eugene Applebaum College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI 48201, USA.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090205,Netherlands,J Control Release,Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,8607908,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'Adenocarcinoma/drug therapy', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use/toxicity', '*Biotin', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Carriers', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Lactic Acid', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/drug therapy', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Animal/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Nanoparticles/ultrastructure', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Paclitaxel/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use/toxicity', '*Polyglycolic Acid', 'Polylactic Acid-Polyglycolic Acid Copolymer', 'Quinolines/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use/toxicity']",2009/04/01 09:00,2009/08/21 09:00,['2009/04/01 09:00'],"['2008/12/05 00:00 [received]', '2009/01/08 00:00 [revised]', '2009/01/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/04/01 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/21 09:00 [medline]']","['S0168-3659(09)00081-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jconrel.2009.01.021 [doi]']",ppublish,J Control Release. 2009 May 21;136(1):21-9. doi: 10.1016/j.jconrel.2009.01.021.

However, the signaling pathways controlling rabbit ES cell pluripotency remain largely unknown. Here we report that bFGF can maintain the undifferentiated status of rabbit ES cells and found that Activin/Nodal signaling through Smad2/3 activation is necessary to maintain the pluripotent status of rabbit ES cells. We further show that in spite of STAT3 in rabbit ES cells, LIF is dispensable for maintenance of undifferentiated status in rabbit ES cells. Although phosphorylation of Janus Kinase signal transducer and activator (JAK/STAT) disappeared after JAK-inhibitor treatment, OCT4 is constantly produced. When rabbit ES cells were cultured for more than 40 passages in the absence of LIF, expression of stem cell markers and teratoma formation were observed. Additionally, treatment with Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) inhibitor, Y27632, to rabbit ES cells significantly enhanced cell growth. These findings suggest that molecular mechanisms underlying rabbit ES cell self-renewal and pluripotency are similar to primate ES cells. Rabbit ES cells may provide a translational research model for the study of human diseases in vitro and applications to transplantation therapy.","['Honda, Arata', 'Hirose, Michiko', 'Ogura, Atsuo']","['Honda A', 'Hirose M', 'Ogura A']","['RIKEN Bioresource Center, 3-1-1, Koyadai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-0074, Japan. a-honda@rtc.riken.jp']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090206,United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,IM,"['Activins/*physiology', 'Amides/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/*physiology', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/*physiology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Nodal Protein/*physiology', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/cytology/physiology', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Rabbits', 'Signal Transduction', 'Teratoma/pathology', 'rho-Associated Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",2009/04/01 09:00,2009/07/07 09:00,['2009/04/01 09:00'],"['2008/12/16 00:00 [received]', '2009/01/25 00:00 [revised]', '2009/01/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/04/01 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/07 09:00 [medline]']","['S0014-4827(09)00049-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.yexcr.2009.01.024 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2009 Jul 15;315(12):2033-42. doi: 10.1016/j.yexcr.2009.01.024.

METHODS: Mice were inoculated subcutaneously with K562 and K562/ADM cells, respectively. Tumour-bearing animals were divided into HSS, adriamycin, combination therapy (adriamycin plus HSS) and placebo groups. The anti-tumour effect was assessed by tumour growth curve and tumour inhibitory rate (IR). RESULTS: In animals inoculated with K562 cells, the inhibitory rates of high (1800mg/kg) and medium (900mg/kg ) dose HSS groups were 100% and 96.4%, respectively, which was higher than that in the adriamycin (88.9%) or the combination therapy groups (85.8%, P < 0.05). The inhibitory rate in the low-dose HSS group (53.4%) was lower than in all other groups (P < 0.01). In mice inoculated with K562/ADM cells, the inhibitory rates in the high, medium and low dose HSS groups were 100%, 95.9%, and 44.1%, respectively. In the adriamycin group, the inhibitory rate was 23.07%, which was lower than in the HSS group (P < 0.01). Pathological examination of tumour tissues from HSS-treated animals showed extensive necrosis and bleeding. CONCLUSIONS: Haishengsu inhibits the growth of transplanted K562 tumours in mice.

In the hematology field, nanotechnology can counter multiple drug resistance in leukemia by blocking drug efflux from cancer cells, and provide effective delivery of siRNA into lymphocytes to block apoptosis in sepsis. Controlling the surface properties of materials on devices such as valves and stents promises improved biocompatibility by inhibition of thrombosis, the formation of blood clots, and regulating cell adhesion and activation. Nanoparticle-based thrombolytic agents have the potential to improve the effectiveness of clot removal. Treatment of both lung and blood diseases is also likely to benefit from nano-scaffold-based methods for controlling the differentiation and proliferation of stem and progenitor cells.","['Buxton, Denis B']",['Buxton DB'],"['Advanced Technologies & Surgery Branch, Division of Cardiovascular Diseases, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. db225a@nih.gov']",,['eng'],['Z99 HL999999/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Nanomedicine (Lond),"Nanomedicine (London, England)",101278111,IM,"['Animals', 'Drug Delivery Systems/*methods/trends', 'Hematologic Diseases/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Lung Diseases/*therapy', 'Nanomedicine/*methods/trends', 'Nanoparticles/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Tissue Engineering']",2009/04/01 09:00,2009/06/03 09:00,['2009/04/01 09:00'],"['2009/04/01 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/03 09:00 [medline]']",['10.2217/nnm.09.8 [doi]'],ppublish,Nanomedicine (Lond). 2009 Apr;4(3):331-9. doi: 10.2217/nnm.09.8.,,,,104,PMC6568266,['NIHMS297194'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The introduction of phenoxy [18], isopropylamino [23] or 2-methylpiperidino [33] groups to the 2-position of naphtho[2,3-b]furan-4,9-dione yielded compounds that showed the greatest tumor-specificity. These compounds, at twice or four times higher concentrations than CC50, induced the activation of caspase-3, caspase-8 and caspase-9 in the HSC-2 and HL-60 cells, but not so apparently in the HSC-4 cells. However, they did not induce internucleosomal DNA fragmentation in the HSC-2 and HSC-4 cells even after 24 hours incubation and only slightly induced DNA fragmentation in the HL-60 cells. Compound [18] induced the production of annexin-positive cells, but did not induce microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) accumulation in autophagosomes in LC3-green fluorescent protein (GFP)-transfected HSC-2 cells. These data suggested that naphtho[2,3-b]furan-4,9-diones may induce the early apoptotic marker, without induction of caspase activation and DNA fragmentation in oral squamous cell carcinoma cell lines.

A robust screening enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect binding Ab(+) against ASNase has been developed and validated for therapeutic monitoring to support clinical trials. Recently, a protein chip bioassay (Biacore) was developed for the Ab of these proteins. These methods were compared. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Biacore T-100 analyzer using a protein bioassay and an ELISA assay were used to determine the IgG immmuboglobulin Ab against ASNase in sera from 84 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients plus 6 controls (n=121 samples). These samples were characterized for anti-ASNase Ab neutralizing activity. Human E. coli ASNase, pegaspargase and Erwinase proteins were covalently coupled to the carboxy-methylated dextran matrix of a CM5 sensor chip (surface plasmon resonance, SPR). In the course of a nested experimental design, a wide range of human sera from patients who had obvious clinical allergic reactions after either native or pegaspargase treatments were tested. The data were fitted by a parametric logistic equation (+/-95% confidence interval, CI), which ranged from <3.0% to <14%. RESULTS: The specificity of Ab(+) was evaluated using ""spiked"" human IgG antibodies. Both assays provide near excellent linearity and sensitivity of response (<0.8 to <500 ratio and 1-3000 resonance units [RU]) of anti-ASNase Ab in human sera with low variance. The bioassay method was ten times more sensitive than the ELISA Ab assay. The lowest limit of quantification of Ab(+) ratio for the SPR assay was 0.6 whereas the upper limit of quantification was 3000 RU. The SPR assay results were in excellent accord with both the Ab(-) and the Ab(+). Ab(-) by the ELISA method (<1.003 ratio) was related to a mean RU value of 8.1. Despite the narrow range of ambiguity around the 1.1 Ab(+) ratio values, the majority of the specimens (93.2%) were determined to be Ab(+) by either ELISA or SPR determination. CONCLUSION: The vast majority (81/84 = 96.4%) of the IgG Ab(+) were neutralizing. The SPR Ab determination technique is reliable, accurate and more sensitive than the ELISA method.","['Avramis, Vassilios I', 'Avramis, Earl V', 'Hunter, William', 'Long, Melissa C']","['Avramis VI', 'Avramis EV', 'Hunter W', 'Long MC']","['CHLA Hematology/Oncology USC-Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90027, USA. vavramis@chla.usc.edu']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,"['Adult', 'Asparaginase/adverse effects/*immunology/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/*methods', 'Erwinia/enzymology', 'Escherichia coli/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/*blood', 'Polyethylene Glycols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Protein Array Analysis/methods', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Surface Plasmon Resonance/*methods']",2009/04/01 09:00,2009/04/17 09:00,['2009/04/01 09:00'],"['2009/04/01 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/04/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/17 09:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2009 Jan;29(1):299-302.,"['0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '7D96IR0PPM (pegaspargase)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Incidence of nonHodgkin's lymphomas and Hodgkin's lymphomas, although not of leukemias, is substantially increased under immunosuppression. Specific chromosomal modifications (translocations) resulting in fusion genes frequently emerge as early, but not sufficient, events for malignant progression in most of these conditions. Presently less than 10% of the global incidence of leukemias and lymphomas can be linked to infections (Epstein-Barr virus, human T-lymphotropic retrovirus, human herpesvirus type 8 and Helicobacter pylori). For individual tumor types of the remaining more than 90%, several risk factors have been identified. They include occupational hazards, such as engagement in community services and agriculture, as well as time-space clustering. In childhood leukemias, a protective effect was noted for multiple infections during the first year of life and for at least 6 months of breastfeeding. A high socioeconomic state and absence of multiple contacts during the early phase of life have been described as risk factors. A hypothesis is presented here which combines these observations. It postulates a wide-spread viral infection, nontumorigenic when replication competent, but potentially leukemiogenic or carcinogenic when replication-incompetent viral genomes infect cells with specific chromosomal modifications. Existing data on polyoma-like virus types seem to render members of this or structurally related virus families as putative candidates for these malignancies.","['zur Hausen, Harald']",['zur Hausen H'],"['Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum, Angewandte Tumorvirologie, Im Neuenheimer Feld 280, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany. zurhausen@dkfz-heidelberg.de']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Child', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Genome, Viral/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*etiology/genetics', 'Lymphoma/*etiology/genetics', 'Polyomavirus Infections/*complications', 'Risk Factors']",2009/03/31 09:00,2009/09/22 06:00,['2009/03/31 09:00'],"['2009/03/31 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.24365 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2009 Oct 15;125(8):1764-70. doi: 10.1002/ijc.24365.,,,,94,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cell viability was measured by an MTT assay. Cell apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry as well as DNA fragmentation analysis. Cell morphology was observed using an inverted microscope and Hoechst 33258 staining. RT-PCR and Western blot analysis were used to detect survivin as well as Bax and Bcl-2 expressions after the cells were treated with different concentrations of ponicidin. The results revealed that ponicidin could inhibit the growth of U937 and THP-1 cells significantly by induction of apoptosis. The suppression was in both time- and dose-dependent manner. Marked morphological changes of cell apoptosis were observed clearly after the cells were treated with ponicidin for 48 approximately 72 h. RT-PCR and Western blot analysis demonstrated that both survivin and Bcl-2 expressions were down-regulated remarkably while Bax expression remained constant before and after apoptosis occurred. We therefore conclude that ponicidin has significant anti-proliferation effects by inducing apoptosis on leukemia cells in vitro, downregulation of survivin as well as Bcl-2 expressions may be the important apoptosis inducing mechanisms.

FLT3 is also expressed on leukemia blasts in most cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In order to determine the frequency of FLT3 oncogene mutations, we analyzed genomic DNA of adult de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and conformation-sensitive gel electrophoresis (CSGE) were used for FLT3 exons 11, 14, and 15, followed by direct DNA sequencing. Two different types of functionally important FLT 3 mutations have been identified. Those mutations were unique to patients with inv(16), t(15:17) or t(8;21) and comprised fifteen cases with internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutation in the juxtamembrane domain and eleven cases with point mutation (exon 20, Asp835Tyr). The high frequency of the flt3 proto-oncogene mutations in acute myeloid leukemia AML suggests a key role for the receptor function. The association of FLT3 mutations with chromosomal abnormalities invites speculation as to the link between these two changes in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemiaAML. Furthermore, CSGE method has shown to be a rapid and sensitive screening method for detection of nucleotide alteration in FLT3 gene.

TSC-22 is a gene silenced in several solid tumors, but its function and the mechanism(s) responsible for its silencing are largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that the TSC-22 promoter is methylated in primary mouse T or natural killer (NK) large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia and this is associated with down-regulation or silencing of TSC-22 expression. The TSC-22 deregulation was reversed in vivo by a 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine therapy of T or NK LGL leukemia, which significantly increased survival of the mice bearing this disease. Ectopic expression of TSC-22 in mouse leukemia or lymphoma cell lines resulted in delayed in vivo tumor formation. Targeted disruption of TSC-22 in wild-type mice enhanced proliferation and in vivo repopulation efficiency of hematopoietic precursor cells (HPCs). Collectively, our data suggest that TSC-22 normally contributes to the regulation of HPC function and is a putative tumor suppressor gene that is hypermethylated and silenced in T or NK LGL leukemia.","['Yu, Jianhua', 'Ershler, Maxim', 'Yu, Li', 'Wei, Min', 'Hackanson, Bjorn', 'Yokohama, Akihiko', 'Mitsui, Takeki', 'Liu, Chunhui', 'Mao, Hsiaoyin', 'Liu, Shujun', 'Liu, Zhongfa', 'Trotta, Rossana', 'Liu, Chang-gong', 'Liu, Xiuping', 'Huang, Kun', 'Visser, Jan', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Plass, Christoph', 'Belyavsky, Alexander V', 'Caligiuri, Michael A']","['Yu J', 'Ershler M', 'Yu L', 'Wei M', 'Hackanson B', 'Yokohama A', 'Mitsui T', 'Liu C', 'Mao H', 'Liu S', 'Liu Z', 'Trotta R', 'Liu CG', 'Liu X', 'Huang K', 'Visser J', 'Marcucci G', 'Plass C', 'Belyavsky AV', 'Caligiuri MA']","['Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology, and Medical Genetics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA. jianhua.yu@osumc.edu']",,['eng'],"['CA101956/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA93548/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA68458/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA068458/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA095426/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA95426/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA068458/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA101956/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA093548/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090327,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Movement/*genetics', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Methylation', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Silencing/physiology', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics/*physiology']",2009/03/31 09:00,2009/06/17 09:00,['2009/03/31 09:00'],"['2009/03/31 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/17 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)37394-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-02-205732 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 May 28;113(22):5558-67. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-02-205732.

Analysis of male germ-line stem cells in Drosophila has revealed the importance of local signals from the microenvironment, the stem cell niche, in controlling stem cell behavior. Germ-line stem cells physically attach to the niche via localized adherens junctions that provide a polarity cue for orientation of centrosomes in interphase and the spindle in mitosis. As a result, stem cells divide asymmetrically: One daughter inherits attachment to the niche and remains within its embrace, whereas the other is displaced away and initiates differentiation. Strikingly, much as leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling maintain mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells, maintenance of stem cell state in the Drosophila male germ line is regulated by cytokine-like signals from hub cells that activate the transcription factor STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) and TGF-beta class signals from surrounding support cells that repress expression of a key differentiation factor. Surprisingly, transit-amplifying cells can revert to the stem cell state if they reoccupy the niche. Upon cessation of mitosis and the switch to terminal differentiation, germ cells express cell-type- and stage-specific transcription machinery components that drive expression of terminal differentiation genes, in part by removing Polycomb transcriptional silencing machinery.","['Davies, E L', 'Fuller, M T']","['Davies EL', 'Fuller MT']","['Departments of Developmental Biology and Genetics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California 94305-5329, USA.']",,['eng'],"['R01 GM061986/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM080501/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', '1 R01 GM080501/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', '3 R01 GM061986/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20090327,United States,Cold Spring Harb Symp Quant Biol,Cold Spring Harbor symposia on quantitative biology,1256107,IM,"['Adult Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Polarity', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Drosophila/*cytology', 'Drosophila Proteins/metabolism', 'Male', 'Models, Biological', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1', 'STAT Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spermatogenesis', 'Spermatozoa/*cytology/metabolism', 'Testis/cytology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/metabolism']",2009/03/31 09:00,2009/08/14 09:00,['2009/03/31 09:00'],"['2009/03/31 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/14 09:00 [medline]']","['sqb.2008.73.063 [pii]', '10.1101/sqb.2008.73.063 [doi]']",ppublish,Cold Spring Harb Symp Quant Biol. 2008;73:137-45. doi: 10.1101/sqb.2008.73.063.

The association between symplekin and the Y-box transcription factor ZONAB activates proliferation in intestinal and kidney cells. We analyzed symplekin expression in human colonic crypts and investigated its function in differentiation. METHODS: Expression of differentiation markers and transcription factors was assessed in HT29-Cl.16E cells that expressed inducible symplekin short hairpin RNA or were transfected with ZONAB small interfering RNAs. Intestines of AML1(Delta/Delta) mice were stained with alcian blue and analyzed for expression of AML1/Runx1, GAPDH, KLF-4, and Muc-2. Mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation were used to detect AML1 and ZONAB/DbpA binding to promoter regions of the Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) and acute myeloid leukemia-1 (AML1) genes, respectively. RESULTS: The gradient of nuclear symplekin expression decreased from the proliferative toward the differentiated compartment of colonic crypts; symplekin down-regulation promoted the differentiation of HT29-Cl.16E colorectal carcinoma cells into goblet cells. Down-regulation of symplekin or ZONAB/Dbpa induced de novo expression of the transcription factor AML1/Runx1, thereby increasing the expression of KLF4 and promoting goblet cell differentiation. Furthermore, increased AML1 expression was required for the induction of goblet cell differentiation after symplekin down-regulation. KLF4 expression and goblet cell numbers were reduced in the intestines of AML1(Delta/Delta) mice, confirming the role of AML1 as a promoter of intestinal differentiation in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Symplekin cooperates with ZONAB to negatively regulate intestinal goblet cell differentiation, acting by repression of AML1 and KLF4.","['Buchert, Michael', 'Darido, Charbel', 'Lagerqvist, Ebba', 'Sedello, Anna', 'Cazevieille, Chantal', 'Buchholz, Frank', 'Bourgaux, Jean-Francois', 'Pannequin, Julie', 'Joubert, Dominique', 'Hollande, Frederic']","['Buchert M', 'Darido C', 'Lagerqvist E', 'Sedello A', 'Cazevieille C', 'Buchholz F', 'Bourgaux JF', 'Pannequin J', 'Joubert D', 'Hollande F']","['CNRS, UMR 5203, Institut de Genomique Fonctionnelle, Montpellier, France.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090327,United States,Gastroenterology,Gastroenterology,0374630,IM,"['Animals', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenases/metabolism', 'Goblet Cells/enzymology/*metabolism', 'HT29 Cells', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intestinal Mucosa/*metabolism', 'Intestines/enzymology', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mucin-2/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Transfection']",2009/03/31 09:00,2009/07/17 09:00,['2009/03/31 09:00'],"['2008/12/24 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/24 00:00 [revised]', '2009/03/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/31 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/17 09:00 [medline]']","['S0016-5085(09)00465-X [pii]', '10.1053/j.gastro.2009.03.037 [doi]']",ppublish,"Gastroenterology. 2009 Jul;137(1):156-64, 164.e1-3. doi: 10.1053/j.gastro.2009.03.037.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Sixty-two patients aged 2.9-16.6 (median 6.4 years) were eligible. Forty-eight (77%) had non-pineal sites and 14 (23%) had pineal sites. Eleven were randomized to RT alone (6) and five to pre-RT Vincristine, Etoposide, Carboplatin and Cyclophosphamide. Fifty-one were not randomized, 15 receiving RT alone and 36 receiving pre-RT chemotherapy. Craniospinal RT (CSRT) 35 Gy/21 fractions were followed by 20 Gy/12 fractions to primary tumour. RESULTS: Mean CSRT dose was 34.7 Gy and mean total primary dose was 53.4 Gy for those who received radiotherapy. Of 30 relapses, 18 (60%) were local only and 5 (16.7%) were combined local and leptomeningeal. There was no significant impact on Overall Survival (OS) or Event-Free Survival (EFS) of surgery-RT interval for patients treated by pre-RT chemotherapy or RT alone, or duration of RT (completing within 50 days). Planning films were received for 42/54 (77.8%) patients. Fourteen (33%) had one or more targeting deviations (10 cribriform fossa, 11 base of skull). There was a statistically significant increase in the risk of recurrence for patients with cribriform fossa targeting deviations (p=0.033), but not for patients with base of skull targeting deviations (p=0.242). There was no statistically significant difference in OS (p=0.0598) or EFS (p=0.0880) for patients who had one or more targeting deviations compared to those who had none. CONCLUSIONS: This study has not demonstrated a statistically significant impact of radiotherapy duration or targeting deviations on OS or EFS, possibly due to small patient numbers. However, multi-institutional SPNET trials should incorporate quality assurance programs including analysis of relapse pattern in relation to primary target volume coverage.","['Taylor, Roger E', 'Donachie, Paul H J', 'Weston, Claire L', 'Robinson, Kathryn J', 'Lucraft, Helen', 'Saran, Frank', 'Ellison, David W', 'Ironside, James', 'Walker, David A', 'Pizer, Barry L']","['Taylor RE', 'Donachie PH', 'Weston CL', 'Robinson KJ', 'Lucraft H', 'Saran F', 'Ellison DW', 'Ironside J', 'Walker DA', 'Pizer BL']","['Swansea University, Swansea, UK.

Increasing the expression of the gamma-globin gene has great benefits in reducing complications associated with these diseases. The Oct-1 transcription factor is involved in the transcriptional regulation of the gamma-globin gene. The human gamma-globin genes (both Agamma and Ggamma-globin genes) carry three Oct-1 transcription factor consensus sequences within their promoter regions. We have studied the possibility of inducing gamma-globin gene expression using decoy oligonucleotides that target the Oct-1 transcription factor consensus sequence. A double-stranded 22 bp decoy oligonucleotide containing the Oct-1 consensus sequence was synthesized. The results obtained from our in vitro binding assay revealed a strong competitive binding of the decoy oligonucleotide for the Oct-1 transcription factor. When K562 human erythroleukemia cells were treated with the Oct-1 decoy oligonucleotide, significant increases in the level of the gamma-globin mRNA were observed. The results of our western blots further demonstrated significant increases of the fetal hemoglobin (HbF, alpha2gamma2) in the Oct-1 decoy oligonucleotide-treated K562 cells. The results of our immunoprecipitation (IP) studies revealed that the treatment of K562 cells with the Oct-1 decoy oligonucleotide significantly reduced the level of the endogenous gamma-globin gene promoter region DNA co-precipitated with the Oct-1 transcription factor. These results suggest that the decoy oligonucleotide designed for the Oct-1 transcription factor consensus sequence could induce expression of the endogenous gamma-globin gene through competitive binding of the Oct-1 transcription factor, resulting in activation of the gamma-globin genes. Therefore, disrupting the bindings of the Oct-1 transcriptional factors with the decoy oligonucleotide provides a novel approach for inducing expression of the gamma-globin genes. It also provides an innovative strategy for the treatment of many disease conditions, including sickle cell anemia and beta-thalassemia.","['Xu, Xiaoxin S', 'Hong, Xin', 'Wang, Gan']","['Xu XS', 'Hong X', 'Wang G']","['Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Wayne State University, 2727 Second Avenue, Detroit, MI 48201, USA. x.xu@wayne.edu']",,['eng'],"['P30 ES006639/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL062551/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01HL62551/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 ES06639/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090327,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', '*Consensus Sequence', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Gene Targeting/methods', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/pathology', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-1/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotides/*pharmacology', 'Protein Binding', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid/genetics', 'Up-Regulation', 'gamma-Globins/*genetics']",2009/03/31 09:00,2010/06/16 06:00,['2009/03/31 09:00'],"['2008/12/18 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/31 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/16 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-8722-2-15 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-8722-2-15 [doi]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2009 Mar 27;2:15. doi: 10.1186/1756-8722-2-15.,"['0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-1)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (gamma-Globins)']",,,,PMC2669152,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our objective was to assess the relationship between protein expression and the amount of lineage marker mRNA in acute leukemia samples and to determine whether four lineage markers could be used to differentiate between normal and acute leukemia bone marrow (BM) without cell sorting. METHODS: Quantification of the mRNA of CD19, CD79a, CD3e, and myeloperoxidase was performed by RT-qPCR on 130 acute leukemia BM samples at diagnosis and on 20 BM samples from healthy donors, without cell sorting. Immunophenotyping of leukemia samples was performed after manual gating around the blastic population. RESULTS: Reference values for the four lineage markers were established by RT-qPCR for normal BM. The mRNA expression levels of these four lineage markers allowed the distinction between normal samples and 100% of acute leukemia samples. CONCLUSIONS: With 92% congruence for protein expression and amount of mRNA in acute leukemias, these four lineage markers, essential for diagnosis and subclassification of acute leukemias by flow cytometry, also represent excellent candidate genes when using RT-qPCR technology as a diagnostic tool for molecular cancer class prediction.","['Saussoy, Pascale', 'Vaerman, Jean-Luc', 'Druez, Vincent', 'Deneys, Veronique', 'Straetmans, Nicole', 'Cornu, Guy', 'Ferrant, Augustin', 'Latinne, Dominique']","['Saussoy P', 'Vaerman JL', 'Druez V', 'Deneys V', 'Straetmans N', 'Cornu G', 'Ferrant A', 'Latinne D']","[""Departement de Biologie Clinique et d'Anatomie Pathologique, Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc (UCL), Bruxelles, Belgium. pascale.saussoy@uclouvain.be""]",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,Clin Chem Lab Med,Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,9806306,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Cell Lineage/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Health', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2009/03/31 09:00,2009/06/13 09:00,['2009/03/31 09:00'],"['2009/03/31 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/13 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1515/CCLM.2009.093 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Chem Lab Med. 2009;47(4):419-26. doi: 10.1515/CCLM.2009.093.,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effects of intracellular ascorbic acid (vitamin C) on HNE-induced cytotoxicity and protein carbonylation were investigated in human THP-1 monocytic leukemia cells. HNE treatment of these cells resulted in apoptosis, necrosis, and protein carbonylation. Ascorbic acid accumulated in the cells at concentrations of 6.4 or 8.9 mM after treatment with 0.1 or 1 mM ascorbate in the medium for 18 h. Pretreatment of cells with 1.0 mM ascorbate decreased HNE-induced formation of reactive oxygen species and formation of protein carbonyls. The protective effects of ascorbate were associated with an increase in the formation of GSH-HNE conjugate and its phase 1 metabolites, measured by LC-MS/MS, and with increased transport of GSH conjugates from the cells into the medium. Ascorbate pretreatment enhanced the efflux of the multidrug resistant protein (MRP) substrate, carboxy-2',7'-dichlorofluorescein (CDF), and it prevented the HNE-induced inhibition of CDF export from THP-1 cells, suggesting that the protective effect of ascorbate against HNE cytotoxicity is through modulation of MRP-mediated transport of GSH-HNE conjugate metabolites. The formation of ascorbate adducts of HNE was observed in the cell exposure experiments, but it represented a minor pathway contributing to the elimination of HNE and to the protective effects of ascorbate.","['Miranda, Cristobal L', 'Reed, Ralph L', 'Kuiper, Heather C', 'Alber, Susan', 'Stevens, Jan F']","['Miranda CL', 'Reed RL', 'Kuiper HC', 'Alber S', 'Stevens JF']","['Linus Pauling Institute and the Departments of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Statistics, Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon 97331, USA.']",,['eng'],"['S10 RR022589/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P30ES000210/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'S10RR022589/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL081721/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'S10 RR022589-01/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 ES000210-40/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL081721-03/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01HL081721/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 ES000210/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Chem Res Toxicol,Chemical research in toxicology,8807448,IM,"['Aldehydes/pharmacology/*toxicity', 'Apoptosis', 'Ascorbic Acid/*metabolism', 'Biological Transport', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Fluoresceins/metabolism', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inactivation, Metabolic', 'Leukemia', 'Protein Carbonylation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2009/03/31 09:00,2009/07/22 09:00,['2009/03/31 09:00'],"['2009/03/31 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/22 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/tx900042u [doi]'],ppublish,Chem Res Toxicol. 2009 May;22(5):863-74. doi: 10.1021/tx900042u.,"['0 (Aldehydes)', '0 (Fluoresceins)', ""111843-78-8 (5(6)-carboxy-2',7'-dichlorofluorescein)"", 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'K1CVM13F96 (4-hydroxy-2-nonenal)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)']",,,,PMC2730585,['NIHMS106305'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The current study provides a comprehensive assessment of survivors' educational achievements. METHODS: Seven hundred eighty-two childhood cancer survivors from the British Columbia (BC) Cancer Registry who attended BC schools from 1995 to 2004, were compared with a randomly selected comparison group of 8386 BC school children. Grade repetition, standard Foundation Skills Assessments (FSA), graduation-year examinations, and special education designations were compared, and factors that affected survivors' educational outcomes were identified. RESULTS: Survivors of central nervous system tumors had statistically significant FSA deficits in numeracy and reading (adjusted odds ratios from 0.2 to 0.5 in various grades); leukemia survivors also had lower FSA scores, although most differences were not statistically significant. Other survivors demonstrated no significant differences in FSA scores. Survivors were significantly more likely than controls to receive special education (32.5% vs 14.1%). Females and those who had received radiation treatment (particularly cranial radiation) were at increased risk for poor educational outcomes.

Receptor-based alignments provided by molecular docking calculations were submitted to a GRID-GOLPE protocol to generate 3D QSAR models. Analysis of the results showed that the models based on the inactive and Src-like inactive conformations had very poor statistical parameters, whereas the sole model based on the active conformation of Abl was characterized by significant internal and external predictive ability. Subsequent analysis of GOLPE PLS pseudo-coefficient contour plots of this model gave us a better understanding of the relationships between structure and affinity, providing suggestions for the next optimization process.

Owing to the long periods of observation and follow-up to assess patient survival outcome, it is difficult to use outcome-adaptive randomization in these trials. In practice, often information about a short-term response is quickly available during or shortly after treatment, and this short-term response is a good predictor for long-term survival. For example, complete remission of leukemia can be achieved and measured after a few cycles of treatment. It is a short-term response that is desirable for prolonging survival. We propose a new design for survival trials when such short-term response information is available. We use the short-term information to 'speed up' the adaptation of the randomization procedure. We establish a connection between the short-term response and the long-term survival through a Bayesian model, first by using prior clinical information, and then by dynamically updating the model according to information accumulated in the ongoing trial. Interim monitoring and final decision making are based upon inference on the primary outcome of survival. The new design uses fewer patients, and can more effectively assign patients to the better treatment arms. We demonstrate these properties through simulation studies.","['Huang, Xuelin', 'Ning, Jing', 'Li, Yisheng', 'Estey, Elihu', 'Issa, Jean-Pierre', 'Berry, Donald A']","['Huang X', 'Ning J', 'Li Y', 'Estey E', 'Issa JP', 'Berry DA']","['Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas, M.

As fundamental assumptions are reestablished, many people report changes and experiences that reflect posttraumatic growth (PTG). The present research describes the development of the Core Beliefs Inventory (CBI), a brief measure of disruption of the assumptive world developed for use in applied research and clinical settings.

Alterations in SUMO conjugation have been implicated in several human diseases, including cancer. Although the main cause of failure in cancer treatment is the development of drug resistance by cancer cells, the mechanisms of drug resistance are not fully understood. SUMO proteins are thought to play roles in various cellular pathways, but no studies have as yet compared the expression of the different SUMO proteins in chemosensitive and drug-resistant cancer cells. To determine the relationship between protein sumoylation and drug resistance, the expression of various SUMO isoforms has been studied and compared in the HL-60 cell line (a model for leukemic cells) and in HL-60RV cells (resistant to vincristine). Co-immunostaining of cells by anti-SUMO antibodies and antibodies against various nuclear subdomains has been examined by an advanced type of bioimaging analysis. Whereas SUMO-2/3 co-localizes exclusively with nuclear bodies containing promyelocytic leukemia protein in both cell types, SUMO-1 has also been seen in nucleolar regions of HL-60, but not in HL-60RV, cells. In HL-60 cells, SUMO-1 occurs adjacent to, but not co-localized with, the nucleolar marker fibrillarin. Western blot analysis has revealed higher levels of free SUMO and sumoylated products in drug-resistant cells and the presence of specific SUMO-1 conjugates in drug-sensitive HL-60 cells, possibly consistent with a specific nucleolar signal. Shortly after the induction of ethanol and oxidative stress, HL-60RV, but not HL-60, cells show increased accumulation of high-molecular-weight SUMO-2/3 conjugates. Thus, SUMO-1 probably has a specific role in the nucleoli of HL-60 cells, and the alteration of sumoylation might be a contributing factor in the development of drug resistance in leukemia cells.","['Vigodner, Margarita', 'Weisburg, Jeffrey H', 'Shrivastava, Vibha', 'Marmor, Rebecca A', 'Fathy, Jennifer', 'Skop, Nolan']","['Vigodner M', 'Weisburg JH', 'Shrivastava V', 'Marmor RA', 'Fathy J', 'Skop N']","['Stern College for Women, Department of Biology, Yeshiva University, New York, NY 10016, USA. vigodner@yu.edu']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090327,Germany,Cell Tissue Res,Cell and tissue research,0417625,IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Cell Nucleolus/metabolism', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Imaging, Three-Dimensional', 'Intranuclear Inclusion Bodies/metabolism', 'Protein Transport', 'Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins/*metabolism']",2009/03/28 09:00,2009/06/06 09:00,['2009/03/28 09:00'],"['2008/10/17 00:00 [received]', '2009/01/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/06 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00441-009-0775-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Tissue Res. 2009 May;336(2):277-86. doi: 10.1007/s00441-009-0775-0.

However, although benzene metabolites are known to induce oxidative stress and disrupt the cell cycle, the mechanism underlying lympho/leukemogenicity is not fully understood. Caspase-4 (alias caspase-11) and -12 are inflammatory caspases implicated in inflammation and endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis. The objectives of this study were to investigate the altered expression of caspase-4 and -12 in mouse bone marrow after benzene exposure and to determine whether their alterations are associated with benzene-induced bone marrow toxicity, especially cellular apoptosis. In addition, we evaluated whether the p53 gene is involved in regulating the mechanism, using both wild-type (WT) mice and mice lacking the p53 gene. For this study, 8-week-old C57BL/6 mice [WT and p53 knockout (KO)] were administered a benzene solution (150 mg/kg diluted in corn oil) via oral gavage once daily, 5 days/week, for 1 or 2 weeks. Blood and bone marrow cells were collected and cell counts were measured using a Coulter counter. Total mRNA and protein extracts were prepared from the harvested bone marrow cells. Then qRT-PCR and Western blotting were performed to detect changes in the caspases at the mRNA and protein level, respectively. A DNA fragmentation assay and Annexin-V staining were carried out on the bone marrow cells to detect apoptosis. Results indicated that when compared to the control, leukocyte number and bone marrow cellularity decreased significantly in WT mice. The expression of caspase-4 and -12 mRNA increased significantly after 12 days of benzene treatment in the bone marrow cells of benzene-exposed p53KO mice. However, apoptosis detection assays indicated no evidence of apoptosis in p53KO or WT mice. In addition, no changes of other apoptosis-related caspases, such as caspase-3 and -9, were found in WT or p53KO mice at the level of mRNA and proteins. These results indicated that upregulation of caspase-4 and -12 in mice lacking the p53 gene is not associated with cellular apoptosis. In conclusion, caspase-4 and -12 can be activated by benzene treatment without inducing cell apoptosis in mouse bone marrow, which are partly under the regulation of the p53 gene.","['Yi, Jung-Yeon', 'Hirabayashi, Yoko', 'Choi, Yang-Kyu', 'Kodama, Yukio', 'Kanno, Jun', 'Han, Jeong-Hee', 'Inoue, Tohru', 'Yoon, Byung-Il']","['Yi JY', 'Hirabayashi Y', 'Choi YK', 'Kodama Y', 'Kanno J', 'Han JH', 'Inoue T', 'Yoon BI']","['School of Veterinary Medicine, Kangwon National University, Gangwon, Republic of Korea.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090327,Germany,Arch Toxicol,Archives of toxicology,0417615,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/analysis/genetics', 'Benzene/*toxicity', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Caspase 12/*genetics', 'Caspases/*genetics', 'Caspases, Initiator', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', '*Genes, p53', 'Leukocytes/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Mice, Knockout']",2009/03/28 09:00,2009/08/07 09:00,['2009/03/28 09:00'],"['2008/11/11 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/07 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00204-009-0420-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Toxicol. 2009 Aug;83(8):795-803. doi: 10.1007/s00204-009-0420-4.

Because the mechanisms contributing to the pathogenesis of PCL are not fully understood, immunophenotyping, genetic evaluation (conventional karyotype, FISH, GEP and array-CGH), and immunohistochemistry are really important tools to investigate why plasma cells escape from bone marrow and become highly aggressive. Since treatment with standard agents and steroids is poorly effective, a combination of new drugs as part of the induction regimens and bone marrow transplant (autologous and allogeneic approaches) could nearly overcome the poor prognosis exhibited by PCL patients.","['Jimenez-Zepeda, Victor H', 'Dominguez-Martinez, Virginia J']","['Jimenez-Zepeda VH', 'Dominguez-Martinez VJ']","['Mayo Clinic Scottsdale, 13400 E Shea Blvd., MCCRB, Suite 300, Scottsdale, AZ, 85259, USA. jimenezzepeda.victor@mayo.edu.', 'INCMNSZ, Mexico, DF, Mexico.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20090327,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,"['Chromosome Aberrations', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/*complications/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Paraproteinemias/*complications/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Transport', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism']",2009/03/28 09:00,2009/06/27 09:00,['2009/03/28 09:00'],"['2008/10/07 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/01/27 00:00 [revised]', '2009/03/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/27 09:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12185-009-0288-3 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-009-0288-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2009 Apr;89(3):259-268. doi: 10.1007/s12185-009-0288-3.

PML and PML-NBs have been implicated in the regulation of growth inhibition, senescence and apoptosis. PML is activated in response to stress signals and is downregulated in certain human cancers. However, the factors mediating PML stability are incompletely understood. Here we demonstrate that a catalytically active form of the mammalian E3 ligase E6AP (HPV E6-associated protein) acts to reduce the half-life of the PML protein by promoting its degradation in the proteasome. E6AP mediates the ubiquitination of PML in an in vitro ubiquitination assay. E6AP and PML interact at physiological levels and colocalize in PML-NBs.

HSPGs are spatiotemporally expressed in embryonic and maternal tissues during implantation. The present study examined the role of agrin in the mouse embryo using leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-deficient mice, which show complete sterility. Agrin was detected widely in the cytoplasm of uterine luminal epithelial cells at the third day of pregnancy (Day 3) and Day 4. At Day 5, agrin moved to the apical surface of the luminal epithelium. This migration was not found in LIF-deficient mice. AChR was also found in the apical surface of the uterine epithelium at Day 4 and Day 5 in normal mice. LIF-deficient mice did not show this pattern of expression. Only nAChR b1 subunit mRNA was increased at Day 5 in normal mice. Furthermore, acetylcholinesterase was active in the uterine stroma of normal mice throughout the implantation period and was exclusively active in the uterine epithelium at Day 4. Taken together, agrin signaling was activated in the uterus during embryo implantation in the mice. Here, we suggest that the agrin pathway is involved in closure of the uterine epithelium toward placentation.","['Terakawa, Jumpei', 'Hondo, Eiichi', 'Sugiyama, Makoto', 'Wakitani, Shoichi', 'Stewart, Colin L', 'Kiso, Yasuo']","['Terakawa J', 'Hondo E', 'Sugiyama M', 'Wakitani S', 'Stewart CL', 'Kiso Y']","['Department of Veterinary Anatomy, Faculty of Agriculture, Yamaguchi University.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090326,Japan,J Reprod Dev,The Journal of reproduction and development,9438792,IM,"['Agrin/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Animals', 'Embryo Implantation/genetics/*physiology', 'Female', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Placentation/genetics/physiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Receptors, Cholinergic/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/physiology', 'Uterus/metabolism']",2009/03/28 09:00,2009/08/13 09:00,['2009/03/28 09:00'],"['2009/03/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/13 09:00 [medline]']","['JST.JSTAGE/jrd/20162 [pii]', '10.1262/jrd.20162 [doi]']",ppublish,J Reprod Dev. 2009 Jun;55(3):293-8. doi: 10.1262/jrd.20162.

This strategy, termed repertoire analysis, was compared with the conventional strategy of identifying markers using family-specific V, D, and J primers for a variety of antigen receptor genes. Repertoire analysis detected significantly more markers for the major leukemic clone than did the conventional strategy, and one or more IgH rearrangements that were suitable for monitoring the major clone were detected in 96% of children and 94% of adults. Repertoire analysis also detected significantly more IGH markers for minor clones. Some minor clones were quite large and a proportion of them would not be able to be detected by a minimal residual disease test directed to the marker for the major clone. IGH repertoire analysis at diagnosis has potential advantages for the identification of molecular markers for the quantification of minimal residual disease in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases. An IGH marker enables very sensitive quantification of the major leukemic clone, and the detection of minor clones may enable early identification of additional patients who are prone to relapse.","['Brisco, Michael J', 'Latham, Sue', 'Sutton, Rosemary', 'Hughes, Elizabeth', 'Wilczek, Vicki', 'van Zanten, Katrina', 'Budgen, Bradley', 'Bahar, Anita Y', 'Malec, Maria', 'Sykes, Pamela J', 'Kuss, Bryone J', 'Waters, Keith', 'Venn, Nicola C', 'Giles, Jodie E', 'Haber, Michelle', 'Norris, Murray D', 'Marshall, Glenn M', 'Morley, Alexander A']","['Brisco MJ', 'Latham S', 'Sutton R', 'Hughes E', 'Wilczek V', 'van Zanten K', 'Budgen B', 'Bahar AY', 'Malec M', 'Sykes PJ', 'Kuss BJ', 'Waters K', 'Venn NC', 'Giles JE', 'Haber M', 'Norris MD', 'Marshall GM', 'Morley AA']","['Department of Hematology and Genetic Pathology, Flinders University and Medical Centre, Adelaide, Australia.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090326,United States,J Mol Diagn,The Journal of molecular diagnostics : JMD,100893612,IM,"['Adult', '*Cell Lineage', 'Child', 'Cooperative Behavior', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genome, Human/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual/genetics', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics']",2009/03/28 09:00,2009/06/18 09:00,['2009/03/28 09:00'],"['2009/03/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/18 09:00 [medline]']","['S1525-1578(10)60228-0 [pii]', '10.2353/jmoldx.2009.080047 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Diagn. 2009 May;11(3):194-200. doi: 10.2353/jmoldx.2009.080047.

For a single sample containing 10 microg of good quality DNA, MRD was quantifiable down to approximately 10(-6), which is at least 1 log more sensitive than current methods. Nonspecific amplification was rarely observed. The standard deviation of laboratory estimations was 0.32 log units at moderate or high levels of MRD, but increased markedly as the level of MRD and the number of intact marker gene rearrangements in the sample fell. In 23 children with ALL studied after induction therapy, the mean MRD level was 1.6 x 10(-5) and levels ranged from 1.5 x 10(-2) to less than 10(-7). Comparisons with the conventional one-round quantitative polymerase chain reaction method on 29 samples from another 24 children who received treatment resulted in concordant results for 22 samples and discordant results for seven samples. The sensitivity and specificity of the method are due to the use of nested polymerase chain reaction, one segment-specific and two allele-specific oligonucleotide primers, and the use of a large amount of good quality DNA. This method may improve MRD-based decisions on treatment for ALL patients, and the principles should be applicable to DNA-based MRD measurements in other disorders.","['Morley, Alexander A', 'Latham, Sue', 'Brisco, Michael J', 'Sykes, Pamela J', 'Sutton, Rosemary', 'Hughes, Elizabeth', 'Wilczek, Vicki', 'Budgen, Bradley', 'van Zanten, Katrina', 'Kuss, Bryone J', 'Venn, Nicola C', 'Norris, Murray D', 'Crock, Catherine', 'Storey, Colin', 'Revesz, Tamas', 'Waters, Keith']","['Morley AA', 'Latham S', 'Brisco MJ', 'Sykes PJ', 'Sutton R', 'Hughes E', 'Wilczek V', 'Budgen B', 'van Zanten K', 'Kuss BJ', 'Venn NC', 'Norris MD', 'Crock C', 'Storey C', 'Revesz T', 'Waters K']","['Department of Haematology and Genetic Pathology, Flinders University and Medical Centre, Adelaide, Australia. alec.morley@flinders.edu.au']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090326,United States,J Mol Diagn,The Journal of molecular diagnostics : JMD,100893612,IM,"['Child', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Fluorescence', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/*pathology/therapy', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2009/03/28 09:00,2009/06/18 09:00,['2009/03/28 09:00'],"['2009/03/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/18 09:00 [medline]']","['S1525-1578(10)60229-2 [pii]', '10.2353/jmoldx.2009.080048 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Diagn. 2009 May;11(3):201-10. doi: 10.2353/jmoldx.2009.080048.

This has been demonstrated by knocking down C3G and p38alpha using the interfering RNA approach, as well as through targeting p38 by its inhibitor SB203580. The results indicate that p38 is a mediator of the STI-571-induced apoptosis, while C3G plays a negative role on STI-571-mediated p38 activation through a Rap1-dependent mechanism. According to this, gene expression analysis in C3G silenced cells revealed an upregulation of a large number of genes involved in apoptosis. Some of these genes are also down-regulated (at the protein level) upon p38alpha knock-down, which further suggests a functional association between these two proteins. On the other hand, C3G knock-down reverts the STI-571-inhibitory effect on ERKs and Akt pathways in a Rap1-independent fashion. Moreover, C3G overexpression also increased both, basal and STI-571-induced apoptosis, in agreement with previous reports. Therefore, our results strongly suggest a dual regulatory role for C3G in CML cells, modulating both apoptosis and survival via Rap-dependent and independent mechanisms.","['Maia, Vera', 'Sanz, Maria', 'Gutierrez-Berzal, Javier', 'de Luis, Alberto', 'Gutierrez-Uzquiza, Alvaro', 'Porras, Almudena', 'Guerrero, Carmen']","['Maia V', 'Sanz M', 'Gutierrez-Berzal J', 'de Luis A', 'Gutierrez-Uzquiza A', 'Porras A', 'Guerrero C']","['Centro de Investigacion del Cancer, IBMCC, Universidad de Salamanca-CSIC, Salamanca, Spain.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090324,England,Cell Signal,Cellular signalling,8904683,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Gene Silencing/*drug effects', 'Guanine Nucleotide-Releasing Factor 2/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Immunoblotting', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*enzymology/genetics/*pathology', 'Models, Biological', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'rap1 GTP-Binding Proteins/metabolism']",2009/03/28 09:00,2009/06/06 09:00,['2009/03/28 09:00'],"['2009/01/21 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/12 00:00 [revised]', '2009/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/06 09:00 [medline]']","['S0898-6568(09)00131-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cellsig.2009.03.015 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Signal. 2009 Jul;21(7):1229-35. doi: 10.1016/j.cellsig.2009.03.015.

Notch signaling initiates the diversification of immature V2-interneurons into excitatory V2a-interneurons and inhibitory V2b-interneurons. Here, we provide a transcriptional regulatory mechanism underlying their balanced production. LIM-only protein LMO4 controls this binary cell fate choice by regulating the activity of V2a- and V2b-specific LIM complexes inversely. In the spinal cord, LMO4 induces GABAergic V2b-interneurons in collaboration with SCL and inhibits Lhx3 from generating glutamatergic V2a-interneuons. In LMO4;SCL compound mutant embryos, V2a-interneurons increase markedly at the expense of V2b-interneurons. We further demonstrate that LMO4 nucleates the assembly of a novel LIM-complex containing SCL, Gata2, and NLI. This complex activates specific enhancers in V2b-genes consisting of binding sites for SCL and Gata2, thereby promoting V2b-interneuron fate. Thus, LMO4 plays essential roles in directing a balanced generation of inhibitory and excitatory neurons in the ventral spinal cord.","['Joshi, Kaumudi', 'Lee, Seunghee', 'Lee, Bora', 'Lee, Jae W', 'Lee, Soo-Kyung']","['Joshi K', 'Lee S', 'Lee B', 'Lee JW', 'Lee SK']","['Department of Molecular Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",,['eng'],"['R01 NS054941-03/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS054941-02/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 HD024064/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS054941-01/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 HD24064/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS054941/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Neuron,Neuron,8809320,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules, Neuronal', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chickens', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation/methods', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'GATA3 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/genetics/*physiology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interneurons/*physiology', 'LIM Domain Proteins', 'Mice', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Models, Biological', 'Multiprotein Complexes/genetics/metabolism', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecules/genetics/metabolism', 'Neural Inhibition/*physiology', 'Protein Binding/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Spinal Cord/cytology', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Transfection/methods', 'Vesicular Glutamate Transport Protein 2/genetics', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid/metabolism']",2009/03/28 09:00,2009/04/25 09:00,['2009/03/28 09:00'],"['2008/09/02 00:00 [received]', '2008/12/29 00:00 [revised]', '2009/02/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/25 09:00 [medline]']","['S0896-6273(09)00123-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.neuron.2009.02.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Neuron. 2009 Mar 26;61(6):839-51. doi: 10.1016/j.neuron.2009.02.011.,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules, Neuronal)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GATA3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Gata3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (Lmo4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Neural Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Slc17a6 protein, mouse)', '0 (Ssbp3 protein, mouse)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Vesicular Glutamate Transport Protein 2)', '0 (Vsx2 protein, mouse)', '0 (neuroligin 1)', '56-12-2 (gamma-Aminobutyric Acid)']",,,,PMC2848494,['NIHMS102848'],,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been demonstrated that Dectin-1 as the principal C-type lectin pattern-recognition receptor (PRR) can recognize fungal beta-glucan and induce immune responses. In this study, we sought to clarify whether insoluble beta-glucan from the cell wall of C. albicans (CaIG) could induce immune responses in human THP-1 monocytes (a human acute monocytic leukemia cell line) and to determine the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: Human THP-1 monocytes were challenged with CaIG in vitro. The mRNA expression of Dectin-1, Toll-like receptors (TLR2), proinflammatory cytokine (TNF-alpha) and chemokine (IL-8) was assayed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The secretion of TNF-a and IL-8 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). H(2)O(2) release was determined by microplate fluorescent assay. Western blotting was used to analyze IkappaB-a phosphorylation and degradation. RESULTS: Exposure of THP-1 monocytes to CaIG led to increased gene expression and secretion of TNF-alpha and IL-8. CaIG induced H(2)O(2) release in a time-dependent manner. CaIG hydrolyzed with zymolyase failed to induce gene expression and secretion of TNF-alpha, IL-8 and H(2)O(2) release. CaIG up-regulated the mRNA of Dectin-1, whereas the mRNA level of TLR2 was not altered. THP-1 monocytes challenged with CaIG resulted in the activation of NF-kappaB in a time-dependent manner. Dectin-1 inhibitor laminarin blocked the CaIG-induced production of TNF-alpha and H(2)O(2) in THP-1 monocytes, but no such effect was observed in pretreatment with anti-TLR2 neutralizing antibody and the LPS inhibitor (polymyxin B). CONCLUSION: CaIG may play a role in activation of immune responses in human THP-1 cells through Dectin-1, not TLR2.","['Li, Min', 'Liu, Ze-hu', 'Chen, Qing', 'Zhou, Wu-qing', 'Yu, Mei-wen', 'Lu, Gui-xia', 'Lu, Xue-lian', 'Shen, Yong-nian', 'Liu, Wei-da', 'Wu, Shao-xi']","['Li M', 'Liu ZH', 'Chen Q', 'Zhou WQ', 'Yu MW', 'Lu GX', 'Lu XL', 'Shen YN', 'Liu WD', 'Wu SX']","['Department of Medical Mycology, Institute of Dermatology, Chinese Academy of Medical Science & Peking Union Medical College, Nanjing, China. minli08@gmail.com']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Candida albicans/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Wall/*metabolism', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/metabolism', 'Interleukin-8/genetics/metabolism', 'Lectins, C-Type', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Monocytes/*drug effects/*immunology/metabolism', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Toll-Like Receptor 2/genetics', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics/metabolism', 'beta-Glucans/*pharmacology']",2009/03/28 09:00,2009/05/23 09:00,['2009/03/28 09:00'],"['2009/03/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/23 09:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2009 Mar 5;122(5):496-501.,"['0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 2)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (beta-Glucans)', '0 (dectin 1)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)']",,,,,,['Chin Med J (Engl). 2009 Mar 5;122(5):483-5.

A semipure extract, previously obtained from Dysidea (Lamellodysidea) herbacea and preserved in our repository, along with an untouched Dysidea granulosa marine sponge afforded 13 distinct oxy-polyhalogenated diphenyl ethers. Among these isolates were four new compounds, 5, 6, 10, and 12. The structure elucidation of these molecules was complicated by the plethora of structural variants that exist in the literature. During dereplication, we established a systematic method for analyzing this class of compounds.

Neutropenia is the most common dose limiting side effects of cytotoxic chemotherapy. We decided to study the effect of same in our patients coming to haematology clinic. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To see the effect of G-CSF on severity of neutropenia following chemotherapy in patients of haematological malignancies and to see the effect of G-CSF on duration of hospitalization, documented infections and duration of fever as compared to control group in patients with neutropenia following chemotherapy in haematological malignancies. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty patients of acute leukemia were prospectively studied. Patients were given G-CSF 24.hours following chemotherapy induced neutropenia and following parameters were observed. (a) median time to ANC recovery (b) incidence and duration of fever (c) duration of hospitalization following chemotherapy (d) incidence of documented infections. The patients were given G-CSF until the neutrophil count was >1000/ml for 3 days or maximum of 7 days. RESULTS: Mean age was 29.33 +/- 14 years in G-CSF group and 27.53 +/- 13.75 in control group. Mean duration of neutropenia was 11.4 days (p < 0.05) in G-CSF group and 15.8 days in control group. Mean duration of fever was 8.2 days in G-CSF group and 13.53 days in control group (p < 0.05). Mean duration of hospital stay was 21.33 days in G-CSF group and 25 days in control group (p > 0.05).

Several models to predict outcome were proposed, including the use of a comorbidity index. However, it is unclear whether the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) or the hematopoietic cell transplant comorbidity index (HCTCI) is more sensitive. METHODS: The authors analyzed their experience with 92 patients aged >or=80 years who had AML. Patients' pretreatment characteristics and their treatment outcomes were recorded. RESULTS: All patients were offered intensive treatment; 59 patients (64%) were treated intensively with a variety of regimens, whereas 33 patients (36%) elected to receive supportive care. The CCI and the HCTCI had similar predictive ability for outcome in both groups. A multivariate analyses of prognostic factors identified near-normal albumin (48% of patients; 1-year survival rate, >27%) as a favorable factor for the whole cohort, age <83 years (47% of patients; 1-year survival rate, >25%) and nonmonocytic morphology (75% of patients; 1-year survival rate, >26%) as favorable factors for the intensively treated cohort, and bone marrow blasts <46% (50% of patients; 1-year survival rate, >19%) as a favorable factor for patients who received supportive care. CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective analysis was developed to assist in treatment decisions for octogenarian and nonagenarian patients with AML.

These compounds demonstrated an increase in growth inhibitory activity relative to the parent compound, geiparvarin. The activity increased even further in the series of demethylated compounds, with the introduction of a methyl group at the 1'-position of the alkenyloxy chain. In contrast, a remarkable decrease in activity was observed with the introduction of a methyl group at the 2'-position. Interestingly, the new derivatives fully inhibited the growth of drug-resistant cell lines, suggesting that they are not subject to pump-mediated drug efflux. On the basis of their cytotoxic profiles, the most active compounds (R)-4 and (R)-5 were selected for further biological evaluation in comparison with the lead compound.

We diagnosed and characterized 137 consecutive cases of precursor B lymphoblastic leukemia (precursor B-cell ALL) presented to our laboratory in Shanghai using the WHO 2001 classification system. Patient clinical, phenotypic and cytogenetic characteristics were correlated with outcome. In contrast to Western studies, females (71) outnumbered males (66) partly due to an increased prevalence of the CD10- pro B-cell phenotype. Females with a CD10- pro B-cell phenotype exhibited significantly better overall survival than males. The most common cytogenetic abnormality was the Philadelphia chromosome (PH/BCR/ABL) which was found in approximately 37% of the cases. Cases of precursor B cell ALL lacking the PH/BCR/ABL genotype exhibited a pronounced age-dependent, gender prevalence with a modal age in the sixth decade for females compared to the second decade for males. These findings suggest significant geographic heterogeneity in precursor B-cell ALL which may be of both etiological and therapeutic significance.","['Bao, Liming', 'Gross, Sherilyn A', 'Ryder, John', 'Wang, Xiaoqin', 'Ji, Meirong', 'Chen, Yan', 'Yang, Yongchen', 'Zhu, Saijuan', 'Irons, Richard D']","['Bao L', 'Gross SA', 'Ryder J', 'Wang X', 'Ji M', 'Chen Y', 'Yang Y', 'Zhu S', 'Irons RD']","['Fudan-Cinpathogen Clinical and Molecular Research Center, Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', ""Division of Human Genetics, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA."", 'Cinpathogen, Inc., Boulder, CO, USA.', 'Fudan-Cinpathogen Clinical and Molecular Research Center, Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Molecular Toxicology and Environmental Health Sciences Program, School of Pharmacy, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO, USA.', 'Fudan-Cinpathogen Clinical and Molecular Research Center, Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Fudan-Cinpathogen Clinical and Molecular Research Center, Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Fudan-Cinpathogen Clinical and Molecular Research Center, Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Fudan-Cinpathogen Clinical and Molecular Research Center, Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Fudan-Cinpathogen Clinical and Molecular Research Center, Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, China. richard.irons@cinpathogen.com.', 'Cinpathogen, Inc., Boulder, CO, USA. richard.irons@cinpathogen.com.', 'Molecular Toxicology and Environmental Health Sciences Program, School of Pharmacy, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO, USA. richard.irons@cinpathogen.com.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO, USA. richard.irons@cinpathogen.com.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090326,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'China', '*Chromosome Aberrations/statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology/therapy', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/03/27 09:00,2009/06/23 09:00,['2009/03/27 09:00'],"['2008/10/29 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/02/23 00:00 [revised]', '2009/03/27 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/23 09:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12185-009-0283-8 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-009-0283-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2009 May;89(4):431-437. doi: 10.1007/s12185-009-0283-8.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Individual semistructured interviews were conducted with 22 children who had experienced WHO grade > or = 2 OM during chemotherapy within the previous 6 months. Parents from each family were also interviewed in the same way. Interviews were audio recorded and fully transcribed verbatim. Data were analyzed using inductive content analysis. RESULTS: The mean ages of the children and parents were 12 and 41 years, respectively. Regarding gender, 55% of the children were boys, and 95% of the parents were mothers or grandmother. Forty-one percent of the children were diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and 36% were treated with methotrexate. The findings illustrated that the experience of OM impacted on the lives of the children and their parents. Five themes, which subsumed a number of categories, were constructed: ""Symptoms experienced,"" ""Negative emotional outcomes,"" ""The dilemma of eating (or not eating),"" ""Challenges in oral care,"" ""Health care needs."" Mouth and throat pain were found to cause a number of severe consequences in daily life. Many children experienced turmoil characterized by a panoply of emotions. All parents described psychological distress on various levels which they attributed to the burden of care and the suffering of their children. OM can present a difficult dilemma to patients: on the one hand, children found it too painful to chew and swallow food, while on the other hand they felt very hungry. Children were aware of the significance of oral care. Discomfort associated with oral care forced some children to neglect oral care. Parents also described oral care as a stressful event for their children and for them. Children needed more activities coordinated by the ward to distract them from their OM, as well as psychological support from the health care professionals. Parents indicated the need for more information about the process of OM and food selection. CONCLUSION: Findings from this study illustrate the complex biopsychosocial impact of chemotherapy-induced OM on children and their parents. Optimal OM pain management guidelines and holistic supportive care strategies should be developed in conjunction with OM strategies in the future.","['Cheng, Karis Kin-fong']",['Cheng KK'],"['The Nethersole School of Nursing, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Room732, Esther Lee Building, Shatin, NT, Hong Kong. kariskwong@cuhk.edu.hk']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090326,Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Data Collection', 'Eating', 'Female', '*Health Services Needs and Demand', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Oral Hygiene', 'Parents/psychology', 'Patient Education as Topic', 'Stomatitis/chemically induced/*physiopathology/psychology', 'Young Adult']",2009/03/27 09:00,2009/09/11 06:00,['2009/03/27 09:00'],"['2008/06/16 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/27 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00520-009-0618-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2009 Jul;17(7):829-37. doi: 10.1007/s00520-009-0618-2.

One approach to improve the biodistribution is to administer a preload of unlabelled antibodies. The aim of this study was to develop a model, which describes distribution of labelled and unlabelled antibodies based on the tissue blood flow and the competing binding behaviour of the antibodies. Such a model can be used to improve biodistribution in the particular case of RIT using anti-CD45 antibodies. METHODS: A compartmental model for the interconnected organs was developed. Reaction constants and organ specific flow, antigen concentrations and distribution volumes were taken from the literature. The organ residence times were calculated for different amounts of given labelled and unlabelled antibodies and the time delay between their administrations. RESULTS: The model is capable to describe the preloading effect. The biodistribution of labelled or unlabelled antibodies depends essentially on the specific blood flow to the organ and its antigen expression. The dose ratio of bone marrow to liver is maximized by applying sufficient unlabelled monoclonal antibody (mAb) to saturate antibody binding in the competing organs and by applying the labelled mAb with a delay of more than one hour. CONCLUSIONS: The developed model qualitatively describes how a preload can considerably increase selectivity of RIT due to different blood flows and antigen distribution in relevant organs. In addition, simulations can identify the optimal delay between the application of labelled and unlabelled antibody. For future analyses, i.e., to fit patient data, degradation and excretion should be incorporated into the model.","['Kiraly, Franz', 'Kletting, Peter', 'Reske, Sven', 'Glatting, Gerhard']","['Kiraly F', 'Kletting P', 'Reske S', 'Glatting G']","['Klinik fur Nuklearmedizin, Universitat Ulm, 89070 Ulm, Germany.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090323,Germany,Nuklearmedizin,Nuklearmedizin.

Using BCR-ABL-expressing myelogenous and lymphoid cell lines and mouse models of CML and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) induced by wild-type BCR-ABL or T315I mutant-BCR-ABL, we evaluated the inhibitory effects of omacetaxine on CML and B-ALL. We showed that more than 90% of the leukemic stem cells were killed after treatment with omacetaxine in vitro. In contrast, less than 9 or 25% of the leukemic stem cells were killed after treating with imatinib or dasatinib, respectively. After 4 days of treatment of CML mice with omacetaxine, Gr-1(+)myeloid leukemia cells decreased in the peripheral blood of the treated CML mice. In the omacetaxine-treated B-ALL mice, only 0.8% of the B220(+)leukemia cells were found in peripheral blood, compared with 34% of the B220(+)leukemia cells in the placebo group.

In some cases, these deletions highlight chromosomal loci containing tumor suppressor genes that undergo homozygous inactivation. In other cases, hemizygous deletions cause disease by allelic insufficiency for one or more genes. As the intact allele has no identifiable lesions, functional approaches are critical for the identification of pathogenic genes within large deletions. Hemizygous, interstitial deletion of chromosome 5q is the most common cytogenetic abnormality in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and has been the focus of functional analysis. Some patients with this molecular lesion have the 5q- syndrome, a disorder with a highly consistent clinical phenotype. A systematic RNA interference screen to interrogate the function of each gene in the common deleted region (CDR) for the 5q- syndrome identified RPS14 as a critical haploinsufficiency disease gene for the erythroid failure, which is a characteristic of this syndrome. Genes located in an adjacent deleted region have also been implicated in MDS. The full clinical phenotype is likely caused by the integration of effects from allelic insufficiency for multiple genes. With the identification and characterization of these genes, the 5q deletion is becoming a model for understanding hemizygous chromosomal deletions in cancer.","['Ebert, B L']",['Ebert BL'],"[""Division of Hematology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA. bebert@partners.org""]",,['eng'],"['R01 HL082945/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08-HL078818/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', '5R01-HL82945/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20090326,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['*Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'RNA Interference']",2009/03/27 09:00,2009/08/06 09:00,['2009/03/27 09:00'],"['2009/03/27 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/06 09:00 [medline]']","['leu200953 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.53 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Jul;23(7):1252-6. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.53.

We utilized a murine model of APL in which the PML-RARalpha oncogene is expressed from the endogenous cathepsin G promoter to test the hypothesis that leukemia stem cell (LSC) activity resides within the differentiated promyelocyte compartment. We prospectively purified promyelocytes from transgenic mice at various stages of disease and observed that PML-RARalpha-expressing promyelocytes from young preleukemic mice had acquired properties of self-renewal both in vitro and in vivo. Progression to acute leukemia was associated with an expansion of the promyelocyte compartment at the expense of other stem, progenitor and terminally differentiated populations. Leukemic promyelocytes exhibited properties of self-renewal, and were capable of engendering leukemia in secondary recipient mice. These data indicate that PML-RARalpha alone can confer properties of self-renewal to committed hematopoietic progenitors before the onset of disease. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that cancer stem cells may arise from committed progenitors that lack stem cell properties, provided that the initiating mutation in cancer progression activates programs that confer properties of self-renewal.","['Wojiski, S', 'Guibal, F C', 'Kindler, T', 'Lee, B H', 'Jesneck, J L', 'Fabian, A', 'Tenen, D G', 'Gilliland, D G']","['Wojiski S', 'Guibal FC', 'Kindler T', 'Lee BH', 'Jesneck JL', 'Fabian A', 'Tenen DG', 'Gilliland DG']","[""Division of Hematology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""]",,['eng'],"['CA66996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK50654/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA066996-130011/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 DK050654/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HHMI/Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States', 'P01 DK050654-060004/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA066996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA066996-120009/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090326,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cathepsin G', 'Cathepsins/genetics', 'Cell Division', 'Granulocyte Precursor Cells/*pathology', 'Granulocytes/pathology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*physiology', 'Preleukemia/genetics/*pathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Radiation Chimera', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Serine Endopeptidases/genetics', 'Transgenes', 'Tretinoin/therapeutic use']",2009/03/27 09:00,2009/09/22 06:00,['2009/03/27 09:00'],"['2009/03/27 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/22 06:00 [medline]']","['leu200963 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.63 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Aug;23(8):1462-71. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.63.

The mechanisms that determine the pace of BM recovery are not fully understood. During the recovery phase after chemotherapy or irradiation, the signals for retention of white blood cells within the BM increase significantly. This leads to a delay in the release of WBC, which can be overcome by targeting the CXCR4 axis with the antagonist 4F-benzoyl-TN14003 (T140). The delay in the release of WBC is also accompanied by suppression in the production of progenitor cells and mature cells by the BM stroma. Administration of T140 to mice transplanted with BM cells stimulates the production of all types of progenitors and mature cells, and increases the exit of mature cells to the periphery. Moreover, addition of T140, but not AMD3100, to BM stromal cultures stimulates the production of mature cells and progenitors from all lineages. The unique ability of the CXCR4 antagonist, T140 to stimulate the production and exit of WBC cells may be used as a novel therapeutic approach to overcome cytopenia associated with treatments for cancer and BM transplantation.","['Abraham, M', 'Beider, K', 'Wald, H', 'Weiss, I D', 'Zipori, D', 'Galun, E', 'Nagler, A', 'Eizenberg, O', 'Peled, A']","['Abraham M', 'Beider K', 'Wald H', 'Weiss ID', 'Zipori D', 'Galun E', 'Nagler A', 'Eizenberg O', 'Peled A']","['Goldyne Savad Institute of Gene Therapy, Hadassah Hebrew University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel.']",,['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090326,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Benzylamines', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects/radiation effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Cyclams', 'Cyclophosphamide/pharmacology', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Female', 'Graft Survival/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization/methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Heterocyclic Compounds/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Integrin alpha4beta1/biosynthesis', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neutropenia/drug therapy/etiology', 'Peptides/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Radiation Chimera', 'Receptors, CXCR4/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/physiology', 'Recovery of Function/drug effects', 'Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms', 'Stromal Cells/physiology']",2009/03/27 09:00,2009/09/22 06:00,['2009/03/27 09:00'],"['2009/03/27 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/22 06:00 [medline]']","['leu200956 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.56 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Aug;23(8):1378-88. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.56.

Although hyperexpression of Wilms' tumor (WT1) gene transcript has been frequently proposed as an MRD marker in AML, wide comparability of the various methods used for evaluating WT1 expression has not been given. We established and standardized a multicenter approach for quantifying WT1 expression by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR), on the basis of a primer/probe set combination at exons 6 and 7. In a series of quality-control rounds, we analyzed 69 childhood AML samples and 47 normal bone marrow (BM) samples from 4 participating centers. Differences in the individual WT1 expressions levels ranged within <0.5 log of the mean in 82% of the cases. In AML samples, the median WT1/1E+04 Abelson (ABL) expression was 3.5E+03 compared with that of 2.3E+01 in healthy BM samples. As 11.5% of childhood AML samples in this cohort harbored WT1 mutations in exon 7, the effect of mutations on WT1 expression has been investigated, showing that mutated cases expressed significantly higher WT1 levels than wild-type cases. Hence, our approach showed high reproducibility and applicability, even in patients with WT1 mutations; therefore, it can be widely used for the quantitation of WT1 expression in future clinical trials.","['Willasch, A M', 'Gruhn, B', 'Coliva, T', 'Kalinova, M', 'Schneider, G', 'Kreyenberg, H', 'Steinbach, D', 'Weber, G', 'Hollink, I H I M', 'Zwaan, C M', 'Biondi, A', 'van der Velden, V H J', 'Reinhardt, D', 'Cazzaniga, G', 'Bader, P', 'Trka, J']","['Willasch AM', 'Gruhn B', 'Coliva T', 'Kalinova M', 'Schneider G', 'Kreyenberg H', 'Steinbach D', 'Weber G', 'Hollink IH', 'Zwaan CM', 'Biondi A', 'van der Velden VH', 'Reinhardt D', 'Cazzaniga G', 'Bader P', 'Trka J']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Hemostaseology, Goethe University Frankfurt, Hospital for Children and Adolescents III, Frankfurt am Main, Germany. andre.willasch@kgu.de']",['European Study Group on WT1 Expression in Childhood AML'],['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090326,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Examination/methods/*standards', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'DNA Primers', 'Exons/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Genes, Wilms Tumor', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*analysis/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods/*standards', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'WT1 Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Young Adult']",2009/03/27 09:00,2009/09/22 06:00,['2009/03/27 09:00'],"['2009/03/27 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/22 06:00 [medline]']","['leu200951 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.51 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Aug;23(8):1472-9. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.51.

We compared these staging systems for predicting outcomes after upfront autologous stem cell transplantation by analyzing the outcomes of 729 patients between 1995 and 2002. With a median follow-up of 56 months, the univariate probabilities (95% CI) of non-relapse mortality (NRM), relapse, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) at 5 years were 7, 68, 25 and 52%, respectively.

Staging systems were formally compared using Cox models fit with DSS and ISS stages. The relative risks of PFS and OS were significantly different for stages I vs II and II vs III for DSS, but only for stages II vs III for ISS. Although both systems were predictive of PFS and OS, the DSS was superior in formal statistical comparison using Brier score. However, neither system was strongly predictive of outcomes, indicating the need for newer schemes incorporating other prognostic markers.","['Hari, P N', 'Zhang, M-J', 'Roy, V', 'Perez, W S', 'Bashey, A', 'To, L B', 'Elfenbein, G', 'Freytes, C O', 'Gale, R P', 'Gibson, J', 'Kyle, R A', 'Lazarus, H M', 'McCarthy, P L', 'Milone, G A', 'Pavlovsky, S', 'Reece, D E', 'Schiller, G', 'Vela-Ojeda, J', 'Weisdorf, D', 'Vesole, D']","['Hari PN', 'Zhang MJ', 'Roy V', 'Perez WS', 'Bashey A', 'To LB', 'Elfenbein G', 'Freytes CO', 'Gale RP', 'Gibson J', 'Kyle RA', 'Lazarus HM', 'McCarthy PL', 'Milone GA', 'Pavlovsky S', 'Reece DE', 'Schiller G', 'Vela-Ojeda J', 'Weisdorf D', 'Vesole D']","['Department of Medicine, Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI 53226, USA. phari@mcw.edu']",,['eng'],"['U24 CA076518/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA076518-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20090326,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/mortality/*pathology/surgery', 'Neoplasm Staging/*methods', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/03/27 09:00,2009/09/22 06:00,['2009/03/27 09:00'],"['2009/03/27 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/22 06:00 [medline]']","['leu200961 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.61 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Aug;23(8):1528-34. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.61.

In this study, c-Jun and p65 were shown to mediate the transcriptional activation of the SHP promoter. In addition, SHP induced the cell cycle regulatory protein levels and cooperatively increased an induction of p21WAF1 expression with p65. Furthermore, SHP protected differentiated cells from etoposide-induced cellular apoptosis through the induction and cytoplasmic sequestration of p21WAF1. Complex formation between SHP and p21WAF1 was demonstrated by means of coimmunoprecipitation.

However, a mechanism to explain its antitumor activity in bladder cancers is unclear. Here, we investigated the role of protein kinase C (PKC) in ATO-induced apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation in bladder cancer cells. METHODS: T24 human bladder carcinoma cells were incubated with different concentrations of ATO in the presence or absence of PMA (PKC activator) or H7 (PKC inhibitor). Cell proliferation was assessed by MTT assay, and apoptosis by TUNEL and electron microscopy. Flow cytometry was used to analyze cell cycle distribution, radioimmunoassay to measure PKC activity, and Western blot analysis to detect caspase-3. RESULTS: ATO inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis of T24 cells in a dose-dependent manner, caused an increase of percentage of cells in the G(1) phase and a decrease in the S and G(2) phases, and upregulated the expression of activated caspase-3 and reduced PKC activity. These effects were abrogated by PMA, but enhanced by H7. CONCLUSIONS: PKC is involved in the anticancer activity of ATO for T24 bladder cancer cells, suggesting that targeting the PKC pathway may represent a potential approach to enhance the efficacy of ATO to treat bladder cancers.","['Wang, Yan', 'An, Ruihua', 'Dong, Xuesong', 'Pan, Shangha', 'Duan, Guowen', 'Sun, Xueying']","['Wang Y', 'An R', 'Dong X', 'Pan S', 'Duan G', 'Sun X']","['Department of Urologic Surgery, First Clinical Medical School of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090319,Switzerland,Urol Int,Urologia internationalis,0417373,IM,"['1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activators/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/*enzymology/*pathology']",2009/03/27 09:00,2009/05/01 09:00,['2009/03/27 09:00'],"['2007/08/14 00:00 [received]', '2008/01/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/27 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/01 09:00 [medline]']","['000200803 [pii]', '10.1159/000200803 [doi]']",ppublish,Urol Int. 2009;82(2):214-21. doi: 10.1159/000200803.

METHODS: Human Hela cells transiently expressing the cellular receptor for avian leukemia and sarcoma viruses (tva) were infected with the avian vector. Molecular analyses of thirteen clones were performed. RESULTS: Data showed that more than 77% of proviruses had lost the 5' part of their genome including the selectable gene. At least 61% of these proviruses were flanked on the left by the additional att sequence and on the right by the LTR. None of the thirteen proviruses was able to express a full-length genomic RNA.

We demonstrate that Oct-4 has a role in supporting hematopoiesis after specifying brachyury-positive mesoderm. When we suppressed Oct-4 expression before or after mesoderm specification, no hematopoietic cells are detected. However, hematopoiesis can be rescued in the absence of Oct-4 after mesoderm specification if the essential hematopoietic transcription factor stem cell leukemia is expressed. Our results suggest that, for hematopoiesis to occur, Oct-4 is required for the initial specification of mesoderm and subsequently is required for the development of hematopoietic cells from uncommitted mesoderm.","['Kong, Kimi Y', 'Williamson, Elizabeth A', 'Rogers, Jason H', 'Tran, Tam', 'Hromas, Robert', 'Dahl, Richard']","['Kong KY', 'Williamson EA', 'Rogers JH', 'Tran T', 'Hromas R', 'Dahl R']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, Albuquerque, NM 87131, USA.']",,['eng'],"['R01 CA102283/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL075783/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL075783/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA102283/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090325,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/genetics/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Gene Silencing', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Mesoderm/embryology/physiology', 'Mice', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-3/antagonists & inhibitors/*deficiency/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transfection']",2009/03/27 09:00,2009/07/25 09:00,['2009/03/27 09:00'],"['2009/03/27 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/25 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)37137-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-08-174755 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Jul 2;114(1):60-3. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-08-174755.

Tax is expressed and known to function in both the cell nucleus and the cytoplasm. Tax has defined nuclear localization (NLS) and nuclear export signals that enable shuttling between the two compartments. In this study, we identified a novel region in Tax that targets the protein to discrete nuclear foci that we have previously termed Tax speckled structures (TSS). We demonstrated that the identified region is both necessary and sufficient for directing proteins to TSS. This novel TSS localization signal (TSLS), spanning amino acids 50 to 75, is separable from and adjacent to the NLS of Tax. Coexpression of a Tax NLS mutant and a Tax TSLS mutant rescued the nuclear entry and subnuclear TSS targeting of both proteins, demonstrating that these signals are independent domains. Our analysis also revealed that Tax proteins deficient for dimerization fail to localize to the nucleus. Consequently, when we restored dimerization via induction of a heterologous ""dimerizer"" domain, nuclear localization was rescued. Thus, we defined additional domains in Tax specific for nuclear localization and subnuclear targeting. Our results reveal a more complex network for regulation of Tax subcellular localization and subsequent function.","['Fryrear, Kimberly A', 'Durkin, Sarah S', 'Gupta, Saurabh K', 'Tiedebohl, Jessica B', 'Semmes, O John']","['Fryrear KA', 'Durkin SS', 'Gupta SK', 'Tiedebohl JB', 'Semmes OJ']","['Department of Microbiology and Molecular Cell Biology, Norfolk, VA 23507, USA.']",,['eng'],"['R01 CA076595/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA76959/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090325,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Products, tax/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'Mutation/genetics', '*Nuclear Export Signals', '*Protein Multimerization', 'Simian virus 40/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics']",2009/03/27 09:00,2009/05/30 09:00,['2009/03/27 09:00'],"['2009/03/27 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/30 09:00 [medline]']","['JVI.00232-09 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00232-09 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2009 Jun;83(11):5339-52. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00232-09.

In order to improve the lipophilicity and bioavailability of Ara-C, a series of N(4) derivatives of Ara-C, i.e., (fatty acid)-(amino acid)-Ara-C analogues, were prepared. The 15 derivatives synthesized were characterized by their melting points, optical rotations and partition coefficients. It was found that the Ara-C derivatives synthesized in this study were more lipophilic than Ara-C as determined by their partition coefficients. Their in vitro cytotoxicity and in vivo anti-tumor activity were determined and compared with that of Ara-C. It was found that the derivatives were more active than Ara-C in Hela cells, but not in HL-60 cells.

It has an anti-inflammatory effect and promotes cell proliferation. However, when it is degraded to granulin peptides (GRNs) by neutrophil proteases, a pro-inflammatory reaction occurs. Since injury, inflammation and repair are common features in the progression of atherosclerosis, it is conceivable that PGRN plays a role in atherogenesis. RESULTS: Immunohistochemical analysis of human carotid endoatherectomy specimens indicated that vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMCs) in the intima expressed PGRN. Some macrophages in the plaque also expressed PGRN. We assessed the effect of PGRN on a human monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1) and human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs). PGRN alone had no effect on HASMC or THP-1 proliferation or migration. However, when THP-1 cells were stimulated with MCP-1, the number of migrated cells decreased in a PGRN-dose-dependent manner. TNF-alpha-induced HASMC migration was enhanced only at 10nM of PGRN. Interleukin-8 (IL-8) secretion from HASMCs was reduced by forced expression of PGRN and increased by RNAi-mediated knockdown of PGRN. While exogenous treatment with recombinant PGRN decreased IL-8 secretion, degraded recombinant GRNs increased IL-8 secretion from HASMCs. CONCLUSIONS: The expression of PGRN mainly reduces inflammation and its degradation into GRNs enhances inflammation in atherosclerotic plaque and may contribute to the progression of atherosclerosis.","['Kojima, Yoji', 'Ono, Koh', 'Inoue, Katsumi', 'Takagi, Yasushi', 'Kikuta, Ken-ichiro', 'Nishimura, Masaki', 'Yoshida, Yoshinori', 'Nakashima, Yasuhiro', 'Matsumae, Hironobu', 'Furukawa, Yutaka', 'Mikuni, Nobuhiro', 'Nobuyoshi, Masakiyo', 'Kimura, Takeshi', 'Kita, Toru', 'Tanaka, Makoto']","['Kojima Y', 'Ono K', 'Inoue K', 'Takagi Y', 'Kikuta K', 'Nishimura M', 'Yoshida Y', 'Nakashima Y', 'Matsumae H', 'Furukawa Y', 'Mikuni N', 'Nobuyoshi M', 'Kimura T', 'Kita T', 'Tanaka M']","['Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090223,Ireland,Atherosclerosis,Atherosclerosis,0242543,IM,"['Atherosclerosis/*metabolism', 'Carotid Artery Diseases/physiopathology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Chemokine CCL2/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Muscle, Smooth, Vascular/physiology', 'Myocytes, Smooth Muscle/metabolism', 'Progranulins', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology', 'Tunica Intima/metabolism']",2009/03/27 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/03/27 09:00'],"['2008/10/08 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/10 00:00 [revised]', '2009/02/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/27 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9150(09)00144-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2009.02.017 [doi]']",ppublish,Atherosclerosis. 2009 Sep;206(1):102-8. doi: 10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2009.02.017.

We examined whether mTOR plays a role as regulator of growth and VEGF-expression in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Three mTOR-targeting drugs, rapamycin, everolimus (RAD001) and CCI-779, were applied. The effects of these drugs on growth, survival, apoptosis and VEGF expression in primary AML cells and various AML cell lines were examined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Growth of AML cells and AML-derived cell lines was assessed by (3)H-thymidine incorporation, survival was examined by light- and electron microscopy, by Tunel assay and by AnnexinV-staining, and the expression of VEGF by Northern blotting, RT-PCR and ELISA. RESULTS: Rapamycin was found to counteract growth in the AML cell lines U937 and KG1a as well as in primary AML cells in 14/18 patients examined. The effects of rapamycin and its derivatives were dose-dependent (IC(50): 10 pM-100 nM). It was also found that exposure to mTOR-targeting drugs resulted in apoptosis and in decreased expression of VEGF in leukaemic cells. CONCLUSIONS: mTOR-targeting drugs exert antileukaemic effects on AML cells in vitro through multiple actions, including direct inhibition of proliferation, induction of apoptosis and suppression of VEGF. Based on this study and other studies, mTOR can be regarded as a potential drug target in AML.","['Bohm, A', 'Aichberger, K J', 'Mayerhofer, M', 'Herrmann, H', 'Florian, S', 'Krauth, M-T', 'Derdak, S', 'Samorapoompichit, P', 'Sonneck, K', 'Vales, A', 'Gleixner, K V', 'Pickl, W F', 'Sperr, W R', 'Valent, P']","['Bohm A', 'Aichberger KJ', 'Mayerhofer M', 'Herrmann H', 'Florian S', 'Krauth MT', 'Derdak S', 'Samorapoompichit P', 'Sonneck K', 'Vales A', 'Gleixner KV', 'Pickl WF', 'Sperr WR', 'Valent P']","['Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Eur J Clin Invest,European journal of clinical investigation,0245331,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sirolimus/*pharmacology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/genetics/*metabolism']",2009/03/27 09:00,2009/10/10 06:00,['2009/03/27 09:00'],"['2009/03/27 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/10 06:00 [medline]']","['ECI2101 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2362.2009.02101.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Clin Invest. 2009 May;39(5):395-405. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2362.2009.02101.x.,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overexpression of the constitutively active alpha subunit of Gs (GalphasQL) in A549 human lung cancer cells increased cisplatin-induced apoptosis, and knockdown of Galphas with small hairpin RNA decreased the percentage of apoptotic cells. GalphasQL increased the expression of the proapoptotic proteins B-cell leukemia/lymphoma-2 genes (Bcl-2) homologous antagonist killer protein (Bak) and Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax), and decreased the expression of the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-Xlong protein. Knockdown of Bak blocked the augmentative effects of GalphasQL. GalphasQL decreased the degradation rate of the Bak protein, and increased Bak mRNA transcript levels. GalphasQL increased Bak-luciferase activity in a protein kinase A and cyclic AMP response element-dependent manner. GalphasQL also augmented cisplatin-induced apoptosis of H1299 human lung cancer cells that lack functional p53. From this study, it is concluded that Galphas augments cisplatin-induced apoptosis of lung cancer cells partially through upregulating Bak expression by increasing transcription and by decreasing the rate of protein degradation.","['Choi, Yoon Jung', 'Oh, Jung-Min', 'Kim, So-Young', 'Seo, Miran', 'Juhnn, Yong-Sung']","['Choi YJ', 'Oh JM', 'Kim SY', 'Seo M', 'Juhnn YS']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Laboratory of Cellular Signaling, Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090323,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cisplatin/*pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/metabolism', 'DNA Primers', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Heterotrimeric GTP-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Luciferases/genetics', 'Lung Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Transfection', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/*genetics']",2009/03/27 09:00,2009/07/09 09:00,['2009/03/27 09:00'],"['2009/03/27 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/09 09:00 [medline]']","['CAS1136 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.2009.01136.x [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2009 Jun;100(6):1069-74. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2009.01136.x.

To further improve the treatment outcome of haplo-mismatched HSCT in CML, a modifiable prognostic factor needs to be found. The cellular composition of grafts obtained from 75 HLA-mismatched/haploidentical related donors was prospectively correlated with the outcome of patients with CML undergoing haplo-mismatched HSCT following a modified regimen of BU/CY 2 plus antithymocyte globulin. The concentration of T-cell subsets, CD14+, and CD34+ cells and their relative proportions were analyzed. In univariate analyses, disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) conversely correlated with the CD4/CD8 ratio in primed bone marrow graft (G-BM) (p = 0.012 and p = 0.040); similarly, CD4/CD8 ratio in total grafts was also negatively associated with DFS and OS (p = 0.018 and p = 0.020). In multivariate analyses, a CD4/CD8 ratio in G-BM higher than the median value remained the only factor negatively affecting DFS (p = 0.030; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.166-19.341). Expectedly, high CD34+ cell dose was associated with accelerated platelet engraftment (p = 0.009; 95% CI = 1.181-3.271) after controlling for a high risk of disease. No other clinical parameter was influenced by graft composition. Our results suggest that a high CD4/CD8 ratio in allografts may predict adverse survival in patients with CML undergoing haplo-mismatched HSCT.","['Xu, Lan-Ping', 'Luo, Xiao-Hua', 'Chang, Ying-Jun', 'Liu, Dai-Hong', 'Liu, Kai-Yan', 'Chen, Yu-Hong', 'Huang, Xiao-Jun']","['Xu LP', 'Luo XH', 'Chang YJ', 'Liu DH', 'Liu KY', 'Chen YH', 'Huang XJ']","[""Peking University Institute of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, No. 11 Xizhimen, South Street, Beijing, 100044, China.""]",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090325,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*CD4-CD8 Ratio', 'Female', '*HLA Antigens', 'Haplotypes', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods/mortality', '*Histocompatibility', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/immunology/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2009/03/26 09:00,2009/09/17 06:00,['2009/03/26 09:00'],"['2008/10/12 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/26 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-009-0728-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2009 Oct;88(10):1015-24. doi: 10.1007/s00277-009-0728-4.

CLL was notably absent from all 5 biopsies that were available for review. In 2 of 6 cases, this was the patients' initial presentation of CLL. Five of 6 cases involved routine paraffin-embedded tissue specimens and 1 case involved frozen tissue sections from a Mohs surgical procedure. The mean age range of the patients was 84 years. Only one of 5 patients in which we have follow-up data, died of a CLL-related cause at the time of this submission (mean follow-up 19.8 months). On histologic examination, the most common pattern of involvement by CLL (as seen in 4 of the 6 cases) was a dense, nodular, and superficial and deep perivascular, periadnexal, and perineural infiltrate beneath the fibrosing granulation tissue of the prior biopsy site. The infiltrate involved the upper and deep reticular dermis and subcutaneous fat. The remaining 2 cases demonstrated a novel finding of a subtle infiltration of leukemic cells among extravasated red blood cells within the mid and deep reticular dermis. In all cases, leukemic cells were present as tightly packed, small, monomorphous, hyperchromatic lymphocytes and 1 case demonstrated a proliferation center. Immunohistochemical stains were performed on 3 of 6 cases, and the leukemic cells were CD5/CD20/CD23/CD3. This case series raises awareness that CLL can incidentally involve dermatopathology specimens and occasionally be the initial presentation of the patients' systemic illness. This series also highlights the unique histologic patterns of CLL in the skin, one of which has not been previously described, and illustrates how these patterns are distinct from the typical interstitial infiltration seen in other cases of leukemia cutis.","['Walther, Brian S', 'Gibbons, George', 'Chan, Edward F', 'Ziselman, Ethel', 'Rothfleisch, Jeremy E', 'Willard, Robert J', 'Baldassano, Marisa F']","['Walther BS', 'Gibbons G', 'Chan EF', 'Ziselman E', 'Rothfleisch JE', 'Willard RJ', 'Baldassano MF']","['Dermatology Group of the Carolinas, Concord, NC, USA. mrgreen134@gmail.com']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Am J Dermatopathol,The American Journal of dermatopathology,7911005,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD20/metabolism', 'Biopsy', 'CD3 Complex/metabolism', 'CD4 Antigens/metabolism', 'CD5 Antigens/metabolism', 'Dermis/metabolism/*pathology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, IgE/metabolism', 'Skin Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology']",2009/03/26 09:00,2009/07/07 09:00,['2009/03/26 09:00'],"['2009/03/26 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/07 09:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/DAD.0b013e3181888869 [doi]', '00000372-200904000-00008 [pii]']",ppublish,Am J Dermatopathol. 2009 Apr;31(2):162-5. doi: 10.1097/DAD.0b013e3181888869.,"['0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), signals from the microenvironment are critical for expansion of the malignant B cells, and cause constitutive activation of PI3Ks. CXCR4 is a key receptor for CLL cell migration and adhesion to marrow stromal cells (MSCs). Because of the importance of CXCR4 and PI3Ks for CLL-microenvironment cross-talk, we investigated the activity of novel, isoform-selective PI3K inhibitors that target different isoforms of the p110-kDa subunit. Inhibition with p110alpha inhibitors (PIK-90 and PI-103) resulted in a significant reduction of chemotaxis and actin polymerization to CXCL12 and reduced migration beneath MSC (pseudoemperipolesis). Western blot and reverse phase protein array analyses consistently demonstrated that PIK-90 and PI-103 inhibited phosphorylation of Akt and S6, whereas p110delta or p110beta/p110delta inhibitors were less effective. In suspension and MSC cocultures, PI-103 and PIK-90 were potent inducers of CLL cell apoptosis. Moreover, these p110alpha inhibitors enhanced the cytotoxicity of fludarabine and reversed the protective effect of MSC on fludarabine-induced apoptosis. Collectively, our data demonstrate that p110alpha inhibitors antagonize stromal cell-derived migration, survival, and drug-resistance signals and therefore provide a rational to explore the therapeutic activity of these promising agents in CLL.","['Niedermeier, Matthias', 'Hennessy, Bryan T', 'Knight, Zachary A', 'Henneberg, Marina', 'Hu, Jianhua', 'Kurtova, Antonina V', 'Wierda, William G', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Shokat, Kevan M', 'Burger, Jan A']","['Niedermeier M', 'Hennessy BT', 'Knight ZA', 'Henneberg M', 'Hu J', 'Kurtova AV', 'Wierda WG', 'Keating MJ', 'Shokat KM', 'Burger JA']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.

CASE SUMMARY: A 6.1-year-old child received cyclosporine and methotrexate for acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) prophylaxis after his first HSCT for acute myeloblastic leukemia. Amlodipine was given for the treatment of hypertension. Symptoms of CIPS were not observed. After the second HSCT at the age of 6.7 years, the child received cyclosporine (target trough whole blood cyclosporine concentration range 150-200 microg/L), starting on day -3, and mycophenolate mofetil for aGVHD prophylaxis. With the first cyclosporine dose, the patient complained of leg pain that was most severe during the cyclosporine infusion. Analgesic agents and a change from intravenous to oral administration of cyclosporine were ineffective in controlling the pain. Magnetic resonance imaging findings on day 10 showed periosteal soft tissue changes and mild bone marrow edema of the femora and tibiae. Tacrolimus was substituted for cyclosporine on day 20; on day 21 amlodipine was initiated to manage hypertension. Trough whole blood tacrolimus concentrations ranged from 1.7 to 6.2 microg/L. Pain was reduced in severity by day 29 and completely resolved once tacrolimus was discontinued on day 42. In this case, CIPS was considered to be probably associated with cyclosporine according to the Naranjo probability scale. DISCUSSION: CIPS is hypothesized to result from calcineurin-induced vascular changes that disturb bone perfusion and permeability, leading to intraosseous vasoconstriction and bone marrow edema. In our patient, symptoms were most acute during the infusion, when whole blood cyclosporine concentrations were likely to be the highest. Our patient's symptoms were resolved when tacrolimus was substituted for cyclosporine and amlodipine was initiated. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions aimed at reducing pain associated with CIPS may include the initiation of calcium-channel blocker therapy and conversion to an alternative calcineurin inhibitor.","['Lavoratore, Sara R', 'Navarro, Oscar M', 'Grunebaum, Eyal', 'Ali, Muhammad', 'Koo, Alicia', 'Schechter, Tal', 'Gassas, Adam', 'Doyle, John J', 'Lee Dupuis, L']","['Lavoratore SR', 'Navarro OM', 'Grunebaum E', 'Ali M', 'Koo A', 'Schechter T', 'Gassas A', 'Doyle JJ', 'Lee Dupuis L']","['University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",,['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20090324,United States,Ann Pharmacother,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,9203131,IM,"['Calcium Channel Blockers/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Cyclosporine/*adverse effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects/methods', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Pain/chemically induced/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy/*chemically induced/diagnosis/drug therapy']",2009/03/26 09:00,2010/01/05 06:00,['2009/03/26 09:00'],"['2009/03/26 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/05 06:00 [medline]']","['aph.1L641 [pii]', '10.1345/aph.1L641 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Pharmacother. 2009 Apr;43(4):767-71. doi: 10.1345/aph.1L641.

This compound is very efficient in killing Bcr-Abl-positive cells in a caspase-dependent manner. Nevertheless, several lines of evidence indicated that caspase-mediated cell death (i.e., apoptosis) is not the only type of death induced by imatinib. The goal of our study was to evaluate the importance of the newly described caspase-independent cell death (CID) in Bcr-Abl-positive cells. We established in several CML cell lines that imatinib, in conjunction with apoptosis, also induced CID. CID was shown to be as efficient as apoptosis in preventing CML cell proliferation and survival. We next investigated the potential implication of a recently identified mechanism used by cancer cells to escape CID through overexpression of the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). We showed here, in several CML cell lines, that GAPDH overexpression was sufficient to induce protection from CID. Furthermore, imatinib-resistant Bcr-Abl-positive cell lines were found to spontaneously overexpress GAPDH. Finally, we showed that a GAPDH partial knockdown, using specific short hairpin RNAs, was sufficient to resensitize those resistant cells to imatinib-induced cell death. Taken together, our results indicate that CID is an important effector of imatinib-mediated cell death. We also established that GAPDH overexpression can be found in imatinib-resistant Bcr-Abl-positive cells and that its down-regulation can resensitize those resistant cells to imatinib-induced death. Therefore, drugs able to modulate GAPDH administered together with imatinib could find some therapeutic benefits in CML patients.","['Lavallard, Vanessa J', 'Pradelli, Ludivine A', 'Paul, Audrey', 'Beneteau, Marie', 'Jacquel, Arnaud', 'Auberger, Patrick', 'Ricci, Jean-Ehrland']","['Lavallard VJ', 'Pradelli LA', 'Paul A', 'Beneteau M', 'Jacquel A', 'Auberger P', 'Ricci JE']","['Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, U895, equipe 3 Avenir, Faculte de Medecine, Nice, France.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090324,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/physiology', 'Benzamides', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Death/*drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/biosynthesis', 'Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenases/biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Quinolines/pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics']",2009/03/26 09:00,2009/06/03 09:00,['2009/03/26 09:00'],"['2009/03/26 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/03 09:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-08-2731 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-2731 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2009 Apr 1;69(7):3013-20. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-2731.

Secondary mutations in target kinases can cause clinical resistance to therapeutic kinase inhibition. We have previously shown that sensitivity toward tyrosine kinase inhibitors varies between different activating FLT3 mutations. We therefore intended to determine whether different FLT3 inhibitors would produce distinct profiles of secondary, FLT3 resistance mutations. Using a cell-based screening approach, we generated FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD)-expressing cell lines resistant to the FLT3 inhibitors SU5614, PKC412, and sorafenib. Interestingly, the profile of resistance mutations emerging with SU5614 was limited to exchanges in the second part of the kinase domain (TK2) with exchanges of D835 predominating. In contrast, PKC412 exclusively produced mutations within tyrosine kinase domain 1 (TK1) at position N676. A mutation at N676 recently has been reported in a case of PKC412-resistant AML. TK1 mutations exhibited a differential response to SU5614, sorafenib, and sunitinib but strongly impaired response to PKC412. TK2 exchanges identified with SU5614 were sensitive to PKC412, sunitinib, or sorafenib, with the exception of Y842D, which caused a strong resistance to sorafenib. Of note, sorafenib also produced a highly distinct profile of resistance mutations with no overlap to SU5614 or PKC412, including F691L in TK1 and exchanges at position Y842 of TK2. Thus, different FLT3 kinase inhibitors generate distinct, nonoverlapping resistance profiles. This is in contrast to Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitors such as imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib, which display overlapping resistance profiles. Therefore, combinations of FLT3 inhibitors may be useful to prevent FLT3 resistance mutations in the setting of FLT3-ITD-positive AML.","['von Bubnoff, Nikolas', 'Engh, Richard A', 'Aberg, Espen', 'Sanger, Jana', 'Peschel, Christian', 'Duyster, Justus']","['von Bubnoff N', 'Engh RA', 'Aberg E', 'Sanger J', 'Peschel C', 'Duyster J']","['III.

Gamma secretase inhibitors (GSI) block proteolytic activation of NOTCH receptors and may provide a targeted therapy for T-ALL. We have investigated the mechanisms of GSI sensitivity across a panel of T-ALL cell lines, yielding an approach for patient stratification based on pathway activity and also providing a rational combination strategy for enhanced response to GSI. Whereas the NOTCH1 mutation status does not serve as a predictor of GSI sensitivity, a gene expression signature of NOTCH pathway activity does correlate with response, and may be useful in the selection of patients more likely to respond to GSI. Furthermore, inhibition of the NOTCH pathway activity signature correlates with the induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors CDKN2D (p19(INK4d)) and CDKN1B (p27(Kip1)), leading to derepression of RB and subsequent exit from the cell cycle. Consistent with this evidence of cell cycle exit, short-term exposure of GSI resulted in sustained molecular and phenotypic effects after withdrawal of the compound. Combination treatment with GSI and a small molecule inhibitor of CDK4 produced synergistic growth inhibition, providing evidence that GSI engagement of the CDK4/RB pathway is an important mechanism of GSI action and supports further investigation of this combination for improved efficacy in treating T-ALL.","['Rao, Sudhir S', ""O'Neil, Jennifer"", 'Liberator, Cole D', 'Hardwick, James S', 'Dai, Xudong', 'Zhang, Theresa', 'Tyminski, Edyta', 'Yuan, Jing', 'Kohl, Nancy E', 'Richon, Victoria M', 'Van der Ploeg, Lex H T', 'Carroll, Pamela M', 'Draetta, Giulio F', 'Look, A Thomas', 'Strack, Peter R', 'Winter, Christopher G']","['Rao SS', ""O'Neil J"", 'Liberator CD', 'Hardwick JS', 'Dai X', 'Zhang T', 'Tyminski E', 'Yuan J', 'Kohl NE', 'Richon VM', 'Van der Ploeg LH', 'Carroll PM', 'Draetta GF', 'Look AT', 'Strack PR', 'Winter CG']","['Merck Research Laboratories, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090324,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclic S-Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p19/biosynthesis', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'G1 Phase/drug effects/genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Protease Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Receptor, Notch1/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/*metabolism', 'S Phase/drug effects/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Thiadiazoles/*pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection']",2009/03/26 09:00,2009/06/03 09:00,['2009/03/26 09:00'],"['2009/03/26 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/03 09:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-08-4295 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-4295 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2009 Apr 1;69(7):3060-8. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-4295.

Particular concern was directed at SR-51, a desealant chemical mixture containing the following four solvents: aromatic 150 solvent (Aro150), dimethylacetamide, thiophenol (TP), and triethylphosphate. The present study examined the mutagenic potential of SR-51 using a range of well-known mutagen and genotoxin assays. The tests used were i) a modified version of the Ames test, ii) the mouse lymphoma assay, iii) the comet assay (a single-cell gel electrophoresis assay), and iv) a mouse micronucleus test. The modified Ames test used mixed bacterial strains in liquid suspension media. The Ames test results showed that SR-51 (tested up to the cytotoxic concentration of 36 microg/ml, 30 min incubation) in the presence and absence of S9 metabolic activation was not mutagenic. The mouse lymphoma assay used cultured mouse lymphoma cells in a microwell suspension method. The mouse lymphoma assay was also negative with SR-51 (tested up to the cytotoxic concentration of 22.5 microg/ml, 3 h incubation) in the presence and absence of S9 metabolic activation. The Comet assay, using cultured mouse lymphoma cells, showed no evidence of DNA damage in cells exposed up to the cytotoxic concentration of SR-51 at 11.25 microg/ml. The in-vivo mouse micronucleus test was undertaken in wild-type C57Bl6J male mice dosed orally with SR-51for 14 days with a single daily dose up to 360 mg/kg/day (the maximum-tolerated dose). No increases were observed in micronuclei (MN) frequency in bone marrow collected (24 h after final dose) from SR-51-treated mice compared to the number of MN observed in bone marrow collected from untreated mice. Tissues collected from treated mice at necropsy demonstrated a significant increase in spleen weights in the high dose mice. Gas chromatography analysis of SR-51 identified more than 40 individual components and an oxidation product, diphenyldisulfide derived from TP under conditions of mild heating. In conclusion, there was no evidence that SR-51 is mutagenic.","['Oakes, D J', 'Ritchie, H E', 'Woodman, P D C', 'Narup, E', 'Moscova, M', 'Picker, K', 'Webster, W S']","['Oakes DJ', 'Ritchie HE', 'Woodman PD', 'Narup E', 'Moscova M', 'Picker K', 'Webster WS']","['Discipline of Biomedical Science (Lidcombe Campus), Faculty of Medicine, University of Sydney, 75 East Street, Lidcombe.

In multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (Men1), a mutation of menin caused decreased expression of the p27(Kip1) and p18(Ink4C) genes and deregulated cell growth. We hypothesized that the same pathway might be involved in sporadic pituitary adenomas. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: mRNA levels for MLL, Men1, p27(Kip1), and p18(Ink4C) were measured in specimens of several sporadic pituitary adenomas, and a search for clinical parameters revealed that octreotide treatment affected the level of expression of some genes tested. To study molecular mechanisms, we cloned and characterized the MLL promoter region and used small interfering RNA for MLL and specific inhibitors for signal transduction pathways. RESULTS: A strong correlation between MLL and p27(Kip1) mRNA levels was observed in prolactinomas and growth hormone-secreting adenomas, and these levels were attenuated except in growth hormone-secreting adenomas treated with a somatostatin analogue, octreotide. Conversely, the patients treated with octreotide showed high levels of MLL-p27(Kip1) mRNA. Experiments in vitro showed that octreotide increased MLL and p27(Kip1) protein and mRNA levels, and overexpression of MLL induced a marked increase in p27(Kip1)promoter activity. Furthermore, octreotide stimulated the promoter activity of the MLL gene through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. In addition, incubation with an inhibitor for methyltransferase, MTA, and knockdown of MLL completely inhibited the octreotide-induced expression of p27(Kip1). CONCLUSIONS: The MLL-p27(Kip1) pathway was down-regulated in the pituitary adenomas, and octreotide increased the p27(Kip1) level, at least in part, by sequential transcriptional stimulation of the MLL and p27(Kip1) genes through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways.","['Horiguchi, Kazuhiko', 'Yamada, Masanobu', 'Satoh, Tetsurou', 'Hashimoto, Koshi', 'Hirato, Junko', 'Tosaka, Masahiko', 'Yamada, Shozo', 'Mori, Masatomo']","['Horiguchi K', 'Yamada M', 'Satoh T', 'Hashimoto K', 'Hirato J', 'Tosaka M', 'Yamada S', 'Mori M']","['Department of Medicine and Molecular Science, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, Maebashi, Japan.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090324,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Adult', 'Androstadienes/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/*pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p18/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Endocrine Gland Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Octreotide/*pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Pituitary Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/drug effects/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcriptional Activation/*drug effects', 'Wortmannin']",2009/03/26 09:00,2009/06/06 09:00,['2009/03/26 09:00'],"['2009/03/26 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/06 09:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-08-2473 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-2473 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2009 Apr 15;15(8):2620-9. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-2473.

A key clinical consideration in this context is the timing of biopsy, if collection of spermatogonia could be delayed from diagnosis to the later phase of leukemia treatment, better patient selection could be offered. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to examine the routine testicular biopsy material collected to detect testicular leukemia to evaluate if treatment for leukemia affects numbers and maturation of the spermatogonia during the prepubertal period. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: The study involved 28 testicular biopsies from 23 prepubertal boys treated for ALL. OUTCOME MEASURE: Samples were stained immunohistochemically to evaluate the expression of the spermatogonial markers MAGE 4A, OCT4, CD9, and AP2gamma, and of the Sertoli cell marker WT-1. To relate these findings to gonadal function after sexual maturation, the surviving patients were evaluated as adults. RESULTS: Several MAGE 4A-, CD9-, or OCT4-positive spermatogonia were detected in testicular biopsies after standard risk therapy without cyclophosphamide, whereas their numbers were significantly reduced in six patients receiving high-risk ALL therapy involving cyclophosphamide. No significant alteration in spermatogonial numbers was associated with testicular leukemia. All patients not treated with cyclophosphamide recovered normal testicular function, with normal sperm quality and endocrine function. CONCLUSION: Treatment for childhood leukemia without high-dose cyclophosphamide seldom depletes the spermatogonial stem cell pool totally.","['Nurmio, Mirja', 'Keros, Victoria', 'Lahteenmaki, Paivi', 'Salmi, Toivo', 'Kallajoki, Markku', 'Jahnukainen, Kirsi']","['Nurmio M', 'Keros V', 'Lahteenmaki P', 'Salmi T', 'Kallajoki M', 'Jahnukainen K']","['Department of Physiology, University of Turku, Turku FIN-20520, Finland. mirja.nurmio@utu.fi']",,['eng'],,"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090324,United States,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,0375362,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclophosphamide/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Fertility/*drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Infertility, Male/chemically induced/pathology/prevention & control', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology/physiopathology', 'Puberty/drug effects/physiology', '*Sperm Count', 'Spermatogonia/drug effects/*pathology/physiology', 'Testis/pathology/physiology']",2009/03/26 09:00,2009/07/03 09:00,['2009/03/26 09:00'],"['2009/03/26 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/03 09:00 [medline]']","['jc.2009-0060 [pii]', '10.1210/jc.2009-0060 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2009 Jun;94(6):2119-22. doi: 10.1210/jc.2009-0060.

Treatment strategy of Hodgkin's disease is now based on risk adaptation, including not only the results of pretreatment diagnostic and prognostic factors but also the repeated PET/CT (restaging) made in the early treatment period. Possible reduction of irradiation therapy may contribute to lower the risk of secondary tumors, which are common late complications of radiochemotherapy. Autologous stem cell transplantation is the therapy of choice in chemosensitive relapsing patients. The complete remission rate today in Hodgkin's disease is around 85%. In the heterogenic group of Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas, progression of indolent lymphomas (CLL, multiple myeloma, hairy cell leukemia, cutaneous lymphomas, etc.) is slow in case of natural course. Their therapy is mostly palliative and complete remission with the latest treatment modalities is not possible. Aggressive lymphomas are characterized with rapid progression and early death without treatment.Most of them respond to chemotherapy and irradiation.With an adequate therapy, 60-70% of patients reach complete remission (CR) and 40-50% of them remain in remission. Using immune- and radioimmune therapy in indolent and aggressive NHL groups gives possibility to influence G0 tumor cells as well. Their use in combination with classic chemotherapy leads to more complete remissions and better therapy results.

In this study, we isolated the 9 kinds of SQTLs from Eupatorium chinense L. and examined the effects of these SQTLs on the degranulation in RBL-2H3 cells. The chemical structures of two novel compounds (SQTL-3 and 8) were determined. All the SQTLs suppressed the degranulation from Ag-stimulated RBL-2H3 cells. To disclose the inhibitory mechanism of degranulation by SQTLs, we examined the activation of intracellular signaling molecules such as Lyn, Syk, and PLCgammas and intracellular free Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i). None of these SQTLs showed the activation of Syk and PLCgammas. The intracellular free Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) was elevated by Fc epsilonRI activation, but SQTLs treatment reduced the elevation of [Ca(2+)]i by suppressing Ca(2+) influx. Thus, it was suggested that the suppression of Ag-stimulated degranulation by these SQTLs is mainly due to the decreased Ca(2+) influx. Furthermore, in order to clarify the in vivo effect of SQTL-rich extract, we administered SQTL-rich extract to the type I allergic model mice and measured the passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) reaction induced by IgE-antigen complex. The SQTLs remarkably suppressed PCA reaction in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, it was suggested that SQTLs would be a candidate as an anti-allergic agent.","['Itoh, Tomohiro', 'Oyama, Masayoshi', 'Takimoto, Norihiko', 'Kato, Chihiro', 'Nozawa, Yoshinori', 'Akao, Yukihiro', 'Iinuma, Munekazu']","['Itoh T', 'Oyama M', 'Takimoto N', 'Kato C', 'Nozawa Y', 'Akao Y', 'Iinuma M']","['Gifu International Institute of Biotechnology, 1-1 Naka-Fudogaoka, Kakamigahara, Gifu 504-0838, Japan. titoh@giib.or.jp']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090305,England,Bioorg Med Chem,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry,9413298,IM,"['Animals', 'Basophil Degranulation Test', 'Basophils/*drug effects/physiology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Degranulation/*drug effects', 'Eupatorium/*chemistry', 'Histamine Release/drug effects', 'Immunoglobulin E/*immunology', 'Lactones/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/immunology/pathology', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Mice', 'Passive Cutaneous Anaphylaxis/*drug effects', 'Rats', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Sesquiterpenes/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",2009/03/26 09:00,2009/12/18 06:00,['2009/03/26 09:00'],"['2009/01/27 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/16 00:00 [revised]', '2009/02/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/26 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S0968-0896(09)00217-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.bmc.2009.02.062 [doi]']",ppublish,Bioorg Med Chem. 2009 Apr 15;17(8):3189-97. doi: 10.1016/j.bmc.2009.02.062.

The percentage of leukemic B-cells expressing CD49d determined by flow cytometry ranged from 0 to 100%. 37 patients with high CD49d protein expression >or=45% (according to ROC analysis) had a significantly shorter treatment-free survival (TFS) and overall survival (OS) than 64 patients with low CD49d expression (median TFS: 116 versus 43 months, p=0.015; median OS: not reached in both groups, p=0.018).

All subjects were genotyped for the C3435T polymorphism using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method. The genotype frequencies in the patients were 17% homozygous CC, 61% heterozygous CT, and 22% homozygous TT; in healthy individuals the genotype frequencies were 14% CC, 53% CT, and 33% TT.

Antigen-induced activation via cell-surface receptors initiates a series of intracellular signaling events, leading to the secretion of inflammatory mediators. While many of the kinases involved in this process have been defined, their substrates are generally unknown. This study aimed to identify proteins phosphorylated by serine or threonine kinases in the early stages of mast cell activation, using the rat basophilic leukemia cell line RBL-2H3 as a model system. Cells were activated via FcepsilonRI cross-linking, and lysed at different time points between 1-10 min. A novel, specific mixture of serine and threonine phospho-specific antibodies was utilized, and was shown to selectively detect proteins that were phosphorylated upon cell activation. The mixture of antibodies was used to immunoprecipitate such regulated phosphoproteins from cell lysates enriched in phosphoproteins by phospho-affinity chromatography. Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, Western blotting and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. With this approach, we highlighted a number of phosphoproteins, demonstrated differences in the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation rates among the regulated proteins, and identified eleven serine- or threonine-phosphorylated proteins that are substrates of kinases involved in mast cell intracellular signaling. Among these were proteins with functions in protein metabolism, including elongation factor 2, calnexin and heat shock proteins; and cell structure, including moesin, tubulin and actin. The novel approach applied in this study proved useful for the identification of kinase substrates, and can readily be extended for use in similar phosphoproteomic studies.","['Olson, Fredrik J', 'Ludowyke, Russell I', 'Karlsson, Niclas G']","['Olson FJ', 'Ludowyke RI', 'Karlsson NG']","['Proteome Systems Limited, Locked Bag 2073, North Ryde, Sydney, NSW 1670, Australia.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Proteome Res,Journal of proteome research,101128775,IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Mast Cells/*metabolism', 'Myosins/metabolism', 'Peptide Elongation Factor 2/metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphoserine/*metabolism', 'Phosphothreonine/*metabolism', 'Rats']",2009/03/26 09:00,2009/09/15 06:00,['2009/03/26 09:00'],"['2009/03/26 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/pr8010809 [doi]'],ppublish,J Proteome Res. 2009 Jun;8(6):3068-77. doi: 10.1021/pr8010809.,"['0 (Peptide Elongation Factor 2)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '1114-81-4 (Phosphothreonine)', '17885-08-4 (Phosphoserine)', 'EC 3.6.4.1 (Myosins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been reported that lymphoma-leukemia, melanoma and sarcomas, the most common primary malignancies, can metastasize to the breast. On the other hand, ovarian carcinoma and other gynecologic cancers rarely develop into breast metastasis. However, the incidence of breast metastasis arising from ovarian carcinoma might be increasing as a result of prolongation in survival and improvement in treatment modalities. Bilateral breast metastasis originating from an ovarian carcinoma is an extremely rare clinico-pathological situation. In our literature review we found just nine cases of bilateral breast metastasis from primary ovarian carcinoma. In this study, the mean age was 46 years (range 16-68). Mean interval from initial diagnosis of ovarian carcinoma to bilateral breast metastases was 22 months (range 11-24) and mean survival was 12 (range 5-27) months after the diagnosis of breast metastasis. Serous papillary adenocarcinoma was the predominant histological subtype. Interestingly, five of the nine (56%) cases reported were from Turkey.

Growth factors and integrins interact with their receptors and activate signaling cascades with intimate interconnections. The specific niches within the bone marrow microenvironment may provide a sanctuary for subpopulations of leukemic cells to escape chemotherapy-induced death and acquire drug resistance. Investigations into bone marrow stroma-leukemia crosstalk may result in the development of strategies against the acquisition of a chemo-resistant phenotype and enhance the efficacy of therapies in leukemia. In recent studies, we proposed novel therapeutic interventions targeting the microenvironment/leukemia interaction focusing on SDF1/CXCR4, ILK/PI3K/Akt, TGF-beta, and Notch signaling. Gene transcriptional activity is regulated by chromatin modification and DNA methylation. Nuclear receptors such as RAR, RXR, and PPARgamma exert histone acetyl transferase activity (HAT). The transcription of target genes is initiated following the ligation of these receptors, recruitment of co-activators, and replacement of repressors. We demonstrated that histone acetylation by the PPARgamma agonist CDDO, RAR/RXR agonist ATRA, and/or histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) reversed the silenced RARbeta and MDR1 genes in acute promyelocytic leukemia, and that HDACI induced apoptosis with phagocytosis through the induction of Annexin A1 in AML1/ETO-positive acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) cells. The translation of research findings into effective clinical laboratory tests is an important approach. The flow cytometric technique is a powerful tool in the field of clinical laboratory medicine, with its accurate and rapid analysis. We carried out phospho-specific flow cytometry to investigate protein phosphorylation in AML cells and detect ZAP-70 in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells, including the evaluation of antibodies, staining epitopes, fixing and permeabilizing methods, and analyzing systems.

However, overlap-mutations between them or within the same class and the position of TP53 mutation are not fully analyzed. We comprehensively analyzed the FLT3, cKIT, N-RAS, C/EBPA, AML1, MLL, NPM1, and TP53 mutations in 144 newly diagnosed de novo AML. We found 103 of 165 identified mutations were overlapped with other mutations, and most overlap-mutations consisted of class I and class II mutations. Although overlap-mutations within the same class were found in seven patients, five of them additionally had the other class mutation. These results suggest that most overlap-mutations within the same class might be the consequence of acquiring an additional mutation after the completion both of class I and class II mutations. However, mutated genes overlapped with the same class were limited in N-RAS, TP53, MLL-PTD, and NPM1, suggesting the possibility that these irregular overlap-mutations might cooperatively participate in the development of AML. Notably, TP53 mutation was overlapped with both class I and class II mutations, and associated with morphologic multilineage dysplasia and complex karyotype. The genotype consisting of complex karyotype and TP53 mutation was an unfavorable prognostic factor in entire AML patients, indicating this genotype generates a disease entity in de novo AML.

The two patients who showed hematopoietic recovery were in first complete remission (CR1) compared to the other heavily pretreated patients. There were no toxic side effects linked to MSC infusion. One patient developed cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation 12 days following the MSC infusion and died from CMV disease.

The aim of the study was to asses mechanisms related to cellular drug resistance in imatinib-resistant derivates of chronic myeloid leukemia K-562 cell line. A parental K-562 and its imatinib-resistant derivate cell lines were used. Cell lines were tested for cytotoxicity of imatinib, cytarabine, busulfan and etoposide by the MTT assay. The cytotoxicity was expressed as IC50, inhibitory concentration for 50% of cells. Multidrug resistance proteins expression, rhodamine retention and daunorubicin accumulation were measured for each cell line. Continuous exposition of K-562 cell line to 0.01-0.02 mM imatinib resulted in development of resistance, while exposition to 0.1 microM imatinib increased cell sensitivity to this drug. There was a high correlation between PGP, MRP1 and LRP expression and IC50 values for imatinib and etoposide. All tested cell lines were highly resistant to cytarabine. Rhodamine retention alone and in the presence of cyclosporine was the lowest in imatinib-resistant K-562R-0.1 cell line, what suggest high PGP activity in this cell line. The highest daunorubicin accumulation was observed in parental K-562 cell line, while it was lower in imatinib-resistant cell lines. These data suggest that imatinib is a substrate for multidrug resistance proteins, and an increased expression of PGP, MRP1 and LRP play a role in resistance to imatinib in CML.

It was significantly less pathogenic than the parental cells. However, a highly pathogenic clone denoted B210cTK-/cl-2 was isolated from its population. As determined by Western blotting, these cells produced more p210 protein than the parental B210 cells. To successfully transfect these cells a modified electroporation method was introduced. Bicistronic plasmids carrying gene for herpes simplex thymidine kinase (HSV TK) and the gene for either granulocyte-monocyte colony stimulation factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-2 (IL-2) or interleukin 12 (IL-12) were used for the transfection experiments. Gradually, cell lines producing these cytokines were isolated in media supplemented with hypoxantin, aminopterin and thymidine (HAT).

We investigated the significance for differential diagnosis, treatment and outcome of musculoskeletal complaints as presenting symptoms of ALL, and their correlation with leukemia immunophenotypes, for which data is lacking. METHODS: Data on 783 children in the national study for childhood ALL between 1984 and 2003 were reviewed retrospectively. Statistical analysis examined possible relationships between MSM at the time of diagnosis and demographic and clinical data, biological features of leukemia (peripheral blood counts, immunophenotype and main cytogenetic aberration), response to initial prednisone treatment, and outcome. RESULTS: Of 765 children with data on orthopaedic complaints, 240 presented with MSM (31.4%). Among these children, B cell precursor (BCP) was much more common (209/576, 36.3%) than T cell ALL (25/176, 14.2%). Patients with MSM had lower white blood cell counts (WBC) (median of 9 vs. 20 x 10(9)/L, P < 0.001) and percentage of blast cells in the peripheral blood at diagnosis compared to those without (median of 27 vs. 53%, P < 0.001). Hepatomegaly and splenomegaly were less common in MSM group (67 vs. 53% <3 cm, P < 0.001, and 63 vs. 50% <3 cm, P < 0.001, respectively). Poor response to initial treatment with prednisone was recorded in 7.1% of patients with MSM versus 11.5% of those without (P = 0.086). The analysis revealed no independent effect of MSM on event-free survival (EFS), after correcting for differences in EFS related to immunophenotype or initial WBC. CONCLUSIONS: MSM occur mostly in children with BCP ALL who present with less involvement of extramedullary organs, low peripheral blood blasts and white blood cells counts. These findings highlight the importance of including ALL in the differential diagnosis of MSM even in the presence of an apparently normal peripheral blood count. Our study also suggests that MSM are caused by leukemic cells with enhanced biological propensity to remain relatively confined within the intramedullary bone-marrow space.","['Maman, Eran', 'Steinberg, David M', 'Stark, Batia', 'Izraeli, Shai', 'Wientroub, Shlomo']","['Maman E', 'Steinberg DM', 'Stark B', 'Izraeli S', 'Wientroub S']","[""Department of Pediatric Orthopaedics, Dana Children's Hospital, Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center and Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, 6 Weizmann Street, Tel Aviv, 62439, Israel, eemaman@gmail.com.""]",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20070223,England,J Child Orthop,Journal of children's orthopaedics,101313582,,,2007/03/01 00:00,2007/03/01 00:01,['2009/03/25 09:00'],"['2007/01/14 00:00 [received]', '2007/01/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2007/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11832-007-0013-9 [doi]'],ppublish,J Child Orthop. 2007 Mar;1(1):63-8. doi: 10.1007/s11832-007-0013-9.

CXCR4 is the most widely expressed chemokine receptor in many different types of cancer and has been linked to tumor dissemination and poor prognosis. Several CXCR4 antagonists have been synthesized. A totally novel approach to discover chemokine receptor antagonists is the use of bacteria. Bacteria produce chemokine receptor inhibitors to prevent neutrophil extravasation and migration toward the infection site to escape clearance by innate immune cells. The aim of the current study was to find and identify the mechanism of a bacterial protein that specifically targets CXCR4, a chemokine receptor shared by neutrophils and cancer cells. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Several staphylococcal proteins were screened for their capacity to prevent binding of a function-blocking antibody against CXCR4. RESULTS: Staphylococcal superantigen-like 10 was found to bind CXCR4 expressed on human T acute lymphoblastic leukemia, lymphoma, and cervical carcinoma cell lines. It potently inhibited CXCL12-induced calcium mobilization and cell migration. CONCLUSIONS: Staphylococcal superantigen-like 10 is a potential lead in the development of new anticancer compounds preventing metastasis by targeting CXCR4.","['Walenkamp, Annemiek M E', 'Boer, Ingrid G J', 'Bestebroer, Jovanka', 'Rozeveld, Dennie', 'Timmer-Bosscha, Hetty', 'Hemrika, Wieger', 'van Strijp, Jos A G', 'de Haas, Carla J C']","['Walenkamp AM', 'Boer IG', 'Bestebroer J', 'Rozeveld D', 'Timmer-Bosscha H', 'Hemrika W', 'van Strijp JA', 'de Haas CJ']","['Department of Medical Oncology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands. a.walenkamp@onco.umcg.nl']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Neoplasia,"Neoplasia (New York, N.Y.)",100886622,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/*drug effects', 'Chemokine CXCL12/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*immunology/metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, CXCR4/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Staphylococcus/*immunology', 'Superantigens/*pharmacology', 'Transfection']",2009/03/25 09:00,2009/05/13 09:00,['2009/03/25 09:00'],"['2008/11/28 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/10 00:00 [revised]', '2009/02/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/13 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1593/neo.81508 [doi]'],ppublish,Neoplasia. 2009 Apr;11(4):333-44. doi: 10.1593/neo.81508.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '0 (Superantigens)']",,,,PMC2657885,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To evaluate our progress in the diagnosis, treatment and outcome of this condition, we reviewed our experience of all patients > or =60 years of age diagnosed with acute leukemia over a 20-year period at Saint Paul's Hospital, a university-based hospital in Vancouver, Canada. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed of 103 patients > or =60 years of age diagnosed with acute leukemia (acute myeloid leukemia-81; acute lymphoid leukemia-15; acute leukemia not otherwise specified-7). RESULTS: Median age was 72 (range 60-88) years. Bone marrow aspirate yielded cytogenetic information on 57 patients and 18 (31.6%) had an unfavourable karyotype. Fifty-three (51%) patients received induction chemotherapy (treated) and 50 (49%) were palliated (untreated). Treated patients were younger [median 67 years (range 60-79)] than untreated patients [76 years (61-88)], (P < 0.0001). Of the treated patients, 33 (62%) achieved a complete remission. The median overall survival for the group was 104 (1-2689) days, and for treated versus untreated patients-219 (1-2689) and 39 (2-1229) days, respectively (P = 0.0021). Univariate variables predictive of prolonged survival included induction chemotherapy (P = 0.0027), de novo leukemia (P = 0.0420), and younger age, with a relative increase in death in older subgroups (60-69, 70-79, 80+), (P = 0.0311). Induction chemotherapy was the only predictor of prolonged survival in multivariate analysis (P = 0.0027). CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis of acute leukemia in older patients remains poor, and even though induction chemotherapy seem to prolong survival in patients able to receive treatment, most ultimately die of leukemia.","['Leger, Chantal S', 'Leitch, Heather A', 'Galbraith, Paul F', 'Li, Charles H', 'Vickars, Linda M']","['Leger CS', 'Leitch HA', 'Galbraith PF', 'Li CH', 'Vickars LM']","['Medicine, University of British Columbia, British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada. cleger@providencehematology.com']",,['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Am J Clin Oncol,American journal of clinical oncology,8207754,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",2009/03/25 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/03/25 09:00'],"['2009/03/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/COC.0b013e31818a6c93 [doi]', '00000421-200904000-00005 [pii]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Oncol. 2009 Apr;32(2):137-41. doi: 10.1097/COC.0b013e31818a6c93.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

KU812F cells, a human basophilic cell line isolated originally from chronic myelocytic leukemia, express a high affinity receptor of IgE, FcepsilonRI. Kaempferol was extracted and isolated from a methanolic extract of flavonoid-rich Nelumbo nucifera stamens. In the present study, the inhibitory effects of kaempferol on FcepsilonRI expression in human basophilic KU812F cells was examined. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that FcepsilonRI expression on the cell surface was suppressed in a concentration-dependent manner when the cells were cultured with kaempferol. Moreover, RTPCR analysis showed that the mRNA levels for FcepsilonRI alpha- and gamma-chains were reduced as the result of kaempferol treatment in a concentration-dependent manner. Kaempferol showed its suppressive effects on intracellular Ca2+ concentration and histamine release from anti-FcepsilonRI alpha- chain antibody-stimulated cells in a concentration-dependent manner. These observations indicate that kaempferol may exert antiallergic effect via downregulation of FcepsilonRI expression and degranulation.","['Shim, Sun-Yup', 'Choi, Jae-Sue', 'Byun, Dae-Seok']","['Shim SY', 'Choi JS', 'Byun DS']","['Institute of Marine Life Science, Pukyong National University, Busan 608-737, Korea.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Korea (South),J Microbiol Biotechnol,Journal of microbiology and biotechnology,9431852,IM,"['Basophils/*drug effects', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Gene Expression', 'Histamine Release/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Kaempferols/*pharmacology', 'Molecular Structure', 'Nelumbo/*chemistry', 'Plant Extracts/pharmacology', 'Receptors, IgE/*metabolism']",2009/03/25 09:00,2009/04/29 09:00,['2009/03/25 09:00'],"['2009/03/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/29 09:00 [medline]']","['8189 [pii]', '10.4014/jmb.0804.259 [doi]']",ppublish,J Microbiol Biotechnol. 2009 Feb;19(2):155-60. doi: 10.4014/jmb.0804.259.,"['0 (Kaempferols)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '731P2LE49E (kaempferol)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 11-aa targeting domain of the modified feline leukemia virus envelope consists of a constrained peptide. Critical to the binding of the constrained peptide envelope to its cellular receptor are a pair of internal cysteines and an essential Trp required for maintenance of titers >10(5) lacZ staining units per milliliter.

This work is a novel attempt to explore the cancer chemopreventive activity of different fractions of water-soluble polysaccharide extract derived from S. latifolium. Estimation of cancer chemopreventive activity, specifically anti-initiation, including the modulation of carcinogen metabolism and the antioxidant capacity, revealed that E1 and E4 were potent anti-initiators, where they lead not only to an inhibition in the carcinogen activator cytochrome P450 1A (IC50 2.54 and 10.30 microg/ml, respectively), but also to an induction in the carcinogen detoxification enzymes glutathione-S-transferases (144% and 225% of the control, respectively). E1 and E4 inhibited 59% and 63% of the induced-DNA damage, as measured by comet assay. Similarly both E1 and E4 possessed potential anti-promoting properties as indicated by their anti-inflammatory activity. E1 and E4 enhanced the macrophage proliferation; however they dramatically inhibited the stimulated NO (30.7% and 59.3%), TNF-alpha (38.2% and 54.9) and COX-2 (20% and 18%), respectively. E3 showed a selective cytotoxicity against lymphoblastic leukemia (1301 cells), while other fraction extracts had no cytotoxic effect against all tested cell lines. E3 led to a major disturbance in cell cycle including arrest in both S-phases in 1301 cells. This disturbance was associated with an induced-cell death due to apoptosis, but not necrosis. In conclusion, E1 and E4 are promising cancer chemopreventive fractions, since they had tumor anti- initiating activity via their protective modulation of carcinogen metabolism, and tumor anti-promoting activity via their anti-inflammatory activity, while E3 can be considered as a promising anti-cancer agent against leukemia.","['Gamal-Eldeen, Amira M', 'Ahmed, Eman F', 'Abo-Zeid, Mona A']","['Gamal-Eldeen AM', 'Ahmed EF', 'Abo-Zeid MA']","['Cancer Biology Laboratory, Center of Excellency for Advanced Sciences, National Research Centre, Dokki 12622, Cairo, Egypt. aeldeen@hotmail.com']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090321,England,Food Chem Toxicol,Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association,8207483,IM,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/pharmacology', '*Anticarcinogenic Agents', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Comet Assay', 'Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1/metabolism', 'Glutathione Transferase/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Neoplasms/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Nitric Oxide/metabolism', 'Polysaccharides/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Sargassum/*chemistry', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",2009/03/25 09:00,2009/07/17 09:00,['2009/03/25 09:00'],"['2008/11/28 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/14 00:00 [revised]', '2009/03/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/17 09:00 [medline]']","['S0278-6915(09)00121-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.fct.2009.03.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Food Chem Toxicol. 2009 Jun;47(6):1378-84. doi: 10.1016/j.fct.2009.03.016.

Leukemic cells are transformed, immortalized, actively proliferating cells that are still able to differentiate into cells resembling mature blood cells. Future therapies of leukemias require identification of molecular targets involved in hematopoiesis under normal and leukemic conditions and detailed understanding of the interactions between normal hematopoietic and leukemic cells within the bone marrow micro-environment. This review presents the basic aspects of hematopoiesis and highlights multilevel exploitable targets for leukemia therapy. These include HSC niche components, signaling pathways (SCF/c-kit-R, EPO-R-JAK2/STAT, Wnt, Notch, HOX), inducer-receptor interactions, superfine chromatin structure modifications, fused transcription factors, microRNAs and signaling of cell death through the Bcl-2 apoptotic switch (BH3-only proteins). The classes of therapeutics developed or being under development to eradicate human leukemias include novel antimetabolites, DNA hypomethylating agents, histone deacetylation inhibitors (HDACIs), retinoids and other inducers of differentiation, targeted monoclonal antibodies raised against cell surface proteins, pro-apoptotic receptor agonists (PARAs), BH3 peptidomimetics, cell cycle inhibitors, siRNAs and perhaps microRNAs. Some of these agents induce terminal differentiation while others promote cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in leukemia cells. At last but not least, this article describes the mechanisms of removal of damaged/harmful cells from organs since impairment in clearance of such cells can lead to autoimmune disorders by self-antigens.","['Tsiftsoglou, Asterios S', 'Bonovolias, Ioannis D', 'Tsiftsoglou, Stefanos A']","['Tsiftsoglou AS', 'Bonovolias ID', 'Tsiftsoglou SA']","['Laboratory of Pharmacology, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki , GR-54124, Thessaloniki, Greece. tsif@pharm.auth.gr']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20090321,England,Pharmacol Ther,Pharmacology & therapeutics,7905840,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects/physiology', 'Drug Delivery Systems/*methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology']",2009/03/25 09:00,2010/03/02 06:00,['2009/03/25 09:00'],"['2008/12/05 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S0163-7258(09)00040-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.pharmthera.2009.03.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Pharmacol Ther. 2009 Jun;122(3):264-80. doi: 10.1016/j.pharmthera.2009.03.001.

MLL has been shown to be overexpressed in cases with 11q amplification. However, in most of the cases, the amplified region is not restricted to the MLL locus. In this study, we investigated 19 patients with AML/MDS and MLL gain/amplification. By means of array CGH performed in 12 patients, we were able to delineate the minimal deleted regions within 5q and 17p and identified three independent regions 11q/I-III that were amplified in all cases. Gene expression profiles established in 15 cases were used to identify candidate genes within these regions. Notably, analysis of our data suggests a correlation of loss of 5q and 17p and expression of genes present in 11q23-25.

Standard-dose imatinib (400 mg/day in chronic phase, 600 mg/day in advanced CML) now dominates the management of this disease, producing considerably higher hematologic, cytogenetic, and molecular response rates than seen with previous drug therapies. However, although many patients respond well to standard-dose imatinib initially, some patients do not achieve adequate levels of response or discontinue therapy because of resistance. One approach to improving treatment response with first-line imatinib may be to increase the imatinib dose (800 mg/day), although recent trial data indicate that overall increases in response rates may be modest. Newer Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitors can induce responses in patients with all phases of imatinib-resistant CML, even those with imatinib-resistant mutations in the BCR-ABL gene. Furthermore, in initial studies, first-line dasatinib or nilotinib treatment has produced response rates that compare favorably with historical controls treated with imatinib, although confirmation is required from head-to-head clinical trials. Future clinical approaches may include drug combinations, which may allow quiescent leukemia stem cells to be eradicated.

Notably, about half of the known miRNAs are intragenic and frequently coexpressed with their host genes. To date there is little evidence concerning miRNA expression in multiple myeloma (MM). In an attempt to provide insights into miRNA deregulation in MM, we profiled global miRNA expression in a panel of molecularly well-characterized human myeloma cell lines (HMCLs) using high-resolution microarrays, and then used integrative analyses to identify altered patterns correlated with DNA copy number (CN) or gene expression profiles. We identified 16 miRNAs mapped to chromosomal regions frequently involved in numerical imbalances in MM, whose expression significantly correlated with the CN of the corresponding miRNA genes; among these, miR-22 expression was also affected by chromosome arm 17p loss in a representative panel of primary MM tumors. The expression of 32 intronic miRNAs significantly correlated with that of their host transcripts, some of which were highly deregulated in MM patients. The expression of some of the miRNAs was validated by quantitative RT-PCR. Finally, a number of the identified miRNAs have previously been reported to play important roles in tumorigenesis. Overall, our data highlight that genomic alterations may significantly affect miRNA expression in HMCLs and demonstrate a frequent coexpression of intronic miRNAs with their host genes that may have a pathogenetic relevance in plasma cell transformation.","['Lionetti, Marta', 'Agnelli, Luca', 'Mosca, Laura', 'Fabris, Sonia', 'Andronache, Adrian', 'Todoerti, Katia', 'Ronchetti, Domenica', 'Deliliers, Giorgio Lambertenghi', 'Neri, Antonino']","['Lionetti M', 'Agnelli L', 'Mosca L', 'Fabris S', 'Andronache A', 'Todoerti K', 'Ronchetti D', 'Deliliers GL', 'Neri A']","['Department of Medical Sciences, Leukemia Study Centre, University of Milan, Hematology 1-CTMO, Foundation IRCCS Policlinico, Milan, Italy.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Allelic Imbalance', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Female', 'Gene Dosage', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Linear Models', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*genetics/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Statistics, Nonparametric']",2009/03/24 09:00,2009/04/29 09:00,['2009/03/24 09:00'],"['2009/03/24 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/29 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/gcc.20660 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2009 Jun;48(6):521-31. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20660.,['0 (MicroRNAs)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The clinical course of T-LGL leukemia is generally indolent, with lymphocytosis and splenomegaly in 20-50% patients, hepatomegaly in 5-20% of patients, and less commonly, lymphadenopathy. T-LGL leukemia is associated with immunological abnormalities: rheumatoid factor with or without rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Coombs positive hemolytic anemia, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), pure red cell aplasia (PRCA), positive anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), hypogammaglobulinemia, and polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia. Aim To compare clinical and laboratory features of T-LGL leukemia patients and their responses to different chemotherapy regimens. METHODS: Six patients (3 males and 3 females) with T-LGL leukemia were analyzed. The diagnosis was based on accepted morphologic criteria, immunophenotype, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection of T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements. RESULTS: All patients exhibited lymphocytosis, mainly with unusual morphologies, splenomegaly, and elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Three patients were treated with a Fludarabine-Cyclophosphamide (FC) combination as initial therapy while three patients received CHOP. Two patients received more than one treatment regimen. One patient died due to T-LGL leukemia in first year after diagnosis, one patient died 4 years after diagnosis, two patients interrupted their treatment, and two patients are still alive.

This methodology is based on spectral measurements of major cellular biochemical constituents and multivariate spectral processing. Major spectral differences were observed in the 1800-900 cm(-1) 'fingerprint' spectral region. Bands in the averaged spectra for each cell line were assigned to major biochemical constituents including: proteins, lipids, carbohydrates and nucleic acids. Multivariate statistical analysis of the spectra was carried out to develop a classification model to discriminate the five cell types. The results show that FT-IR spectroscopy displays high sensitivity and specificity when discriminating between T-cell lymphoma, B-cell lymphoid, and myeloid leukaemia cells based on intrinsic biomolecular signatures. FT-IR spectroscopy in combination with multivariate statistical analysis provides an important insight into T-cell lymphoma, B-cell lymphoid, and myeloid leukaemia cell line identification.

Both transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms account for the constitutive expression of the protein, and the PI3K/Akt pathway is essential for this process. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of CDC25 dramatically inhibits the proliferation of NPM/ALK-expressing cells, while moderately affecting the proliferation of control Ba/F3 cells. RNA interference-mediated downregulation of CDC25A confirmed that NPM/ALK-expressing cells are highly dependent on this protein for their proliferation. Moreover, similar PI3K/AKt-mediated constitutive expression of CDC25A takes place down-stream of other hematological oncogenes, including BCR/ABL in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia and FLT3-ITD in Acute Myeloid Leukemia. Altogether, our data point to the functional link between hematopoietic oncogenic tyrosine kinases and the G(1) cell cycle regulator CDC25A, and we propose that this protein may be a potential therapeutic target in ALCL and other hematological malignancies.","['Fernandez-Vidal, Anne', 'Mazars, Anne', 'Gautier, Emilie-Fleur', 'Prevost, Gregoire', 'Payrastre, Bernard', 'Manenti, Stephane']","['Fernandez-Vidal A', 'Mazars A', 'Gautier EF', 'Prevost G', 'Payrastre B', 'Manenti S']","['INSERM U563-IFR30, Centre de Physiopathologie de Toulouse-Purpan, Departement Oncogenese, signalisation et innovation therapeutique, Universite Paul Sabatier, Toulouse, France.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090526,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,IM,"['Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Large-Cell, Anaplastic/*enzymology/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/metabolism', '*Oncogenes', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Signal Transduction', '*Up-Regulation', 'cdc25 Phosphatases/*metabolism']",2009/03/24 09:00,2009/06/06 09:00,['2009/03/24 09:00'],"['2009/03/24 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/06 09:00 [medline]']","['8302 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.8.9.8302 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2009 May 1;8(9):1373-9. doi: 10.4161/cc.8.9.8302.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The investigated group consisted of: I. 16 patients after auto-HSCT (6 girls, 10 boys) aged 3-20 years (average 10,8+/-) because of acute myelogenous leukaemia (n=5), non Hodgkin lymphoma (n=3), neuroblastoma (n=3), embryonal cancer (n=2), medulloblastoma (n=1), Ewing's sarcoma/PNET (n=1), hyper eosinophilic syndrome (n=1). High dose chemiotherapy (HDC/T) included: BU/MEL (busulfan/melfalan) (n=7), BEAM (carmustine, eteposide, cytosine arabinose, melfalan) (n=3). II. 30 patients after allo-HSCT (20 girls, 10 boys) aged 3-17 years (average 9,56). Indication for HSCT was acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (n=11), acute myelogenous leukaemia (n=5), chronic myeloid leukaemia-CML (n=6), myelodysplastic syndromes (n=2), non Hodgkin lymphoma (n=1), juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (n=1), severe aplastic anaemia (n=1), Blackfan-Diamond anaemia (n=1), severe combined immune deficiency (n=1), rhabdomyosarcoma (n=1). The patients underwent the following types of transplantation: HSCT of matched sibling donor (n=13), HSCT of matched unrelated donor (n=11) and HLA-mismatched related donor (n=6). The preparative regimens consisted of HDC/T usually BU/MEL (n=3); BU/CY/VP (busulfan, cyclophosphamide, etoposide) (6); BU/CY/ATG (anti-thymocyte globulin) (n=5), VP/ATG/TBI (total body irradiation) (n=3). 19 children received CI (cranial irradiation) prior to grafting: auto-HSCT (n=6) and allo-HSCT (n=13) and 6 patients underwent TBI. 18 children received high steroid doses at least 28 days before transplant, 4 patients in the auto-HSCT group, and in the allo-HSCT group 14 patients before and 20 after HSCT procedure. The analysis of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free triiodothyronine (fT3), free thyroxine (fT4), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), prolactine (PRL), oral glucose tolerance test, growth hormone (GH test) and thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) test was performed in each case. RESULTS: Hypothyroidism was found in 5 patients (3 after allo-HSCT, 2 after auto-HSCT). Thyroid hormone substitution was applied. No case of hyperthyroidism was diagnosed. Growth deficit was found in 8 patients (6 girls, 2 boys) between 13 to 70 months after allo-transplantation (average 36 months). Three children from the above group received CI. Growth hormone substitution was applied in 1 girl (ALL, HLA MM REL, CI). An impaired excretion of GH after stimulation was diagnosed in 14 pts (10 after allo-HSCT, 4 after auto-HSCT). The growth process should still be observed in this subgroup. Glucose intolerance was found in 7 patients: in 4 treated with auto-HSCT and in 3 after allo-HSCT. Diabetes mellitus was diagnosed in none of them. An impaired glucose tolerance curve with increased excretion of insulin was diagnosed in 12 children. CONCLUSIONS: Early endocrinological care is necessary in patients treated both with auto-HSCT and allo-HSCT due to high risk of hormonal disorders.","['Niedzielska, Ewa', 'Wojcik, Dorota', 'Barg, Ewa', 'Pietras, Wojciech', 'Sega-Pondel, Dorota', 'Doroszko, Adrian', 'Niedzielska, Malgorzata', 'Skarzynska, Malgorzata', 'Chybicka, Alicja']","['Niedzielska E', 'Wojcik D', 'Barg E', 'Pietras W', 'Sega-Pondel D', 'Doroszko A', 'Niedzielska M', 'Skarzynska M', 'Chybicka A']","['Katedra i Klinika Transplantacji Szpiku, Onkologii i Hematologii Dzieciecej, ul.

We evaluated the prevalence and prognostic significance of CEBPA mutations in 847 children with AML treated on 3 consecutive pediatric trials. Two types of CEBPA mutations-N-terminal truncating mutations and in-frame bZip-domain mutations-were detected in 38 (4.5%) of 847 patients tested; 31 (82%) of 38 patients with mutations harbored both mutation types. Mutation status was correlated with laboratory and clinical characteristics and clinical outcome. CEBPA mutations were significantly more common in older patients, patients with FAB M1 or M2, and patients with normal karyotype. Mutations did not occur in patients with either favorable or unfavorable cytogenetics. Actuarial event-free survival at 5 years was 70% versus 38% (P = .015) with a cumulative incidence of relapse from complete remission of 13% versus 44% (P = .007) for those with and without CEBPA mutations. The presence of CEBPA mutations was an independent prognostic factor for improved outcome (HR = 0.24, P = .047). As CEBPA mutations are associated with lower relapse rate and improved survival, CEBPA mutation analysis needs to be incorporated into initial screening for risk identification and therapy allocation at diagnosis.","['Ho, Phoenix A', 'Alonzo, Todd A', 'Gerbing, Robert B', 'Pollard, Jessica', 'Stirewalt, Derek L', 'Hurwitz, Craig', 'Heerema, Nyla A', 'Hirsch, Betsy', 'Raimondi, Susana C', 'Lange, Beverly', 'Franklin, Janet L', 'Radich, Jerald P', 'Meshinchi, Soheil']","['Ho PA', 'Alonzo TA', 'Gerbing RB', 'Pollard J', 'Stirewalt DL', 'Hurwitz C', 'Heerema NA', 'Hirsch B', 'Raimondi SC', 'Lange B', 'Franklin JL', 'Radich JP', 'Meshinchi S']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, 1100 Fairview Ave N., Seattle, WA 98109, USA. pho@fhcrc.org']",,['eng'],"['T32 CA009351/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA10262-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA114563-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA114563/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA98543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090320,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/statistics & numerical data', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Prevalence', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2009/03/24 09:00,2009/08/29 09:00,['2009/03/24 09:00'],"['2009/03/24 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/29 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)37216-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-10-184747 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Jun 25;113(26):6558-66. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-10-184747.

METHODS: From January 2001 to May 2008, 59 patients (median age of 32 years ranging from 3 to 69 years) with the diagnosis of BCR/ABL360888725-ALL by fluorescence in situ hybridization received induction chemotherapy with VDLP-/+Ara-C regimen. The patients who failed to respond to the chemotherapy received subsequent consolidation chemotherapy with imatinib (400-800 mg/day) (17 cases) or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) (16 cases). RESULTS: Of the 59 patients, 32 (58.3%) achieved complete remission (CR) after the first induction cycle. In patients with peripheral white blood cell (WBC) count <30=10(9)/L, 30-99.9(9)/L and > or =100(9)/L, the CR rates were 75.0% (18/24), 56.3% (9/15) and 26.3% (5/19) (P=0.006), and the overall survival probability of 2 years ( OSs of 2-yrs) was 24.7%, 22.5% and 21.1%, respectively (P=0.180). According to the FAB classification, 56 cases were divided into L1, L2 and biphenotypic acute leukemia (BAL) subgroups, and their CR rates were 66.7% (6/9), 63.2% (24/38) and 22.2% (2/9) (P=0.029), with OSs of 2-yrs of 22.2%, 27.0% and 22.0%, respectively (P=0.623). In terms of immunophenotype grouping by EGIL, the patients with ALL, myeloid antigen-positive ALL and BAL had CR rates of 61.1% (11/18), 60.6% (20/33) and 12.5% (1/8) (P=0.039), and the OSs of 2-yrs of 22.7%, 21.0% and 18.8%, respectively (P=0.643). In 55 patients with known karyotype, the CR rates were 71.4%(5/7), 70.8% (17/24) and 37.5% (9/24) in normal, sole t(9;22) abnormality, t(9;22) with additional abnormalities groups (P=0.046), with the OSs of 2-yrs of 42.9%, 34.0% and 7.3%, respectively (P=0.000). The patients complicated by septicemia had significantly lower OSs of 2-yrs than those without septicemia (0% vs 38.8%, P=0.005). The OSs of 2-yrs were significantly higher in patients with consolidation chemotherapy with imatinib than those without (48.0% vs 11.2%, P=0.001), and allo-HSCT was associated with significantly higher OSs of 2-yrs than exclusive chemotherapy (54.2% and 8.5%, P=0.000).

METHODS: HL-60/HT cells were derived from HL-60 cells induced by harringtonine (HT) in gradient concentrations. The inhibitory effect of valproic acid on the proliferation of HL-60 and HL-60/HT cells was evaluated by MTT assay, and the P27(Kip1) expression, P170 expression and cell cycle of the cells were analyzed with flow cytometry. RESULTS: The multidrug-resistant HL-60/HT was acquired, which showed a stable drug-resistant index with increased IC(50) of HT, VCR, DNR and Ara-c by 9.30, 5.20, 4.91 and 3.65 folds, respectively, as compared with those of HL60 cells. The expression of P27(Kip1) in HL-60/HT cells was significantly lower but P170 expression significantly higher than that of HL-60 cells and normal mononuclear cells (P<0.05). The expressions of P27(Kip1) and P170 showed no significant difference between normal mononuclear cells and HL-60 cells. The growth inhibition rate of VPA combined with Ara-C was significantly higher than that of valproic acid or Ara-C alone in HL-60/HT cells and HL-60 cells (q=1.37 and 1.51, respectively). HL-60/HT and HL-60 cells cultured in the presence of VPA resulted in a significant increase in the expression of P27(Kip1) and the G(1)-phase cells (P<0.05), but the expression of P170 underwent no significant changes (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: HL-60/HT cells have lower P27(Kip1) expression compared with HL-60 cells. Valproic acid can inhibit the growth of HL-60/HT cells and enhance their Ara-C sensitivity possibly by increasing P27(Kip1) expression and causing cell cycle arrest in G(1) phase.","['Li, Yi-Qing', 'Yin, Song-Mei', 'Xie, Shuang-Feng', 'Ma, Li-Ping', 'Nie, Da-Nian', 'Wang, Xiu-Ju', 'Wu, Yu-Dan']","['Li YQ', 'Yin SM', 'Xie SF', 'Ma LP', 'Nie DN', 'Wang XJ', 'Wu YD']","['Department of Hematology, Second Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China. sumliyiqing@163.com']",,['chi'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao,Nan fang yi ke da xue xue bao = Journal of Southern Medical University,101266132,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Glycoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Valproic Acid/*pharmacology']",2009/03/24 09:00,2010/05/05 06:00,['2009/03/24 09:00'],"['2009/03/24 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/05 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao. 2009 Mar;29(3):423-7.,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CDKN1B protein, human)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', '614OI1Z5WI (Valproic Acid)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Biclustering in microarray data is an important technique that discovers a group of genes that are coregulated in a subset of conditions. Biclustering algorithms require to identify coherent and nontrivial biclusters, i.e., the biclusters should have low mean squared residue and high row variance. A multiobjective genetic biclustering technique is proposed here that optimizes these objectives simultaneously. A novel encoding scheme that uses variable chromosome length is developed. Moreover, a new quantitative measure to evaluate the goodness of the biclusters is proposed.

Inhibition of NF-kappaB activity significantly reduced proliferation and invasion of Hep3B cells as well as down-regulated the expression of invasion-related molecules including matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9, membrane type-1 MMP (MT1-MMP), urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Hep3B cells exhibited a dose-dependent increase in apoptosis after receiving sorafenib treatment. Inhibition of NF-kappaB activity strongly sensitized Hep3B cells to sorafenib-induced cell death. Mechanistically, combined treatment of sorafenib and NF-kappaB inhibition enhanced inhibition of MAPK signaling and down-regulation of anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 expression. These observations indicate that inhibition of NF-kappaB may be a potential antineoplastic therapy for HCC, especially the combination of NF-kappaB inhibition and sorafenib provides a novel therapeutic strategy for patients with advanced-stage HCC.","['Wu, Jian-Min', 'Sheng, Hongmiao', 'Saxena, Romil', 'Skill, Nicholas James', 'Bhat-Nakshatri, Poornima', 'Yu, Menggang', 'Nakshatri, Harikrishna', 'Maluccio, Mary A']","['Wu JM', 'Sheng H', 'Saxena R', 'Skill NJ', 'Bhat-Nakshatri P', 'Yu M', 'Nakshatri H', 'Maluccio MA']","['Department of Surgery, Indiana University School of Medicine, 1001 W. 10th St., OPW Rm 324A, Indianapolis, IN 46202, United States.

In these patients, OCN levels were low at diagnosis but they increased throughout the IM treatment, approaching normal levels at 24 months of IM therapy. In summary, our data show that IM increases mRNA expression of osteogenic markers in hBM-MSCs and increases the OPG/RANKL ratio and the OCN levels both in surnatant of hBM-MSCs cultured with IM and in serum of patients treated with IM, thus indicating that IM potentially favors osteoblastogenesis.","['Tibullo, Daniele', 'Giallongo, Cesarina', 'La Cava, Piera', 'Berretta, Salvatore', 'Stagno, Fabio', 'Chiarenza, Annalisa', 'Conticello, Concetta', 'Palumbo, Giuseppe A', 'Di Raimondo, Francesco']","['Tibullo D', 'Giallongo C', 'La Cava P', 'Berretta S', 'Stagno F', 'Chiarenza A', 'Conticello C', 'Palumbo GA', 'Di Raimondo F']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences, Division of Hematology, University of Catania, Ospedale Ferrarotto, Catania, Italy.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Benzamides', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/*drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Osteoblasts/*cytology/*drug effects', 'Osteogenesis/*drug effects', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Reference Standards', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2009/03/24 09:00,2009/04/10 09:00,['2009/03/24 09:00'],"['2008/09/08 00:00 [received]', '2008/11/24 00:00 [revised]', '2008/12/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/24 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/10 09:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(09)00007-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2008.12.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2009 Apr;37(4):461-8. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2008.12.008.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effectiveness of inhibiting two such pathways, the phosphatidylinosityl-3-kinase pathway via the intermediate integrin-linked kinase (ILK), and FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT-3) signaling pathway in killing AML cells was studied. MATERIALS AND METHODS: AML colony-forming cell (CFC) assays were used to determine the effects of a small molecule inhibitor of both ILK and FLT-3 (QLT0267) on poor prognosis primary AML sample viability. Kinase assays and Western blots were used to analyze effects of the compound on target molecules. RESULTS: In 31/36 AML blast samples p-Akt was detected indicating phosphatidylinosityl-3-kinase activation. ILK was ubiquitously and FLT-3 abundantly expressed. Downregulation of ILK in the AML cell line TF-1 using small interfering RNA caused >or= 50% CFC death, suggesting ILK inhibition might also be toxic to primary AML cells. In vitro kinase assays on three AML samples showed inhibition of both ILK and FLT-3 by QLT0267. Treatment of AML patient blast cells (n=27) with QLT0267, caused a dose- and time-dependent downregulation of p-Akt and kill of AML-CFC with AML samples containing FLT-3 mutations being more sensitive to QLT0267 than those without. AML samples were more sensitive to QLT0267 killing than normal bone marrow (IC(50)=3 microM, vs 10 microM for AML-CFC and normal CFC, respectively, n=5). CONCLUSION: Combined inhibition of ILK and FLT-3 with a small molecule kinase inhibitor can achieve selective targeting of AML rather than normal hematopoietic progenitors.","['Muranyi, Andrew L', 'Dedhar, Shoukat', 'Hogge, Donna E']","['Muranyi AL', 'Dedhar S', 'Hogge DE']","['British Columbia Cancer Research Centre, Vancouver, Canada.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow Cells/enzymology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/enzymology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/*drug effects', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors']",2009/03/24 09:00,2009/04/10 09:00,['2009/03/24 09:00'],"['2008/09/19 00:00 [received]', '2008/12/04 00:00 [revised]', '2009/01/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/24 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/10 09:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(09)00004-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2009.01.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2009 Apr;37(4):450-60. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2009.01.002.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (integrin-linked kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Gata1.05 gene knockdown mice, Gata1 expression deteriorates to 5% of wild-type allelic expression, a level insufficient for supporting normal erythropoiesis and one that leads to accumulation of erythroid progenitors that are readily transformed into erythroblastic leukemia. Serial engraftment of leukemic cells into primary or subsequent nude mice reconstituted complete leukemic phenotype in recipient. To delineate characteristics of leukemic stem cells (LSCs), we analyzed LSCs of Gata1.05 leukemia, which have a potential to reestablish leukemia in mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Leukemic cells isolated from the first recipient mice of Gata1.05 leukemia cells were divided into two fractions using Hoechst dye. Fractionated cells were transplanted into second recipient, or analyzed gene expression profiles and cell-cycle status. Consequences of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment on leukemic cells in vivo were studied. RESULTS: LSCs were enriched in the Hoechst dye-excluded side population (SP), and leukemic cells in the SP population (LSP cells) were morphologically and immunophenotypically indistinguishable from other leukemic cells. However, expression of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-related genes was upregulated in the LSP cells. In cell-cycle analyses, LSP cells were quiescent like HSCs, but reentry into the cell cycle was stimulated by 5-FU treatment. Nonetheless, 5-FU treatment established a point of newly adjusted equilibrium in the LSP cells and the cells never recovered to their previous quiescent state. CONCLUSION: Based on this observation, distinct self-renewal regulatory mechanisms in LSCs may be considered as one of the causes of worsening of the features of leukemia after injury and relapse.","['Abe, Kanako', 'Shimizu, Ritsuko', 'Pan, Xiaoqing', 'Hamada, Hiromi', 'Yoshikawa, Hiroyuki', 'Yamamoto, Masayuki']","['Abe K', 'Shimizu R', 'Pan X', 'Hamada H', 'Yoshikawa H', 'Yamamoto M']","['Graduate School of Comprehensive Human Sciences and Center for Tsukuba Advanced Research Alliance, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorouracil/*pharmacology', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Nude', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Up-Regulation']",2009/03/24 09:00,2009/04/10 09:00,['2009/03/24 09:00'],"['2008/10/04 00:00 [received]', '2008/11/25 00:00 [revised]', '2008/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/24 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/10 09:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(08)00577-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2008.12.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2009 Apr;37(4):435-445.e1. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2008.12.004.,"['0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Gata1 protein, mouse)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our study is designed to further elucidate the role of Nm23-H1 in the human chronic myeloid leukemia K562 cell line. MAIN METHODS: In this study we generated and selected two cell clone pools of human chronic myeloid leukemia K562 cells with up-regulated and down-regulated Nm23-H1 expression. KEY FINDINGS: Our data show that knockdown of Nm23-H1 decreased proliferation and increased the percentage of cells arrested in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. Correspondingly, K562 cells overexpressing Nm23-H1 were more proliferative. After treatment of these two cell types with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) for 48 h, cells with reduced Nm23-H1 expression had a higher percentage of 8N ploidy and higher expression of CD41 than K562 cells overexpressing Nm23-H1. A functional proteomics analysis identified ten proteins, including ANP32A, Cdc42GAP, and the isoform 2 of SET, whose expression levels were significantly altered by down-regulation of Nm23-H1. In addition, cells with decreased levels of Nm23-H1 had significantly reduced expression of Cdc42 independent of treatment with PMA. The interaction of the endogenous Nm23-H1 and Cdc42 proteins has been further validated by reciprocal immunoprecipitations. SIGNIFICANCE: We provide data that complement functional studies of Nm23-H1 in regulating hematopoietic cells, and address action mechanisms of Nm23-H1 that have not previously been reported.","['Jin, Lin', 'Liu, Ge', 'Zhang, Chuan-hai', 'Lu, Chun-hua', 'Xiong, Sheng', 'Zhang, Mei-ying', 'Liu, Qiu-Ying', 'Ge, Feng', 'He, Qing-Yu', 'Kitazato, Kaio', 'Kobayashi, Nobuyuki', 'Wang, Yi-Fei']","['Jin L', 'Liu G', 'Zhang CH', 'Lu CH', 'Xiong S', 'Zhang MY', 'Liu QY', 'Ge F', 'He QY', 'Kitazato K', 'Kobayashi N', 'Wang YF']","['The Institute of Pharmacology Science, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632 China.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090202,Netherlands,Life Sci,Life sciences,0375521,IM,"['*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', '*Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'NM23 Nucleoside Diphosphate Kinases/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoprotein IIb/biosynthesis', '*Proteomics/methods', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Up-Regulation', 'cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein/biosynthesis']",2009/03/24 09:00,2009/05/23 09:00,['2009/03/24 09:00'],"['2008/08/26 00:00 [received]', '2009/01/05 00:00 [revised]', '2009/01/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/24 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/23 09:00 [medline]']","['S0024-3205(09)00037-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.lfs.2009.01.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Life Sci. 2009 Mar 27;84(13-14):458-67. doi: 10.1016/j.lfs.2009.01.010.

MAIN METHODS: Flow cytometry was used to determine cell cycle changes in HL-60 cells following treatment (1.0 muM) with natural and synthetic retinoids (ATRA, RII and R9158), and cDNA microarrays were used to monitor the gene expression profiles of HL-60 cells treated with the various retinoids. KEY FINDINGS: Consistent with retinoid-induced cell differentiation, treatment with these three retinoids correlated with an increase in the percentage of cells arrested in the G1/G0 phase of the cell cycle. Microarray analysis showed upregulation of known differentiation genes, adhesion molecules, and the oxidase activation pathway following retinoid treatment. Differential expression of several genes was observed in HL-60 cells treated with the three retinoids. For example, tissue remodeling protein genes, ubiquitin genes, and signal transduction genes were highly expressed in ATRA- and R9158-treated HL-60 cells, but remained unchanged in HL-60 cells treated with RII. SIGNIFICANCE: The above findings suggest that the differentiation of HL-60 cells induced by the three retinoids occurs through similar pathways, and that there exists a structure-function relationship regarding retinoids and the induction of cell differentiation and cytotoxicity.","['Wang, Jin', 'Fong, Chi-Chun', 'Tzang, Chi-Hung', 'Xiao, Peigen', 'Han, Rui', 'Yang, Mengsu']","['Wang J', 'Fong CC', 'Tzang CH', 'Xiao P', 'Han R', 'Yang M']","['Department of Biology and Chemistry, and Applied Research Centre for Genomics Technology, City University of Hong Kong, 83 Tat Chee Avenue, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090211,Netherlands,Life Sci,Life sciences,0375521,IM,"['Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Retinoids/*pharmacology']",2009/03/24 09:00,2009/05/05 09:00,['2009/03/24 09:00'],"['2008/06/20 00:00 [received]', '2009/01/02 00:00 [revised]', '2009/02/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/24 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/05 09:00 [medline]']","['S0024-3205(09)00062-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.lfs.2009.02.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Life Sci. 2009 Apr 24;84(17-18):576-83. doi: 10.1016/j.lfs.2009.02.001.

In this long-term study, we identified factors influencing patient outcomes in 73 patients with HCL. Median age at diagnosis was 53 yr and the gender ratio (M/F) was 2.3. At the time of HCL diagnosis, 60 patients (82%) were symptomatic and 22 of these had an infection. After a median follow-up of 13 yr, eight patients had died of secondary cancer (n = 2), HCL progression (n = 1) and age-related complications (n = 5). The 10-yr overall survival (OS), progression-free survival and relapse rates were 91 +/- 3%, 14 +/- 5% and 87 +/- 5%, respectively. In multivariate analyses, age >53 yr was the only factor adversely influencing OS and secondary cancer incidence, with adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 9.30 (95%CI, 1.15-76.6; P = 0.037) and 2.80 (95%CI, 1.05-7.71; P = 0.04), respectively. Eleven patients developed severe infections. Absolute lymphocyte count (<1 x 10(9)/L) at diagnosis was the only factor influencing the occurrence of severe infections, with an adjusted HR of 4.01 (P = 0.007). Strikingly, we did not observe any significant correlation between neutrophil or monocyte counts and the incidence of infection. We confirmed long-term survival in HCL but found a high incidence of infection - even late in the course of the disease. The absolute lymphocyte count at diagnosis is a risk factor for the occurrence of severe infections. In addition to careful monitoring of infections, prompt initiation of anti-HCL treatment should be considered in patients with low lymphocyte counts.","['Damaj, Ghandi', 'Kuhnowski, Frederique', 'Marolleau, Jean-Pierre', 'Bauters, Francis', 'Leleu, Xavier', 'Yakoub-Agha, Ibrahim']","['Damaj G', 'Kuhnowski F', 'Marolleau JP', 'Bauters F', 'Leleu X', 'Yakoub-Agha I']","['Hematology, Amiens University Medical Center, Amiens, France.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090319,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infections/*complications/diagnosis/*physiopathology', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*complications/diagnosis/*physiopathology', 'Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/cytology', 'Neutrophils/cytology', 'Nucleosides/chemistry', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/03/24 09:00,2009/09/03 06:00,['2009/03/24 09:00'],"['2009/03/24 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/03 06:00 [medline]']","['EJH1259 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2009.01259.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2009 Sep;83(3):246-50. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2009.01259.x.

No data are available on VEGF kinetics in haematological patients with neutropenic fever. METHODS: Forty-two haematological patients were included into this prospective study. Median age was 57 yr (range 18-70). Fifteen patients received therapy for acute myeloid leukaemia and 27 patients received autologous stem cell transplantation for haematological malignancy. Laboratory samples for the determination of C-reactive protein (CRP) and VEGF were collected at the start of fever (d0) and then daily. RESULTS: The median serum VEGF concentrations were low in all study patients. In patients with severe sepsis (n = 5) the median VEGF on d0 was higher than in septic patients without signs of hypoperfusion or hypotension (n = 37) (77 pg/mL vs. 52 pg/mL, P = 0.061). Also on d1 the median VEGF concentration was higher in patients with severe sepsis (82 pg/mL vs. 56 pg/mL, P = 0.048). There were no statistically significant differences in CRP values on any day during the study period between patients with severe sepsis and those without. Time from d0 to the peak VEGF concentration (mean 1.02, SE 0.18 d) was shorter than that to the peak CRP concentration (mean 1.93, SE 0.15 d) (P = 0.002). CONCLUSION: Compared to CRP, serum VEGF was a more rapid indicator for sepsis in our haematological patients with neutropenic fever. Those with severe sepsis had higher VEGF concentrations than those without on d0 and d1 after the onset of fever. Further studies on VEGF are warranted in haematological patients.","['Hamalainen, Sari', 'Juutilainen, Auni', 'Matinlauri, Irma', 'Kuittinen, Taru', 'Ruokonen, Esko', 'Koivula, Irma', 'Jantunen, Esa']","['Hamalainen S', 'Juutilainen A', 'Matinlauri I', 'Kuittinen T', 'Ruokonen E', 'Koivula I', 'Jantunen E']","['Department of Medicine, Kuopio University Hospital, P.O.

In the present study, the role of the 5' untranslated region in protein expression was investigated. Luciferase expression vectors containing the LTR (R-U3-U5) and 5' leader sequence of A8 and non-neuropathogenic 57 Fr-MLV, designated gl-A8 and gl-57, and their chimeric vectors, were constructed, and transfected into rat glial cells F10. Replacement of the region containing the 3' half of R, U5, and 5' leader sequence of gl-A8 with that of 57 showed a reduction in luciferase activities, and replacement of this region of gl-57 with that of A8 showed increased luciferase activity. These results show that the region containing the 3' half of R, U5, and 5' leader sequence of A8 more efficiently up-regulates protein expression than 57. In particular, the 3' half of 5' leader of A8 was most responsible for the up-regulation of protein expression. Of interest, after replacement of the fragments between A8 and 57, changes in the activities of vectors containing A8-U3 paralleled the amount of mRNA, but the activities of vectors containing 57-U3 did not.

TEL is known to be rearranged in a variety of leukemias and solid tumors resulting in the formation of oncogenic chimeric protein. Tel is essential for maintaining hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow. To understand the role of TEL in erythropoiesis, we generated transgenic mice expressing human TEL under the control of Gata1 promoter that is activated during the course of the erythroid-lineage differentiation (GATA1-TEL transgenic mice). Although GATA1-TEL transgenic mice appeared healthy up to 18 months of age, the level of hemoglobin was higher in transgenic mice compared to non-transgenic littermates. In addition, CD71+/TER119+ and c-kit+/CD41+ populations proliferated with a higher frequency in transgenic mice when bone marrow cells were cultured in the presence of erythropoietin and thrombopoietin, respectively. In transgenic mice, enhanced expression of Alas-e and beta-major globin genes was observed in erythroid-committed cells. When embryonic stem cells expressing human TEL under the same Gata1 promoter were differentiated into hematopoietic cells, immature erythroid precursor increased better compared to controls as judged from the numbers of burst-forming unit of erythrocytes.

From the mechanism, it becomes clear that small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) play a pivotal role in triggering RNAi. Thus, the efficient delivery of target gene-specific siRNAs is one major challenge in the establishment of therapeutic RNAi. Here we show that in vivo application of targeted nonvirally delivered synthetic bcr-abl siRNA in a female patient with recurrent Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) resistant to imatinib (Y253F mutation) and chemotherapy after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can silence the expression of bcr-abl gene. We found a remarkable inhibition of the overexpressed bcr-abl oncogene resulting in increased apoptosis of CML cells.

This lack of tumour cell specificity results in severe toxic side effects and may only hardly affect quiescent cancer stem cells consequently leading to relapse. Since oncogenes are exclusively expressed in malignant and pre-malignant cells, they may provide unique, cancer cell specific targets for therapeutic strategies. However, their role in maintaining the malignant phenotype is frequently unknown. Furthermore, oncogenic transcription factors are generally considered to be ""undruggable"" with conventional small molecule approaches. Oncogene-specific RNA interference offers here new and exciting options to analyse oncogene functions directly in the malignant environment. Moreover, such approaches may permit the targeting of oncogenic transcription factors, thereby considerably extending the number of cancer-specific target structures. In this chapter, several rationales and practical aspects of oncogene targeting with siRNAs are discussed. Special emphasis is given to the application of RNA interference to haematopoietic cells, which are generally hard to transfect. In particular, solving the problem of systemic siRNA/shRNA delivery will greatly advance the inclusion of RNA interference strategies into more efficient and specific therapeutic strategies.","['Heidenreich, Olaf']",['Heidenreich O'],"['Newcastle University, Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Medical School, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,IM,"['Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Oncogenes/*physiology', '*RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*therapeutic use', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2009/03/24 09:00,2009/04/17 09:00,['2009/03/24 09:00'],"['2009/03/24 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/17 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-60327-547-7_11 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2009;487:221-42. doi: 10.1007/978-1-60327-547-7_11.,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

None of the vitamin C (5-50 microm), DADS and DPDS (1-5 microm) concentrations selected induced a significant percentage of apoptosis. In simultaneous treatments, vitamin C, DADS and DPDS reduced the apoptosis induced by NPIP and NDBA in HL-60 and HepG2 cells (around 70% of reduction). We also investigated its scavenging activities towards reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by NPIP and NDBA using 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate in both cell lines. ROS production induced by both N-nitrosamine was reduced to control levels by vitamin C (5-50 microm) in a dose-dependent manner. However, DADS (5 microm) increased ROS levels induced by NPIP and NDBA in HL-60 (40 and 20% increase, respectively) and HepG2 cells (18% increase), whereas DPDS was more efficient scavenger of ROS at the lowest concentration (1 microm) in both HL-60 (52 and 25% reduction, respectively) and HepG2 cells (24% reduction). The data demonstrated that the scavenging ability of vitamin C and DPDS could contribute to inhibition of the NPIP- and NDBA-induced apoptosis. However, more than one mechanism, such as inhibition of phase I and/or induction of phase II enzymes, could be implicated in the protective effect of dietary antioxidants towards NPIP- and NDBA-induced apoptosis in HL-60 and HepG2 cells.","['Garcia, Almudena', 'Morales, Paloma', 'Arranz, Nuria', 'Delgado, Ma Eugenia', 'Rafter, Joseph', 'Haza, Ana I']","['Garcia A', 'Morales P', 'Arranz N', 'Delgado ME', 'Rafter J', 'Haza AI']","['Departamento de Nutricion, Bromatologia y Tecnologia de los Alimentos, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Spain.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Appl Toxicol,Journal of applied toxicology : JAT,8109495,IM,"['Allyl Compounds/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Ascorbic Acid/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Culture Techniques', '*Dietary Supplements', 'Disulfides/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Liver Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology', 'Nitrosamines/*toxicity', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",2009/03/21 09:00,2010/02/02 06:00,['2009/03/21 09:00'],"['2009/03/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jat.1426 [doi]'],ppublish,J Appl Toxicol. 2009 Jul;29(5):403-13. doi: 10.1002/jat.1426.,"['0 (Allyl Compounds)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Disulfides)', '0 (Nitrosamines)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '5HI47O6OA7 (diallyl disulfide)', '6N066XUL4L (N-nitrosopiperidine)', '8K8942WN31 (dibutylnitrosamine)', 'I7K169J70F (n-propyl disulfide)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)']",,,,,,,"['2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,
