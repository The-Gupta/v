The present study aimed to analyze the diagnosis pattern of childhood malignant diseases using public health data, and to compare this pattern with seasonal viral infection trends. METHOD: Using the open data source of the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service, we extracted data regarding all patients under 21 years of age and who had any cancer, aplastic anemia or myelodysplastic syndrome between September 2009 and December 2013. The positive detection rates of 11 viruses was collected from the surveillance data of Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and seasonality analysis were conducted with both data. RESULTS: In total, 9085 patients were diagnosed with malignant disease during the study period; there were about 175 new cases per month on average. Monthly stacked time series by year showed an apparent seasonal variation with the highest monthly average in January as 236, and the lowest in September as 120. In winter, significantly more patients were diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, neuroblastoma, and Hodgkin's lymphoma than in other seasons. There was a temporal correlation with the diagnostic trends of several diseases and the prevalence of recent human parainfluenza virus. CONCLUSION: This study tentatively suggests that the diagnosis of childhood malignancy follows a seasonal trend in Korea, and has a possible correlation with viral prevalence in several diseases.

This investigation evaluates the anti-invasive, antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects of Pleurotus ostreatus (Pleurotaceae) on leukemia cell lines. METHODS: The proliferation of KG-1 cells was measured by using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay after treatment with gradient dilutions of P. ostreatus extract. Then, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the extract was determined. Moreover, the proliferation of Jurkat cells and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), a cancerous cell line and normal body cells, respectively, was considered. The apoptotic morphology of treated KG-1 cells was evaluated with Giemsa staining. The invasion and migration of cells were evaluated using transwell invasion assay. Thereafter, the rates of apoptosis and necrosis were measured by using flow cytometry, and BAX and MMP-9 gene expression were evaluated using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction as apoptotic and metastatic genes, respectively. RESULTS: The MIC of the extract was determined to be 1 mg/mL after 48 h. According to the results, the extract decreased the proliferation of leukemia cell lines (KG-1 and Jurkat cells) but had no antiproliferative effects on BMSCs. Moreover, KG-1 cell migration and MMP-9 gene expression decreased after the treatment, and the rate of apoptosis and BAX gene expression increased significantly.

METHODS: Questionnaire development was conducted according to guidelines from the EORTC Quality of Life Group. Phase I comprised generation of QoL issues relevant to patients. Phase II included operationalization and assessment of item relevance. In phase III, items were pretested in a cross-cultural sample. RESULTS: In Phase I, 75 issues were identified through focus groups and systematic literature searches. Interviews with 80 health-care professionals and 245 patients resulted in a provisional module of 38 items (phase II) representing items relevant for all or at least one of the four malignancies. In Phase III, this was tested in 337 patients from five European countries and resulted in a questionnaire with 27 items for HL (EORTC QLQ-HL27), 29 items for HG-NHL (EORTC QLQ-NHL-HG29), 20 items for LG-NHL (EORTC QLQ-NHL-LG20) and 17 items for CLL (EORTC QLQ-CLL17).

We report here that the c-KIT (CD117) targeting with dasatinib and radotinib promotes acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell death, and c-KIT endocytosis is essential for triggering c-KIT-positive AML cell death by dasatinib and radotinib during the early stages. In addition, dasatinib and radotinib reduce heat shock protein 90beta (HSP90beta) expression and release Apaf-1 in c-KIT-positive AML cells. Finally, this activates a caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway in c-KIT-positive AML cells. Moreover, the inhibition of c-KIT endocytosis by dynamin inhibitor (DY) reversed cell viability and c-KIT expression by dasatinib and radotinib. HSP90beta expression was recovered by DY in c-KIT-positive AML cells as well. Furthermore, the effect of radotinib on c-KIT and HSP90beta showed the same pattern in a xenograft animal model using HEL92.1.7 cells.

However, the redox regulators that allow AML cell survival in this oxidized environment remain largely unknown.Experimental Design: Utilizing several chemical and genetically-encoded redox sensing probes across multiple human and mouse models of AML, we evaluated the role of the serine/threonine kinase PKC-epsilon (PKCepsilon) in intracellular redox biology, cell survival and disease progression.Results: We show that RNA interference-mediated inhibition of PKCepsilon significantly reduces patient-derived AML cell survival as well as disease onset in a genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) of AML driven by MLL-AF9. We also show that PKCepsilon inhibition induces multiple reactive oxygen species (ROS) and that neutralization of mitochondrial ROS with chemical antioxidants or co-expression of the mitochondrial ROS-buffering enzymes SOD2 and CAT, mitigates the anti-leukemia effects of PKCepsilon inhibition. Moreover, direct inhibition of SOD2 increases mitochondrial ROS and significantly impedes AML progression in vivo Furthermore, we report that PKCepsilon over-expression protects AML cells from otherwise-lethal doses of mitochondrial ROS-inducing agents. Proteomic analysis reveals that PKCepsilon may control mitochondrial ROS by controlling the expression of regulatory proteins of redox homeostasis, electron transport chain flux, as well as outer mitochondrial membrane potential and transport.Conclusions: This study uncovers a previously unrecognized role for PKCepsilon in supporting AML cell survival and disease progression by regulating mitochondrial ROS biology and positions mitochondrial redox regulators as potential therapeutic targets in AML.

Published data on efficacy of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation in Richter syndrome are limited to single-center case series and registry data. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated the efficacy of allogeneic transplantation in 10 patients, median age of 63 (range, 50-74) years, allografted at a median of 5 (range, 4-25) months from diagnosis of Richter syndrome. All showed an objective response to therapy before transplantation (first complete remission = 7 [70%], first partial response = 2 [20%], second partial response = 1 [10%]). Most received a myeloablative conditioning regimen (n = 7, 70%). Filgrastim-mobilized peripheral blood stem cells was the preferred cell source (n = 10, 100%). RESULTS: Median follow-up of surviving patients was 46 (range, 15-82) months. The 4-year overall survival was 50% (95% confidence interval [CI], 19%-81%). Nonrelapse mortality at 1 year and 4 years post-transplantation were 40% (95% CI, 19%-85%) for both time points. The 4-year incidence of relapse/progression was 10% (95% CI, 2%-64%). CONCLUSION: Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation is an effective treatment for patients with Richter syndrome who show an objective response before allografting. Patients must be referred to transplant centers as soon as the diagnosis is confirmed to evaluate candidacy for the procedure and identify a suitable donor in a timely manner.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Although genetic susceptibility contributes to the development of these problems, there are very few studies that have so far addressed this issue in a cALL survivorship context. METHODS: In this study, we aimed at evaluating the associations between common and rare genetic variants and long-term cardiometabolic complications in survivors of cALL. We examined the cardiometabolic profile and performed whole-exome sequencing in 209 cALL survivors from the PETALE cohort. Variants associated with cardiometabolic outcomes were identified using PLINK (common) or SKAT (common and rare) and a logistic regression was used to evaluate their impact in multivariate models. RESULTS: Our results showed that rare and common variants in the BAD and FCRL3 genes were associated (p<0.05) with an extreme cardiometabolic phenotype (3 or more cardiometabolic risk factors). Common variants in OGFOD3 and APOB as well as rare and common BAD variants were significantly (p<0.05) associated with dyslipidemia.

CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we identified genetic susceptibility loci as contributing factors to the development of late treatment-related cardiometabolic complications in cALL survivors.

The objective of this study was to identify core groups of transcripts and molecular signaling pathways that respond to 17alpha-ethylinestadiol (EE2), a ubiquitous estrogenic contaminant, using transcriptome datasets generated from six independent laboratories. We sought to determine which biomarkers and gene networks were those most robust and reliably detected in multiple laboratories. Six laboratories conducted microarray analysis in pieces of the same liver from male fathead minnows exposed to approximately 15ng/L EE2 for 96h. There were common transcriptional networks identified in every dataset. These included down-regulation of gene networks associated with blood clotting, complement activation, triglyceride storage, and xenobiotic metabolism. Noteworthy was that more than approximately 85% of the gene networks were suppressed by EE2. Leveraging both these data and those mined from the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD), we narrowed in on an EE2-responsive transcriptional network. All transcripts in this network responded approximately +/-5-fold or more to EE2, increasing reliability of detection. This network included estrogen receptor alpha, transferrin, myeloid cell leukemia 1, insulin like growth factor 1, insulin like growth factor binding protein 2, and methionine adenosyltransferase 2A. This estrogen-responsive interactome has the advantage over single markers (e.g. vitellogenin) in that these entities are directly connected to each other based upon evidence of expression regulation and protein binding. Thus, it represents an interacting functional suite of estrogenic markers. Vitellogenin, the gold standard for estrogenic exposures, can show high individual variability in its response to estrogens, and the use of a multi-gene approach for estrogenic chemicals is expected to improve sensitivity. In our case, the coefficient of variation was significantly lowered by the gene network ( approximately 67%) compared to Vtg alone, supporting the use of this transcriptional network as a sensitive alternative for detecting estrogenic effluents and chemicals. We propose that screening chemicals for estrogenicity using interacting genes within a defined expression network will improve sensitivity, accuracy, and reduce the number of animals required for endocrine disruption assessments.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Additional efforts were made to correlate the observed methylation patterns with selected clinical features. We assessed DNA methylation from bone marrow samples obtained from 38 children with BCP ALL at the time of diagnosis along with 4 samples of normal bone marrow cells as controls using Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip Array. Patients were diagnosed and stratified into prognosis groups according to the BFM ALL IC 2009 protocol. The analysis of differentially methylated sites across the genome as well as promoter methylation profiles allowed clear separation of the leukemic and control samples into two clusters. 86.6% of the promoter-associated differentially methylated sites were hypermethylated in BCP ALL. Seven sites were found to correlate with the BFM ALL IC 2009 high risk group. Amongst these, one was located within the gene body of the MBP gene and another was within the promoter region- PSMF1 gene.

Ibrutinib lacks myelotoxicity and is generally well tolerated by older and unfit patients; however, side effects, such as atrial fibrillation or hemorrhage, can result in treatment interruption or discontinuation. Given the high efficacy and overall safety, ibrutinib is increasingly used in untreated and previously treated CLL patients. Second-generation BTK inhibitors are being developed, with different and generally more BTK-selective kinase inhibition profiles, which may increase the safety and/or efficacy. AREAS COVERED: We review key features of ibrutinib, along with problems of its use, discuss the potential and drawbacks of second generation molecules, and discuss combination therapies currently in development. EXPERT OPINION: BTK inhibitors have been a major therapeutic advance in older/unfit patients and those with high-risk and/or relapsed CLL, but require indefinite maintenance therapy and risk of developing treatment resistance or adverse events requiring treatment cessation increases over time. Novel combination strategies are currently being evaluated (e.g. the combination of ibrutinib with venetoclax), which may achieve greater depth of remission, remove the need for indefinite maintenance treatment and potentially replace chemoimmunotherapy in the first-line setting.",,"['Thompson, Philip A', 'Burger, Jan A']","['Thompson PA', 'Burger JA']","['a Department of Leukemia , The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston , TX , USA.', 'a Department of Leukemia , The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston , TX , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20171115,England,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,9434197,IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacology', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/administration & dosage', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Piperidines', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrazoles/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacology', 'Sulfonamides/administration & dosage']",['NOTNLM'],"['*BGB-3111', '*BTK inhibitor', '*CLL', '*GS-4059', '*SNS-062', '*acalabrutinib', '*chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*ibrutinib']",2017/11/11 06:00,2018/02/23 06:00,['2017/11/11 06:00'],"['2017/11/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/23 06:00 [medline]', '2017/11/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/13543784.2018.1404027 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2018 Jan;27(1):31-42. doi: 10.1080/13543784.2018.1404027.

The BCR expressed on malignant B-CLL cells contributes to the disease pathogenesis, and its signaling pathway is currently the target of several therapeutic strategies. Although various BCR alterations have been described in B-CLL at the protein level, the mRNA expression levels of tyrosine kinases in B-CLL compared to that in normal CD5-high and CD5-low B-lymphocytes remain unknown. In the current study, we measured the mRNA expression levels of CD79A, CD79B, LYN, SYK, SHP1, and ZAP70 in purified populations of CD5-high B-CLL cells, CD5-low B-cells from the peripheral blood of healthy donors, and CD5-high B-cells from human tonsils. Here, we report a clear separation in the B-CLL dataset between the ZAP70-high and ZAP70-low subgroups. Each subgroup has a unique expression profile of BCR signaling components that might reflect the functional status of the BCR signaling pathway.

METHODS: Cause of death, health and work histories, radiographs and spirometry were collected. Mortality and cancer incidence were analyzed. Logistic regression analysis investigated the associations of latency and cumulative fiber exposure (CFE) on radiographic changes. RESULTS: The mortality study showed no increase in standardized mortality rates (SMR) for lung cancer, but urinary cancers were significantly elevated in the higher exposed group (SMR = 3.62, 95% CI: 1.33-7.88) and leukemia in the total cohort (SMR = 2.51, 95% CI: 1.08-4.94). One death attributed to mesothelioma was identified (SMR = 2.86, 95% CI: 0.07-15.93) in a worker reporting some asbestos exposure. The overall rate of pleural changes was 6.1%, attaining 21.4% in the highest CFE category for all subjects (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 6.9, 95% CI: 3.6-13.4), and 13.0% for those with no reported asbestos exposure (OR= 9.1, 95% CI: 2.5-33.6). Prevalence for recent hires (>/=1985) was similar to the background. Interstitial changes were not elevated. Localized pleural thickening was associated with small decreases in spirometry results. CONCLUSION: Increases in leukemia and urinary cancer but not lung cancer mortality were found. One death attributed to mesothelioma was observed in a worker with self-reported asbestos exposure and a work history where occupational asbestos exposure may have occurred, rendering uncertainties in assigning causation. Radiographic analyses indicated RCF exposure alone is associated with increased pleural but not interstitial changes. Reductions in RCF exposure should continue.

METHODS: We screened all patients with acute leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndrome admitted to a university hospital ICU during 2008-2012. Data were obtained from the clinical chemistry laboratory database and patient files. We graded bleeding according to the World Health Organisation (WHO)-system within 24-h, within 5-days and during the whole ICU stay. We analysed the predictive values of laboratory parameters using multiple logistic regression and receiver operator characteristics (ROC) curves. As we previously have established that platelet count at admission was associated with bleeding, we focused on International Normalised Ratio (INR), activated pro-thrombin time (APTT), anti-thrombin, D-dimer and fibrinogen, and markers of infection (C-reactive protein, pro-calcitonin), kidney function (creatinine) and tissue damage (lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)). RESULTS: We included 116 patients; 66 (57%) had at least one bleeding episode and 11 (9%) patients had at least one thrombotic event. The differences in coagulation values when bleeding compared to baseline values were minor. INR was the only variable we found associated with subsequent bleeding within 24 h from admission to ICU (odds ratio 2.91, 95% CI: 1.01-8.43, P = 0.048). ROC analyses did not show predictive value of any of the other variables with regards to bleeding and none of the variables were associated with thrombosis in adjusted analyses. Increased levels of LDH at admission were associated with increased 7-day and 30-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Increased INR at admission was associated with a higher rate of bleeding in ICU patients with haematological malignancies. No other biochemical coagulation or other parameter had any association with bleeding, thrombosis or mortality except increased LDH, which at ICU admission was associated with increased 30-day mortality.","['(c) 2017 The Acta Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica Foundation.

In mammals, the enzyme is also identical to the extracellular proteins neuroleukin, tumor-secreted autocrine motility factor (AMF) and differentiation and maturation mediator for myeloid leukemia. Hereditary deficiency of the enzyme causes non-spherocytic hemolytic anemia in human. In the present study, a novel interaction between GTP and human PGI was corroborated by UV-induced crosslinking, affinity purification and kinetic study. GTP not only inhibits the isomerization activity but also compromises the AMF function of the enzyme. Kinetic studies, including the Yonetani-Theorell method, suggest that GTP is a competitive inhibitor with a Ki value of 63 muM and the GTP-binding site partially overlaps with the catalytic site. In addition, GTP stabilizes the structure of human PGI against heat- and detergent-induced denaturation. Molecular modelling and dynamic simulation suggest that GTP is bound in a syn-conformation with the gamma-phosphate group located near the phosphate-binding loop and the ribose moiety positioned away from the active-site residues.",,"['Lin, Hua-Yang', 'Liu, Jyung-Hurng', 'Cheng, Ka-Lik', 'Lin, Jia-Yun', 'Liu, Ni-Rung', 'Meng, Menghsiao']","['Lin HY', 'Liu JH', 'Cheng KL', 'Lin JY', 'Liu NR', 'Meng M']","['Graduate Institute of Biotechnology, National Chung Hsing University (NCHU), 250 Kuo-Kuang Road, Taichung, Taiwan 40227.', 'Graduate Institute of Genomics and Bioinformatics, NCHU, Taichung, Taiwan 40227.', 'Agricultural Biotechnology Center (ABC), NCHU, Taichung, Taiwan 40227.', 'Rong Hsing Research Center for Translational Medicine, NCHU, Taichung, Taiwan 40227.', 'Graduate Institute of Biotechnology, National Chung Hsing University (NCHU), 250 Kuo-Kuang Road, Taichung, Taiwan 40227.', 'Graduate Institute of Biotechnology, National Chung Hsing University (NCHU), 250 Kuo-Kuang Road, Taichung, Taiwan 40227.', 'Graduate Institute of Biotechnology, National Chung Hsing University (NCHU), 250 Kuo-Kuang Road, Taichung, Taiwan 40227.', 'Graduate Institute of Biotechnology, National Chung Hsing University (NCHU), 250 Kuo-Kuang Road, Taichung, Taiwan 40227.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150430,Netherlands,Biochem Biophys Rep,Biochemistry and biophysics reports,101660999,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Autocrine motility factor', 'GTP', 'Glucose-6-phosphate isomerase', 'Inhibition kinetics', 'Phosphoglucose isomerase']",2015/04/30 00:00,2015/04/30 00:01,['2017/11/11 06:00'],"['2015/02/26 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/13 00:00 [revised]', '2015/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/30 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.bbrep.2015.04.003 [doi]', 'S2405-5808(15)00016-3 [pii]']",epublish,Biochem Biophys Rep. 2015 Apr 30;2:14-22. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrep.2015.04.003. eCollection 2015 Jul.,PMC5668625,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently, the recommended treatment for patients with high-risk MDS is the methylation agent decitabine (DAC), a drug that can induce the reexpression of silenced tumor suppressor genes. We investigated the effects of DAC treatment on the myeloid MDS cell line SKM-1 and investigated the role of FOXO3A, a potentially tumor-suppressive transcription factor, by silencing its expression prior to DAC treatment. We found that FOXO3A exists in an inactive, hyperphosphorylated form in SKM-1 cells, but that DAC both induces FOXO3A expression and reactivates the protein by reducing its phosphorylation level. Furthermore, we show that this FOXO3A activation is responsible for the DAC-induced differentiation of SKM-1 cells into monocytes, as well as for SKM-1 cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and autophagy.

Loss of T cell function is frequently caused in cancer by sustained signaling of inhibitory receptors. Here, we analyzed the role of the novel inhibitory receptor Ig-like transcript 2 (ILT2) in the pathogenesis of CLL. We observed that ILT2 expression was markedly reduced on leukemic cells, whereas it was increased on CD8 and CD4 T cells from CLL patients, particularly in those patients harboring chromosome 11q deletion, which includes the ATM gene. A deep dysregulation of ILT2 ligands expression in leukemia cells was also observed. ILT2 impaired the activation and proliferation of CD4 and CD8 T cells in CLL patients, but it had no effect in leukemic cells. ILT2 downregulated the production of IL-2 by CD4 T cells of CLL patients and induced the expression of cytokines that promote the survival of leukemic cells, such as IFN-gamma, by T cells. Importantly, ILT2 blockade restored the activation, proliferation and cytokine production of T cells.

We also tested the in vivo anti-leukemic capacity of ex vivo-expanded NK cells against patient-derived acute myeloid leukemia cells.

Mutations in Janus Kinase-2 (JAK2), calreticulin (CALR) and myeloproliferative leukemia protein (MPL) genes have been recently associated to MF and they all activate the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Since this pathway is essential in shaping the immune response, we investigated the role of circulating immune subsets and cytokines in 38 patients (20 carrying JAK2((V617F)),13 exon-9 CALR mutation and 5 triple negative). In comparison to healthy donors, patients presented a reduced amount of circulating dendritic cells (DCs) associated with a defective ability of monocytes in differentiating into DCs. In addition, we found a reduction in circulating T-helper (Th)1 and Th17 and hypo-functional innate lymphoid cells (ILC). Results analyzed according to the mutational status showed that patients carrying JAK2((V617F)) mutation had a reduction in Th17, myeloid-DCs and effector Tregs as well as increased ILC1 and cytokine producing Tregs. The CALR mutated patients revealed high ILC3 levels, reduced Th1 and their monocytes had a reduced capacity to mature in vitro into fully committed DCs. Their Tregs were also less effective in inhibiting the proliferation of autologous effector T-cells due to an increased proliferative status induced by CALR mutation. Triple negative patients presented a reduced amount of total circulating CD3, effectors Tregs and Th1 with increased ILC1.

The amphiphilic nature of surfactin allows its easy incorporation nano-formulations, such as polymeric nanoparticles, micelles, microemulsions, liposomes, to name a few. The use of nano-formulations offers the advantage of optimizing surfactin delivery for an improved anticancer therapy. This review focuses on the current knowledge of surfactin properties and biosynthesis; anticancer activity against different cancer models and the underlying mechanisms involved; as well as the potential application of nano-formulations for optimal surfactin delivery.",,"['Wu, Yuan-Seng', 'Ngai, Siew-Ching', 'Goh, Bey-Hing', 'Chan, Kok-Gan', 'Lee, Learn-Han', 'Chuah, Lay-Hong']","['Wu YS', 'Ngai SC', 'Goh BH', 'Chan KG', 'Lee LH', 'Chuah LH']","['School of Pharmacy, Monash University Malaysia, Bandar Sunway, Malaysia.', 'Faculty of Science, School of Biosciences, The University of Nottingham Malaysia Campus, Semenyih, Malaysia.', 'Faculty of Science, School of Biosciences, The University of Nottingham Malaysia Campus, Semenyih, Malaysia.', 'School of Pharmacy, Monash University Malaysia, Bandar Sunway, Malaysia.', 'Centre of Health Outcomes Research and Therapeutic Safety (Cohorts), School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Phayao, Phayao, Thailand.', 'Global Asia in the 21st Century Platform, Asian Centre for Evidence Synthesis in Population, Implementation and Clinical Outcomes, Health and Well-being Cluster, Monash University Malaysia, Bandar Sunway, Malaysia.', 'Division of Genetics and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Science, Institute of Biological Sciences, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Vice Chancellor Office, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Monash University Malaysia, Bandar Sunway, Malaysia.', 'Centre of Health Outcomes Research and Therapeutic Safety (Cohorts), School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Phayao, Phayao, Thailand.', 'Global Asia in the 21st Century Platform, Asian Centre for Evidence Synthesis in Population, Implementation and Clinical Outcomes, Health and Well-being Cluster, Monash University Malaysia, Bandar Sunway, Malaysia.', 'School of Pharmacy, Monash University Malaysia, Bandar Sunway, Malaysia.', 'Advanced Engineering Platform, Monash University Malaysia, Bandar Sunway, Malaysia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20171026,Switzerland,Front Pharmacol,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923,,,['NOTNLM'],"['anticancer', 'biosurfactant', 'lipopeptide', 'nano-formulation', 'surfactin']",2017/11/11 06:00,2017/11/11 06:01,['2017/11/11 06:00'],"['2017/07/22 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/11/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/11 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fphar.2017.00761 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pharmacol. 2017 Oct 26;8:761. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2017.00761. eCollection 2017.,PMC5662584,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several NF-kappaB inhibitors were shown to successfully induce apoptosis of CLL cells in vitro Since the microenvironment is known to be crucial for the survival of CLL cells, herein, we tested whether NF-kappaB inhibition may still induce apoptosis in these leukemic cells in the presence of protective stromal interaction. We used the specific NF-kappaB inhibitor dehydroxymethylepoxyquinomicin (DHMEQ). Microenvironmental support was mimicked by co-culturing CLL cells with bone marrow-derived stromal cell lines (HS-5 and M2-10B4). NF-kappaB inhibition by DHMEQ in CLL cells could be confirmed in both the monoculture and co-culture setting. In line with previous reports, NF-kappaB inhibition induced apoptosis in the monoculture setting by activating the intrinsic apoptotic pathway resulting in poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-cleavage; however, it was unable to induce apoptosis in leukemic cells co-cultured with stromal cells. Similarly, small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA)-mediated RELA downregulation induced apoptosis of CLL cells cultured alone, but not in the presence of supportive stromal cells. B-cell activating factor (BAFF) was identified as a microenvironmental messenger potentially protecting the leukemic cells from NF-kappaB inhibition-induced apoptosis. Finally, we show improved sensitivity of stroma-supported CLL cells to NF-kappaB inhibition when combining the NF-kappaB inhibitor with the SYK inhibitor R406 or the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor ibrutinib, agents known to inhibit the stroma-leukemia crosstalk. We conclude that NF-kappaB inhibitors are not promising as monotherapies in CLL, but may represent attractive therapeutic partners for ibrutinib and R406.",['Copyright(c) 2018 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],"['Simon-Gabriel, Carl Philipp', 'Foerster, Katharina', 'Saleem, Shifa', 'Bleckmann, Dorothee', 'Benkisser-Petersen, Marco', 'Thornton, Nicolas', 'Umezawa, Kazuo', 'Decker, Sarah', 'Burger, Meike', 'Veelken, Hendrik', 'Claus, Rainer', 'Dierks, Christine', 'Duyster, Justus', 'Zirlik, Katja']","['Simon-Gabriel CP', 'Foerster K', 'Saleem S', 'Bleckmann D', 'Benkisser-Petersen M', 'Thornton N', 'Umezawa K', 'Decker S', 'Burger M', 'Veelken H', 'Claus R', 'Dierks C', 'Duyster J', 'Zirlik K']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Target Medicine, Aichi Medical University School of Medicine, Nagakute, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Germany.', 'Furtwangen University, Faculty of Medical and Life Sciences, Schwenningen Campus, Villingen-Schwenningen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Centre, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Germany katja.zirlik@zetaup.ch katja.zirlik@uniklinik-freiburg.de.', 'Tumor and Breast Center ZeTuP, St. Gallen, Switzerland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20171109,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzamides/pharmacology', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cyclohexanones/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', '*Tumor Microenvironment/drug effects/genetics']",,,2017/11/11 06:00,2019/07/25 06:00,['2017/11/11 06:00'],"['2017/01/26 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/25 06:00 [medline]', '2017/11/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2017.165381 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2017.165381 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2018 Jan;103(1):136-147. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2017.165381.

In this study, we identified COBLL1 as a novel interaction partner of ROR1. COBLL1 shows clear bimodal expression with high levels in chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients with mutated IGHV and approximately 30% of chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients with unmutated IGHV. In the remaining 70% of chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients with unmutated IGHV, COBLL1 expression is low. Importantly, chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients with unmutated IGHV and high COBLL1 have an unfavorable disease course with short overall survival and time to second treatment. COBLL1 serves as an independent molecular marker for overall survival in chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients with unmutated IGHV. In addition, chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients with unmutated IGHV and high COBLL1 show impaired motility and chemotaxis towards CCL19 and CXCL12 as well as enhanced B-cell receptor signaling pathway activation demonstrated by increased PLCgamma2 and SYK phosphorylation after IgM stimulation. COBLL1 expression also changes during B-cell maturation in non-malignant secondary lymphoid tissue with a higher expression in germinal center B cells than naive and memory B cells. Our data thus suggest COBLL1 involvement not only in chronic lymphocytic leukemia but also in B-cell development. In summary, we show that expression of COBLL1, encoding novel ROR1-binding partner, defines chronic lymphocytic leukemia subgroups with a distinct response to microenvironmental stimuli, and independently predicts survival of chronic lymphocytic leukemia with unmutated IGHV.",['Copyright(c) 2018 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],"['Plesingerova, Hana', 'Janovska, Pavlina', 'Mishra, Archana', 'Smyckova, Lucie', 'Poppova, Lucie', 'Libra, Antonin', 'Plevova, Karla', 'Ovesna, Petra', 'Radova, Lenka', 'Doubek, Michael', 'Pavlova, Sarka', 'Pospisilova, Sarka', 'Bryja, Vitezslav']","['Plesingerova H', 'Janovska P', 'Mishra A', 'Smyckova L', 'Poppova L', 'Libra A', 'Plevova K', 'Ovesna P', 'Radova L', 'Doubek M', 'Pavlova S', 'Pospisilova S', 'Bryja V']","['Center of Molecular Biology and Gene Therapy, Department of Internal Medicine- Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Medical Faculty, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Experimental Biology, Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Cytokinetics, Institute of Biophysics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Experimental Biology, Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Experimental Biology, Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Center of Molecular Biology and Gene Therapy, Department of Internal Medicine- Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Medical Faculty, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Generi Biotech, s.r.o., Hradec Kralove, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Center of Molecular Biology and Gene Therapy, Department of Internal Medicine- Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Medical Faculty, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Biostatistics and Analyses, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Center of Molecular Biology and Gene Therapy, Department of Internal Medicine- Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Medical Faculty, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Center of Molecular Biology and Gene Therapy, Department of Internal Medicine- Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Medical Faculty, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Center of Molecular Biology and Gene Therapy, Department of Internal Medicine- Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Medical Faculty, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Experimental Biology, Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic bryja@sci.muni.cz.', 'Department of Cytokinetics, Institute of Biophysics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Brno, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171109,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Cell Movement', 'Cell Polarity', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/classification/diagnosis/genetics/*mortality', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptor Tyrosine Kinase-like Orphan Receptors/*metabolism', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway']",,,2017/11/11 06:00,2019/03/21 06:00,['2017/11/11 06:00'],"['2017/08/18 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/21 06:00 [medline]', '2017/11/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2017.178699 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2017.178699 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2018 Feb;103(2):313-324. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2017.178699.

In this study, we report that global or myeloid-specific deficiency of PTP1B in mice decreases lifespan. We demonstrate that myeloid-specific deficiency of PTP1B is sufficient to promote the development of acute myeloid leukemia. LysM-PTP1B(-/-) mice lacking PTP1B in the innate myeloid cell lineage displayed a dysregulation of bone marrow cells with a rapid decline in population at midlife and a concomitant increase in peripheral blood blast cells. This phenotype manifested further with extramedullary tumors, hepatic macrophage infiltration, and metabolic reprogramming, suggesting increased hepatic lipid metabolism prior to overt tumor development. Mechanistic investigations revealed an increase in anti-inflammatory M2 macrophage responses in liver and spleen, as associated with increased expression of arginase I and the cytokines IL10 and IL4. We also documented STAT3 hypersphosphorylation and signaling along with JAK-dependent upregulation of antiapoptotic proteins Bcl2 and BclXL.

However, a major issue of transducing T cells with a transgenic TCR is the preexisting expression of TCRs in the recipient cells. These endogenous TCRs compete with the transgenic TCR for surface expression and allow mixed dimer formation. Mixed dimers, formed by mispairing between the endogenous and transgenic TCRs, may harbor autoreactive specificities. To circumvent these problems, we designed a system where the endogenous TCR-beta is knocked out from the recipient cells using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein-9 (Cas9) technology, simultaneously with transduction with a cancer-reactive receptor of choice. This TCR replacement strategy resulted in markedly increased surface expression of transgenic alphabeta and gammadelta TCRs, which in turn translated to a stronger, and more polyfunctional, response of engineered T cells to their target cancer cell lines. Additionally, the TCR-plus-CRISPR-modified T cells were up to a thousandfold more sensitive to antigen than standard TCR-transduced T cells or conventional model proxy systems used for studying TCR activity. Finally, transduction with a pan-cancer-reactive gammadelta TCR used in conjunction with CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of the endogenous alphabeta TCR resulted in more efficient redirection of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells against a panel of established blood cancers and primary, patient-derived B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia blasts compared with standard TCR transfer. Our results suggest that TCR transfer combined with genome editing could lead to new, improved generations of cancer immunotherapies.",['(c) 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Legut, Mateusz', 'Dolton, Garry', 'Mian, Afsar Ali', 'Ottmann, Oliver G', 'Sewell, Andrew K']","['Legut M', 'Dolton G', 'Mian AA', 'Ottmann OG', 'Sewell AK']","['Division of Infection and Immunity, School of Medicine.', 'Systems Immunity Research Institute, and.', 'Division of Infection and Immunity, School of Medicine.', 'Systems Immunity Research Institute, and.', 'Haematology, Division of Cancer and Genetics, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom.', 'Haematology, Division of Cancer and Genetics, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom.', 'Division of Infection and Immunity, School of Medicine.', 'Systems Immunity Research Institute, and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171109,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*metabolism', 'CRISPR-Associated Protein 9/metabolism', 'CRISPR-Cas Systems/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'Genes, T-Cell Receptor/*genetics', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/immunology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/metabolism', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', '*Transgenes']",,,2017/11/11 06:00,2019/04/16 06:00,['2017/11/11 06:00'],"['2017/05/30 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/16 06:00 [medline]', '2017/11/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)32544-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2017-05-787598 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2018 Jan 18;131(3):311-322. doi: 10.1182/blood-2017-05-787598.

Better understanding of biologic, genetic, and molecular characteristics of CLL have contributed to better appreciating its clinical heterogeneity. New prognostic models, the GCLLSG prognostic index and the CLL-IPI, emerged. They incorporate biologic and genetic information related to CLL and are capable of predicting survival outcomes and cases anticipated to need therapy earlier in the disease course. Accordingly, these newer models are helping develop better informed surveillance strategies and ultimately tailor treatment intensity according to presence (or lack thereof) of certain prognostic markers.

Depending on definitions, reported non-adherence rates in cancer patients ranges between 16 and 100%, which illustrates a serious problem. In malignancy, non-adherence reduces chances of achievement of treatment response and may thereby lead to progression or even relapse. Except for Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML), the extent of non-adherence has not been investigated in hematological-oncological patients in an outpatient setting. In order to explore ways to optimize cancer treatment results, this study aimed to assess the prevalence of self-administered medication non-adherence and to identify potential associated factors in hematological-oncological patients in their home situation. METHODS: This is an exploratory cross-sectional study, carried out at the outpatient clinic of the Department of Hematology at the VU University medical center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands between February and April 2014. Hematological-oncological outpatients were sent questionnaires retrieving information on patient characteristics, medication adherence, beliefs about medication, anxiety, depression, coping, and quality of life. We performed uni- and multivariable analysis to identify predictors for medication non-adherence. RESULTS: In total, 472 participants were approached of which 259 (55%) completed the questionnaire and met eligibility criteria. Prevalence of adherence in this group (140 male; 54,1%; median age 60 (18-91)) was 50%. In univariate analysis, (lower) age, (higher) education level, living alone, working, perception of receiving insufficient social support, use of bisphosphonates, depression, helplessness (ICQ), global health, role function, emotional function, cognitive function, social functioning, fatigue, dyspnea, diarrhea were found to be significantly related (p = <0.20) to medication non-adherence. In multivariable analysis, younger age, (higher) education level and fatigue remained significantly related (p = <0.10) to medication non-adherence. CONCLUSIONS: This cross-sectional study shows that 50% of the participants were non-adherent. Lower age, living alone and perception of insufficient social support were associated factors of non-adherence in hematological-oncological adult patients in their home-situation.",,"['Bouwman, Linda', 'Eeltink, Corien M', 'Visser, Otto', 'Janssen, Jeroen J W M', 'Maaskant, Jolanda M']","['Bouwman L', 'Eeltink CM', 'Visser O', 'Janssen JJWM', 'Maaskant JM']","['Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands. c.eeltink@vumc.nl.', 'Cancer Center Amsterdam, VU University Medical Center, De Boelelaan 1117, 1081, HV, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. c.eeltink@vumc.nl.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', ""Emma Children's Hospital, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands."", 'Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Medical Faculty, Academic Medical Center and University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20171109,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Medication Adherence', 'Middle Aged', 'Netherlands/epidemiology', 'Prevalence', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Self Care/trends', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['Associated factors', 'Hematological-oncological patients', 'Non-adherence']",2017/11/11 06:00,2018/06/21 06:00,['2017/11/11 06:00'],"['2017/02/03 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/11/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-017-3735-1 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-017-3735-1 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2017 Nov 9;17(1):739. doi: 10.1186/s12885-017-3735-1.,PMC5679497,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The overall scenario of cancer including hematological malignancies (HMs) is largely unknown in Bangladesh, where a significant proportion of people (44% of total population) belong to AYA age group. This study aims to describe the patterns of HM among AYA in the context of Bangladesh METHODS: Two previously published datasets (on hematological malignancies and childhood and adolescent cancer) were merged to construct a comprehensive dataset focusing exclusively on HMs in AYA age group. Univariate descriptive statistics were calculated and bivariate association were tested using Pearson's Chi-square test. RESULTS: A total of 2144 diagnosed HM related cases over a period of 2007-2014 were analyzed. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was the most frequent HM (35.1%) in AYAs, which was followed by acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) constituting 22.7% and 20.8%, respectively. Among lymphomas, Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) constituted 13.9% of all HMs while 4.6% was for Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL). CONCLUSION: This is the first attempt to provide a glimpse on the pattern and distribution of HMs among AYA in Bangladesh. Future studies are essential to get a better insight on the epidemiology, biology, potential risk factors and treatment outcomes for the AYA age group.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study we aimed to analyze the prognostic impact of -Y in the context of the IPSS-R cytogenetic classification, evaluate the clinical significance of the percentage of metaphases with isolated -Y, and test whether finding -Y may predispose to over-diagnose MDS in patients with borderline morphological features. We evaluated 3581 male patients from the Spanish MDS Registry with a diagnosis of MDS or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). -Y was identified in 177 patients (4.9%). Compared with the 2246 male patients with normal karyotype, -Y group showed a reduced risk of leukemic transformation that did not translate into a survival advantage. The overall survival and the risk of leukemic transformation were not influenced by the percentage of metaphases with -Y. The -Y group was not enriched in patients with minor morphologic traits of dysplasia, suggesting that the better outcome in the -Y group cannot be explained by enrichment in cases misdiagnosed as MDS. In conclusion, our results support the current recommendation of classifying patients with -Y within the very good risk category of the IPSS-R for MDS and rule out a selection bias as a possible explanation of this better outcome. An analysis of the molecular basis of MDS with isolated -Y would be of interest as it may provide a biological basis of protection against progression to acute leukemia.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

However, TKI treatment is long-term and can induce resistance to TKI, which often leads to a poor clinical outcome in CML patients. Here, we examined the effect of continuous IM exposure on intracellular energy metabolism in K562 cells, a human Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML cell line, and its subsequent sensitivity to anti-cancer agents. Contrary to our expectations, we found that continuous IM exposure increased sensitivity to TKI. Cancer energy metabolism, characterized by abnormal glycolysis, is linked to cancer cell survival. Interestingly, glycolytic activity was suppressed by continuous exposure to IM, and autophagy increased to maintain cell viability by compensating for glycolytic suppression. Notably, increased sensitivity to TKI was not caused by glycolytic inhibition but by altered intracellular signaling, causing glycolytic suppression and increased autophagy, as evidenced by suppression of p70 S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) and activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Using another human CML cell line (KCL22 cells) and BCR/ABL+ Ba/F3 cells (mimicking Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML cells) confirmed that suppressing S6K1 and activating AMPK increased sensitivity to TKI. Furthermore, suppressing S6K1 and activating AMPK had a synergistic anti-cancer effect by inhibiting autophagy in the presence of TKI. The present study provides new insight into the importance of signaling pathways that affect cellular energy metabolism, and suggests that co-treatment with agents that disrupt energy metabolic signaling (using S6K1 suppressors and AMPK activators) plus blockade of autophagy may be strategies for TKI-based CML therapy.","['(c) 2017 The Authors.

Competition experiments combined with molecular docking analysis were utilized to investigate the binding modes between emodin and binding sites of P-gp.

Moreover, when incubated with emodin under different conditions where P-gp was inhibited, K562/ADM cells displayed increasing intracellular uptake of emodin, suggesting that emodin may be the potential substrate of P-gp. Importantly, rhodamine 123 could increase the Kintrinsic (Ki) value of emodin linearly, whereas, verapamil could not, implying that emodin competitively bound to the R site of P-gp and noncompetition existed between emodin and verapamil at the M site, in a good accordance with the results of molecular docking that emodin bound to the R site of P-gp with higher affinity.

In addition, differences in methotrexate (MTX), 7-OHMTX levels, and MTX metabolism using the ratio MTX/7-OHMTX were determined according to age. METHODS: The authors included a total of 106 cycles, corresponding to 33 patients (mean age: 9.8 years, range: 2-18 years) suffering from acute lymphoblastic leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and osteosarcoma and receiving high-dose MTX (HD-MTX). Plasma MTX, 7-OHMTX, and creatinine at T24 and T48 hours were measured. RESULTS: Children older than 14 years had significantly higher MTX levels at T48 hours (1.25 versus 0.5 mumol/L, P < 0.05) and a higher MTX/7-OHMTX ratio (0.63 versus 0.20, P < 0.05) than children younger than 6 years. Plasma 7-OHMTX at T24 and T48 hours was positively correlated with serum creatinine and creatinine ratio at T24 and T48 hours. MTX levels provided a better specificity and sensitivity at both 24 and 48 hours than 7-OHMTX to predict delayed MTX elimination. A MTX threshold close to 0.83 mumol/L at T48 hours improved specificity from 58% to 82% and keeps sensitivity at 100%. The authors identified a cut-off at 65 mumol/L for MTX at T24 hours with a good sensitivity (75%) and specificity above 50%. CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm the concentration-dependent nephrotoxicity of 7-OHMTX. Children older than 14 years old had a higher MTX levels at 48 hours and a higher MTX/7-OHMTX ratio, suggesting a faster metabolism in younger children.

The efficiency of this approach is inadequate when applied to a relatively low levels of incidence. We compared that approach with the Cuscore test with respect to detecting a log-linear increasing trend of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) in datasets simulated to match a province of about 700,000 inhabitants. METHODS: For better efficiency, we replaced the standardized rate as the dependent variable with a continuous statistic that reflects the inverse of the standardized incidence ratio (SIR). Both procedures were applied to datasets simulated to match published results in the Girona Province of Spain. We also present the use of the q-interval in displaying the temporal pattern of the events. This approach is demonstrated by analyses of CMML diagnoses in Girona County (1994-2008). RESULTS: The Cuscore was clearly more efficient than regression in detecting the simulated trend. The relative efficiency of the Cuscore is likely to be maintained in even higher levels of incidence. The use of graphical displays in providing clues regarding interpretation of the results is demonstrated. CONCLUSIONS: The Cuscore test coupled with visual inspection of the temporal pattern of the events seems to be more efficient than regression analysis in detecting and interpreting data suspected to be at elevated risk. A confirmatory analysis is expected to weed out 75% of the superfluous significant results.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

METHODS: Guam cancer incidence and mortality were compared to that of Hawaii using data from their respective population-based, central cancer registries. RESULTS: In 2009-2013, overall cancer incidence was substantially lower in Guam than in Hawaii for both sexes while overall cancer mortality was higher for Guam males. Cervical cancer incidence and prostate cancer mortality were higher in Guam. Both incidence and mortality were higher among Guam men for cancers of the lung & bronchus, liver & intrahepatic bile duct, and nasopharynx; Chamorro men were disproportionately affected by these cancers. Filipinos and Whites in Guam had lower overall cancer incidence compared to Filipinos and Whites in Hawaii. Although breast cancer incidence was significantly lower in Guam compared to Hawaii, women in Guam presented at younger ages and with rarer disease histologies such as inflammatory carcinoma were more prevalent. Guam patients were also diagnosed at younger ages for cancers of bladder, pancreas, colon & rectum, liver & intrahepatic bile duct, lung & bronchus, stomach, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and leukemia. CONCLUSION: Smoking, infectious agents, and betel nut chewing appear to be important contributors to the burden of cancer in Guam. Earlier onset of cancer in Guam suggests earlier age of exposure to key risk factors and/or a more aggressive pathogenesis. Contrasting cancer patterns within Guam and between Guam and Hawaii underscore the potential influence of genes, lifestyle, and environmental factors on cancer development and progression.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the involvement and details of miRNA-mediated epigenetic regulation, particularly in targeting genomic DNA and mediating epigenetic regulation, remain largely uninvestigated. In the present study, transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer binding protein delta (CEBPD) was responsive to the anticancer drug bortezomib, a clinical and highly selective drug for leukemia treatment, and contributed to bortezomib-induced cell death. Interestingly, following the identification of CEBPD-induced miRNAs, we found that miR-744, miR-3154 and miR-3162 could target CpG islands in the 5'-flanking region of the CEBPD gene. We previously demonstrated that the Yin Yang 1 (YY1)/polycomb group (PcG) protein/DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) complex is important for CCAAT/enhancer binding protein delta (CEBPD) gene inactivation; we further found that Argonaute 2 (Ago2) interacts with YY1 and binds to the CEBPD promoter. The miRNA/Ago2/YY1/PcG group protein/DNMT complex linked the inactivation of CEBPD and genes adjacent to its 5'-flanking region, including protein kinase DNA-activated catalytic polypeptide (PRKDC), minichromosome maintenance-deficient 4 (MCM4) and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 variant 2 (UBE2V2), upon bortezomib treatment. Moreover, we revealed that miRNA binding is necessary for YY1/PcG group protein/DNMT complex-mediated epigenetic gene silencing and is associated with bortezomib-induced methylation on genomic DNA.

In both, lymphosarcoma was detected and the presence of BLV was confirmed by nested PCR. The neighbour-joining algorithm distance method was used to genotype the BLV sequences by phylogenetic reconstruction, and the maximum likelihood method was used for the phylogenetic reconstruction. The phylogeny estimates were calculated by performing 1000 bootstrap replicates. RESULTS: Analysis of the partial envelope glycoprotein (env) gene sequences from two isolates (25 and 31) revealed two different genotypes of BLV. Isolate 25 clustered with ten genotype 6 isolates from Brazil, Argentina, Thailand and Paraguay. On the other hand, isolate 31 clustered with two genotype 5 isolates (one was also from Sao Paulo and one was from Costa Rica). The detected genotypes corroborate the results of previous studies conducted in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil. The prediction of amino acids showed substitutions, particularly between positions 136 and 150 in 11 out of 13 sequences analysed, including sequences from GenBank. CONCLUSION: BLV is still important in Brazil and this research should be continued.",,"['Gregory, Lilian', 'Carrillo Gaeta, Natalia', 'Araujo, Jansen', 'Matsumiya Thomazelli, Luciano', 'Harakawa, Ricardo', 'Ikuno, Alice A', 'Hiromi Okuda, Liria', 'de Stefano, Eliana', 'Pituco, Edviges Maristela']","['Gregory L', 'Carrillo Gaeta N', 'Araujo J', 'Matsumiya Thomazelli L', 'Harakawa R', 'Ikuno AA', 'Hiromi Okuda L', 'de Stefano E', 'Pituco EM']","['Department of Internal Medicine, School of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Science, University of Sao Paulo, Av.

However, human DHODH inhibitors have also been investigated as treatment for cancer, parasite infections (i.e. malaria) and viruses as well as in the agrochemicals industry. OBJECTIVE: An overview of current knowledge of hDHODH inhibitors and their potential uses in diseases where hDHODH is involved. METHOD: This review focuses on recent advances in the development and application of hDHODH inhibitors, specifically covering the patent field, starting from a brief description of enzyme topography and of the strategies usually followed in designing its selective inhibitors. RESULTS: The most important and well-described novelty is the fact that the discovery, in the autumn of 2016, that hDHODH inhibitors are able to induce in vivo myeloid differentiation has led to the possibility of developing novel hDHODH based treatments for Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML). CONCLUSION: The review will describe a variety of specific inhibitor classes and conclude on recent and future therapeutic perspectives for this target.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.org.']","['Lolli, Marco L', 'Sainas, Stefano', 'Pippione, Agnese C', 'Giorgis, Marta', 'Boschi, Donatella', 'Dosio, Franco']","['Lolli ML', 'Sainas S', 'Pippione AC', 'Giorgis M', 'Boschi D', 'Dosio F']","['Department of Drug Science and Technology, University of Turin, via Pietro Giuria 9, 10125 Turin.

These results were confirmed also by the Regional Environmental Protection Agency and the Regional Health Authority.

Lenalidomide is an immunomodulatory drug that may modulate anti-tumor immunity. We performed a study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of lenalidomide with mitoxantrone, etoposide and cytarabine (MEC) in relapsed/refractory AML. Adult patients with relapsed/refractory AML were eligible for this phase I dose-escalation study. We enrolled 35 patients using a ""3 + 3"" design, with a 10 patient expansion cohort at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Lenalidomide was initially given days 1-14 and MEC days 4-8; due to delayed count recovery, the protocol was amended to administer lenalidomide days 1-10. The dose of lenalidomide was then escalated starting at 5 mg/d (5-10-25-50). The primary objective was tolerability and MTD determination, with secondary outcomes including overall survival (OS). The MTD of lenalidomide combined with MEC was 50 mg/d days 1-10. Among the 35 enrolled patients, 12 achieved complete remission (CR) (34%, 90%CI 21-50%); 30-day mortality was 6% and 60-day mortality 13%. The median OS for all patients was 11.5 months. Among 17 patients treated at the MTD, 7 attained CR (41%); the median OS was not reached while 12-month OS was 61%. Following therapy with MEC and lenalidomide, patient CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells demonstrated increased inflammatory responses to autologous tumor lysate. The combination of MEC and lenalidomide is tolerable with an RP2D of lenalidomide 50 mg/d days 1-10, yielding encouraging response rates. Further studies are planned to explore the potential immunomodulatory effect of lenalidomide and MEC.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['DeAngelo, Daniel J', 'Brunner, Andrew M', 'Werner, Lillian', 'Avigan, David', 'Fathi, Amir T', 'Sperling, Adam S', 'Washington, Abigail', 'Stroopinsky, Dina', 'Rosenblatt, Jacalyn', 'McMasters, Malgorzata', 'Luptakova, Katarina', 'Wadleigh, Martha', 'Steensma, David P', 'Hobbs, Gabriela S', 'Attar, Eyal C', 'Amrein, Philip C', 'Ebert, Benjamin L', 'Stone, Richard M', 'Ballen, Karen K']","['DeAngelo DJ', 'Brunner AM', 'Werner L', 'Avigan D', 'Fathi AT', 'Sperling AS', 'Washington A', 'Stroopinsky D', 'Rosenblatt J', 'McMasters M', 'Luptakova K', 'Wadleigh M', 'Steensma DP', 'Hobbs GS', 'Attar EC', 'Amrein PC', 'Ebert BL', 'Stone RM', 'Ballen KK']","['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Beth-Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Beth-Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Beth-Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Beth-Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Beth-Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Takeda Oncology, Cambridge, Cambridge, MA.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Agios Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, Cambridge, MA.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article']",20171121,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Adult', 'Angiogenesis Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Lenalidomide/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'Salvage Therapy/methods', 'Survival Analysis']",,,2017/11/10 06:00,2018/12/12 06:00,['2017/11/10 06:00'],"['2017/10/12 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/27 00:00 [revised]', '2017/11/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [medline]', '2017/11/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.24968 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2018 Feb;93(2):254-261. doi: 10.1002/ajh.24968.

This translocation leads to ETV6-NTRK3 (EN) gene fusions resulting in ectopic expression of the NTRK3 neurotropic tyrosine receptor kinase moiety as well as oligomerization through the donated ETV6-sterile alpha motif domain. As yet, no in vitro cell line model carrying this anomaly is available. Here we genetically characterized the acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cell line AP-1060 and, by doing so, revealed the presence of a t(12;15)(p13;q25). Subsequently, we evaluated its suitability as a model for this important clinical entity. METHODS: Spectral karyotyping, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and genomic and transcriptomic microarray-based profiling were used to screen for the presence of EN fusions. qRT-PCR was used for quantitative expression analyses. Responses to AZ-23 (NTRK) and wortmannin (PI3K) inhibitors, as well as to arsenic trioxide (ATO), were assessed using colorimetric assays. An AZ-23 microarray screen was used to define the EN targetome, which was parsed bioinformatically. MAPK1 and MALAT1 activation were assayed using Western blotting and RNA-FISH, respectively, whereas an AML patient cohort was used to assess the clinical occurrence of MALAT1 activation. RESULTS: An EN fusion was detected in AP1060 cells which, accordingly, turned out to be hypersensitive to AZ-23. We also found that AZ-23 can potentiate the effect of ATO and inhibit the phosphorylation of its canonical target MAPK1. The AZ-23 microarray screen highlighted a novel EN target, MALAT1, which also proved sensitive to wortmannin. Finally, we found that MALAT1 was massively up-regulated in a subset of AML patients. CONCLUSIONS: From our data we conclude that AP-1060 may serve as a first publicly available preclinical model for EN. In addition, we conclude that these EN-positive cells are sensitive to the NTRK inhibitor AZ-23 and that this inhibitor may potentiate the therapeutic efficacy of ATO. Our data also highlight a novel AML EN target, MALAT1, which was so far only conspicuous in solid tumors.",,"['Chen, Suning', 'Nagel, Stefan', 'Schneider, Bjoern', 'Dai, Haiping', 'Geffers, Robert', 'Kaufmann, Maren', 'Meyer, Corinna', 'Pommerenke, Claudia', 'Thress, Kenneth S', 'Li, Jiao', 'Quentmeier, Hilmar', 'Drexler, Hans G', 'MacLeod, Roderick A F']","['Chen S', 'Nagel S', 'Schneider B', 'Dai H', 'Geffers R', 'Kaufmann M', 'Meyer C', 'Pommerenke C', 'Thress KS', 'Li J', 'Quentmeier H', 'Drexler HG', 'MacLeod RAF']","['Department of Human and Animal Cell Lines, DSMZ - German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Inhoffenstrasse 7b, 38124, Braunschweig, Germany.', ""Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, People's Republic of China."", 'Department of Human and Animal Cell Lines, DSMZ - German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Inhoffenstrasse 7b, 38124, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Department of Human and Animal Cell Lines, DSMZ - German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Inhoffenstrasse 7b, 38124, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology and Molecular Pathology, University of Rostock, Rostock, Germany.', 'Department of Human and Animal Cell Lines, DSMZ - German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Inhoffenstrasse 7b, 38124, Braunschweig, Germany.', ""Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, People's Republic of China."", 'Genome Analytics Research Group, Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Department of Human and Animal Cell Lines, DSMZ - German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Inhoffenstrasse 7b, 38124, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Department of Human and Animal Cell Lines, DSMZ - German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Inhoffenstrasse 7b, 38124, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Department of Human and Animal Cell Lines, DSMZ - German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Inhoffenstrasse 7b, 38124, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'AstraZeneca Oncology Innovative Medicines, Waltham, MA, USA.', ""Department of Hematology, Yixing People's Hospital of Jiangsu Province, Yixing, People's Republic of China."", 'Department of Human and Animal Cell Lines, DSMZ - German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Inhoffenstrasse 7b, 38124, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Department of Human and Animal Cell Lines, DSMZ - German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Inhoffenstrasse 7b, 38124, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Department of Human and Animal Cell Lines, DSMZ - German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Inhoffenstrasse 7b, 38124, Braunschweig, Germany. rafmacleod@gmail.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20171108,Netherlands,Cell Oncol (Dordr),Cellular oncology (Dordrecht),101552938,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Oxides/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['APL', 'ETV6', 'MALAT1', 'MAPK1', 'NTRK3']",2017/11/10 06:00,2018/08/02 06:00,['2017/11/10 06:00'],"['2017/10/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/02 06:00 [medline]', '2017/11/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s13402-017-0356-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s13402-017-0356-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Cell Oncol (Dordr). 2018 Feb;41(1):93-101. doi: 10.1007/s13402-017-0356-2.

Asparaginases deplete Gln, and asparaginase derived from Erwinia chrysanthemi (Erwinaze) appears to have the greatest glutaminase activity of the available asparaginases. In this Phase I study, we sought to determine the dose of Erwinaze that safely and effectively depletes plasma Gln levels to </= 120 mumol/L in patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) AML. Five patients were enrolled before the study was halted due to issues with Erwinaze manufacturing supply. All patients received Erwinaze at a dose of 25,000 IU/m(2) intravenously three times weekly for 2 weeks. Median trough plasma Gln level at 48 h after initial Erwinaze administration was 27.6 mumol/L, and 80% (lower limit of 1-sided 95% CI 34%) of patients achieved at least one undetectable plasma Gln value (< 12.5 mumol/L), with the fold reduction (FR) in Gln level at 3 days, relative to baseline, being 0.16 (p < 0.001 for rejecting FR = 1). No dose-limiting toxicities were identified. Two patients responded, one achieved partial remission and one achieved hematologic improvement after six doses of Erwinaze monotherapy. These data suggest asparaginase-induced Gln depletion may have an important role in the management of patients with AML, and support more pharmacologic and clinical studies on the mechanistically designed asparaginase combinations in AML.",,"['Emadi, Ashkan', 'Law, Jennie Y', 'Strovel, Erin T', 'Lapidus, Rena G', 'Jeng, Linda J B', 'Lee, Myounghee', 'Blitzer, Miriam G', 'Carter-Cooper, Brandon A', 'Sewell, Danielle', 'Van Der Merwe, Isabella', 'Philip, Sunita', 'Imran, Mohammad', 'Yu, Stephen L', 'Li, Hongxia', 'Amrein, Philip C', 'Duong, Vu H', 'Sausville, Edward A', 'Baer, Maria R', 'Fathi, Amir T', 'Singh, Zeba', 'Bentzen, Soren M']","['Emadi A', 'Law JY', 'Strovel ET', 'Lapidus RG', 'Jeng LJB', 'Lee M', 'Blitzer MG', 'Carter-Cooper BA', 'Sewell D', 'Van Der Merwe I', 'Philip S', 'Imran M', 'Yu SL', 'Li H', 'Amrein PC', 'Duong VH', 'Sausville EA', 'Baer MR', 'Fathi AT', 'Singh Z', 'Bentzen SM']","['University of Maryland Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center, Baltimore, USA. aemadi@umm.edu.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Maryland, Baltimore, USA. aemadi@umm.edu.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University of Maryland, Baltimore, USA. aemadi@umm.edu.', 'University of Maryland Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center, Baltimore, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Maryland, Baltimore, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Maryland, Baltimore, USA.', 'University of Maryland Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center, Baltimore, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Maryland, Baltimore, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Maryland, Baltimore, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Maryland, Baltimore, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Maryland, Baltimore, USA.', 'University of Maryland Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center, Baltimore, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Maryland, Baltimore, USA.', 'University of Maryland Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center, Baltimore, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Maryland, Baltimore, USA.', 'University of Maryland Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center, Baltimore, USA.', 'University of Maryland Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center, Baltimore, USA.', 'University of Maryland Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center, Baltimore, USA.', 'University of Maryland Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center, Baltimore, USA.', 'University of Maryland Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center, Baltimore, USA.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA.', 'University of Maryland Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center, Baltimore, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Maryland, Baltimore, USA.', 'University of Maryland Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center, Baltimore, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Maryland, Baltimore, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University of Maryland, Baltimore, USA.', 'University of Maryland Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center, Baltimore, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Maryland, Baltimore, USA.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Maryland, Baltimore, USA.', 'University of Maryland Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center, Baltimore, USA.', 'Epidemiology and Public Health, University of Maryland, Baltimore, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171108,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Asparaginase/*administration & dosage', 'Dickeya chrysanthemi/*enzymology', 'Female', 'Glutamine/*blood', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)', '*Asparaginase Erwinia Chrysanthemi (Erwinaze)', '*Asparaginase-induced glutamine depletion', '*Glutamine addiction in AML', '*Isocitrate Dehydrogenase Mutation (IDH)', '*Leukemia metabolism']",2017/11/10 06:00,2019/02/05 06:00,['2017/11/10 06:00'],"['2017/09/05 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/05 06:00 [medline]', '2017/11/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00280-017-3459-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s00280-017-3459-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2018 Jan;81(1):217-222. doi: 10.1007/s00280-017-3459-6.

CDDO-Me (Bardoxolone methyl), a potent Nrf2 activator and NF-kappaB inhibitor, is a promising candidate for cancer treatment including leukemia. However, the underlying mechanism for CDDO-Me in CML treatment is unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the molecular interactome of CDDO-Me in K562 cells using the quantitative proteomics approach stable-isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) and explore the underlying mechanisms using cell-based functional assays. A total of 1,555 proteins responded to CDDO-Me exposure, including FANCI, SRPK2, XPO5, HP1BP3, NELFCD, Na(+),K(+)-ATPase 1, etc. in K562 cells. A total of 246 signaling pathways and 25 networks regulating cell survival and death, cellular function and maintenance, energy production, protein synthesis, response to oxidative stress, and nucleic acid metabolism were involved. Our verification experiments confirmed that CDDO-Me down-regulated Na(+),K(+)-ATPase alpha1 in K562 cells, and significantly arrested cells in G2/M and S phases, accompanied by remarkable alterations in the expression of key cell cycle regulators. CDDO-Me caused mitochondria-, death receptor-dependent and ER stress-mediated apoptosis in K562 cells, also induced autophagy with the suppression of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. p38 MAPK/Erk1/2 signaling pathways contributed to both apoptosis- and autophagy-inducing effects of CDDO-Me in K562 cells. Taken together, these data demonstrate that CDDO-Me is a potential anti-cancer agent that targets cell cycle, apoptosis, and autophagy in the treatment of CML.",,"['Wang, Xin-Yu', 'Zhang, Xue-Hong', 'Peng, Li', 'Liu, Zheng', 'Yang, Yin-Xue', 'He, Zhi-Xu', 'Dang, Hong-Wan', 'Zhou, Shu-Feng']","['Wang XY', 'Zhang XH', 'Peng L', 'Liu Z', 'Yang YX', 'He ZX', 'Dang HW', 'Zhou SF']","['Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, General Hospital of Ningxia Medical UniversityYinchuan, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, General Hospital of Ningxia Medical UniversityYinchuan, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, China.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of South FloridaTampa, FL, USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of South FloridaTampa, FL, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, General Hospital of Ningxia Medical UniversityYinchuan, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, General Hospital of Ningxia Medical UniversityYinchuan, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, China.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, General Hospital of Ningxia Medical UniversityYinchuan, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, China.', 'Department of Colorectal Surgery, General Hospital, Ningxia Medical UniversityYinchuan, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, China.', 'Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine, Stem Cell and Tissue Engineering Research Center & Sino-US Joint Laboratory for Medical Sciences, Guizhou Medical UniversityGuiyang, Guizhou, China.', 'Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, General Hospital of Ningxia Medical UniversityYinchuan, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, General Hospital of Ningxia Medical UniversityYinchuan, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, China.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of South FloridaTampa, FL, USA.', 'Department of Bioengineering and Biotechnology, College of Chemical Engineering, Huaqiao UniversityXiamen, Fujian 361021, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20171015,United States,Am J Transl Res,American journal of translational research,101493030,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CDDO-Me/Bardoxolone methyl', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'K+-ATPase alpha1', 'K562 cells', 'Na+', 'SILAC', 'apoptosis', 'autophagy', 'cell cycle']",2017/11/10 06:00,2017/11/10 06:01,['2017/11/10 06:00'],"['2017/06/07 00:00 [received]', '2017/09/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/11/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/10 06:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Am J Transl Res. 2017 Oct 15;9(10):4652-4672. eCollection 2017.,PMC5666072,,,,,,,['None.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our objective was to study the characteristics, outcomes and predictors of mortality of patients with HMs who required intubation for ARF. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study evaluated all patients with HMs who were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of King Abdul-Aziz Medical City-Riyadh between 2008 and 2013 and required invasive mechanical ventilation. We noted their baseline characteristics, treatments and different outcomes. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate predictors of hospital mortality. RESULTS: During the 6-year period, 190 patients with HMs were admitted to the ICU and 122 (64.2%) required intubation for ARF. These patients had mean age of 57.2 +/- 19.3 years and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score of 28.0 +/- 7.8 and were predominantly males (63.4%). Lymphoma (44.3%) and acute leukemia (38.5%) were the most common hematologic malignancy. Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) was tried in 22 patients (18.0%) but failed. The code status was changed to ""Do-Not-Resuscitate"" for 39 patients (32.0%) during ICU stay. Hospital mortality was 70.5% and most deaths (81.4%) occurred in the ICU. The mortality of patients with ""Do-Not-Resuscitate"" status was 97.4%. On multivariable logistic regression analysis, male gender (odds ratio (OR), 6.74; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.24-20.30), septic shock (OR, 6.61; 95% CI, 1.93-22.66) were independent mortality predictors. Remission status, non-NIV failure and chemotherapy during ICU stay were not associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with HMs requiring intubation had high mortality (70.5%).

Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is a chronic leukaemia of the haematopoietic stem cells affecting mostly adults. The disease results from a translocation of the Philadelphia chromosome in stem cells of the bone marrow. CML patients usually present with mild to moderate anaemia and with decreased, normal, or increased platelet counts. CML represents 0.5% of all new cancer cases in the United States (2016). In 2016, an estimated 1070 people would die of this disease in the United States. Platelets serve as a means for tumours to increase growth and to provide physical- and mechanical support to elude the immune system and to metastasize. Currently there is no literature available on the role that platelets play in CML progression, despite literature reporting the fact that platelet count and size are affected. Resistance to CML treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors can be as a result of acquired resistance ensuing from mutations in the tyrosine kinase domains, loss of response or poor tolerance. In CML this resistance has recently become linked to bone marrow (BM) angiogenesis which aids in the growth and survival of leukaemia cells. The discovery of the lungs as a site of haematopoietic progenitors, suggests that CML resistance is not localized to the bone marrow and that the mutations leading to the disease and resistance to treatment may also occur in the haematopoietic progenitors in the lungs. In conclusion, platelets are significantly affected during CML progression and treatment. Investigation into the role that platelets play in CML progression is vital including how treatment affects the cell death mechanisms of platelets.",,"['Repsold, Lisa', 'Pool, Roger', 'Karodia, Mohammed', 'Tintinger, Gregory', 'Joubert, Annie Margaretha']","['Repsold L', 'Pool R', 'Karodia M', 'Tintinger G', 'Joubert AM']","['Department of Physiology, Faculty of Health Sciences, School of Medicine, University of Pretoria, Pretoria, Gauteng South Africa.0000 0001 2107 2298grid.49697.35', 'Department of Haematology, Faculty of Health Sciences, School of Medicine, University of Pretoria, Pretoria, Gauteng South Africa.0000 0001 2107 2298grid.49697.35', 'Department of Haematology, Faculty of Health Sciences, School of Medicine, University of Pretoria, Pretoria, Gauteng South Africa.0000 0001 2107 2298grid.49697.35', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, School of Medicine, University of Pretoria, Pretoria, Gauteng South Africa.0000 0001 2107 2298grid.49697.35', 'Department of Physiology, Faculty of Health Sciences, School of Medicine, University of Pretoria, Pretoria, Gauteng South Africa.0000 0001 2107 2298grid.49697.35']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20171030,England,Cancer Cell Int,Cancer cell international,101139795,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Angiogenesis', 'Apoptosis', 'Autophagy', 'Chronic myeloid leukaemia', 'Platelets']",2017/11/10 06:00,2017/11/10 06:01,['2017/11/10 06:00'],"['2017/06/24 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/11/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/10 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12935-017-0460-4 [doi]', '460 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Cell Int. 2017 Oct 30;17:89. doi: 10.1186/s12935-017-0460-4. eCollection 2017.,PMC5664592,,,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-6931-7554'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While research into secretory stress signaling has so far mostly focused on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), emerging data suggest that the Golgi itself serves as an important signaling hub capable of initiating stress responses. To systematically identify novel Golgi stress mediators, we performed a transcriptomic analysis of cells exposed to three different pharmacological compounds known to elicit Golgi fragmentation: brefeldin A, golgicide A, and monensin. Subsequent gene-set enrichment analysis revealed a significant contribution of the ETS family transcription factors ELK1, GABPA/B, and ETS1 to the control of gene expression following compound treatment. Induction of Golgi stress leads to a late activation of the ETS upstream kinases MEK1/2 and ERK1/2, resulting in enhanced ETS factor activity and the transcription of ETS family target genes related to spliceosome function and cell death induction via alternate MCL1 splicing. Further genetic analyses using loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments suggest that these transcription factors operate in parallel.","['(c) 2018 Baumann et al.

CD38 is a transmembrane glycoprotein with ectoenzymatic activity, and also functions as a receptor and adhesion molecule. Altogether, this has triggered the development of several CD38 antibodies including daratumumab (fully human), isatuximab (chimeric), and MOR202 (fully human). CD38 antibodies have pleiotropic mechanisms of action including Fc-dependent immune-effector mechanisms, direct apoptotic activity, and immunomodulatory effects by the elimination of CD38(+) immune-suppressor cells. CD38-targeting antibodies are generally well tolerated and induce partial response or better in approximately 30% of heavily pretreated MM patients as monotherapy. Based on their distinct mechanisms of action, favorable toxicity profile, and single-agent activity, CD38 antibodies are attractive partners in combination regimens. Indeed, deep responses and prolonged progression-free survival can be achieved in relapsed/refractory MM patients when CD38 antibodies are combined with immunomodulatory agents or proteasome inhibitors. Infusion-related reactions, which typically occur during the first infusion, are the most frequent adverse events. Attention should also be paid to the interference of CD38 antibodies with certain laboratory assays, which may complicate response evaluation and blood compatibility testing. Several studies are currently examining the role of CD38-based therapies in newly diagnosed and high-risk smoldering MM. Furthermore, CD38 antibodies are currently also under investigation in other hematologic malignancies, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia, natural killer/T-cell lymphoma, and acute myeloid leukemia, as well as in solid tumors.",['(c) 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['van de Donk, Niels W C J', 'Richardson, Paul G', 'Malavasi, Fabio']","['van de Donk NWCJ', 'Richardson PG', 'Malavasi F']","['Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Jerome Lipper Myeloma Center, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.', 'Laboratory of Immunogenetics, Department of Medical Sciences and.', 'Center for Experimental Research and Medical Studies (CeRMS), University of Turin, Turin, Italy; and.', 'Department of Transplantation Immunology, University Hospital, Turin, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20171108,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/*antagonists & inhibitors/immunology', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/immunology', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/immunology']",,,2017/11/10 06:00,2018/10/13 06:00,['2017/11/10 06:00'],"['2017/05/31 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/13 06:00 [medline]', '2017/11/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)32581-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2017-06-740944 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2018 Jan 4;131(1):13-29. doi: 10.1182/blood-2017-06-740944.

This article reviews the landscape of PD-1/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression and current PD-1 blockade immunotherapy trials in B-cell lymphomas. Most notably, in relapsed/refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma, which frequently has increased PD-1(+) tumor-infiltrating T cells, 9p24.1 genetic alteration, and high PD-L1 expression, anti-PD-1 monotherapy has demonstrated remarkable objective response rates (ORRs) of 65% to 87% and durable disease control in phase 1/2 clinical trials. The median duration of response was 16 months in a phase 2 trial. PD-1 blockade has also shown promise in a phase 1 trial of nivolumab in relapsed/refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas, including follicular lymphoma, which often displays abundant PD-1 expression on intratumoral T cells, and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, which variably expresses PD-1 and PD-L1. In primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma, which frequently has 9p24.1 alterations, the ORR was 35% in a phase 2 trial of pembrolizumab. In contrast, the ORR with pembrolizumab was 0% in relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and 44% in CLL with Richter transformation in a phase 2 trial. T cells from CLL patients have elevated PD-1 expression; CLL PD-1(+) T cells can exhibit a pseudo-exhaustion or a replicative senescence phenotype. PD-1 expression was also found in marginal zone lymphoma but not in mantle cell lymphoma, although currently anti-PD-1 clinical trial data are not available. Mechanisms and predictive biomarkers for PD-1 blockade immunotherapy, treatment-related adverse events, hyperprogression, and combination therapies are discussed in the context of B-cell lymphomas.",['(c) 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Xu-Monette, Zijun Y', 'Zhou, Jianfeng', 'Young, Ken H']","['Xu-Monette ZY', 'Zhou J', 'Young KH']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Hematology and Cancer Biology Research Center, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China; and.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Graduate School of Biomedical Science, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20171108,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'B7-H1 Antigen/*antagonists & inhibitors/immunology', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*immunology', 'Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor/*antagonists & inhibitors/immunology']",,,2017/11/10 06:00,2018/10/13 06:00,['2017/11/10 06:00'],"['2017/07/05 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/13 06:00 [medline]', '2017/11/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)32586-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2017-07-740993 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2018 Jan 4;131(1):68-83. doi: 10.1182/blood-2017-07-740993.

Immunotherapy holds the promise to meet this need, because it does not rely on the cytotoxic mechanism of conventional therapies. Among different forms of immunotherapy, redirecting T cells to hematological malignancies with bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) is an attractive strategy. BsAbs are an ""off-the-shelf"" product that is easily scalable in contrast to adoptive T-cell therapies. Among these, the bispecific T-cell engager blinatumomab has emerged as the most successful BsAb to date. It consists of 2 single-chain variable fragments specific for CD19 present on B-cell malignancies and CD3 expressed on almost all T cells. Blinatumomab has shown potent antitumor activity as a single agent, particularly for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, resulting in its US Food and Drug Administration approval. However, although successful in inducing remissions, these are normally short-lived, with median response durations of <1 year. Nevertheless, the success of blinatumomab has reinvigorated the BsAb field, which is bustling with preclinical and clinical studies for not only B-cell-derived lymphoblastic leukemia and lymphoma but also acute myeloid leukemia and multiple myeloma.

It is extensively metabolized by CYP3A4 to form two major active metabolites, CGP52421 and CGP62221. In vitro and clinical drug-drug interaction (DDI) studies indicated that midostaurin and its metabolites are substrates, reversible and time-dependent inhibitors, and inducers of CYP3A4. A simultaneous pharmacokinetic model of parent and active metabolites was initially developed by incorporating data from in vitro, preclinical, and clinical pharmacokinetic studies in healthy volunteers and in patients with AML or advSM. The model reasonably predicted changes in midostaurin exposure after single-dose administration with ketoconazole (a 5.8-fold predicted versus 6.1-fold observed increase) and rifampicin (90% predicted versus 94% observed reduction) as well as changes in midazolam exposure (1.0 predicted versus 1.2 observed ratio) after daily dosing of midostaurin for 4 days. The qualified model was then applied to predict the DDI effect with other CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers and the DDI potential with midazolam under steady-state conditions. The simulated midazolam area under the curve ratio of 0.54 and an accompanying observed 1.9-fold increase in the CYP3A4 activity of biomarker 4beta-hydroxycholesterol indicated a weak-to-moderate CYP3A4 induction by midostaurin and its metabolites at steady state in patients with advSM. In conclusion, a simultaneous parent-and-active-metabolite modeling approach allowed predictions under steady-state conditions that were not possible to achieve in healthy subjects. Furthermore, endogenous biomarker data enabled evaluation of the net effect of midostaurin and its metabolites on CYP3A4 activity at steady state and increased confidence in DDI predictions.","['Copyright (c) 2018 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental', 'Therapeutics.']","['Gu, Helen', 'Dutreix, Catherine', 'Rebello, Sam', 'Ouatas, Taoufik', 'Wang, Lai', 'Chun, Dung Yu', 'Einolf, Heidi J', 'He, Handan']","['Gu H', 'Dutreix C', 'Rebello S', 'Ouatas T', 'Wang L', 'Chun DY', 'Einolf HJ', 'He H']","['Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, East Hanover, New Jersey (H.G., S.R., L.W., D.Y.C., H.J.E., H.H.); Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, Basel, Switzerland (C.D., T.O.); and Insmed Inc., Bridgewater, New Jersey (D.Y.C.) helen.gu@novartis.com.', 'Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, East Hanover, New Jersey (H.G., S.R., L.W., D.Y.C., H.J.E., H.H.); Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, Basel, Switzerland (C.D., T.O.); and Insmed Inc., Bridgewater, New Jersey (D.Y.C.).', 'Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, East Hanover, New Jersey (H.G., S.R., L.W., D.Y.C., H.J.E., H.H.); Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, Basel, Switzerland (C.D., T.O.); and Insmed Inc., Bridgewater, New Jersey (D.Y.C.).', 'Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, East Hanover, New Jersey (H.G., S.R., L.W., D.Y.C., H.J.E., H.H.); Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, Basel, Switzerland (C.D., T.O.); and Insmed Inc., Bridgewater, New Jersey (D.Y.C.).', 'Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, East Hanover, New Jersey (H.G., S.R., L.W., D.Y.C., H.J.E., H.H.); Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, Basel, Switzerland (C.D., T.O.); and Insmed Inc., Bridgewater, New Jersey (D.Y.C.).', 'Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, East Hanover, New Jersey (H.G., S.R., L.W., D.Y.C., H.J.E., H.H.); Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, Basel, Switzerland (C.D., T.O.); and Insmed Inc., Bridgewater, New Jersey (D.Y.C.).', 'Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, East Hanover, New Jersey (H.G., S.R., L.W., D.Y.C., H.J.E., H.H.); Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, Basel, Switzerland (C.D., T.O.); and Insmed Inc., Bridgewater, New Jersey (D.Y.C.).', 'Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, East Hanover, New Jersey (H.G., S.R., L.W., D.Y.C., H.J.E., H.H.); Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, Basel, Switzerland (C.D., T.O.); and Insmed Inc., Bridgewater, New Jersey (D.Y.C.).']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171108,United States,Drug Metab Dispos,Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals,9421550,IM,"['Adult', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A/*metabolism', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inducers/metabolism/pharmacokinetics', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inhibitors/metabolism/pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Interactions/*physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydroxycholesterols/metabolism', 'Ketoconazole/metabolism/pharmacokinetics', 'Male', 'Midazolam/metabolism/pharmacokinetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Biological', 'Rifampin/metabolism/pharmacokinetics', 'Staurosporine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacokinetics', 'Young Adult']",,,2017/11/10 06:00,2018/10/18 06:00,['2017/11/10 06:00'],"['2017/08/15 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/18 06:00 [medline]', '2017/11/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['dmd.117.078006 [pii]', '10.1124/dmd.117.078006 [doi]']",ppublish,Drug Metab Dispos. 2018 Feb;46(2):109-121. doi: 10.1124/dmd.117.078006.

Previously, we observed that adipocytes protect acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells from the anthracycline, daunorubicin. In this study, it is determined whether adipocytes clear daunorubicin from the tumor microenvironment (TME). Intracellular daunorubicin concentrations were evaluated using fluorescence. Daunorubicin and its largely inactive metabolite, daunorubicinol, were analytically measured in media, cells, and tissues using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS). Expression of daunorubicin-metabolizing enzymes, aldo-keto reductases (AKR1A1, AKR1B1, AKR1C1, AKR1C2, AKR1C3, and AKR7A2) and carbonyl reductases (CBR1, CBR3), in human adipose tissue, were queried using public databases and directly measured by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and immunoblot. Adipose tissue AKR activity was measured by colorimetric assay. Adipocytes absorbed and efficiently metabolized daunorubicin to daunorubicinol, reducing its antileukemia effect in the local microenvironment. Murine studies confirmed adipose tissue conversion of daunorubicin to daunorubicinol in vivo Adipocytes expressed high levels of AKR and CBR isoenzymes that deactivate anthracyclines. Indeed, adipocyte protein levels of AKR1C1, AKR1C2, and AKR1C3 are higher than all other human noncancerous cell types. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that adipocytes metabolize and inactivate a therapeutic drug. Adipocyte-mediated daunorubicin metabolism reduces active drug concentration in the TME. These results could be clinically important for adipocyte-rich cancer microenvironments such as omentum, breast, and marrow. As AKR and CBR enzymes metabolize several drugs, and can be expressed at higher levels in obese individuals, this proof-of-principle finding has important implications across many diseases.Implications: Adipocyte absorption and metabolism of chemotherapies can reduce cytotoxicity in cancer microenvironments, potentially contributing to poorer survival outcomes.

Siblings experience similar stress to that of the ill child, including anger, depression, jealousy, guilt, and social isolation. School reentry programs are shown to be positive interventions for patients, it is hypothesized that similar outcomes exist for siblings. OBJECTIVE: To examine the feasibility of studying the impact of the Ontario Oncology Nurse School Visitation Program on the well-being and school adjustment of siblings of pediatric cancer patients. METHODS: Fourteen sibling participants and parents completed a semistructured interview and the PedsQL((R)) questionnaire before and after a nurse school visit. School attendance was also compared and data were collected for logistics of study procedures. RESULTS: The mode of data collection was agreeable and easy to plan and execute. School attendance showed a reduction of days missed; there was no significant impact on PedsQL results but the interviews yielded positive feedback. CONCLUSIONS: The outlook for siblings improves with the support of family members and health care professionals.

Antisense oligonucleotide promises to be no less specific than antibodies and inhibitors, but more interesting for pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. We addressed this using the published CD49d antisense drug ATL1102. In vitro, we incubated/nucleofected the ALL cell line Kasumi-2 with ATL1102. In vivo, immunodeficient hosts were engrafted with primary ALL cells and treated with ATL1102. Changes in expression of CD49d mRNA and CD49d protein, and of cooperating gene products, including ss1 integrin and CXCR4, as well as survival in the mouse experiments were quantified. We observed dose-dependent down-regulation of CD49d mRNA and protein levels and its partner integrin ss1 cell surface protein level and, up-regulation of CXCR4 surface expression. The suppression was more pronounced after nucleofection than after incubation, where down-regulation was significant only at the higher doses. In vivo effects of ATL1102 were not sufficient to translate into ""clinical"" benefit in the leukemia model. In summary, antisense oligonucleotides are successful tools for specifically modulating gene expression but sufficient delivery to down-regulate CD49d in vivo may be difficult to achieve.",,"['Duchartre, Yann', 'Bachl, Stefanie', 'Kim, Hye Na', 'Gang, Eun Ji', 'Lee, Solah', 'Liu, Hsiao-Chuan', 'Shung, Kirk', 'Xu, Ruth', 'Kruse, Aaron', 'Tachas, George', 'Bonig, Halvard', 'Kim, Yong-Mi']","['Duchartre Y', 'Bachl S', 'Kim HN', 'Gang EJ', 'Lee S', 'Liu HC', 'Shung K', 'Xu R', 'Kruse A', 'Tachas G', 'Bonig H', 'Kim YM']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles, United States of America."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles, United States of America."", 'Institute for Transfusion Medicine and Immunohematology, Goethe University, and German Red Cross Blood Service Baden-Wurttemberg-Hessen, Frankfurt, Germany.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles, United States of America."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles, United States of America."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles, United States of America."", 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, United States of America.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, United States of America.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles, United States of America."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles, United States of America."", 'Department of Pathology, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, United States of America.', 'Antisense Therapeutics Limited, Toorak, Victoria, Australia.', 'Institute for Transfusion Medicine and Immunohematology, Goethe University, and German Red Cross Blood Service Baden-Wurttemberg-Hessen, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, United States of America.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles, United States of America.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20171108,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Injections, Subcutaneous', 'Integrin alpha4/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Integrin beta1/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/*genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Receptors, CXCR4/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2017/11/09 06:00,2017/11/29 06:00,['2017/11/09 06:00'],"['2017/07/19 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/29 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0187684 [doi]', 'PONE-D-17-26412 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2017 Nov 8;12(11):e0187684. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0187684. eCollection 2017.,PMC5678723,"['0 (CXCR4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Integrin beta1)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '143198-26-9 (Integrin alpha4)']",['R01 CA172896/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3793-6438'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells were cultured as a signal transduction interface to induce allergic reaction on the gate oxide surface of the FET, because IgE antibodies, which bind to Fcepsilon receptors at the RBL-2H3 cell membrane, are specifically cross-linked by allergens, resulting in the allergic response of RBL-2H3 cells. In fact, the surface potential at the FET gate decreased owing to secretions such as histamine from the IgE-bound RBL-2H3 cells, which reacted with the allergen. This is because histamine, as one of the candidate secretions, shows basicity, resulting in a change in pH around the cell/gate interface. That is, the RBL-2H3-cell-based FET used in this study was originally from an ion-sensitive FET (ISFET), whose oxide surface (Ta2O5) with hydroxyl groups is fully responsive to pH on the basis of the equilibrium reaction. The allergic response of RBL-2H3 cells on the gate was also confirmed by estimating the amount of beta-hexosaminidase released together with histamine and was analyzed using the electrical properties based on an inflammatory response of secreted histamine with the vascular endothelial cell-based FET. Thus, the allergic responses were monitored in a nonoptical and real-time manner using the cell-based FETs with the cellular layers on the gate, which reproduced the in vivo system and were useful for the reliable detection of the allergic reaction.",,"['Yang, Haoyue', 'Honda, Masatoshi', 'Saito, Akiko', 'Kajisa, Taira', 'Yanase, Yuhki', 'Sakata, Toshiya']","['Yang H', 'Honda M', 'Saito A', 'Kajisa T', 'Yanase Y', 'Sakata T']","['Department of Materials Engineering, School of Engineering, The University of Tokyo , 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8656, Japan.', 'Department of Materials Engineering, School of Engineering, The University of Tokyo , 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8656, Japan.', 'Department of Materials Engineering, School of Engineering, The University of Tokyo , 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8656, Japan.', 'Department of Materials Engineering, School of Engineering, The University of Tokyo , 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8656, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Division of Molecular Medical Science, Graduate School of Biomedical Science, Hiroshima University , 1-2-3 Kasumi, Minami-ku, Hiroshima 734-8551, Japan.', 'Department of Materials Engineering, School of Engineering, The University of Tokyo , 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8656, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171115,United States,Anal Chem,Analytical chemistry,0370536,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Immobilized/immunology/*metabolism', 'Electrochemical Techniques/instrumentation/*methods', 'Histamine/metabolism', 'Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Hypersensitivity/*diagnosis', 'Immunoglobulin E/immunology', 'Oxides/chemistry', 'Rats', 'Tantalum/chemistry', '*Transistors, Electronic']",,,2017/11/09 06:00,2019/03/12 06:00,['2017/11/09 06:00'],"['2017/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/12 06:00 [medline]', '2017/11/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.analchem.7b03688 [doi]'],ppublish,Anal Chem. 2017 Dec 5;89(23):12918-12923. doi: 10.1021/acs.analchem.7b03688.

Another significant group of patients is being overtreated, which causes long-lasting side effects. Identification of molecules controlling drug resistance in T-ALL is crucial for treatment optimisation in both scenarios. We report here the EphB6 receptor is frequently overexpressed in T-ALL. Remarkably, our observations indicate that EphB6 acts in T-ALL cells to enhance sensitivity to a DNA-damaging drug, doxorubicin, as interruption of EphB6 activity interferes with the efficiency of doxorubicin-induced eradication of T-ALL cells in cell culture and in xenograft animals. This effect relies on the protection of Akt kinase signaling, while Akt inhibition combined with doxorubicin application produces synergistic effects on the elimination of EphB6-deficient T-ALL cells. These data imply that EphB6 suppresses T-ALL resistance by interfering with Akt activity. Our observations highlight a novel role for EphB6 in reducing drug resistance of T-ALL and suggest that doxorubicin treatment should produce better results if personalised based on EphB6 levels. If successfully verified in clinical studies, this approach should improve outcomes for T-ALL patients resistant to current therapies and for patients, who are being overtreated.",,"['El Zawily, Amr', 'McEwen, Emily', 'Toosi, Behzad', 'Vizeacoumar, Frederick S', 'Freywald, Tanya', 'Vizeacoumar, Franco J', 'Freywald, Andrew']","['El Zawily A', 'McEwen E', 'Toosi B', 'Vizeacoumar FS', 'Freywald T', 'Vizeacoumar FJ', 'Freywald A']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Saskatchewan, Royal University Hospital, 103 Hospital Drive, Saskatoon, SK, S7N 0W8, Canada.', 'Faculty of Science, Damanhour University, Damanhour, 22516, Egypt.', 'Department of Biochemistry, University of Saskatchewan, 107 Wiggins Road, Saskatoon, SK, S7N 5E5, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Saskatchewan, Royal University Hospital, 103 Hospital Drive, Saskatoon, SK, S7N 0W8, Canada.', 'Department of Oncology, University of Saskatchewan,107 Wiggins Road, Saskatoon, SK, S7N 5E5, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Saskatchewan, Royal University Hospital, 103 Hospital Drive, Saskatoon, SK, S7N 0W8, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Saskatchewan, Royal University Hospital, 103 Hospital Drive, Saskatoon, SK, S7N 0W8, Canada. franco.vizeacoumar@usask.ca.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Saskatchewan, Royal University Hospital, 103 Hospital Drive, Saskatoon, SK, S7N 0W8, Canada. andrew.freywald@usask.ca.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171107,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Doxorubicin/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Receptor, EphB6/*metabolism']",,,2017/11/09 06:00,2019/07/31 06:00,['2017/11/09 06:00'],"['2017/07/19 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/31 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-017-15200-3 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-017-15200-3 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2017 Nov 7;7(1):14767. doi: 10.1038/s41598-017-15200-3.,PMC5676711,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Receptor, EphB6)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",['132192/CIHR/Canada'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated flow cytometry immunophenotyping (FCI) performance for improving detection of central nervous system (CNS) involvement in ALL. METHODS: This prospective study included analysis of consecutive CSF samples of patients of all ages with ALL at 3 clinical stages: new diagnosis, relapse suspicion, and after relapse treatment. Manual, cytospin, automated, and FCI methods were compared and their performance statistically assessed. Using FCI as the reference method, optimal CSF cutoff cell count that better correlated with presence of lymphoblasts was established by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. RESULTS: Seventy-seven CSF samples were investigated, 35 (45.4%) from newly diagnosed cases, 30 (39%) suspicion of relapse, and 12 (15.6%) after treatment for relapse. Median manual WBC count in patients with CNS involvement detected by FCI was 3.75 cells/muL (0.0-1280), and this was also the count that best correlated with CNS infiltration (sensitivity, 50.0%; specificity, 82.2%). Compared with FCI, CCC sensitivity and specificity were 28.6% and 100%. Automated CSF WBC count in patients with CNS involvement detected by FCI was 5 (0.0-1578). For automated count, optimal WBC cutoff was 4.5 cells/muL (sensitivity, 62.5%; specificity, 70.5%).

Although a recent study showed that CHFR hypermethylation was a frequent event in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and correlated with adverse clinical outcome, herein, we found that CHFR methylation was a rare event in patients with myeloid malignancies (including AML, chronic myeloid leukemia, and myelodysplastic syndromes), but its expression may serve as an independent prognostic biomarker in AML. CHFR expression was assessed by real-time quantitative PCR, whereas CHFR methylation was detected by methylation-specific PCR and bisulfite sequencing PCR. In AML patients, lower CHFR expression was associated with lower complete remission (CR) rate, and CHFR expression was significantly increased in CR after chemotherapy. Moreover, patients with lower CHFR expression showed shorter overall survival and leukemia-free survival, and multivariate analysis confirmed that lower CHFR expression was an independent risk factor in AML. Importantly, the prognostic value of CHFR expression was validated using the published Gene Expression Omnibus datasets. Notably, CHFR promoter was nearly unmethylated in patients with myeloid malignancies. Our findings revealed that lower CHFR expression was independently associated with unfavorable prognosis in AML. Moreover, aberrant CHFR promoter methylation was a rare event in myeloid malignances.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Zhou, Jing-Dong', 'Zhang, Ting-Juan', 'Li, Xi-Xi', 'Ma, Ji-Chun', 'Guo, Hong', 'Wen, Xiang-Mei', 'Yao, Dong-Ming', 'Zhang, Wei', 'Lin, Jiang', 'Qian, Jun']","['Zhou JD', 'Zhang TJ', 'Li XX', 'Ma JC', 'Guo H', 'Wen XM', 'Yao DM', 'Zhang W', 'Lin J', 'Qian J']","[""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, P.R.

Cells were incubated in the presence of IMA or NIL. Concomitantly, specific inhibitors were applied to analyze the inhibition of the VD3 processing cytochrome P450 isoenzyme family by TKIs. In vitro, IMA and NIL significantly impaired the production of calcitriol in HaCaT and cultured ORSKC cells from hair follicles of IMA treated children. For NIL, this inhibitory effect demonstrated a 4fold increase. In HaCaT and ORSKC, application of specific CYP450 inhibitors revealed that CYP27B1 was impaired by IMA and NIL leading to an intracellular accumulation of calcidiol. However, during TKI treatment, KC of IMA treated children revealed no differences in calcidiol and calcitriol levels.

In the current study, immunohistochemistry revealed an overexpression of CCDC34 in CRC tissues compared with paracancerous tissue (chi2=29.810; P<0.001). Furthermore, CCDC34 expression was revealed to be associated with tumor invasion depth and lymphatic metastasis (chi2=4.343, P=0.037; chi2=7.915, P=0.005). Additionally, the inhibition of CCDC34 expression in SW620 cells led to reduced tumor cell activity, increased apoptosis rate and reduced invasion ability, and expression of apoptosis and invasionassociated genes varied simultaneously which demonstrated that B cell leukemia/lymphoma 2, survivin, Ncadherin, and MMP9 were decreased, whereas Ecadherin increased significantly in cells of CCDC34siRNA group compared with the control group (P<0.05).

The aim of the present study was to identify a combination micro (mi)RNA signature that enhanced the prognostic prediction for PAAD. Following analysis of the data available from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), 175 PAAD samples were selected for the present study, and the associations between 494 miRNAs and OS were investigated. The prognostic value of all miRNAs was analyzed by multivariate Cox regression, and the miRNAs were ranked according to the hazard ratio (HR) and Pvalues. The top 5 miRNAs (miR1301, miR125a, miR376c, miR328 and miR376b) were significantly associated with OS (HR=0.139; 95% confidence interval, 0.0430.443; P<0.001), thus demonstrating that this panel was able to serve as an independent prognostic factor for PAAD. In addition, the present study also predicted the target genes of the top 10 miRNAs with the highest prognostic values using 12 different prediction software, and enrichment signaling pathway analyses elucidated that several pathways may be markedly associated with these miRNAs, including 'Pathways in cancer', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Glioma' and 'MicroRNAs in cancer'. Lastly, ubiquitin C, epidermal growth factor receptor, estrogen receptor 1, mitogenactivated protein kinase 1, mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 4 and androgen receptor may be the hub genes revealed by STRING analysis. The present study identified several miRNAs, particularly a fivemiRNApool, that may be reliable, independent factors for predicting survival in patients with PAAD.

However, the underlying mechanism of HDW circumventing drug resistance of cancer cells remains to be elucidated. Cancer cell resistance to apoptosis and activation of the phosphatidylinositol3kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathway have been implicated as major factors in the acquired resistance to chemotherapeutic anticancer drugs. The present study investigated the effect and mechanisms of action of ethanol extract of Hedyotis diffusa Willd (EEHDW) on the proliferation and apoptosis of CRC 5fluorouracil (5FU) resistant (HCT8/5FU) cells. CRC HCT8/5FU cell viability following treatment with EEHDW was determined using MTT and colony formation assay. In addition, Annexin V/propidium iodide staining with flow cytometry analysis and 4',6diamidino2phenylindole staining were used to determine the apoptosis of drugresistant cancer cells following treatment with EEHDW. The mRNA and protein expression levels of B cell leukemia/lymphoma (Bcl2), Bcl2 associated X (Bax), cyclin dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), cyclin D1 and p21 were evaluated using reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis, respectively. Furthermore, activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and expression of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), PI3K, AKT and phosphorylated (p)AKT were determined. EEHDW significantly reduced cell viability, inhibited cell colony formation and promoted apoptosis of HCT8/5FU cells. Furthermore, EEHDW significantly downregulated the expression of Bcl2, cyclin D1 and CDK4 and upregulated the expression of Bax and p21. In addition, EEHDW inhibited the activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway by increasing expression of PTEN and suppressing the expression of PI3K and pAKT. The present study provided the first direct evidence that EEHDW may overcome drugresistance in human CRC cells by inhibiting PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and provides a basis for the improved therapeutic use of HDW in the clinical treatment of cancer.",,"['Li, Qiongyu', 'Lai, Zijun', 'Yan, Zhaokun', 'Peng, Jun', 'Jin, Yiyi', 'Wei, Lihui', 'Lin, Jiumao']","['Li Q', 'Lai Z', 'Yan Z', 'Peng J', 'Jin Y', 'Wei L', 'Lin J']","['Academy of Integrative Medicine, Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Fuzhou, Fujian 350122, P.R.

The p53 protein network regulates important mechanisms in DNA damage repair, cell cycle regulation/checkpoints, and cell senescence and apoptosis, as demonstrated by its ability to positively regulate the expression of various pro-apoptotic genes, including B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax). In the present study, it was observed that the mRNA levels of STAT5A and STAT5B were upregulated in patients with imatinib-resistant CML and in the imatinib-resistant K562/G CML cell line. In addition, increased expression of STAT5 was observed in the BCR-ABL1 mutation group, compared with that in the non-BCR-ABL1 mutation group, regardless of patient imatinib resistance state. Elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and DNA double-strand breaks were identified in K562/G cells using flow cytometric and phosphorylated H2AX (gamma-H2AX) foci immunofluorescence assays, respectively, compared with the imatinib-sensitive K562 cells. The levels of intracellular ROS and gamma-H2AX were decreased by the ROS scavenger (N-acetylcysteine), and ROS levels were also markedly reduced by STAT5 inhibitor (SH-4-54). In addition, imatinib significantly inhibited the proliferation of K562 and K562/G cells, with half maximal inhibitory concentration values of 0.17+/-0.07 and 14.78+/-0.43 microM, respectively, and the levels of apoptosis were significantly different between K562 and K562/G cells following treatment with imatinib. The mRNA and protein levels of STAT5 and mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2) were upregulated, whereas those of Bax were downregulated in K562/G cells, as determined using western blot analysis. Additionally, although the two cell lines exhibited relatively low protein expression levels of p53, lower levels of p53 and TPp53BP1 transcripts were detected in the K562/G cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that the resistance of CML to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib, may be associated with persistent STAT5-mediated ROS production, and the abnormality of the p53 pathway.",,"['Cheng, Yanhong', 'Hao, Yingchan', 'Zhang, Aimei', 'Hu, Chaojie', 'Jiang, Xiaoxiao', 'Wu, Quan', 'Xu, Xiucai']","['Cheng Y', 'Hao Y', 'Zhang A', 'Hu C', 'Jiang X', 'Wu Q', 'Xu X']","['Central Laboratory, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui 230001, P.R.

PATIENTS AND RESULTS: Eighty of 87 adult patients with genetically confirmed APL of all risk groups were eligible. The outcome of both arms was similar: AMLCG vs PETHEMA: hematological complete remission 87% vs 83%, early death 13% vs 17% (P = .76), overall survival, event-free survival, leukemia-free survival, cumulative incidence of relapse at 6 years 75% vs 78% (P = .92); 75% vs 68% (P = .29); 86% vs 81% (P = .28); and 0% vs 12% (P = .04, no relapse vs four relapses), respectively. The median time to achieve molecular remission (RT-PCR negativity of PML-RARA) was 60 days in both arms (P = .12). The AMLCG regimen was associated with a longer duration of neutropenia (P = .02) and a higher rate of WHO grade >/=3 infections. CONCLUSIONS: The small number of patients limits the reliability of conclusions. With these restrictions, the outcomes of both approaches were similar and show the limitations of ATRA and chemotherapy. The HD ara-C-containing regimen was associated with a lower relapse rate in high-risk APL.",['(c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

As several potential haploidentical relative donors are typically available for a given patient, optimizing donor selection to improve clinical outcome is crucial. The impact of donor age and kinship on the outcome of acute leukemia patients is not clearly established in this setting. Using the multinational registry of the acute leukemia working party of the European society for blood and marrow transplantation we retrospective analyzed the clinical outcome of 1270 acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients who underwent haplo-HCT between 2005 and 2015. Patients over the age of 40 were significantly affected by increasing donor age resulting in higher non-relapse mortality (NRM) [Hazard ratio (HR)=1.86, confidence interval (CI) 95%, 1.18-2.94; P = .007], inferior leukemia-free survival (LFS) (HR = 1.59, CI 95%, 1.13-2.24; P = .007), and overall survival (OS) (HR = 1.74, CI 95%, 1.22-2.47; P = .002) when donors were over the age of 40. Additionally, kinship was found to be prognostically significant as patients transplanted from children donors over the age of 35 experienced an increased rate of NRM (HR = 1.82, CI 95%, 1.13-2.9; P = .01), inferior LFS (HR = 1.5, CI 95%, 1.05-2.13; P = .03), and OS (HR = 1.5, CI 95%, 1.04-2.15; P = .03). For patients younger than 40 years, donor age and kinship were mostly not clinically impactful. Our data establish donor age and kinship as significant determinants of outcome following haplo-HCT for acute leukemia patients.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Canaani, Jonathan', 'Savani, Bipin N', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Huang, Xiao-Jun', 'Ciceri, Fabio', 'Arcese, William', 'Koc, Yener', 'Tischer, Johanna', 'Blaise, Didier', 'Gulbas, Zafer', 'Van Lint, Maria Teresa', 'Bruno, Benedetto', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Nagler, Arnon']","['Canaani J', 'Savani BN', 'Labopin M', 'Huang XJ', 'Ciceri F', 'Arcese W', 'Koc Y', 'Tischer J', 'Blaise D', 'Gulbas Z', 'Van Lint MT', 'Bruno B', 'Mohty M', 'Nagler A']","['Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Hematology Division, Tel Aviv University, Tel-Hashomer, Israel.', 'Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.', 'Acute Leukemia Working Party -EBMT and Department of Hematology and Cell Therapy, Hopital Saint-Antoine, Paris.', 'INSERM UMRs 938, CEREST-TC EBMT, Paris, France.', 'Peking University Peoples Hospital, Institute of Haematology, Xicheng District, Beijing, China.', 'Ospedale San Raffaele s.r.l., Haematology and BMT, Milano, Italy.', '""Tor Vergata"" University of Rome, Stem Cell Transplant Unit, Policlinico Universitario Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Medical Park Hospitals, Stem Cell Transplant Unit, Antalya, Turkey.', 'Klinikum Grosshadern, Med.

This was carried out using 1,062 BCIS cases and 10,126 controls as well as 6,113 invasive breast cancer cases from the Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium (BPC3). Three SNPs showed at least one nominally significant association in homozygous minor versus homozygous major models. ACVR2A-rs2382112 (ORhom = 3.05, 95%CI = 1.72-5.44, Phom = 1.47 x 10(-4) ), MAST2-rs12124649 (ORhom = 1.73, 95% CI =1.18-2.54, Phom = 5.24 x 10(-3) ), and INSR-rs10500204 (ORhom = 1.96, 95% CI = 1.44-2.67, Phom =1.68 x 10(-5) ) were associated with increased risk of BCIS; however, only the latter association was significant after correcting for multiple testing. Furthermore, INSR-rs10500204 was more strongly associated with the risk of BCIS than invasive disease in case-only analyses using the homozygous minor versus homozygous major model (ORhom = 1.78, 95% CI = 1.30-2.44, Phom = 3.23 x 10(-4) ). The SNP INSR-rs10500204 is located in an intron of the INSR gene and is likely to affect binding of the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein. The PML gene is known as a tumor suppressor and growth regulator in cancer. However, it is not clear on what pathway the A-allele of rs10500204 could operate to influence the binding of the protein.

A second series of acyclic carbene (ACC) complexes of gold(i) were prepared by nucleophilic attack on isocyanide complexes by amines and amino esters, to give (ACC)AuCl, [(ACC)Au(PTA)](+) (PTA = triazaphosphaadamantane), as well as mixed-carbene compounds [(CAAC)Au(ACC)](+). Representative complexes were characterised by X-ray diffraction which confirmed the mononuclear linear structures without close intermolecular contacts or aurophilic interactions. The redox properties of these complexes have been determined. The compounds were tested against a panel of human cancer cell lines including leukemia (HL 60), breast adenocarcinoma cells (MCF-7) and human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cell lines (A549), which show varying degrees of cisplatin resistance. The pro-ligand iminium salts and the PTA complexes were non-toxic. By contrast, the CAAC complexes show high cytotoxicity, with IC50 values in the sub-micromolar to approximately 100 nanomolar range, even against cisplatin-insensitive MCF-7 and A549 cells. Cationic bis-carbene complexes [((Me2)CAAC)2M](+) (6-8, M = Cu, Ag and Au) proved particularly effective. The mechanism of cell growth control by these complexes remains to be established, although possible modes of action such as inhibition of thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), which is a common pathway for gold NHC compounds, or the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through redox processes, could be ruled out as primary pathways.",,"['Bertrand, Benoit', 'Romanov, Alexander S', 'Brooks, Mark', 'Davis, Josh', 'Schmidt, Claudia', 'Ott, Ingo', ""O'Connell, Maria"", 'Bochmann, Manfred']","['Bertrand B', 'Romanov AS', 'Brooks M', 'Davis J', 'Schmidt C', 'Ott I', ""O'Connell M"", 'Bochmann M']","['School of Chemistry, University of East Anglia, Norwich NR4 7TJ, UK. benoit.bertrand1988@gmail.com Manfred.bochmann@uea.ac.uk.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Dalton Trans,"Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)",101176026,,,,,2017/11/09 06:00,2017/11/09 06:01,['2017/11/09 06:00'],"['2017/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/09 06:01 [medline]', '2017/11/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1039/c7dt03189k [doi]'],ppublish,Dalton Trans. 2017 Nov 21;46(45):15875-15887. doi: 10.1039/c7dt03189k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanisms underlying the development of adaptive NK cells remain uncertain but some observations support the involvement of a cognate interaction of CD94/NKG2C with ligand(s) displayed by HCMV-infected cells. To approach this issue, the heterodimer and its adaptor (DAP12) were expressed in the human Jurkat leukemia T cell line; signaling was detected by transfection of a reporter plasmid encoding for Luciferase (Luc) under NFAT/AP1-dependent control. Engagement of the receptor by solid-phase bound CD94- or NKG2C-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) triggered Luc expression. Moreover, reporter activation was detectable upon interaction with HLA-E+ 721.221 (.221-AEH) cells, as well as with 721.221 cells incubated with synthetic peptides, which stabilized surface expression of endogenous HLA-E; the response was specifically antagonized by soluble NKG2C- and HLA-E-specific mAbs.

The Asxl1(Y588X) Tg mice had an enlarged hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) pool, shortened survival, and predisposition to a spectrum of myeloid malignancies, thereby recapitulating the characteristics of myeloid malignancy patients with ASXL1 mutations. ATAC- and RNA-sequencing analyses revealed that the ASXL1(aa1-587) truncating protein expression results in more open chromatin in cKit(+) cells compared with wild-type cells, accompanied by dysregulated expression of genes critical for HSC self-renewal and differentiation. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that ASXL1(aa1-587) acquired an interaction with BRD4. An epigenetic drug screening demonstrated a hypersensitivity of Asxl1(Y588X) Tg bone marrow cells to BET bromodomain inhibitors.

Overexpression of myeloid cell leukaemia-1 (Mcl-1) and Survivin is associated with drug resistance, tumour progression and inhibition of apoptotic mechanisms in leukaemia and several cancers. In the present study, we examined the combined effect of etoposide and dual siRNA-mediated silencing of Mcl-1 and Survivin on U-937 AML cells. The AML cells were co-transfected with Mcl-1 and Survivin-specific siRNAs and genes silencing were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blotting. Subsequently, MTT assay was used for the evaluation of cytotoxic effects by dual siRNA and etoposide on their own and in combination. For the studying of apoptosis, DNA-histone ELISA and annexin-V/FITC assays were performed. Co-transfection of Mcl-1 and Survivin siRNA significantly blocked their expression at the mRNA and protein levels, leading to the induction of apoptosis and strong inhibition of growth (p < .05). Besides, combined treatment of etoposide with Mcl-1 and Survivin siRNAs co-transfection leads to synergistically enhance etoposide-induced cytotoxic and apoptotic effects (p < .05). The results showed that Mcl-1 and Survivin play a major role in the U937 cells survival and their resistance relative to etoposide. Thus, Mcl-1 and Survivin can be considered as promising molecular targets for the treatment of AML. The combination treatment with etoposide, and siRNA-mediated silencing of corresponding genes may be a novel strategy in chemoresistance AML treatment.",,"['Jafarlou, Mahdi', 'Shanehbandi, Dariush', 'Dehghan, Parvin', 'Mansoori, Behzad', 'Othman, F', 'Baradaran, Behzad']","['Jafarlou M', 'Shanehbandi D', 'Dehghan P', 'Mansoori B', 'Othman F', 'Baradaran B']","['a Immunology Research Center , Tabriz University of Medical Sciences , Tabriz , Iran.', 'b Department of Human Anatomy, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, UPM , Selangor , Malaysia.', 'a Immunology Research Center , Tabriz University of Medical Sciences , Tabriz , Iran.', 'c Nutrition Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences , Tabriz , Iran.', 'a Immunology Research Center , Tabriz University of Medical Sciences , Tabriz , Iran.', 'b Department of Human Anatomy, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, UPM , Selangor , Malaysia.', 'a Immunology Research Center , Tabriz University of Medical Sciences , Tabriz , Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20171107,England,Artif Cells Nanomed Biotechnol,"Artificial cells, nanomedicine, and biotechnology",101594777,IM,"['*Apoptosis', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', '*Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/genetics/metabolism/pathology/*therapy', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Survivin/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'U937 Cells']",['NOTNLM'],"['Mcl-1', 'Survivin', 'U-937', 'etoposide', 'myelomonocytic leukaemia', 'siRNA']",2017/11/09 06:00,2019/03/21 06:00,['2017/11/09 06:00'],"['2017/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/21 06:00 [medline]', '2017/11/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/21691401.2017.1392969 [doi]'],ppublish,Artif Cells Nanomed Biotechnol. 2018 Dec;46(8):1792-1798. doi: 10.1080/21691401.2017.1392969.

However, for proper self-renewal of its own population and differentiation to blood, the HSC requires a specialized microenvironment called the ""niche."" Recent Advances: Recent studies using novel mouse models have shed new light on the cellular architecture and function of the HSC niche. Here, we review the different cells that constitute the HSC niche and the molecular mechanisms that underlie HSC and niche interaction. We discuss the evidence and potential features that distinguish the HSC niche from other microenvironments in the bone marrow. The relevance of the niche in malignant transformation of the HSCs and harboring cancer metastasis to the bone is also outlined. In addition, we address how the niche may regulate reactive oxygen species levels surrounding the HSCs. Critical Issues and Future Directions: We propose future directions and remaining challenges in investigating the niche of HSCs. We discuss how a better understanding of the HSC niche may help in restoring an aged hematopoietic system, fighting against malignancies, and transplanting purified HSCs safely and effectively into patients.

Large granular lymphocytic (LGL) lymphocytosis is one type of PTLD, ranging from reactive polyclonal self-limited expansion to oligo/monoclonal lymphocytosis or even to overt leukaemia. LGL lymphocytosis in transplant recipients may present as a relatively indolent version of the condition and may be more common than reported, but its natural history and clinical course have not been well described, and the lack of a reliable classification system has limited studies on this disease. Patients with unexplained cytopenias, autoimmune manifestations, or unexpected remissions may be mislabelled. The purpose of this review was to evaluate the clinical features, immunophenotypes, etiopathogenesis, diagnosis, outcomes and treatment of post-transplantation LGL lymphocytosis. In conclusion, LGL lymphocytosis is a frequent occurrence after transplantation that correlates with certain procedural variables and post-transplant events. LGL lymphocytosis should be considered in patients with unexplained lymphocytosis or when pancytopenia develops after transplantation. The diagnosis of LGL lymphocytosis requires a demonstration of monoclonality, but clonality does not indicate malignancy.

Although long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been implicated in cALL etiology, progression, and treatment response, little is known about their exact functional role. We had previously sequenced the whole transcriptome of 56 cALL patients and identified lncRNA transcripts specifically silenced in tumoral cells. Here we investigated the impact of restoring the expression of three of these (RP11-624C23.1, RP11-203E8, and RP11-446E9) in leukemic cell lines had dramatic impact on cancer hallmark cellular phenotypes such as apoptosis, cell proliferation and migration, and DNA damage response. Interestingly, both RP11-624C23.1 and RP11-203E8 had very similar impacts on DNA damage response, specifically displaying lower gamma-H2A.X and higher apoptosis levels than control cells in response to genotoxic stress. These results indicate that silencing RP11-624C23.1 or RP11-203E8 could provide a selective advantage to leukemic cells by increasing resistance to genotoxic stress, possibly by modulating the DDR pathway.

Here we describe a characteristic immunophenotypic panel that can rapidly and accurately distinguish APL from other types of adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) using only FCM. By comparing APL cells and non-APL AML cells that share APL common immunophenotypes (CD34(-)CD117(+)HLA(-)DR(-)) we found that CD64 was a significant factor that differentiated APL from other AMLs.

Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a catechin, exhibits numerous biological functions, including antitumor activities. Previous studies have reported that EGCG induces apoptosis in NB4 cells. However, the molecular mechanism underlying EGCG-induced apoptosis remains unclear. The present study aimed to determine the molecular basis of EGCG-induced apoptosis in NB4 cells. EGCG treatment significantly inhibited the viability of NB4 cells in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, EGCG treatment induced apoptosis and increased the levels of (Bcl-2-like protein 4) Bax protein expression. Moreover, EGCG treatment was able to increase phosphorylated (p)-p38alpha mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Src homology 1 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase (SHP-1) expression. Pretreatment with PD169316 (a p38 MAPK inhibitor) partially blocked EGCG-induced apoptosis and inhibited EGCG-mediated Bax expression. Similarly, pretreatment with NSC87877, an inhibitor of SHP-1, partially blocked EGCG-induced apoptosis and inhibited EGCG-mediated increases in p-p38alpha MAPK and Bax expression. Therefore, the results of the present study indicate that EGCG is able to induce apoptosis in NB4 cells via the SHP-1-p38alphaMAPK-Bax cascade.",,"['Gan, Liugen', 'Zhong, Liang', 'Shan, Zhiling', 'Xiao, Chunlan', 'Xu, Ting', 'Song, Hao', 'Li, Liu', 'Yang, Rong', 'Liu, Beizhong']","['Gan L', 'Zhong L', 'Shan Z', 'Xiao C', 'Xu T', 'Song H', 'Li L', 'Yang R', 'Liu B']","['Central Laboratory, Yongchuan Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 402160, P.R.

Blood or bone marrow samples from 216 patients with AML (158 AML patients in the first stage, and 58 more patients with AML-M3 for further verification), and 146 healthy controls were collected. Sanger sequencing was performed for the D-loop region ranging between nucleotide (nt)15811 and nt 775. With the exception of mitochondrial microsatellite instability (mtMSI) variations, a total of 2,630 variations in 232 loci were identified with similar variation rates/person in patients with AML and controls when compared with the revised Cambridge reference sequence (8.54+/-2.14 vs. 8.77+/-2.15; P=0.366). A positive association between AML and variation-T152C was identified, which occurred more frequently in patients with AML compared with in controls [26.6 vs. 17.1%; P=0.048; odds ratio (OR), 1.752; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.004-3.058]. Furthermore, T152C was identified to be associated with promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha(PML-RARalpha) and French-American-British AML subtypes, with a tendency to occur in patients with AML-M3. The AML-M3 sample size was extended by 58 cases, and it was identified that the T152C variation rate was significantly higher in patients with AML-M3 compared with that of controls (41.0 vs. 17.1%; P<0.001; OR, 3.228; 95% CI, 1.714-6.079).

In addition, the mtMSIs, including D310, mt514-523 (CA)n and T16189C, demonstrated no association with AML risk. Together, the results of the present study suggest that the mitochondrial DNA D-loop region is high variable, and that T152C is associated with AML risk, particularly regarding the M3 subtype.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the prognostic significance of the expression of V-Ki-ras2 Kappairsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), downstream signaling pathway genes and the association with clinical characteristics in PDAC patients undergoing radical surgery. Tumors and adjacent non-neoplastic pancreatic tissues were examined in 45 patients with histologically verified PDAC. KRAS and B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase (BRAF) gene mutation analysis was performed using the KRAS/BRAF/phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha array. The transcript profile of 52 KRAS downstream signaling pathway genes was assessed using quantitative-polymerase chain reaction. KRAS mutation was detected in 80% of cases. The genes of four signaling pathways downstream of KRAS, including the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1/V-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1, RAL guanine nucleotide exchange factor, Ras and Rab interactor 1/ABL proto-oncogene-1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase, and RAF proto-oncogene serine/threonine-protein kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, exhibited differential expression in PDAC compared with that in the adjacent normal tissues. However, no significant differences in expression were evident between patients with KRAS-mutated and wild-type tumors. The expression of KRAS downstream signaling pathways genes did not correlate with angioinvasion, perineural invasion, grade or presence of lymph node metastasis. Additionally, the presence of KRAS mutations was not associated with overall survival. Among the KRAS downstream effective signaling pathways molecules investigated, only v-raf-1 murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 expression was predictive of prognosis. Overall, KRAS mutation is present in the majority of cases of PDAC, but is not associated with changes in the expression of KRAS downstream signaling pathways and the clinical outcome.

The purpose of the present study was to assess CD133 and CD82 expression in patients with pediatric ALL, and to evaluate the association with the clinical data. Using flow cytometric assessment and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, CD133 and CD82 expression levels were measured in the bone marrow (BM) of 37 patients with newly diagnosed (ND) pediatric ALL [ALL-ND; 30 B-cell-ALL (B-ALL) and 7 T-cell-ALL (T-ALL)], in 22 patients with complete remission pediatric ALL (ALL-CR) and in 16 age-matched children without BM disease. BM plasma CD82 concentrations were measured by ELISA. The CD82 mRNA expression level in the patients with ALL-ND was significantly higher compared with that in the controls. CD82 mRNA expression levels in pediatric patients with B cell-ALL (B-ALL) were higher than those in ALL-CR patients and controls. For T-ALL, CD82 expression in ND patients was higher than in controls. CD133 mRNA expression levels in patients with pediatric B-ALL-ND were higher than that of controls and patients with ALL-CR. The frequency of CD34(+) cells in pediatric ALL was significantly higher than that in controls. Frequencies of CD34(+)CD133(+) or CD34(+)CD82(+) cells in pediatric ALL were higher than those in controls. A positive association was observed between CD133 and CD82 mRNA expression in patients with B-ALL. A significant association was observed between CD133 mRNA expression and the hyperdiploid karyotype.

The present study reported that adenine, an AMPK activator, triggers cell cycle arrest and autophagy of human chronic myelogenous leukemia K562 cells consequently suppressing cell viability. The present findings revealed that adenine treatment (4.0-8.0 mM) significantly inhibited the viability of K562 cells to 69.3+/-2.5% (24 h) and 53.4+/-2.1% (48 h) of the control. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that there was a significant accumulation in G2/M phase, but not sub-G1 phase K562 cells following exposure to adenine. Additional investigation demonstrated that adenine treatments significantly increased the number of acidic vesicular organelles and the level of autophagosomal microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 alpha (LC3) marker. By contrast, cleavage of caspase-9, caspase-3 and poly-ADP-ribose polymerase was insignificantly affected in K562 cells following adenine treatment. In K562 cells, adenine was able to markedly promote the phosphorylation of AMPKalpha and suppress the phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a downstream target of AMPK. In addition, inhibiting AMPK phosphorylation using dorsomorphin restored mTOR phosphorylation, inhibited the accumulation of LC3 and significantly recovered the suppressed cell viability in response to adenine. Taken together, the present results demonstrated that adenine induced G2/M phase arrest and autophagic cell death, consequently suppressing the viability of K562 cells, which may attribute to the AMPK activation triggered by adenine. These findings provide evidence that adenine may be beneficial to chronic myelogenous leukemia therapy by suppressing excessive cell proliferation.",,"['Chen, San-Yuan', 'Lin, Chun-Hsiang', 'Lin, Jiun-Tsai', 'Cheng, Yi-Fang', 'Chen, Han-Min', 'Kao, Shao-Hsuan']","['Chen SY', 'Lin CH', 'Lin JT', 'Cheng YF', 'Chen HM', 'Kao SH']","['Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Ditmanson Medical Foundation Chia-Yi Christian Hospital, Chiayi 600, Taiwan R.O.C.', 'Institute of Biochemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung 402, Taiwan R.O.C.', 'Institute of Applied Science and Engineering, Catholic Fu Jen University, New Taipei 242, Taiwan R.O.C.', 'Energenesis Biomedical Co.

To study its cytotoxicity in detail, we evaluated its activity on human K562 chronic myelogenous leukemia cells and investigated the related molecule mechanisms. AS1041 significantly inhibited the proliferation and colony formation of K562 cells. Moreover, AS1041 arrested cell cycle progression at G2/M phase in a concentration-dependent manner, and also caused concentration- and time-dependent induction of apoptosis. In addition, the molecular mechanisms investigation showed that AS1041 did not localize in the cellular nucleus and did not affect topoisomerases I or II. However, AS1041 could inactivate extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and contribute to AS1041-induced apoptosis. We concluded that AS1041 was cytotoxic to K562 leukemia cells and the cytotoxicity related to the cell cycle arrest, apoptosis induction, and ERK inhibition.

However, to the authors' knowledge, patterns and predictors of QOL impairment during therapy have not been well characterized to date. METHODS: Patients with AR-ALL who were enrolled on the Children's Oncology Group AALL0932 trial were offered participation in this prospective cohort study if they were aged >/=4 years at the time of diagnosis and had an English-speaking parent. At approximately 2 months, 8 months, 17 months, 26 months, and 38 months (boys only) after diagnosis, parents completed the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory Generic Core Scales Version 4.0 (PedsQL4.0) and McMaster Family Assessment Device instruments for QOL (physical, emotional, and social functioning) and family functioning, respectively. The proportions of individuals scoring in the impaired range (2 standard deviations below the population mean) were calculated at each time point. Longitudinal impairment patterns and predictors were examined. RESULTS: A total of 594 participants with AR-ALL were diagnosed at a mean age of 6.0 years (standard deviation, 1.6 years). At 2 months, a substantial proportion of participants had impaired scores for physical (36.5%; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 32.3%-40.8%) and emotional (26.2%; 95% CI, 22.5%-30.2%) functioning compared with population norms of 2.3%. These elevations persisted at 26 months. Emotional impairment at 2 months (odds ratio, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.5-7.7) was found to significantly predict emotional impairment at 26 months. In repeated measures analysis with multivariate modeling, unhealthy family functioning (odds ratio, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1-2.1) significantly predicted emotional impairment controlling for age and sex. QOL outcomes were similar between sexes at the end of therapy (26 months for girls and 38 months for boys). CONCLUSIONS: Many children with AR-ALL experience physical and emotional functioning impairment that begins early in treatment and persists. Early screening may identify high-risk patients who might benefit from family-based interventions. Cancer 2018;124:571-9.

DESIGN: A cross-sectional study was designed to analyze MEB cells of HIV-1 ART treated and ART-naive study participants, and uninfected individuals. METHODS: Frequency and absolute counts of MEB cell subsets in blood were determined by multicolor flow cytometry. Spontaneous cell death and B-cell proliferative capacity was evaluated in vitro by cell culture and flow cytometry. Splenic function was determined by pitted erythrocytes quantification in HIV-1 ART-treated study participants. RESULTS: HIV-1 ART-treated individuals did not show functional hyposplenism despite the lack of recovery IgMIgDCD27 marginal zone-like B cells. Moreover, two germinal center-dependent MEB cells subsets were also dysregulated in HIV-1 individuals: IgMIgDCD27 (IgM only) cells were increased, whereas the switched subset (IgMIgD) was reduced in viremic individuals. Althought ART restored the numbers of these populations; the switched MEB cells were enriched in CD27 cells, which showed the highest susceptibility to spontaneous cell death ex vivo. In addition, B cells from viremic individuals showed a poor response to B-cell receptor and toll-like receptor 9 stimulation that was circumvented when both stimuli were used simultaneously. CONCLUSION: B cells from HIV-1 study participants show a poor stimulation capacity, that may be bypassed by the proper combination of stimuli, and a dysregulated MEB cell pool that suggest an affectation of the germinal center reaction, only partially normalized by ART. Interestingly, hyposplenism does not explain the lack of recovery of the marginal zone-like B cells in ART-treated HIV-1 individuals.",,"['Carrillo, Jorge', 'Negredo, Eugenia', 'Puig, Jordi', 'Molinos-Albert, Luis Manuel', 'Rodriguez de la Concepcion, Maria Luisa', 'Curriu, Marta', 'Massanella, Marta', 'Navarro, Jordi', 'Crespo, Manel', 'Vinets, Ester', 'Milla, Fuensanta', 'Clotet, Bonaventura', 'Blanco, Julia']","['Carrillo J', 'Negredo E', 'Puig J', 'Molinos-Albert LM', 'Rodriguez de la Concepcion ML', 'Curriu M', 'Massanella M', 'Navarro J', 'Crespo M', 'Vinets E', 'Milla F', 'Clotet B', 'Blanco J']","['IrsiCaixa AIDS Research Institute-HIVACAT.', 'Jorge Carrillo and Julia Blanco equally contributed to this article.', 'Fundacio Lluita Contra la Sida, Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Badalona.', 'Fundacio Lluita Contra la Sida, Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Badalona.', 'IrsiCaixa AIDS Research Institute-HIVACAT.', 'IrsiCaixa AIDS Research Institute-HIVACAT.', 'IrsiCaixa AIDS Research Institute-HIVACAT.', 'IrsiCaixa AIDS Research Institute-HIVACAT.', ""Infectious Diseases Department, Hospital Universitari Vall d'Hebron, Barcelona."", 'Infectious Diseases Unit, Internal Medicine Department, IIS Galicia Sur, Complexo Hospitalario Universitario de Vigo, Vigo.', ""Hematology Department, Institut Catala D'Oncologia (ICO), Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Badalona."", ""Hematology Department, Institut Catala D'Oncologia (ICO), Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Badalona."", 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Badalona.', 'IrsiCaixa AIDS Research Institute-HIVACAT.', 'Fundacio Lluita Contra la Sida, Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Badalona.', 'Univ Autonoma de Barcelona, Bellaterra, Cerdanyola del Valles.', 'Universitat de Vic-Universitat Central de Catalunya (UVic-UCC), Vic.', 'IrsiCaixa AIDS Research Institute-HIVACAT.', 'Universitat de Vic-Universitat Central de Catalunya (UVic-UCC), Vic.', 'Germans Trias i Pujol Research Institute (IGTP), Badalona, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.', 'Jorge Carrillo and Julia Blanco equally contributed to this article.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,AIDS,"AIDS (London, England)",8710219,IM,"['Adult', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents/therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HIV Infections/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Humans', '*Immunologic Memory', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology', 'Male', 'Spleen/immunology']",,,2017/11/08 06:00,2018/07/17 06:00,['2017/11/08 06:00'],"['2017/11/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/17 06:00 [medline]', '2017/11/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/QAD.0000000000001686 [doi]'],ppublish,AIDS. 2018 Jan 14;32(2):149-160. doi: 10.1097/QAD.0000000000001686.,,['0 (Anti-Retroviral Agents)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All 3 cases occurred in male patients with initial presentation of diffuse lymphadenopathy. Cases 1 and 2 had B-ALL with significantly increased lymphoblasts in peripheral blood and bone marrow. Case 3, a patient with human immunodeficiency virus infection, had the diagnosis of B-LBL made on a retroperitoneal lymph node biopsy and had no peripheral blood or bone marrow involvement. The leukemic and lymphoma cells in all 3 cases demonstrated Burkitt lymphoma-like morphology with deeply basophilic cytoplasm and numerous cytoplasmic vacuoles. However, all 3 had immature immunophenotypes including expression of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), absence of BCL6, and dim-to-negative CD45. CD20 was largely negative in 2 of 3 cases.

Platelet production is thus dependent on both the MK number and size. During differentiation, MKs switch from a division by mitosis to polyploidization by endomitosis to increase their size. The endomitotic process includes several successive rounds of DNA replication with an entry in mitosis with a failure in late cytokinesis and a defect in karyokinesis. This leads to a giant cell with a modal ploidy at 16N and one multilobulated nucleus. The entire genome is duplicated several times and all alleles remain functional producing a hypermetabolic cell. A defect in abscission explains the cytokinesis failure and is related to an altered accumulation of actomyosin at the cleavage furrow as a consequence of both a low local RhoA activity and silencing of the MYH10 gene. This mechanism is regulated by transcription factors that govern differentiation explaining the intricacies of both processes. However, the endomitotic cell cycle regulation is still incompletely understood, particularly mitosis entry, escape to the tetraploid checkpoint, and defect in karyokinesis. Polyploidization is regulated during ontogeny, the first embryonic MKs being 2N. The molecular mechanism of this embryo-fetal/adult transition is beginning to be understood. In physiological conditions, MK ploidy is increased by an enhanced platelet demand through the thrombopoietin/myeloproliferative leukemia axis. In numerous hematologic malignancies, MK ploidy decreases, but it is always associated with a defect in MK differentiation.

Emerging evidence indicates that histone demethylases play a role in tumorigenesis. However, due to the complexity of this enormous family of histone-modifying enzymes, substrate redundancy, and context-specific roles, the contribution of each member remains ambiguous and targeting them remains challenging. Here, we analyzed expression of histone-3-lysine (H3K) demethylases and their cognate substrates in a cohort of de novo AML patients, which demonstrated that the expression of H3K27Me3/2-demethylases and selected members of H3K9Me3/2/1-demethylases are significantly increased in AML. KDM6 upregulation is associated with a global decrease in H3K27Me3 level. Importantly, our data show that pharmacological inhibition of H3K27Me3/2-demethylases or H3K9Me3/2-demethylases, either alone or in combination, could be considered an interesting molecular therapeutic modality in human AML independent of its subtype.","['Copyright (c) 2018 ISEH - Society for Hematology and Stem Cells.

The NPM1 gene is involved in human tumorigenesis and is found mutated in one third of acute myeloid leukemia patients, leading to the aberrant cytoplasmic localization of NPM1. Recent studies indicated that the N6L multivalent pseudopeptide, a synthetic ligand of cell-surface nucleolin, is also able to bind NPM1 with high affinity. N6L inhibits cell growth with different mechanisms and represents a good candidate as a novel anticancer drug for a number of malignancies of different histological origin. In this study we investigated whether N6L treatment could drive antitumor effect in acute myeloid leukemia cell lines. We found that N6L binds NPM1 at the N-terminal domain, co-localizes with cytoplasmic, mutated NPM1, and interferes with its protein-protein associations. N6L toxicity appears to be p53 dependent but interestingly, the leukemic cell line harbouring the mutated form of NPM1 is more resistant to treatment, suggesting that NPM1 cytoplasmic delocalization confers protection from p53 activation. Moreover, we show that N6L sensitizes AML cells to doxorubicin and cytarabine treatment. These studies suggest that N6L may be a promising option in combination therapies for acute myeloid leukemia treatment.",['Copyright (c) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

LncRNA Nuclear Enriched Abundant Transcript 1 (NEAT1) is indispensable during acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cell differentiation induced by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). However, the precise mechanism of NEAT1 upregulation has not been fully understood. In this study, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assays to demonstrate that C/EBP family transcription factor C/EBPbeta bind to and transactivate the promoter of lncRNA NEAT1 through the C/EBPbeta binding sites both around -54 bp and -1453 bp upstream of the transcription start site. Moreover, the expression of C/EBPbeta was increased after ATRA treatment, and the binding of C/EBPbeta in the NEAT1 promoter was also dramatically increased. Finally, knockdown of C/EBPbeta significantly reduced the ATRA-induced upregulation of NEAT1. In conclusion, C/EBPbeta directly activates the expression of NEAT1 through binding to the promoter of NEAT1. Knockdown of C/EBPbeta impairs ATRA-induced transcriptional activation of NEAT1. Our data indicate that C/EBPbeta contributes to ATRA-induced activation of NEAT1 during APL cell differentiation. Our results enrich our knowledge on the regulation of lncRNAs and the regulatory role of C/EBPbeta in APL cell differentiation.",['Copyright (c) 2017.

Our aim was to describe the scale and profile of cancer incidence and mortality worldwide among 20-39 year-olds, highlighting major patterns by age, sex, development level, and geographical region. METHODS: We did a population-based study to quantify the burden of young adult cancers worldwide. We defined young adult cancers as those occurring between the ages of 20 and 39 years because these individuals will have passed puberty and adolescence, but not yet experienced the effects of hormonal decline, immune response deterioration, or organ dysfunction associated with chronic health conditions. Global, regional, and country-specific (n=184) data estimates of the number of new cancer cases and cancer-associated deaths that occurred in 2012 among young adults were extracted in four 5-year bands from the International Agency for Research on Cancer's GLOBOCAN 2012 for all cancers combined and for 27 major types as defined by the International Classification of Disease, tenth revision. We report the number of new cancer cases and cancer-associated deaths overall and by sex alongside corresponding age-standardised rates (ASR) per 100 000 people per year. We also present results using four levels of the Human Development Index (HDI; low [least developed], medium, high, and very high [most developed]), which is a composite indicator for socioeconomic development comprising life expectancy, education, and gross national income. FINDINGS: 975 396 new cancer cases and 358 392 cancer-associated deaths occurred among young adults worldwide in 2012, which equated to an ASR of 43.3 new cancer cases per 100 000 people per year and 15.9 cancer-associated deaths per 100 000 people per year. The burden was disproportionally greater among women and the most common cancer types overall in terms of new cases were female breast cancer, cervical cancer, thyroid cancer, leukaemia, and colorectal cancer; in terms of deaths, female breast cancer, liver cancer, leukaemia, and cervical cancer were the main contributors. When assessed by development level and geographical region, the cancer profile varied substantially; generally, the burden of infection-associated cancers was greater in regions under transition. Cancer incidence was elevated in very high-HDI regions compared with low-HDI regions (ASR 64.5 vs 46.2 cancer cases per 100 000 people per year); however, the mortality burden was 3 times higher in low-HDI regions (ASR 25.4 vs 9.2 cancer-associated deaths per 100 000 people per year), reflecting differences in cancer profiles and inferior outcomes. INTERPRETATION: The global cancer burden among 20-39 year-olds differs from that seen in younger or older ages and varies substantially by age, sex, development level, and geographical region. Although the cancer burden is lower in this age group than that observed in older ages, the societal and economic effects remain great given the major effects of premature morbidity and mortality. Targeted surveillance, prevention, and treatment are needed to reduce the cancer burden in this underserved age group.

RESULTS: We showed a statistically significant increase in the concentration of 8 proteins, interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin 6 (IL-6), leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), C-X-C motif chemokine 10 (IP-10), leptin and platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB), as well as a significant decrease in the concentration of 3 proteins, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), placental growth factor (PlGF) and follistatin, in the plasma of women with preeclampsia. CONCLUSION: Based on our findings, it seems that protein factors may play an important role in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia, and there are many proteins that have not been studied in PE to date. There are no previous studies assessing the LIF, follistatin, HGF, HB-EGF and PDGF-BB concentrations in the plasma of women with PE; therefore, our obtained results indicate that these proteins are new factors that can play an important role in the pathomechanisms of PE.",['Copyright (c) 2017.

Characteristically, they are noted to be made of diverse properties based on their biological, biochemical, and pharmacological actions. Accordingly, the apoptosis mechanisms induced by beta-mangostin, a xanthone compound isolated from Cratoxylum arborescens in the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line (HL60) in vitro, were examined in this study. The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay was done to estimate the cytotoxicity effect of beta-mangostin on the HL60 cell line. Acridine orange/propidium iodide and Hoechst 33342 dyes and Annexin V tests were conducted to detect the apoptosis features. Caspase-3 and caspase-9 activities; reactive oxygen species; real-time polymerase chain reaction for Bcl-2, Bax, caspase-3, and caspase-9 Hsp70 genes; and western blot for p53, cytochrome c, and pro- and cleavage-caspase-3 and caspase-9 were assessed to examine the apoptosis mechanism. Cell-cycle analysis conducted revealed that beta-mangostin inhibited the growth of HL60 at 58 microM in 24 h. The administration of beta-mangostin with HL60 caused cell morphological changes related to apoptosis which increased the number of early and late apoptotic cells. The beta-mangostin-catalyzed apoptosis action through caspase-3, caspase-7, and caspase-9 activation overproduced reactive oxygen species which downregulated the expression of antiapoptotic genes Bcl-2 and HSP70. Conversely, the expression of the apoptotic genes Bax, caspase-3, and caspase-9 were upregulated. Meanwhile, at the protein level, beta-mangostin activated the formation of cleaved caspase-3 and caspase-9 and also upregulated the p53. beta-mangostin arrested the cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase. Overall, the results for beta-mangostin showed an antiproliferative effect in HL60 via stopping the cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase and prompted the intrinsic apoptosis pathway.",,"['Omer, Fatima Abdelmutaal Ahmed', 'Hashim, Najihah Binti Mohd', 'Ibrahim, Mohamed Yousif', 'Dehghan, Firouzeh', 'Yahayu, Maizatulakmal', 'Karimian, Hamed', 'Salim, Landa Zeenelabdin Ali', 'Mohan, Syam']","['Omer FAA', 'Hashim NBM', 'Ibrahim MY', 'Dehghan F', 'Yahayu M', 'Karimian H', 'Salim LZA', 'Mohan S']","['1 Department of Pharmacy, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', '1 Department of Pharmacy, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', '2 Center for Natural Products Research and Drug Discovery, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', '1 Department of Pharmacy, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', '3 Department of Exercise Science, Sports Center, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', '4 Department of Bioproduct Research and Innovation, Institute of Bioproduct Development (IBD), Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM), Johor Bahru, Malaysia.', '1 Department of Pharmacy, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', '1 Department of Pharmacy, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', '5 Medical Research Centre, Jazan University, Jazan, Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Clusiaceae', 'Down-Regulation', 'G1 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/biosynthesis/*drug effects', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Plant Extracts/pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Xanthones/*pharmacology']",['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'HL60 cell line', 'beta-mangostin', 'intrinsic pathway', 'leukemia', 'xanthones']",2017/11/08 06:00,2017/11/14 06:00,['2017/11/08 06:00'],"['2017/11/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/11/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/1010428317731451 [doi]'],ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2017 Nov;39(11):1010428317731451. doi: 10.1177/1010428317731451.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Xanthones)', 'U6RIV93RU1 (mangostin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DIAGNOSIS: Diagnosis of HCL is based on morphological evidence of hairy cells, an HCL immunologic score of 3 or 4 based on the CD11C, CD103, CD123, and CD25 expression, the trephine biopsy which makes it possible to specify the degree of tumoral medullary infiltration and the presence of BRAF V600E somatic mutation. RISK STRATIFICATION: Progression of patients with HCL is based on a large splenomegaly, leukocytosis, a high number of hairy cells in the peripheral blood and the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region gene mutational status. VH4-34 positive HCL cases are associated with poor prognosis RISK ADAPTED THERAPY: Purine analogs (PNA) are indicated in symptomatic first line HCL patients. The use of PNA followed by rituximab represents an alternative option. MANAGEMENT OF PROGRESSIVE OR REFRACTORY DISEASE: It is based on the use of BRAF inhibitors associated or not with MEK inhibitors, recombinant immunoconjugates targeting CD22 or BCR inhibitors.","['(c) 2017 The Authors American Journal of Hematology Published by Wiley', 'Periodicals, Inc.']","['Troussard, Xavier', 'Cornet, Edouard']","['Troussard X', 'Cornet E']","['Laboratoire Hematologie, CHU Caen, 14 033, Caen Cedex, France.', 'Laboratoire Hematologie, CHU Caen, 14 033, Caen Cedex, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Immunoconjugates/therapeutic use', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/pathology/therapy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Risk Assessment', 'Salvage Therapy/methods', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2/antagonists & inhibitors']",,,2017/11/08 06:00,2017/11/29 06:00,['2017/11/08 06:00'],"['2017/09/13 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/04 00:00 [revised]', '2017/10/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/11/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.24936 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2017 Dec;92(12):1382-1390. doi: 10.1002/ajh.24936.,PMC5698705,"['0 (CD22 protein, human)', '0 (Immunoconjugates)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BRAF protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf)']",,,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6863-9992', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1667-3421']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here it was found to inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis through JAK/STAT signal pathway in these cells; the mechanism by which this occurred was investigated. We find that fucoxanthin significantly increased the number of apoptotic cells by propidium iodide (PI) dye staining and flow cytometry. Fucoxanthin (50 or 75 muM) induced SGC-7901 cells cycle arrest at S phase, while BGC-823 cells arrest at G2/M phase. RT-PCR and western blot analysis revealed that the expressions of Mcl-1, STAT3 and p-STAT3 were obviously decreased by fucoxanthin in a dose-dependent manner. Synthetic siRNA targeting Mcl-1 was transfected into cells which had no effect on expressions of STAT3. After pretreatment with AG490 (50 muM) which led to blocking of the JAK/STAT signal pathway, the reductive expressions of Mcl-1, STAT3 and p-STAT3 caused by fucoxanthin were inhibited. This is the first analysis of effects on SGC-7901 and BGC-823 cells by fucoxanthin. Fucoxanthin can induce cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in these cells. These effects involved downregulation of Mcl-1, STAT3 and p-STAT3. This work is significant for better understanding of mechanisms leading to human gastric adenocarcinoma formation and informing exploitation of anti-tumor marine drug, and for providing Mcl-1 and STAT3 as potential therapeutic targets for gastric adenocarcinoma.",,"['Yu, Rui-Xue', 'Yu, Rui-Tao', 'Liu, Zhong']","['Yu RX', 'Yu RT', 'Liu Z']","['Pingdingshan University, Pingdingshan, 467000, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Tibetan Medicine Research, Northwest Institute of Plateau Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xining, 810008, China. yuruitao521@163.com.', 'Qinghai Key Laboratory of Tibetan Medicine, Northwest Institute of Plateau Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xining, 810008, China. yuruitao521@163.com.', 'Qinghai Institute of Salt Lake, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xining, 810008, China.

Choice of treatment and management of complications are challenging. METHODS: We report the case of a patient with diagnosis of APL at gestational age (GA) 24 + 4. We describe the interdisciplinary management during pregnancy and delivery and provide a 2-year follow-up. Existing reports on APL in pregnancy are summarized. RESULTS: Single-agent induction therapy with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) was started and resulted in normalization of blood cell counts after 32 days. Vaginal delivery of a healthy baby occurred at GA 34 + 4. Consolidation therapy consisted of four courses of ATRA and arsenic trioxide (ATO). Less than 100 cases of APL in pregnancy are published.

Mitotic catastrophe (MC) represents attractive platform compromising tumor resistance to current therapeutic modalities. MC appeared as onco-suppressive mechanism and is defined as a stage driving the cell to an irreversible destiny, i.e. cell death via apoptosis or necrosis. Our study highlights that MC induction in colorectal carcinoma cell lines ultimately leads to the autophagy followed by apoptosis. We show that autophagy suppression in Atg 13 knockout non-small cell lung carcinoma cells lead to the dramatic decrease of MC rate. Furthermore, mitochondria-linked anti-apoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL play a crucial role in the duration of MC and a cross-talk between autophagy and apoptosis. Thus, the suppression of apoptosis by overexpression of Mcl-1 or Bcl-xL affected MC and lead to a significant induction of autophagy in HCT116 wt and HCT116 14-3-3sigma(-/-) cells.

The underlying epigenetic mechanism, however, is underexplored. Here we report that the transcriptional modulator megakaryocytic leukemia 1 (MKL1) is associated with a histone H3K4 methyltransferase activity. Re-ChIP assay suggests that MKL1 interacts with and recruits WDR5, a component of the COMPASS complex responsible for H3K4 methylation, to the promoter regions of pro-inflammatory genes in macrophages treated with TNF-alpha. WDR5 enhances the ability of MKL1 to stimulate the promoter activities of pro-inflammatory genes. In contrast, silencing of WDR5 attenuates TNF-alpha induced production of pro-inflammatory mediators and erases the H3K4 methylation from the gene promoters. Of interest, the chromatin remodeling protein BRG1 also plays an essential role in maintaining H3K4 methylation on MKL1 target promoters by interacting with WDR5. MKL1 knockdown disrupts the interaction between BRG1 and WDR5. Together, our data illustrate a role for MKL1 in moderating the crosstalk between BRG1 and WDR5 to activate TNF-alpha induced pro-inflammatory transcription in macrophages.",,"['Xu, Wenping', 'Zhao, Quanyi', 'Wu, Min', 'Fang, Mingming', 'Xu, Yong']","['Xu W', 'Zhao Q', 'Wu M', 'Fang M', 'Xu Y']","['Department of Medicine, Jiangsu Jiankang Vocational College, Nanjing, Jiangsu 211800, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei 430072, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei 430072, China.', 'Department of Medicine, Jiangsu Jiankang Vocational College, Nanjing, Jiangsu 211800, China.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Disease and Molecular Intervention, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu 211166, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,China,J Biomed Res,Journal of biomedical research,101551157,,,,,2017/11/08 06:00,2017/11/08 06:01,['2017/11/08 06:00'],"['2017/11/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/08 06:01 [medline]', '2017/11/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.7555/JBR.32.20170025 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biomed Res. 2019 Jun 4;33(3):164-172. doi: 10.7555/JBR.32.20170025.,PMC6551423,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The two functional germline variants of FEN1, rs174538 and rs4246215, regarding cancer susceptibility have been reported in lung, breast, liver, esophageal, gastric, colorectal cancer, glioma and leukemia, but not endometriosis. In this study, we firstly aimed at evaluating the contribution of FEN1 genotypes to endometriosis risk in a representative Taiwan population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In total, 153 patients with endometriosis and 636 non-cancer healthy controls were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) methodology. RESULTS: The genotypes of FEN1 rs174538, but not those of rs4246215, were differently distributed between the endometriosis and control groups. In detail, the AA of FEN1 rs174538 genotypes were significantly less frequently found among endometriosis patients than among controls (odds ratio [OR]=0.43, 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.24-0.78, p=0.0125). The A allele at FEN1 rs174538 was also significantly less frequent among cases than controls (OR=0.65, 95%CI=0.50-0.86, p=0.0021). As for age of first menarche, those with first menarche at the age >12.8 carrying the FEN1 rs174538 AA genotype conferred lower OR of 0.29 (95%CI=0.11-0.78, p=0.0381) for endometriosis. Regarding the full pregnancy status, those without having had a full-term pregnancy carrying the FEN1 rs174538 AA genotype were of lower risk (ORs=0.12, 95%CI=0.03-0.53, p=0.0050). CONCLUSION: The FEN1 rs174538 A allele is a novel protective biomarker for endometriosis and this genotype may have interactions with age- and hormone-related factors on the development of endometriosis.","['Copyright(c) 2017, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']","['Chou, An-Kuo', 'Shen, Ming-Yi', 'Chen, Fang-Yu', 'Hsiao, Chieh-Lun', 'Shih, Liang-Chun', 'Chang, Wen-Shin', 'Tsai, Chia-Wen', 'Ying, Tsung-Ho', 'Wu, Ming-Hsien', 'Huang, Chung-Yu', 'Bau, DA-Tian']","['Chou AK', 'Shen MY', 'Chen FY', 'Hsiao CL', 'Shih LC', 'Chang WS', 'Tsai CW', 'Ying TH', 'Wu MH', 'Huang CY', 'Bau DT']","['Department of Anesthesiology, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Medical Research, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Graduate Institute of Biomedical Sciences, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Medical Research, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Graduate Institute of Biomedical Sciences, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Terry Fox Cancer Research Laboratory, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Terry Fox Cancer Research Laboratory, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Terry Fox Cancer Research Laboratory, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Terry Fox Cancer Research Laboratory, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Chung Shan Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Taichung Armed Forces General Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Taoyuan Armed Forces General Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Graduate Institute of Biomedical Sciences, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C. datian@mail.cmuh.org.tw artbau2@gmail.com.', 'Terry Fox Cancer Research Laboratory, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Bioinformatics and Medical Engineering, Asia University, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Greece,Cancer Genomics Proteomics,Cancer genomics & proteomics,101188791,IM,"['Adult', 'Endometriosis/*genetics/pathology', 'Female', 'Flap Endonucleases/*genetics', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Male']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Endometriosis', '*FEN1', '*Taiwan', '*genotype', '*polymorphism']",2017/11/08 06:00,2018/07/04 06:00,['2017/11/08 06:00'],"['2017/08/02 00:00 [received]', '2017/09/05 00:00 [revised]', '2017/10/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/11/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/04 06:00 [medline]']","['14/6/455 [pii]', '10.21873/cgp.20055 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genomics Proteomics. 2017 Nov-Dec;14(6):455-460. doi: 10.21873/cgp.20055.,PMC6070328,"['EC 3.1.- (Flap Endonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.11.- (FEN1 protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CONCLUSION: RNA-sequencing proved to be a valuable tool for the detection of a fusion of genes DEK and NUP214 in a leukemia that showed cryptic cytogenetic rearrangement of chromosome band 9q34.","['Copyright(c) 2017, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']","['Panagopoulos, Ioannis', 'Gorunova, Ludmila', 'Torkildsen, Synne', 'Tjonnfjord, Geir E', 'Micci, Francesca', 'Heim, Sverre']","['Panagopoulos I', 'Gorunova L', 'Torkildsen S', 'Tjonnfjord GE', 'Micci F', 'Heim S']","['Section for Cancer Cytogenetics, Institute for Cancer Genetics and Informatics, The Norwegian Radium Hospital, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway ioannis.panagopoulos@rr-research.no.', 'Section for Cancer Cytogenetics, Institute for Cancer Genetics and Informatics, The Norwegian Radium Hospital, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'Section for Cancer Cytogenetics, Institute for Cancer Genetics and Informatics, The Norwegian Radium Hospital, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Haematology, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Haematology, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'Institute of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Section for Cancer Cytogenetics, Institute for Cancer Genetics and Informatics, The Norwegian Radium Hospital, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'Section for Cancer Cytogenetics, Institute for Cancer Genetics and Informatics, The Norwegian Radium Hospital, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'Institute of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,Greece,Cancer Genomics Proteomics,Cancer genomics & proteomics,101188791,IM,"['Adult', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA/*methods', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*DEK', '*DEK-NUP214 fusion gene', '*NUP214', '*PRRC2B', '*PRRC2B-DEK fusion gene', '*RNA-sequencing']",2017/11/08 06:00,2018/07/04 06:00,['2017/11/08 06:00'],"['2017/09/07 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/06 00:00 [revised]', '2017/10/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/11/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/04 06:00 [medline]']","['14/6/437 [pii]', '10.21873/cgp.20053 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genomics Proteomics. 2017 Nov-Dec;14(6):437-443. doi: 10.21873/cgp.20053.,PMC6070322,"['0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (Dek protein, human)', '0 (NUP214 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the phenotypic and functional heterogeneity of human MDSCs represents a major hurdle for the development of therapeutic strategies targeting or regulating MDSCs in tumor progression, inflammation, and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). We previously shown that circulating HLA-DR(-)CD14(+) monocytic MDSCs are a major contributor to clinical outcomes after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). In this study, we identified, using high-throughput screening, a set of surface markers that are strongly expressed in HLA-DR(-)CD14(+) monocytic MDSCs isolated from the peripheral blood (PB) of patients receiving allo-HSCT. Subsequent experiments showed the consistent dominant expression of CD1d in monocytic MDSCs of allo-HSCT PB in comparison with granulocytic MDSCs. In addition, CD1d-expressing cells isolated from PB of allo-HSCT patients showed the suppressive activity of T cell proliferation and higher expression of MyD88 and IDO compared with CD1d(-) cells. Our results suggest that CD1d could be a valuable marker for further therapeutic evaluation of human monocytic MDSCs for immune-related diseases, including GVHD.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Materials and Methods: This was a phase I study with intravenous fludarabine (25 mg/m(2), days 1-5), and methoxyamine (15 mg/m(2)-120 mg/m(2), once). A maximum of six cycles were given. Adult patients with relapsed/refractory hematologic malignancies, excluding acute myeloid leukemia, were eligible. Results: Twenty patients were treated; diagnoses included CLL/SLL (n = 10), follicular lymphoma (n = 3), DLBCL (n = 3), mantle cell lymphoma (n = 1), anaplastic large cell lymphoma (n = 1) and plasma cell myeloma (n = 2). No DLTs were observed and dose escalation reached the maximum planned dose. Hematologic toxicity was frequent; most common grade 3-4 toxicities were lymphopenia (70%), neutropenia (60%), leukopenia (50%) and anemia (40%). Four patients achieved a partial remission and 8 achieved stable disease. The drug combination resulted in increased DNA damage measured with the Comet assay. Conclusions: Methoxyamine combined with fludarabine was safe and well tolerated. Hematologic toxicity was comparable to single agent fludarabine. Activity appears to correlate with increased levels of DNA damage.

We evaluated the treatment status and survival outcomes of 69 Korean patients with pPCL. Of them, 59 patients were treated; 15 (25.4%) were treated initially with novel agent-based regimens with upfront autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT), 7 (11.9%) with conventional chemotherapy with upfront ASCT, 21 (35.6%) with novel agent-based regimens only, and 16 (27.1%) were treated with conventional chemotherapy alone. Overall response rates after initial therapy were significantly higher in patients treated with novel agent-based regimens compared with those treated with conventional chemotherapies (75% vs. 43.4%, P = 0.026). Median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 12.2 months and 16.1 months, respectively. The median PFS of the four treatment groups-conventional chemotherapy alone, novel agents alone, conventional chemotherapy with ASCT, and novel agents with ASCT-were 1.2, 9.0, 10.5, and 26.4 months, respectively (P < 0.001); the median OS of the four treatment groups were 2.9, 12.3, 14.1, and 31.1 months, respectively (P < 0.001). The median OS was also significantly better in the patients with novel agents with ASCT versus other patients. In a multivariate analysis, an increased lactate dehydrogenase level, low albumin (< 3.5 g/dL), and non-CR after front-line treatment were independently associated with poor PFS and OS.

This study aimed to investigate bone lesions detected by whole-body bone single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and its prognostic value in children with ALL. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed using whole-body bone SPECT scans obtained from children with ALL in our department between June 2008 and June 2012. A total of 166 children newly diagnosed with ALL were included, and the patients were divided into two groups: patients with positive and negative SPECT scans. We compared the clinical characteristics of the two groups and analyzed the relationship between the skeletal abnormalities detected by SPECT and prognosis. Results: Among the 166 patients, bone scintigraphic abnormalities was detected by SPECT scan in sixty-four patients (38.6%). The most common site was the limbs. There were no significant differences in age, gender, WBC count at diagnosis, risk group and minimal residual disease (MRD) level between SPECT-positive patients and their SPECT-negative counterparts. The event-free and overall survival rates were higher in SPECT-positive patients, but the difference was not statistically significant. However, patients with positive SPECT scans, especially those with multifocal abnormalities (>/=3 sites), had a higher rate of relapse (P < 0.05). Multivariate analyses identified that abnormal SPECT scan (HR = 3.547, P = 0.015) was an independent relapse risk. Conclusion: Children with ALL and multiple skeletal abnormalities will suffer from relapse. Abnormal SPECT scan was associated with increased relapse risk which might be a potential relapse marker for ALL children.",,"['Zhou, Fen', 'Zhang, Meiling', 'Han, Juan', 'Hao, Jinjin', 'Xiao, Yan', 'Liu, Qin', 'Jin, Runming', 'Mei, Heng']","['Zhou F', 'Zhang M', 'Han J', 'Hao J', 'Xiao Y', 'Liu Q', 'Jin R', 'Mei H']","['Department of Pediatrics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170523,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,,['NOTNLM'],"['SPECT', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'relapse', 'skeletal abnormalities']",2017/11/08 06:00,2017/11/08 06:01,['2017/11/08 06:00'],"['2016/07/26 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/11/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/08 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.18110 [doi]', '18110 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2017 May 23;8(45):79347-79355. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.18110. eCollection 2017 Oct 3.,PMC5668046,,,,,,,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Adjusted time-dependent analyses showed that, before 1.6 years post-treatment, there were no differences in survival times between chemotherapy and azacitidine treatments whereas, after this time-point, patients that received chemotherapy had a lower risk of death compared to those that received azacitidine (adjusted HR 0.61, 95%CI: 0.38-0.99 at 1.6 years).

However, its efficacy was limited in mono-therapy, and a higher incidence of fatal events was revealed in the combination with low-dose cytarabine. Thus, optimization of combination therapy with volasertib and other agents is necessary for its clinical development, and the predictive factors for response or resistance to volasertib remain largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the resistance mechanism in volasertib-resistant cell lines and the combination effects with other agents, such as azacitidine (AZA), on AML cells. We identified that mutations in the ATP-binding domain of PLK1 and expression of MDR1 conferred resistance to volasertib. In the combination therapy, the effects of AZA differed among cells, but were prominent in the cells with higher GI50 values of volasertib in mono-therapy. Furthermore, we identified that the cells in G2/M phase were more sensitive to volasertib, and the PI3K/AKT pathway was up-regulated upon administration of volasertib. Combination therapies with the agents that caused cell cycle accumulation in G2/M phase or with PI3K inhibitor were highly potent against AML cells.

The HematoFlow solution, able to quantify CD16 negative monocytes, could be a useful tool to manage monocytosis which remains a common issue in routine laboratories. METHODS: Classical monocytes were quantified from 153 whole blood samples collected on EDTA using both flow cytometry methods, either MO1 percentage determination by the multiparameter assay previously published and regarded here as the reference method, or CD16 negative monocyte percentage determination by the means of HematoFlow. RESULTS: Both methods of classical monocyte percentage determination were highly and significantly correlated (r = 0.87, P < 0.0001). The HematoFlow solution leant toward an overestimation of the genuine classical monocyte percentages obtained by the reference method. Percentages of CD16 negative monocytes provided by HematoFlow were higher than 94% for all the 73 patients displaying classical monocytes MO1 found >/=94% by the reference method, indicating a sensitivity of 100%. Furthermore, the calculation of CD16 negative monocyte percentage can be easily computerized and integrated to the middleware. CONCLUSIONS: We propose a new application of the Hematoflow solution that can be used as a flag system for monocytosis management and CMML detection.

This study assessed where children with cancer in the Netherlands were treated since 2004. METHODS: All patients aged under 18 diagnosed with cancer between 2004 and 2013 were selected from the Netherlands Cancer Registry (NCR) and linked with the Dutch Childhood Oncology Group (DCOG) database. Associations between patient and tumour characteristics and site of care were tested statistically with logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: This population-based study of 6021 children diagnosed with cancer showed that 82% of them were treated in a paediatric oncology centre. Ninety-four percent of the patients under 10 years of age, 85% of the patients aged 10-14 and 48% of the patients aged 15-17 were treated in a paediatric oncology centre. All International Classification of Childhood Cancers (ICCC), 3rd edition, ICCC-3 categories, except embryonal tumours, were associated with a higher risk of treatment outside a paediatric oncology centre compared to leukaemia. Multivariable analyses by ICCC-3 category revealed that specific tumour types such as chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML), embryonal carcinomas, bone tumours other type than osteosarcoma, non-rhabdomyosarcomas, thyroid carcinomas, melanomas and skin carcinomas as well as lower-staged tumours were associated with treatment outside a paediatric oncology centre. CONCLUSION: The site of childhood cancer care in the Netherlands depends on the age of the cancer patient, type of tumour and stage at diagnosis. Collaboration between paediatric oncology centre(s), other academic units is needed to ensure most up-to-date paediatric cancer care for childhood cancer patients at the short and long term.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

RSV causes airway mucosa inflammation and cellular oxidative damage by triggering production of reactive oxygen species and by inhibiting at the same time expression of antioxidant enzymes, via degradation of the transcription factor NF-E2-related factor 2 (NRF2). RSV infection induces NRF2 deacetylation, ubiquitination, and degradation through a proteasome-dependent pathway. Although degradation via KEAP1 is the most common mechanism, silencing KEAP1 expression did not rescue NRF2 levels during RSV infection. We found that RSV-induced NRF2 degradation occurs in an SUMO-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase - RING finger protein 4 (RNF4)-dependent manner. NRF2 is progressively SUMOylated in RSV infection and either blocking SUMOylation or silencing RNF4 expression rescued both NRF2 nuclear levels and transcriptional activity. RNF4 associates with promyelocytic leukemia - nuclear bodies (PML-NBs). RSV infection induces the expression of PML and PML-NBs formation in an interferon (INF)-dependent manner and also induces NRF2 - PMN-NBs association. Inhibition of PML-NB formation by blocking IFN pathway or silencing PML expression resulted in a significant reduction of RSV-associated NRF2 degradation and increased antioxidant enzyme expression, identifying the RNF4-PML pathway as a key regulator of antioxidant defenses in the course of viral infection.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

All the patients displayed an erythematous maculopapular eruption on the trunk and the limbs associated with fever. All but one had received a polychemotherapy for an acute myeloid leukemia (n=10) or a urothelial carcinoma (n=1) before the occurrence of the skin eruption. One had an autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome causing chronic agranulocytosis requiring granulocyte colony-stimulating factor injection. In all patients, the skin eruption was associated with a slight increase of white blood cell count followed by bone marrow recovery within the next weeks. All skin biopsies showed a dermal perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate containing atypical medium- to large-sized CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+, CD25+, ICOS+, PD1- lymphocytes with a strong CD30 expression in most instances (n=10), suggesting the recruitment of strongly activated T cells in the skin. In 6 patients, a diagnosis of CD30+ lymphoproliferative disorder or Sezary syndrome was proposed or suspected histopathologically, and only the clinical context allowed the diagnosis of ELR with a peculiar presentation with atypical lymphocytes.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 92 patients with CBF-AML in first relapse who presented to our institution from 1990-2014. Clinical and demographic parameters were included in univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model to predict overall survival. RESULTS: Among the 92 relapsed patients, 60 (65%) patients had inv (16) and 32 (35%) had t (8;21). The median survival for patients with inv(16) cytogenetic group was 15.6 months (range 10.32 to 20.88 months) while for the t(8;21) group was 9 months (range 3.68 to 14.32) (P = .004). Univariate Cox model analysis showed that increased age, high white blood cell count, t (8;21) cytogenetic group, and high bone marrow blast percentage were associated with poor overall outcome, while stem cell transplant intervention was associated with better survival. Additional cytogenetic aberrations at relapse were not associated with survival outcomes (P = .4). Multivariate Cox model analysis showed that t(8;21) cytogenetic group has more hazard of death after adjusting, age, marrow blast percentage, blood cell count, and stem cell transplant(hazard ratio 1.802; P = .02). CONCLUSION: Among patients with relapsed CBF-AML, median survival was less than a year and half and the outcome was worse in patients with t (8;21). Despite the relatively better outcomes, dedicated clinical trials are needed to improve the outcome in all patients with relapsed CBF-AML.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Few studies have systematically analyzed this rare disorder. OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinicopathologic characteristics and treatment of Sweet syndrome and identify characteristics associated with concurrent malignancy. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed patients with Sweet syndrome at the University of Pennsylvania from 2005 to 2015. RESULTS: We identified 83 patients (mean age, 57 years; 51% male) with Sweet syndrome: 30% with the classic form, 44% with the malignancy-associated form, 24% with the drug-induced form in the setting of malignancy, and 2% with the drug-induced form. Acute myeloid leukemia was the most common malignancy (in 24 of 83 patients [29%]). Filgrastim was the most common medication (used in 8 of 83 patients [10%]). Leukopenia (P < .001), anemia (P = .002), thrombocytopenia (P < .001), absence of arthralgia (P < .001), and histiocytoid or subcutaneous histopathology (P = .024) were associated with malignancy (chi(2) test). LIMITATIONS: This was a retrospective study that represents patients from a single tertiary academic referral center, which may limit its generalizability to other settings. CONCLUSION: When caring for patients with Sweet syndrome, dermatologists should be aware of the potential association of leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, absence of arthralgia, and histiocytoid or subcutaneous histopathology with malignancy.","['Copyright (c) 2017 American Academy of Dermatology, Inc.

In the present study we have investigated cytotoxic effects of FLU on malignant melanoma using A-375, BOWES and RPMI-7951 cell lines representing diverse melanoma molecular types. In all three cell lines, FLU inhibited cell growth and proliferation and disrupted microtubule structure and function which was accompanied by dramatic changes in cellular morphology. In addition, FLU-treated cells accumulated at the G2/M phase of cell cycle and displayed the features of mitotic catastrophe characterized by formation of giant cells with multiple nuclei, abnormal spindles and subsequent apoptotic demise. Although this endpoint was observed in all treated melanoma lines, our analyses showed different activated biochemical signaling in particular cells, thus suggesting a promising treatment potential of FLU in malignant melanoma warranting its further testing.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Early recognition is crucial for facilitating successful treatment with minimal morbidity. The goal of this analysis was to identify patient characteristics associated with high-risk surgical disease through a population-based examination into this rare and deadly disease process. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of the 2009 and 2012 Kids' Inpatient Database (KID) was conducted. A series of queries (Fungal infection-->immunocompromised diagnosis-->sinus procedure) identified 102 patients with likely invasive fungal sinusitis. Outcomes included: species, invasive extension, death, and other clinical characteristics. RESULTS: Patients with leukemia/lymphoma constituted 90.2% of individuals evaluated in this analysis. Nearly a quarter of pediatric patients receiving surgical treatment for invasive fungal sinusitis died during their hospital stay -24.9%. Aspergillus was the most commonly recorded mycotic species. Average hospital stay was 59.3 days, and associated hospital costs averaged $746,299 per stay. Patients 0-5 years old were more likely to have orbital involvement -56.3%. Brain extension was noted in 33.7% of this cohort as well. Mucormycosis was an independent predictor of death (p = 0.03), with an odds ratio of 3.835. CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest pediatric cohort with invasive fungal sinusitis in the literature. Patient demographics, cytology, and disease extension offer predictive information regarding patient outcomes for invasive fungal sinusitis. A high clinical suspicion and early treatment may decrease the lengthy and costly hospitalizations in this population.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, supraphysiological doses can suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. HPA axis suppression resulting in reduced cortisol response may cause an impaired stress response and an inadequate host defence against infection, which remain a cause of morbidity and death. Suppression commonly occurs in the first days after cessation of glucocorticoid therapy, but the exact duration is unclear. This review is the second update of a previously published Cochrane review. OBJECTIVES: To examine the occurrence and duration of HPA axis suppression after (each cycle of) glucocorticoid therapy for childhood ALL. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 11), MEDLINE/PubMed (from 1945 to December 2016), and Embase/Ovid (from 1980 to December 2016). In addition, we searched reference lists of relevant articles, conference proceedings (the International Society for Paediatric Oncology and the American Society of Clinical Oncology from 2005 up to and including 2016, and the American Society of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology from 2014 up to and including 2016), and ongoing trial databases (the International Standard Registered Clinical/Social Study Number (ISRCTN) register via http://www.controlled-trials.com, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) register via www.clinicaltrials.gov, and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) of the World Health Organization (WHO) via apps.who.int/trialsearch) on 27 December 2016. SELECTION CRITERIA: All study designs, except case reports and patient series with fewer than 10 children, examining effects of glucocorticoid therapy for childhood ALL on HPA axis function. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently performed study selection. One review author extracted data and assessed 'Risk of bias'; another review author checked this information. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 10 studies (total of 298 children; we identified two studies for this update) including two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed adrenal function. None of the included studies assessed the HPA axis at the level of the hypothalamus, the pituitary, or both. Owing to substantial differences between studies, we could not pool results. All studies had risk of bias issues. Included studies demonstrated that adrenal insufficiency occurs in nearly all children during the first days after cessation of glucocorticoid treatment for childhood ALL. Most children recovered within a few weeks, but a small number of children had ongoing adrenal insufficiency lasting up to 34 weeks.Included studies evaluated several risk factors for (prolonged) adrenal insufficiency. First, three studies including two RCTs investigated the difference between prednisone and dexamethasone in terms of occurrence and duration of adrenal insufficiency. The RCTs found no differences between prednisone and dexamethasone arms. In the other (observational) study, children who received prednisone recovered earlier than children who received dexamethasone. Second, treatment with fluconazole appeared to prolong the duration of adrenal insufficiency, which was evaluated in two studies. One of these studies reported that the effect was present only when children received fluconazole at a dose higher than 10 mg/kg/d. Finally, two studies evaluated the presence of infection, stress episodes, or both, as a risk factor for adrenal insufficiency. In one of these studies (an RCT), trial authors found no relationship between the presence of infection/stress and adrenal insufficiency. The other study found that increased infection was associated with prolonged duration of adrenal insufficiency. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that adrenal insufficiency commonly occurs in the first days after cessation of glucocorticoid therapy for childhood ALL, but the exact duration is unclear. No data were available on the levels of the hypothalamus and the pituitary; therefore, we could draw no conclusions regarding these outcomes. Clinicians may consider prescribing glucocorticoid replacement therapy during periods of serious stress in the first weeks after cessation of glucocorticoid therapy for childhood ALL to reduce the risk of life-threatening complications. However, additional high-quality research is needed to inform evidence-based guidelines for glucocorticoid replacement therapy.Special attention should be paid to patients receiving fluconazole therapy, and perhaps similar antifungal drugs, as these treatments may prolong the duration of adrenal insufficiency, especially when administered at a dose higher than 10 mg/kg/d.Finally, it would be relevant to investigate further the relationship between present infection/stress and adrenal insufficiency in a larger, separate study specially designed for this purpose.",,"['Rensen, Niki', 'Gemke, Reinoud Jbj', 'van Dalen, Elvira C', 'Rotteveel, Joost', 'Kaspers, Gertjan Jl']","['Rensen N', 'Gemke RJ', 'van Dalen EC', 'Rotteveel J', 'Kaspers GJ']","['Department of Pediatrics, Division of Oncology/Hematology, VU University Medical Center, De Boelelaan 1117, Amsterdam, Netherlands, 1081 HZ.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20171106,England,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,100909747,IM,"['Adrenal Insufficiency/*chemically induced', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Fluconazole/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Glucocorticoids/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System/*drug effects', 'Observational Studies as Topic', 'Pituitary-Adrenal System/*drug effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prednisolone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic']",,,2017/11/07 06:00,2018/01/06 06:00,['2017/11/07 06:00'],"['2017/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/06 06:00 [medline]', '2017/11/07 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/14651858.CD008727.pub4 [doi]'],epublish,Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2017 Nov 6;11:CD008727. doi: 10.1002/14651858.CD008727.pub4.,PMC6486149,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '8VZV102JFY (Fluconazole)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",,,,,,,,,,,['Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2015 Aug 17;(8):CD008727.

This situation can worsen at times of hospital construction, however there are several preventive measures available. This work aims to define the cost-effectiveness of some of these interventions. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A decision tree model was used, it was divided into four arms according to each 1 of the interventions performed. A cost-effectiveness incremental analysis comparing environmental control measures, high efficiency particulate absorption (HEPA) filter installation and prophylaxis with posaconazole was done. Probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses were also carried out. RESULTS: Among 86 patients with 175 hospitalization episodes, the incidence of IA with environmental protection measures, antifungal prophylaxis and hospitalization in rooms with HEPA filters was 14.4%, 6.3% and 0%, respectively. An Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratio analysis was performed and it was found that HEPA filtered rooms and environmental protection measures are cost saving interventions when compared with posaconazole prophylaxis (-$2665 vs -$4073 vs $42 531 US dollars, respectively) for IA episode prevented. CONCLUSION: The isolation of inpatients with acute leukemia during hospital construction periods in HEPA filtered rooms could reduce the incidence of IA and might be a cost-effective prevention strategy.",['(c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Here, we show that stimulation of NK cells with IL-12/15/18 for two days led to downregulation of surface expression of the inhibitory KIR2DL2/L3, KIR2DL1 and KIR3DL1 receptors on peripheral blood NK cells. Downregulation of KIR expression was attributed to decreased KIR mRNA levels which could be re-induced already 3 days after re-culture in IL-2. Reduced KIR2DL2/L3 expression on IL-12/15/18-activated NK cells resulted in less inhibition upon antibody-mediated KIR engagement and increased CD16-dependent cytotoxicity in redirected lysis assays. Most importantly, downregulated KIR2DL2/L3 expression enabled enhanced cytotoxicity of IL-12/15/18-stimulated NK cells against tumor cells expressing cognate HLA-I molecules. NK cells pre-activated with IL-12/15/18 were previously shown to exert potent anti-tumor activity and memory-like long-lived functionality, mediating remission in a subset of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients in a clinical trial. Our study reveals a novel mechanism of IL-12/15/18 in improving the cytotoxicity of NK cells by reducing their sensitivity to inhibition by self-HLA-I due to decreased KIR expression, highlighting the potency of IL-12/15/18-activated NK cells for anti-tumor immunotherapy protocols.","['(c) 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

IL-15 activates STAT5 proteins, which can form dimers or tetramers. We previously found that NK cell numbers are decreased in Stat5a-Stat5b tetramer-deficient double knockin (DKI) mice, but the mechanism was not investigated. Here we show that STAT5 dimers are sufficient for NK cell development, whereas STAT5 tetramers mediate NK cell maturation and the expression of maturation-associated genes. Unlike the defective proliferation of Stat5 DKI CD8(+) T cells, Stat5 DKI NK cells have normal proliferation to IL-15 but are susceptible to death upon cytokine withdrawal, with lower Bcl2 and increased active caspases. These findings underscore the importance of STAT5 tetramers in maintaining NK cell homoeostasis. Moreover, defective STAT5 tetramer formation could represent a cause of NK cell immunodeficiency, and interrupting STAT5 tetramer formation might serve to control NK leukaemia.",,"['Lin, Jian-Xin', 'Du, Ning', 'Li, Peng', 'Kazemian, Majid', 'Gebregiorgis, Tesfay', 'Spolski, Rosanne', 'Leonard, Warren J']","['Lin JX', 'Du N', 'Li P', 'Kazemian M', 'Gebregiorgis T', 'Spolski R', 'Leonard WJ']","['Laboratory of Molecular Immunology and the Immunology Center, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, 20892-1674, USA. linjx@nhlbi.nih.gov.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Immunology and the Immunology Center, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, 20892-1674, USA.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Immunology and the Immunology Center, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, 20892-1674, USA.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Immunology and the Immunology Center, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, 20892-1674, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Computer Science, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, 47906, USA.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Immunology and the Immunology Center, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, 20892-1674, USA.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Immunology and the Immunology Center, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, 20892-1674, USA.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Immunology and the Immunology Center, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, 20892-1674, USA. wjl@helix.nih.gov.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20171106,England,Nat Commun,Nature communications,101528555,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/immunology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival/immunology', 'Cytokines/immunology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Knock-In Techniques', 'Homeostasis', 'Killer Cells, Natural/cytology/*immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Models, Immunological', 'Protein Structure, Quaternary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/immunology', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/chemistry/genetics/*immunology']",,,2017/11/07 06:00,2018/09/05 06:00,['2017/11/07 06:00'],"['2017/02/20 00:00 [received]', '2017/09/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41467-017-01477-5 [doi]', '10.1038/s41467-017-01477-5 [pii]']",epublish,Nat Commun. 2017 Nov 6;8(1):1320. doi: 10.1038/s41467-017-01477-5.,PMC5673064,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat5a protein, mouse)', '0 (Stat5b protein, mouse)', '114100-40-2 (Bcl2 protein, mouse)']",['K22 HL125593/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7080-8820'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Karyotyping is generally performed to enable risk stratification, but the results are not always consistent with those of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and more accurate and rapid methods are required. METHODS: A total of 487 samples from de novo AML patients enrolled in the Japanese Pediatric Leukemia/Lymphoma Study Group (JPLSG) AML-05 study (n = 448), and from acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) patients enrolled in the JPLSG AML-P05 study (n = 39) were available for this investigation. Multiplex quantitative RT-PCR was performed to detect eight important fusion genes: AML1(RUNX1)-ETO(RUNX1T1), CBFB-MYH11, MLL(KMT2A)-AF9(MLLT3), MLL-ELL, MLL-AF6(MLLT4), FUS(TLS)-ERG, NUP98-HOXA9, and PML-RARA. RESULTS: Fusion genes were detected in 207 (46.2%) of the 448 AML-05 patient samples. After exclusion of two samples with PML-RARA, no chromosomal abnormalities were identified on karyotyping in 19 of 205 patients (9.3%) positive for fusion genes on RT-PCR. Fusion genes were confirmed on fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in 11 of these 19 patients. In contrast, fusion genes were detected in 37 of 39 patients (94.9%) from the AML-P05 study, and 33 of these results were consistent with the karyotyping. There were discrepancies in four patients (10.8%), three with normal karyotypes and one in whom karyotyping was not possible. All four of these patients were PML-RARA positive on FISH.

We studied the incidence and severity of chronic health conditions among survivors of childhood leukemia with DS compared with those without DS. METHODS: Chronic health conditions reported by questionnaire were compared between 154 pediatric leukemia survivors with DS and 581 without DS, matched by leukemia, age at diagnosis, race/ethnicity, sex, radiation location and chemotherapy exposure using Cox models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Subjects were selected from 7139 5-year survivors of leukemia in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study. RESULTS: Risk of at least 1 late onset chronic health condition (grade 1-5) was similar in the DS population compared with the non-DS group (HR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.7-1.5). Serious chronic health conditions (grade 3-5) were more common in DS survivors (HR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1-2.6), as were >/= 3 chronic health conditions (grades 1-5) (HR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.2-2.4). The 25-year cumulative incidence of any condition (grades 1-5) was 83% for DS survivors and 69% for non-DS survivors. CONCLUSION: Leukemia survivors with DS have therapy-related chronic health conditions comparable to those of similarly treated survivors without DS, with a few notable exceptions: 1) an increased risk of cataracts, hearing loss, and thyroid dysfunction compared with survivors without DS (though these are known risks in the DS population), 2) decreased risk of second cancers, and 3) increased risk of severe or multiple conditions.

The use of one specific form of social media, Twitter, has increased among healthcare providers, both as a means of information gathering and as a conduit for original content creation. Recently, major efforts by users have been put forward to help streamline the unprecedented amount of information that can be found on Twitter. These efforts have led to the creation of diseasespecific hashtag (#) medical communities and have greatly enhanced the ability to understand and better categorize the available data on Twitter. Specifically, for those involved in rare cancer fields, adhering to organically designed and consistently used hashtags has led to the rapid, reliable dissemination of information and the ability to efficiently discuss and debate topics of interest in the field. For the field of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), the creation of #MPNSM (myeloproliferative neoplasms on social media) in 2015 has facilitated interactions among healthcare stakeholders from all over the world in the MPN field. RECENT FINDINGS: In order to better understand the trends and topics of interest to Twitter users of this novel medical community, we conducted the present analysis which focuses on Twitter analytics from the first two years of #MPNSM. In this analysis, we observed a sustained increase in the number of Twitter users, number of tweets, number of impressions, and number of retweets over time, demonstrating the feasibility of creating and maintaining a disease-specific hashtag for a rare cancer over time.",,"['Pemmaraju, Naveen', 'Utengen, Audun', 'Gupta, Vikas', 'Kiladjian, Jean-Jacques', 'Mesa, Ruben', 'Thompson, Michael A']","['Pemmaraju N', 'Utengen A', 'Gupta V', 'Kiladjian JJ', 'Mesa R', 'Thompson MA']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Unit 428, PO Box 301402, Houston, TX, 77230-1402, USA. npemmaraju@mdanderson.org.', 'Symplur LLC, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'The Elizabeth and Tony Comper MPN Program-Princess Margaret Cancer Center, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'CIC (Clinical Investigations Center INSERM CIC 1427), Hopital Saint-Louis and Universite Paris Diderot, Paris, France.', 'University of Texas Health San Antonio Cancer Center, San Antonio, TX, USA.', 'Aurora Research Institute, Aurora Health Care, Milwaukee, WI, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,Current hematologic malignancy reports,101262565,IM,"['Humans', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*diagnosis', 'Neoplasms/*diagnosis', 'Rare Diseases/*diagnosis', 'Social Media/*statistics & numerical data', 'Time Factors']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Disease-specific hashtag', '*Essential thrombocytosis', '*MPN', '*Myelofibrosis', '*Myeloproliferative neoplasm', '*Polycythemia vera', '*Social media', '*Twitter']",2017/11/07 06:00,2018/07/10 06:00,['2017/11/07 06:00'],"['2017/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/10 06:00 [medline]', '2017/11/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11899-017-0421-y [doi]', '10.1007/s11899-017-0421-y [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Hematol Malig Rep. 2017 Dec;12(6):598-604. doi: 10.1007/s11899-017-0421-y.,PMC8148890,,"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA054174/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['NIHMS1698086'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This signaling has a protumorigenic effect but may also act as a tumor suppressor. How induction of a single pathway gives rise to the opposite effects in different cell types is still unknown. Methods: This review article includes available data from peer-reviewed publications associated with the role of Notch signaling during cancer pathogenesis. Results: Numerous reports have indicated that alterations in Notch signaling and its oncogenic activity were originally associated with the pathogenesis of Tcell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (T-ALL), an aggressive hematologic tumor affecting children and adolescents. The possibility that Notch could play a significant role in human breast cancer development comes from studies on mouse mammary tumor virus-induced cancer. Numerous findings over the past several years have indicated that alterations in Notch signaling are also responsible for ovarian cancer development. Mention should also be made of the connection between expression of Notch 3 and increased resistance to chemotherapy, which remains a major obstacle to successful treatment. Notch as an oncogenic factor is also involved in the development of colon cancer, lung carcinoma and Kaposi's sarcoma. Conclusion: Notch is a binary cell fate determinant and its overexpression has been described as oncogenic in a wide array of human malignancies. This finding led to interest in therapeutically targeting this pathway, especially by the use of gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) blocking the cleavage of Notch receptors at the cell membrane by the inhibition of Notch intracellular domain (NICD) releasing. Preclinical cancer models have revealed that GSIs suppress the growth of cancers such as pancreatic, breast and lung cancer.",,"['Brzozowa-Zasada, Marlena', 'Piecuch, Adam', 'Michalski, Marek', 'Segiet, Oliwia', 'Kurek, Jozef', 'Harabin-Slowinska, Marzena', 'Wojnicz, Romuald']","['Brzozowa-Zasada M', 'Piecuch A', 'Michalski M', 'Segiet O', 'Kurek J', 'Harabin-Slowinska M', 'Wojnicz R']","['Department of Histology and Embryology, School of Medicine with the Division of Dentistry in Zabrze, Medical University of Silesia, Jordana 19, 41-808 Zabrze, Poland.0000 0001 2198 0923grid.411728.9', 'Department of Histology and Embryology, School of Medicine with the Division of Dentistry in Zabrze, Medical University of Silesia, Jordana 19, 41-808 Zabrze, Poland.0000 0001 2198 0923grid.411728.9', 'Department of Histology and Embryology, School of Medicine with the Division of Dentistry in Zabrze, Medical University of Silesia, Jordana 19, 41-808 Zabrze, Poland.0000 0001 2198 0923grid.411728.9', 'Department of Histology and Embryology, School of Medicine with the Division of Dentistry in Zabrze, Medical University of Silesia, Jordana 19, 41-808 Zabrze, Poland.0000 0001 2198 0923grid.411728.9', 'Municipal Hospital, Jaworzno, Poland.', 'Department of Histology and Embryology, School of Medicine with the Division of Dentistry in Zabrze, Medical University of Silesia, Jordana 19, 41-808 Zabrze, Poland.0000 0001 2198 0923grid.411728.9', 'Department of Histology and Embryology, School of Medicine with the Division of Dentistry in Zabrze, Medical University of Silesia, Jordana 19, 41-808 Zabrze, Poland.0000 0001 2198 0923grid.411728.9']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170918,Austria,Eur Surg,European surgery : ACA : Acta chirurgica Austriaca,101140655,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer', 'Chemoresistance', 'Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition', 'Notch']",2017/11/07 06:00,2017/11/07 06:01,['2017/11/07 06:00'],"['2017/02/01 00:00 [received]', '2017/09/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/07 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s10353-017-0491-z [doi]', '491 [pii]']",ppublish,Eur Surg. 2017;49(5):199-209. doi: 10.1007/s10353-017-0491-z.

It is localised on human chromosome 2q35 and three different isomers, MR-1L, MR-1M and MR-1S, are formed by alternative splicing. MR-1S promotes cardiac hypertrophy and is closely related to cancer. MR-1S is overexpressed in haematologic and solid malignancies, such as hepatoma, breast cancer and chronic myelogenous leukaemia. MR-1S causes disordered cell differentiation, initiates malignant transformation and accelerates metastasis. MR-1S directly phosphorylates and activates the MEK-ERK-RSK pathway to accelerate cancer growth and facilitates metastasis by activating the MLC2-FAK-AKT pathway. Silencing MR-1 inhibits cancer cell proliferation and metastasis. MR-1S causes disordered cell differentiation, initiates malignant transformation and accelerates metastasis. MR-1 interacts with eukaryotic translation initiation factors and MRIP-1, which contains Ras GTPase, PH and zinc-containing ArfGap domains, as well as three ankyrin repeats. Mutations in the N-terminal region of MR-1L and MR-1S are the main causes of PNKD (a hereditary disease characterised by paroxysmal dystonic choreoathetosis) and targeting the mutated protein could provide symptomatic relief.

However, multifaceted and divergent signaling cascades downstream of oxidative stress have posed challenges for researchers to identify a central component of the oxidative stress-induced pathways causing neurodegeneration in PD. Since 2010, c-Abl-a non-receptor tyrosine kinase and an indicator of oxidative stress-has shown remarkable potential as a future promising drug target in PD therapeutics. Although, the constitutively active form of c-Abl, Bcr-Abl, has a long history in chronic myeloid leukemia and acute lymphocytic leukemia, the role of c-Abl in PD and relevant neurodegenerative diseases was completely unknown. Recently, others and we have identified and validated c-Abl as an important pathogenic mediator of the disease, where activated c-Abl emerges as a common link to various PD-related inducers of oxidative stress relevant to both sporadic and familial forms of PD and alpha-synucleinopathies.

However, few reports have studied the contribution of MMP genotypes to either diagnostic or prognostic potential in non-solid tumors such as leukemia. In this study, we firstly investigated the contribution of a polymorphism in the promoter region of MMP-8 (-799C/T) and two non-synonymous polymorphisms (Val436Ala and Lys460Thr) to childhood leukemia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this study, 266 patients with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 266 non-cancer control patients were collected and the genomic DNA was isolated from their peripheral blood. MMP-8 -799C/T, Val436Ala and Lys460Thr polymorphic genotypes of each subject were determined by the typical polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). RESULTS: The results showed that the three polymorphisms were not significantly associated with an increased risk of childhood ALL in the overall investigated population. Furthermore, when the analyses were stratified by age and gender, no significant association between these genotypes and increased ALL risk was found. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the polymorphisms at MMP-8 -799C/T, Val436Ala and Lys460Thr may not play a major role in determining the personal susceptibility to childhood ALL in Taiwan.","['Copyright(c) 2017, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']","['Pei, Jen-Sheng', 'Chang, Wen-Shin', 'Hsu, Pei-Chen', 'Hung, Yi-Wen', 'Cheng, Shun-Ping', 'Tsai, Chia-Wen', 'Bau, DA-Tian', 'Gong, Chi-Li']","['Pei JS', 'Chang WS', 'Hsu PC', 'Hung YW', 'Cheng SP', 'Tsai CW', 'Bau DT', 'Gong CL']","['Department of Pediatrics, Taoyuan General Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taoyuan, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Terry Fox Cancer Research Laboratory, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Taoyuan General Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taoyuan, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Medicine Research, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Taoyuan General Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taoyuan, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Terry Fox Cancer Research Laboratory, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C. datian@mail.cmuh.org.tw artbau2@gmail.com.', 'Terry Fox Cancer Research Laboratory, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C. datian@mail.cmuh.org.tw artbau2@gmail.com.', 'Graduate Institute of Biomedical Sciences, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Bioinformatics and Medical Engineering, Asia University, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Physiology, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C. datian@mail.cmuh.org.tw artbau2@gmail.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Greece,In Vivo,"In vivo (Athens, Greece)",8806809,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Genetic Association Studies', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 8/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Sex Characteristics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Age', '*MMP-8', '*childhood', '*gender', '*genotype', '*leukemia', '*polymorphism']",2017/11/06 06:00,2018/06/16 06:00,['2017/11/06 06:00'],"['2017/08/20 00:00 [received]', '2017/09/14 00:00 [revised]', '2017/09/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/16 06:00 [medline]']","['31/6/1059 [pii]', '10.21873/invivo.11170 [doi]']",ppublish,In Vivo. 2017 Nov-Dec;31(6):1059-1064. doi: 10.21873/invivo.11170.,PMC5756632,"['EC 3.4.24.34 (MMP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.24.34 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 8)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Even in the current era of targeted therapy, chemotherapy remains the backbone of treatment for many hematologic malignancies, especially in acute leukemias, where relapse remains the major cause of mortality. Application of novel immunotherapies in hematology attempts to harness the killing power of the immune system against leukemia and lymphoma. Cellular immunotherapy is evolving rapidly for high-risk hematologic disorders. Recent advances include chimeric antigen-receptor T cells, mesenchymal stromal/stem cells, dendritic cell tumor vaccines, cytokine-induced killer cells, and virus-specific T cells. The advantages of nontransplantation cellular immunotherapy include suitability for patients for whom transplantation has failed or is contraindicated, and a potentially less-toxic treatment alternative to transplantation for relapsed/refractory patients. This review examines those emerging cellular immunotherapies that are changing treatment paradigms for patients with hematologic malignancies.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.

The contribution of this microenvironment to the pathophysiology of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is not well defined. A recent study in mice demonstrated that DICER1 gene deletion in osteoprogenitor cells from the BM microenvironment suppressed osteogenic differentiation and induced MDS and AML-like haematological findings. The present study evaluated the expression profiles of microRNAs (miRNAs) and DICER1 gene in BM-derived MSC of patients with AML (n=12), MDS (n=10) and healthy controls (HC) (n=8).miRNA expression profiles were analyzed by microarray and confirmations were performed using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Patient MSC displayed impaired proliferative and differentiation potential compared to HC. DICER1 gene expression was lower in MSC from MDS and AML patients than HC and some differentially expressed miRNAs indicated the potential involvement of DICER1 in the pathogenesis of MDS and AML. qRT-PCR confirmation revealed down-regulated miRNAs (hsa-miR-30d-5p, hsa-miR-222-3p and hsa-miR-30a-3p in MDS; hsa-miR-1275, hsa-miR-4725-5p and hsa-miR-143-3p in AML) and over-expressed miRNAs (hsa-miR-4462 in MDS; hsa-miR-134-5p and hsa-miR-874-3p in AML) in MDS and AML.

The decision to administer re-induction chemotherapy with residual disease on day 14 is variable and lacks clear guidance.

RESULTS: Of 90 patients with a positive day 14 BM biopsy, 53 did not receive immediate re-induction chemotherapy. Twenty-seven (51%) of those patients achieved a CR upon count recovery. Favorable risk cytogenetics was found to be highly significant for attaining a CR at repeat BM biopsy. CONCLUSIONS: Day 14 BM evaluations following 3+7 induction are unable to accurately predict the ability to achieve a CR. Many patients will attain a CR despite no further chemotherapy.

Vitamin C deficiency is rare in the general population, but is frequently observed in patients with cancer. Genes encoding epigenetic regulators are often mutated in cancer, underscoring their central roles in carcinogenesis. In hematological cancers, such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), drugs that reverse epigenetic aberrations are now the standard of care. Recent in vitro studies suggest that vitamin C at physiological concentrations, combined with hypomethylating agents may act synergistically to cause DNA demethylation through active and passive mechanisms, respectively. Additionally, several recent studies have renewed interest in the use of pharmacological doses of vitamin C injected intravenously to selectively kill tumor cells. This review will focus on the potential of vitamin C to optimize the outcome of epigenetic therapy in cancer patients and alternatively to act as a therapeutic at high doses.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Both the Escherichia coli (EcAII) and Erwinia chrysanthemi (ErAII) type II ASNases currently used in the clinics are characterized by high in vivo instability, short half-life and the requirement of several administrations to obtain a pharmacologically active concentration. Moreover, they are sensitive to proteases (cathepsin B and asparagine endopeptidase) that are over-expressed by resistant leukaemia lymphoblasts, thereby impairing drug activity and pharmacokinetics. Herein, we present the biochemical, structural and in vitro antiproliferative characterization of a new EcAII variant, N24S. The mutant shows completely preserved asparaginase and glutaminase activities, long-term storage stability, improved thermal parameters, and outstanding resistance to proteases derived from leukaemia cells. Structural analysis demonstrates a modification in the hydrogen bond network related to residue 24, while Normal Mode-based geometric Simulation and Molecular Dynamics predict a general rigidification of the monomer as compared to wild-type. These improved features render N24S a potential alternative treatment to reduce the number of drug administrations in vivo and to successfully address one of the major current challenges of ALL treatment: spontaneous, protease-dependent and immunological inactivation of ASNase.",,"['Maggi, Maristella', 'Mittelman, Steven D', 'Parmentier, Jean Hugues', 'Colombo, Giorgio', 'Meli, Massimiliano', 'Whitmire, Jeannette Marie', 'Merrell, D Scott', 'Whitelegge, Julian', 'Scotti, Claudia']","['Maggi M', 'Mittelman SD', 'Parmentier JH', 'Colombo G', 'Meli M', 'Whitmire JM', 'Merrell DS', 'Whitelegge J', 'Scotti C']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, Unit of Immunology and General Pathology, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy.', ""Center for Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA."", ""Center for Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA."", 'Biomolecular Simulations & Computational Chemistry Group, Istituto di Chimica del Riconoscimento Molecolare, CNR, Milan, Italy.', 'Biomolecular Simulations & Computational Chemistry Group, Istituto di Chimica del Riconoscimento Molecolare, CNR, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Julian Whitelegge, The Pasarow Mass Spectrometry Laboratory, The NPI-Semel Institute & Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center, David Geffen School of Medicine, UCLA, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Unit of Immunology and General Pathology, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy. claudia.scotti@unipv.it.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20171103,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Asparaginase/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Storage', 'Enzyme Stability', 'Escherichia coli/*enzymology', 'Escherichia coli Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Molecular Dynamics Simulation', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Peptide Hydrolases/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Protein Conformation', 'Temperature']",,,2017/11/05 06:00,2019/07/25 06:00,['2017/11/05 06:00'],"['2017/02/07 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-017-15075-4 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-017-15075-4 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2017 Nov 3;7(1):14479. doi: 10.1038/s41598-017-15075-4.,PMC5670125,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Escherichia coli Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']","['P30 DK063491/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'S10 OD018227/OD/NIH HHS/United States']",,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-3304-6104', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5790-1833']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These patients, classified as prednisone poor responders (PPR), have poorer outcome than do the other pediatric T-ALL patients receiving a high-risk adapted therapy. Because glucocorticoids are administered to ALL patients during all the different phases of therapy, GC resistance represents an important challenge to improving the outcome for these patients. Mechanisms underlying resistance are not yet fully unraveled; thus our research focused on the identification of deregulated signaling pathways to point out new targeted approaches. We first identified, by reverse-phase protein arrays, the lymphocyte cell-specific protein-tyrosine kinase (LCK) as aberrantly activated in PPR patients. We showed that LCK inhibitors, such as dasatinib, bosutinib, nintedanib, and WH-4-023, are able to induce cell death in GC-resistant T-ALL cells, and remarkably, cotreatment with dexamethasone is able to reverse GC resistance, even at therapeutic drug concentrations. This was confirmed by specific LCK gene silencing and ex vivo combined treatment of cells from PPR patient-derived xenografts. Moreover, we observed that LCK hyperactivation in PPR patients upregulates the calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated T cells signaling triggering to interleukin-4 (IL-4) overexpression. GC-sensitive cells cultured with IL-4 display an increased resistance to dexamethasone, whereas the inhibition of IL-4 signaling could increase GC-induced apoptosis in resistant cells. Treatment with dexamethasone and dasatinib also impaired engraftment of leukemia cells in vivo. Our results suggest a quickly actionable approach to supporting conventional therapies and overcoming GC resistance in pediatric T-ALL patients.",['(c) 2017 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Serafin, Valentina', 'Capuzzo, Giorgia', 'Milani, Gloria', 'Minuzzo, Sonia Anna', 'Pinazza, Marica', 'Bortolozzi, Roberta', 'Bresolin, Silvia', 'Porcu, Elena', 'Frasson, Chiara', 'Indraccolo, Stefano', 'Basso, Giuseppe', 'Accordi, Benedetta']","['Serafin V', 'Capuzzo G', 'Milani G', 'Minuzzo SA', 'Pinazza M', 'Bortolozzi R', 'Bresolin S', 'Porcu E', 'Frasson C', 'Indraccolo S', 'Basso G', 'Accordi B']","[""Department of Woman's and Child's Health and."", ""Department of Woman's and Child's Health and."", ""Department of Woman's and Child's Health and."", 'Immunology and Oncology Section, Department of Surgery, Oncology, and Gastroenterology, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Immunology and Molecular Oncology Unit, Istituto Oncologico Veneto IRCCS, Padova, Italy; and.', ""Department of Woman's and Child's Health and."", ""Department of Woman's and Child's Health and."", ""Department of Woman's and Child's Health and."", ""Department of Woman's and Child's Health and."", 'Immunology and Oncology Section, Department of Surgery, Oncology, and Gastroenterology, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Immunology and Molecular Oncology Unit, Istituto Oncologico Veneto IRCCS, Padova, Italy; and.', 'Istituto di Ricerca Pediatrica Citta della Speranza, Padova, Italy.', 'Immunology and Molecular Oncology Unit, Istituto Oncologico Veneto IRCCS, Padova, Italy; and.', ""Department of Woman's and Child's Health and."", ""Department of Woman's and Child's Health and.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171103,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Dasatinib/pharmacology', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Lymphocytes/enzymology', 'Mice', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Prednisone/pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors']",,,2017/11/05 06:00,2018/01/27 06:00,['2017/11/05 06:00'],"['2017/05/11 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/27 06:00 [medline]', '2017/11/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)32620-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2017-05-784603 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2017 Dec 21;130(25):2750-2761. doi: 10.1182/blood-2017-05-784603.

Thus, we conducted a retrospective analysis of clofarabine-based (GCLAC; granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [filgrastim], clofarabine, high-dose cytarabine) versus cladribine-based (CLAG; cladribine, cytarabine, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [filgrastim]) regimens in rrAML. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified 41 consecutive patients with rrAML who had received either GCLAC or CLAG from 2011 to 2014. The primary outcome measure was the complete remission (CR) rate defined according to the International Working Group criteria. The secondary outcomes included the proportion of patients who underwent allogenic stem cell transplantation and the rate of relapse-free survival and overall survival. RESULTS: We found no significant differences in the baseline characteristics of the patients treated with GCLAC (n = 22) or CLAG (n = 19). The outcomes with these 2 regimens were not significantly different. Patients treated with GCLAC had a CR/CR with incomplete blood count recovery rate of 64% compared with 47% for the patients treated with CLAG (P = .36). Of the GCLAC patients, 45% underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation compared with 26% of the CLAG patients (P = .32). The median relapse-free survival after GCLAC and CLAG was 1.59 years and 1.03 years, respectively (P = .75). The median overall survival after GCLAG and CLAG was 1.03 years and 0.70 years, respectively (P = .08). The drug costs were significantly different for GCLAC versus CLAG. Using an average wholesale price, the cost per patient per cycle was $60,821.60 for GCLAC and $4910.60 for CLAG. CONCLUSION: A single-institutional retrospective analysis found no significant differences in the outcomes between GCLAC and CLAG for rrAML patients, although formal comparisons should be performed in a randomized clinical trial. The cost of GCLAC was greater than that of CLAG, which should be considered when evaluating the choice for the salvage chemotherapy options.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

TET1 is differentially expressed in many cancers, including leukemia. However, very little is known about mechanism behind TET1 deregulation. Previously, by characterizing global methylation patterns in CLL patients using MBD-seq, we found TET1 as one of the differentially methylated regions with gene-body hypermethylation. Herein, we characterize mechanisms that control TET1 gene activity at the transcriptional level. We show that treatment of CLL cell lines with 5-aza 2 -deoxycytidine (DAC) results in the activation of miR26A1, which causes decrease in both mRNA and protein levels of EZH2, which in turn results in the decreased occupancy of EZH2 over the TET1 promoter and consequently the loss of TET1 expression. In addition, DAC treatment also leads to the activation of antisense transcription overlapping the TET1 gene from a cryptic promoter, located in the hypermethylated intronic region. Increased expression of intronic transcripts correlates with decreased TET1 promoter activity through the loss of RNA Pol II occupancy. Thus, our data demonstrate that TET1 gene activation in CLL depends on miR26A1 regulated EZH2 binding at the TET1 promoter and silencing of novel cryptic promoter by gene-body hypermethylation.",,"['Kopparapu, Pradeep Kumar', 'Abdelrazak Morsy, Mohammad Hamdy', 'Kanduri, Chandrasekhar', 'Kanduri, Meena']","['Kopparapu PK', 'Abdelrazak Morsy MH', 'Kanduri C', 'Kanduri M']","['Department of Clinical Chemistry and Transfusion Medicine, Institute of Biomedicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, Gothenburg University, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry and Transfusion Medicine, Institute of Biomedicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, Gothenburg University, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Institute of Biomedicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, Gothenburg University, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry and Transfusion Medicine, Institute of Biomedicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, Gothenburg University, Gothenburg, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170906,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,,['NOTNLM'],"['EZH2 and TET1 gene', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'cryptic promoters', 'gene-body hypermethylation']",2017/11/05 06:00,2017/11/05 06:01,['2017/11/05 06:00'],"['2017/04/28 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/05 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.20668 [doi]', '20668 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Sep 6;8(44):77595-77608. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.20668. eCollection 2017 Sep 29.,PMC5652802,,,,,,,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors have no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In East Asians, primary imatinib resistance is caused by a deletion polymorphism in Intron 2 of the BIM gene, whose product is required for TKI-induced apoptosis. The deletion biases BIM splicing from exon 4 to exon 3, generating splice isoforms lacking the exon 4-encoded pro-apoptotic BH3 domain, which impairs the ability of TKIs to induce apoptosis. We sought to identify splice-switching antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) that block exon 3 but enhance exon 4 splicing, and thereby resensitize BIM deletion-containing cancers to imatinib. First, we mapped multiple cis-acting splicing elements around BIM exon 3 by minigene mutations, and found an exonic splicing enhancer acting via SRSF1. Second, by a systematic ASO walk, we isolated ASOs that corrected the aberrant BIM splicing. Eight of 67 ASOs increased exon 4 levels in BIM deletion-containing cells, and restored imatinib-induced apoptosis and TKI sensitivity. This proof-of-principle study proves that resistant CML cells by BIM deletion polymorphism can be resensitized to imatinib via splice-switching BIM ASOs.

Approximately 50% of MDS patients respond to current FDA-approved drug therapies but a majority of responders relapse within 2-3 years. There is therefore a compelling need to identify potential new therapies for MDS treatment. We utilized the MDS-L cell line to investigate the anticancer potential and mechanisms of action of a plant-derived compound, Withaferin A (WFA), in MDS. WFA was potently cytotoxic to MDS-L cells but had no significant effect on the viability of normal human primary bone marrow cells. WFA also significantly reduced engraftment of MDS-L cells in a xenotransplantation model. Through transcriptome analysis, we identified reactive oxygen species (ROS)-activated JNK/AP-1 signaling as a major pathway mediating apoptosis of MDS-L cells by WFA. We conclude that the molecular mechanism mediating selective cytotoxicity of WFA on MDS-L cells is strongly associated with induction of ROS.

However, our understanding of how tumor cell-specific DNA methylation patterns are established and maintained is limited. Here, we report that in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and Burkitt's lymphoma the MYC oncogene causes overexpression of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) 1 and 3B, which contributes to tumor maintenance. By utilizing a tetracycline-regulated MYC transgene in a mouse T-ALL (EmuSRalpha-tTA;tet-o-MYC) and human Burkitt's lymphoma (P493-6) model, we demonstrated that DNMT1 and DNMT3B expression depend on high MYC levels, and that their transcription decreased upon MYC-inactivation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation indicated that MYC binds to the DNMT1 and DNMT3B promoters, implicating a direct transcriptional regulation. Hence, shRNA-mediated knock-down of endogenous MYC in human T-ALL and Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines downregulated DNMT3B expression. Knock-down and pharmacologic inhibition of DNMT3B in T-ALL reduced cell proliferation associated with genome-wide changes in DNA methylation, indicating a tumor promoter function during tumor maintenance. We provide novel evidence that MYC directly deregulates the expression of both de novo and maintenance DNMTs, showing that MYC controls DNA methylation in a genome-wide fashion.

We have developed models of hematopoietic drug resistance that are based on expression of dominant-negative TP53 [TP53 (DN)] or constitutively-active MEK1 [MEK1(CA)] oncogenes in the presence of chemotherapeutic drugs. In human cancer, functional TP53 activity is often lost in human cancers. Also, activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway frequently occurs due to mutations/amplification of upstream components of this and other interacting pathways. FL5.12 is an interleukin-3 (IL-3) dependent hematopoietic cell line that is sensitive to doxorubicin (a.k.a Adriamycin). FL/Doxo is a derivative cell line that was isolated by culturing the parental FL5.12 cells in doxorubicin for prolonged periods of time. FL/Doxo + TP53 (DN) and FL/Doxo + MEK1 (CA) are FL/Doxo derivate cell lines that were infected with retrovirus encoding TP53 (DN) or MEK1 (CA) and are more resistant to doxorubicin than FL/Doxo cells. This panel of cell lines displayed differences in the sensitivity to inhibitors that suppress mTORC1, BCL2/BCLXL, MEK1 or MDM2 activities, as well as, the proteasomal inhibitor MG132. The expression of key genes involved in cell growth and drug-resistance (e.g., MDM2, MDR1, BAX) also varied in these cells.

Whereas adverse and favourable risk patients have well-established treatment protocols, IR-AML patients have not. It is, therefore, crucial to find novel factors that stratify this subgroup to implement risk-adapted strategies. The CAS (Crk-associated substrate) adaptor protein family regulates cell proliferation, survival, migration and adhesion. Despite its association with metastatic dissemination and prognosis of different solid tumors, the role of these proteins in hematological malignancies has been scarcely evaluated. Nevertheless, previous work has established an important role for the CAS family members NEDD9 or BCAR1 in the migratory and dissemination capacities of myeloid cells. On this basis, we hypothesized that NEDD9 or BCAR1 expression levels could associate with survival in IR-AML patients and become new prognostic markers. To that purpose, we assessed BCAR1 and NEDD9 gene expression in a cohort of 73 adult AML patients validating the results in an independent cohort (n = 206). We have identified NEDD9, but not BCAR1, as a new a marker for longer overall and disease-free survival, and for lower cumulative incidence of relapse.

To further elucidate a potential function of Aid in the bone marrow prior to V(D)J-recombination, we utilized an in vivo model which exerts a B-cell developmental arrest at the pro-B cell stage with low frequencies of pro-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pro-B ALL) development. Therefore, p19Arf(-/-)Rag1(-/-) (AR) mice were crossed with Aid-deficient mice (ARA). Surprisingly, loss of Aid expression in pro-B cells accelerated pro-B ALL incidence from 30% (AR) to 98% (ARA). This effect was Aid dose dependent, since Aid(+/-) animals of the same background displayed a significantly lower incidence (83%). Furthermore, B-cell-specific Aid up-regulation was observed in Aid-competent pro-B ALLs. Additional whole exome/sanger sequencing of murine pro-B ALLs revealed an accumulation of recurrent somatic Jak3 (p.R653H, p.V670A) and Dnm2 (p.G397R) mutations, which highlights the importance of active IL7R signaling in the pro-B ALL blast cells. These findings were further supported by an enhanced proliferative potential of ARA pro-B cells compared to Aid-competent cells from the same genetic background.

As a next step towards clinical use, we assessed the efficacy of quinacrine in an AML-PS mouse model and investigated possible synergistic effects when combining quinacrine with nine other antileukemic compounds in two AML cell lines. Furthermore, we explored the in vivo activity of quinacrine in combination with the widely used AML agent cytarabine. The in vivo use of quinacrine (100mg/kg three times per week for two consecutive weeks) significantly suppressed circulating blast cells at days 30/31 and increased the median survival time (MST). The in vitro drug combination analysis yielded promising synergistic interactions when combining quinacrine with cytarabine, azacitidine and geldanamycin. Finally, combining quinacrine with cytarabine in vivo showed a significant decrease in circulating leukemic blast cells and increased MST compared to the effect of either drug used alone, thus supporting the findings from the in vitro combination experiments. Taken together, the repositioning potential of quinacrine for treatment of AML is reinforced by demonstrating significant in vivo activity and promising synergies when quinacrine is combined with different agents, including cytarabine, the hypomethylating agent azacitidine and HSP-90 inhibitor geldanamycin.",['Copyright (c) 2017 The Authors.

Genetic association studies suggest that donors expressing aKIRs next to iKIRs will be superior donors in the setting of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation of patients with leukemia. However, contrary evidence states that aKIR expression may be irrelevant or even detrimental. Using a complex methodology incorporating KIR-Q-PCR, double fluorescence and viSNE analysis, we characterized subset distribution patterns and functionality in haplotype A donors which lack aKIRs and haplotype B donors that express a variety of B-specific genes. Here, we show that the alloreactive KIR2DS1+ NK cell subset in HLA-C1/C2 donors is highly responsive towards C2-expressing targets but quantitatively small and as such does not significantly contribute to cytotoxicity. Thus, we fail to find a direct link between haplotype allocation status and NK cell cytotoxicity at least in HLA-C1/C2 heterozygous donors.","['(c) The Japanese Society for Immunology. 2017.

Birth characteristics initiated in utero, such as gestational age, may play a role in leukemogenesis. The purpose of our meta-analysis is to explore the association between gestational age and childhood leukemia. METHODS: Relevant studies up to 21 April 2017 were collected by searching PubMed and EMBASE databases. Subgroup analysis, sensitivity analysis and publication bias assessment were conducted. RESULTS: A total of 13 studies were included. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for preterm birth and postterm birth were 1.06 (0.98, 1.13) and 1.01 (0.90, 1.13) for childhood leukemia, 1.04 (0.97, 1.11) and 1.03 (0.95, 1.12) for acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), 1.20 (1.00, 1.44) and 1.20 (1.00, 1.43) for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), compared with full-term birth. Study type and study region were the reasons behind the heterogeneity. In subgroup analyses, the summary ORs with 95% CI for childhood leukemia and ALL were 1.23 (1.07, 1.41) and 1.21 (1.06, 1.39) for postterm birth in cohort studies. No significant changes in sensitivity analyses and no publication bias were observed in our analysis. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that both preterm and postterm infants have an elevated risk of developing AML. In addition, postterm birth increased the risk of childhood leukemia and ALL in cohort studies.

Among different MRD techniques, flow cytometry provides additional information about antigen expression on tumor cells, which could potentially contribute to stratify MRD-positive patients. We investigated the prognostic value of those antigens required to monitor MRD in 1265 newly diagnosed patients enrolled in the GEM2000, GEM2005MENOS65, GEM2005MAS65 and GEM2010MAS65 protocols. Overall, CD19(pos), CD27(neg), CD38(lo), CD45(pos), CD81(pos), CD117(neg) and CD138(lo) expression predicted inferior outcomes. Through principal component analysis, we found that simultaneous CD38(low)CD81(pos)CD117(neg) expression emerged as the most powerful combination with independent prognostic value for progression-free survival (HR:1.69; P=0.002). This unique phenotypic profile retained prognostic value among MRD-positive patients. We then used next-generation flow to determine antigen stability throughout the course of the disease, and found that the expression of antigens required to monitor MRD is mostly stable from diagnosis to MRD stages, except for CD81 whose expression progressively increased from baseline to chemoresistant tumor cells (14 vs 28%). Altogether, we showed that the phenotypic profile of tumor cells provides additional prognostic information, and could be used to further predict risk of relapse among MRD-positive patients.",,"['Arana, P', 'Paiva, B', 'Cedena, M-T', 'Puig, N', 'Cordon, L', 'Vidriales, M-B', 'Gutierrez, N C', 'Chiodi, F', 'Burgos, L', 'Anglada, L-L', 'Martinez-Lopez, J', 'Hernandez, M-T', 'Teruel, A-I', 'Gironella, M', 'Echeveste, M-A', 'Rosinol, L', 'Martinez, R', 'Oriol, A', 'De la Rubia, J', 'Orfao, A', 'Blade, J', 'Lahuerta, J-J', 'Mateos, M-V', 'San Miguel, J-F']","['Arana P', 'Paiva B', 'Cedena MT', 'Puig N', 'Cordon L', 'Vidriales MB', 'Gutierrez NC', 'Chiodi F', 'Burgos L', 'Anglada LL', 'Martinez-Lopez J', 'Hernandez MT', 'Teruel AI', 'Gironella M', 'Echeveste MA', 'Rosinol L', 'Martinez R', 'Oriol A', 'De la Rubia J', 'Orfao A', 'Blade J', 'Lahuerta JJ', 'Mateos MV', 'San Miguel JF']","['Clinica Universidad de Navarra, Centro de Investigacion Medica Aplicadas (CIMA); Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria de Navarra (IDISNA), CIBERONC, Pamplona, Spain.', 'Clinica Universidad de Navarra, Centro de Investigacion Medica Aplicadas (CIMA); Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria de Navarra (IDISNA), CIBERONC, Pamplona, Spain.', 'Hospital 12 de Octubre, CIBERONC, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, Instituto de Investigacion Biomedica de Salamanca (IBSAL), Centro de Investigacion del Cancer (IBMCC-USAL, CSIC), CIBERONC, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Hospital Universitario y Politecnico La Fe, CIBERONC, Valencia, Spain.', 'Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, Instituto de Investigacion Biomedica de Salamanca (IBSAL), Centro de Investigacion del Cancer (IBMCC-USAL, CSIC), CIBERONC, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, Instituto de Investigacion Biomedica de Salamanca (IBSAL), Centro de Investigacion del Cancer (IBMCC-USAL, CSIC), CIBERONC, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Clinica Universidad de Navarra, Centro de Investigacion Medica Aplicadas (CIMA); Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria de Navarra (IDISNA), CIBERONC, Pamplona, Spain.', 'Clinica Universidad de Navarra, Centro de Investigacion Medica Aplicadas (CIMA); Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria de Navarra (IDISNA), CIBERONC, Pamplona, Spain.', 'Hospital 12 de Octubre, CIBERONC, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hospital 12 de Octubre, CIBERONC, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hospital Universitario de Canarias, Tenerife, Spain.', 'Hospital Clinico de Valencia, Valencia, Spain.', ""Hospital Vall d'Hebron, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Hospital de Donostia, San Sebastian, Spain.', 'Hospital Clinic, IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hospital Clinico San Carlos, Madrid, Spain.', ""Institut Catala d'Oncologia i Institut Josep Carreras, Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Badalona, Spain."", 'Hospital Universitario y Politecnico La Fe, CIBERONC, Valencia, Spain.', 'Servicio General de Citometria-NUCLEOS, Centro de Investigacion del Cancer (IBMCC-USAL, CSIC), IBSAL and Department of Medicine, Universidad de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Hospital Clinic, IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hospital 12 de Octubre, CIBERONC, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, Instituto de Investigacion Biomedica de Salamanca (IBSAL), Centro de Investigacion del Cancer (IBMCC-USAL, CSIC), CIBERONC, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Clinica Universidad de Navarra, Centro de Investigacion Medica Aplicadas (CIMA); Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria de Navarra (IDISNA), CIBERONC, Pamplona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171103,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm, Residual/metabolism/pathology', 'Prognosis']",,,2017/11/04 06:00,2019/03/21 06:00,['2017/11/04 06:00'],"['2017/07/26 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/07 00:00 [revised]', '2017/10/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/21 06:00 [medline]', '2017/11/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2017320 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2017.320 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2018 Apr;32(4):971-978. doi: 10.1038/leu.2017.320.

To elucidate on-target and pharmacodynamic effects of acalabrutinib, we evaluated several laboratory endpoints, including proteomic changes, chemokine modulation and impact on cell migration. Pharmacological profiling of samples from acalabrutinib-treated CLL patients was used to identify strategies for achieving deeper responses, and to identify additive/synergistic combination regimens. Peripheral blood samples from 21 patients with relapsed/refractory CLL in acalabrutinib phase I (100-400 mg/day) and II (100 mg BID) clinical trials were collected prior to and on days 8 and 28 after treatment initiation and evaluated for plasma chemokines, reverse phase protein array, immunoblotting and pseudoemperipolesis. The on-target pharmacodynamic profile of acalabrutinib in CLL lymphocytes was comparable to ibrutinib in measures of acalabrutinib-mediated changes in CCL3/CCL4 chemokine production, migration assays and changes in B-cell receptor signaling pathway proteins and other downstream survival proteins. Among several CLL-targeted agents, venetoclax, when combined with acalabrutinib, showed optimal complementary activity in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo in TCL-1 adoptive transfer mouse model system of CLL.

Deepening understanding of how opposing factions of the BCL-2 protein family switch on apoptosis and of their structures has driven development of a new class of cancer drugs that targets various pro-survival members by mimicking their natural inhibitors, the BH3-only proteins. These 'BH3 mimetic' drugs seem destined to become powerful new weapons in the arsenal against cancer. Successful clinical trials of venetoclax/ABT-199, a specific inhibitor of BCL-2, have led to its approval for a refractory form of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and to scores of on-going trials for other malignancies. Furthermore, encouraging preclinical studies of BH3 mimetics that target other BCL-2 pro-survival members, particularly MCL-1, offer promise for cancers resistant to venetoclax.

Genome editing in human lymphoid cells is challenging as these difficult-to-transfect cells may also inefficiently repair DNA by HDR. Here, we estimated efficiencies and dynamics of knockout (KO) and knockin (KI) generation in human T and B cell lines depending on repair template, target loci and types of genomic endonucleases. Using zinc finger nuclease (ZFN), we have engineered Jurkat and CEM cells with the 8.2 kb human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Env genome integrated at the adeno-associated virus integration site 1 (AAVS1) locus that stably produce virus particles and mediate infection upon transfection with helper vectors. Knockouts generated by ZFN or clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR/Cas9) double nicking techniques were comparably efficient in lymphoid cells. However, unlike polyclonal sorted cells, gene-edited cells selected by cloning exerted tremendous deviations in functionality as estimated by replication of HIV-1 and human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) in these cells. Notably, the recently reported high-fidelity eCas9 1.1 when combined to the nickase mutation displayed gene-dependent decrease in on-target activity. Thus, the balance between off-target effects and on-target efficiency of nucleases, as well as choice of the optimal method of edited cell selection should be taken into account for proper gene function validation in lymphoid cells.",,"['Zotova, Anastasia', 'Lopatukhina, Elena', 'Filatov, Alexander', 'Khaitov, Musa', 'Mazurov, Dmitriy']","['Zotova A', 'Lopatukhina E', 'Filatov A', 'Khaitov M', 'Mazurov D']","['Faculty of Biology, Lomonosov Moscow State University, 1-12 Leninskie Gory, 119991 Moscow, Russia. ashunaeva@gmail.com.', 'Faculty of Biology, Lomonosov Moscow State University, 1-12 Leninskie Gory, 119991 Moscow, Russia. helena.lopatukhina@mail.ru.', 'NRC Institute of Immunology FMBA of Russia, 24 Kashirskoe shosse, 115472 Moscow, Russia. avfilat@yandex.ru.', 'NRC Institute of Immunology FMBA of Russia, 24 Kashirskoe shosse, 115472 Moscow, Russia. mr.khaitov@nrcii.ru.', 'NRC Institute of Immunology FMBA of Russia, 24 Kashirskoe shosse, 115472 Moscow, Russia. dvmazurov@yandex.ru.', 'Cell and Gene Technology Group, Institute of Gene Biology RAS, 34/5 Vavilova Street, 119334 Moscow, Russia. dvmazurov@yandex.ru.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20171102,Switzerland,Viruses,Viruses,101509722,IM,"['CRISPR-Cas Systems', 'DNA End-Joining Repair', '*Gene Editing', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'Genome, Viral', 'Genomics/methods', 'HIV-1/*genetics/physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/physiology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Lymphocytes/enzymology/*physiology/*virology', 'Transfection', 'Zinc Finger Nucleases/genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*CRISPR-Cas9', '*HIV-1', '*T lymphocytes', '*ZFN', '*cell functionality', '*cell sorting', '*gene editing', '*knockin', '*knockout']",2017/11/04 06:00,2018/06/21 06:00,['2017/11/04 06:00'],"['2017/10/10 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/30 00:00 [revised]', '2017/10/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/11/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/21 06:00 [medline]']","['v9110325 [pii]', '10.3390/v9110325 [doi]']",epublish,Viruses. 2017 Nov 2;9(11). pii: v9110325. doi: 10.3390/v9110325.,PMC5707532,['EC 3.1.- (Zinc Finger Nucleases)'],,,,,,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Early and late anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity is a well-known phenomenon, and the incidence of heart failure in patients receiving doxorubicin is 2.2%, with a mortality rate over 60% at 2 years. Prognosis can be improved by prevention, early detection and treatment. A specific treatment for anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity is not yet available, but non-pharmacological measures such as exercise, lifestyle changes and control of risk factors have shown a cardioprotective effect. Exercise training represents a viable non-pharmacological treatment as it increases cardiovascular reserve and endothelial function, regulates proapoptotic signaling, protects against reactive oxygen species (ROS), and decreases autophagy/lysosomal signaling. However, no current guidelines are available for prevention management in cancer patients. Pharmacological measures both for prevention and treatment are those used for heart failure (beta-blockers, angiotensin-receptor blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, statins, dexrazoxane and aldosteron antagonists).

Due to the remarkable clinical success of using proteasome inhibitors for clinical treatment of multiple myeloma, it is anticipated that targeting the UPS upstream of the proteasome step be an effective strategy for cancer therapy. Deubiquitinases (DUB) are proteases that remove ubiquitin from target proteins and therefore regulate multiple cellular processes including some signaling pathways altered in cancer cells. Thus, targeting DUB is a promising strategy for cancer drug discovery. Previously, we have reported that metal complexes, such as copper and gold complexes, can disrupt the UPS via suppressing the activity of 19S proteasome-associated DUBs and/or of the 20S proteasomes, thereby inducing cancer cell death. In this study, we found that cadmium pyrithione (CdPT) treatment led to remarkable accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in cultured cancer cells and primary leukemia cells. CdPT potently inhibited the activity of proteasomal DUBs (USP14 and UCHL5), but slightly inhibited 20S proteasome activity.

The role and molecular functions of osteoblasts in normal hematopoiesis and in myeloid hematological malignancies is discussed. Recent findings: Cells of the osteoblast lineage have emerged as potent regulators of HSC expansion that regulate their recruitment and, depending on their stage of differentiation, their activity, proliferation and differentiation along the lymphoid, myeloid and erythroid lineages. In addition, mutations in mature osteoblasts or their progenitors induce myeloid malignancies. Conversely, signals from myelodysplastic cells can remodel the osteoblastic niche to favor self-perpetuation.

Despite enormous improvement of prognosis during the last half century, ALL remains a major cause of childhood cancer-related mortality. During the past decade, whole genomic methods have enhanced our knowledge of disease biology. Stratification of therapy according to early treatment response measured by minimal residual disease allows risk group assignment into different treatment arms, ranging from reduction to intensification of treatment. Progress has been achieved in academic clinical trials by optimization of combined chemotherapy, which continues to be the mainstay of contemporary treatment. The availability of suitable volunteer main histocompatibility antigen-matched unrelated donors has increased the rates of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) over the past two decades. Allogeneic HSCT has become an alternative treatment for selected, very-high-risk patients. However, intensive treatment burdens children with severe acute toxic effects that can cause permanent organ damage and even toxic death. Immunotherapeutic approaches have recently come to the forefront in ALL therapy. Monoclonal antibodies blinatumomab and inotuzumab ozogamicin as well as gene-modified T cells directed to specific target antigens have shown efficacy against resistant/relapsed leukemia in phase I/II studies. Integration of these newer modalities into combined regimens with chemotherapy may rescue a subset of children not curable by contemporary therapy. Another major challenge will be to incorporate less toxic regimens into the therapy of patients with low-risk disease who have a nearly 100% chance of being cured, and the ultimate goal is to improve their quality of life while maintaining a high cure rate.",,"['Stary, Jan', 'Hrusak, Ondrej']","['Stary J', 'Hrusak O']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, 2nd Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, 2nd Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20161104,England,F1000Res,F1000Research,101594320,,,['NOTNLM'],"['ALL', 'HSCT', 'immunotherapy', 'leukaemia', 'monoclonal antibodies', 'paediatric']",2017/11/04 06:00,2017/11/04 06:01,['2017/11/04 06:00'],"['2016/11/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/11/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/04 06:01 [medline]']",['10.12688/f1000research.9548.1 [doi]'],epublish,F1000Res. 2016 Nov 4;5:2635. doi: 10.12688/f1000research.9548.1. eCollection 2016.,PMC5642309,,,,,,,"['Competing interests: The authors declare that they have no competing interests.No', 'competing interests were disclosed.No competing interests were disclosed.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Alloreactive KIR-ligand mismatched NK cells crucially mediate the innate immune response and have a well-recognized antitumor activity. Adoptive immunotherapy with alloreactive NK cells determined promising clinical results in terms of response in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients and several data demonstrated that response can be influenced by the composition of NK graft. Several data show that there is a correlation between NK alloreactivity and clinical outcome: in a cohort of AML patients who received NK infusion with active disease, more alloreactive NK cell clones were found in the donor repertoire of responders than in non-responders. These findings demonstrate that the frequency of alloreactive NK cell clones influence clinical response in AML patients undergoing NK cell immunotherapy. In this work, we will review the most recent preclinical and clinical data about the impact of alloreactive NK cells features other than frequency of alloreactive clones and cytokine network status on their anti-leukemic activity.

CML is consistently associated with the expression of the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene, generated by the t(9;22) chromosomal translocation, thus creating the Philadelphia chromosome, a target for protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy. There is no published data, demonstrating increased risk for development of second cancers, associated with the exposure to TKIs. CASE REPORT: We report a case of a primary extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma (EMZBCL), diagnosed in a 53-year-old woman with CML receiving treatment with TKI the preceding seven years. Both diagnoses were confirmed by cytological/histological examination. Regarding CML, complete hematological, cytogenetic, and molecular remission was achieved by imatinib therapy. Regarding EMZBCL complete remission with an anthracycline-based polychemotherapy was achieved, while the patient was on continuous treatment with imatinib. Currently, the patient is in major molecular response for CML (151 months) and also in complete remission for EMZBCL (60 months).

The aim of this study was to evaluate bone involvement at diagnosis in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia as a predictive factor and to correlate its presence with other demographic, clinical, and laboratory findings. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 97 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia diagnosed from January 2005 to December 2014. The mean age of patients was 5.7 years, and 83 (85.6 %) of them were diagnosed with B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia. RESULTS: Among the 97 children, 46 (47.4 %) reported bone involvement at the time of diagnosis. Among children with B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia 43/83 (51.8 %) reported bone involvement, while among children with T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia only 3/14 (21.4 %) (p =0.04). Bone involvement was registered more frequently among males (30/59; 50.8 %) in comparison to females (16/38; 42.2 %) (p =0.414). The mean white blood cell count at diagnosis was lower among children with bone involvement (109,800/mm(3) vs. 184,700/mm(3)) (p =0.092). The mean age of patients with bone involvement was four years, which differs significantly from those without bone involvement (p =0.029). Moreover, children with bone involvement at diagnosis were prednisone ""good responders"" (79.5 %) when compared with those without bone involvement (58.8 %) (p =0.046). Additionally, mean serum phosphate values were higher at diagnosis among children with bone involvement (5.3 mg/dl vs. 4.8 mg/dl, p =0.035). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of bone involvement at diagnosis is related with immunophenotype of B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia, lower mean age, lower mean white blood cell count and good prednisone response. According to presented data, we conclude that the presence of bone involvement at diagnosis represents a positive predictive factor for outcome/survival.

Lenalidomide at a continuous high-dose schedule was poorly-tolerated resulting in a high rate of early therapy discontinuations. Hazard of death in the first four months was greatest in subjects receiving continuous high-dose lenalidomide; hazards of death thereafter were similar.

To identify a gene expression-based classification of myelodysplasia with biological and clinical relevance, we performed a comprehensive transcriptomic analysis of myeloid neoplasms with dysplasia using transcriptome sequencing. Unsupervised clustering of gene expression data of bone marrow CD34(+) cells from 100 patients identified 2 subgroups. The first subtype was characterized by increased expression of genes related to erythroid/megakaryocytic (EMK) lineages, whereas the second subtype showed upregulation of genes related to immature progenitor (IMP) cells. Compared with the first so-called EMK subtype, the IMP subtype showed upregulation of many signaling pathways and downregulation of several pathways related to metabolism and DNA repair. The IMP subgroup was associated with a significantly shorter survival in both univariate (hazard ratio [HR], 5.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8-14; P = .002) and multivariate analysis (HR, 4.9; 95% CI, 1.3-19; P = .02). Leukemic transformation was limited to the IMP subgroup. The prognostic significance of our classification was validated in an independent cohort of 183 patients. We also constructed a model to predict the subgroups using gene expression profiles of unfractionated bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs). The model successfully predicted clinical outcomes in a test set of 114 patients with BMMNC samples. The addition of our classification to the clinical model improved prediction of patient outcomes.

But the relationship between polymorphisms of NLRP3 inflammasome related genes and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is rarely reported. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the association of five genetic polymorphisms (NLRP3, IL-1beta, IL-18, CARD8 and NF-kappaB) in 267 CML patients and 344 healthy controls. We found that the AT genotype of CARD8 (rs2043211) was significantly higher compared to TT genotype in high and intermediate risk CML patients. IL-1beta (rs16944) polymorphism in early molecular response at 6months was marginally different, with more GG and less AA genotype in BCR-ABL(IS) >1% group. IL-18 (rs1946518) polymorphism was significantly different with more GG genotype in BCR-ABL(IS) >1% group at 6months. We also demonstrated that WBC count of newly diagnosed patients carrying AG genotype was significantly higher than that of GG or AA genotype of IL-1beta (rs16944). The onset age of patients carrying ins/ins genotype of NF-kappaB (rs28362491) was significantly older than that of ins/del and del/del genotype. Moreover, IL-1beta or NLRP3 mRNA expression was decreased and IL-18 mRNA expression was increased significantly in CML patients compared with controls. In conclusion, the genetic polymorphisms of NLRP3 inflammasome may be served as potential predictors for CML.","['Copyright (c) 2017 American Society for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Therefore, the CLL working party revised the Dutch guidelines. Not only efficacy but also quality of life and socio-economic impact were taken into account in the formulation of treatment recommendations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The working party discussed a set of questions regarding diagnostic tests and treatment and wrote the draft guideline. This was evidence-based whenever possible, but in cases of low evidence, an expert-based recommendation was formulated with input of the entire working party. The draft guideline was sent to all hematologists in the Netherlands for comment and was subsequently approved. RESULTS: Recommendations were formulated on diagnostic tests and work-up before treatment. Also, recommendations were made for treatment with fludarabine-cyclophosphamide-rituximab, bendamustine-rituximab, chlorambucil with anti-CD20 antibody, ibrutinib, idelalisib-rituximab, venetoclax, and allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

This study assesses clinical and epidemiologic factors in a population of inpatients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and stroke. METHODS: Using the 2012 National Inpatient Sample, demographic and clinical data including age, gender, race, length of stay, in-hospital procedures, discharge diagnosis, disposition, and mortality incidence were extracted. RESULTS: Of 7,296,968 admissions, 10,984 patients with active AML were analyzed. Of these, 65 patients had a concomitant cerebrovascular accident (CVA) (hemorrhagic or ischemic). There was a 50-fold increase in the risk of stroke in patients with active AML compared with all admissions. Patients with AML and CVAs were found to have significantly higher inpatient mortality than for all admitted patients with stroke (36.9% vs. 6.7%; odds ratio, 5.5; 95% confidence interval, 2.3-8.8; P < .0001). Multivariate logistic regression, after controlling for confounding variables, identified acute renal failure with tubular necrosis, hypernatremia, urinary tract infection, and secondary thrombocytopenia as significant predictors of stroke. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with AML have an elevated risk of CVA compared with all inpatients, and mortality in this population is high.

In this study, dasatinib synergized with ATRA to trigger differentiation in ATRA-resistant APL cell lines. The combined treatment activated RAF-1, MEK and ERK as well as enhanced ATRA-promoted up-regulation of the protein level of PU.1, C/EBPbeta and C/EBPepsilon. U0126 (MEK specific inhibitor) and sorafenib tosylate (RAF-1 specific inhibitor) suppressed the combined treatment-induced differentiation, ERK phosphorylation and the up-regulation of C/EBPs and PU.1. Sorafenib tosylate also attenuated the MEK activity. However, the combined treatment did not enhance Ras activity and Ras inhibitor neither blocked MEK activation nor inhibited differentiation. Therefore, the combined treatment induced differentiation via Ras independent RAF-1/MEK/ERK. Earlier than RAF-1 activation, dasatinib suppressed Lyn activity, the predominant activated Src family kinase (SFK) and dephosphorylated RAF-1 at S259. Furthermore, SFK inhibitor, PP2 did suppress Lyn activity and mimicked the effect of dasatinib on ATRA-induced differentiation as well as decreased phosphorylation of RAF-1 at S259. Thus, it was suggested that Lyn inhibition might activate RAF-1 by the dephosphorylation of RAF at S259 and lead to differentiation. In conclusion, the combination of dasatinib and ATRA could overcome ATRA resistance through Lyn inhibition-mediated activation of RAF-1/MEK/ERK.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed patients with hemato-oncological disease and secondary intracranial hypertension in our center during the past five years. We compared these individuals with a historical cohort with idiopathic intracranial hypertension from our institution (control group). RESULTS: We identified eight patients, all with leukemia, and 21 controls. Mean age at diagnosis was 10.6 years, and 62% of individuals were female. Most of them were under treatment with drugs (62% corticosteroids, 75% active chemotherapy). Mean opening pressure of cerebrospinal fluid was 35 cm H2O. All had headache, but only 28% complained of visual symptoms. Only 12.5% exhibited papilledema at the time of diagnosis (versus 71% in controls). All of them were treated with acetazolamide, with average therapy duration of nine months, and all had a favorable outcome (versus 57% of controls who needed second-line treatment). None of them showed long-term visual complications (versus 20% of controls). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with hemato-oncological disease and secondary intracranial hypertension may not develop typical symptomatology. Thus, diagnosis and recognition of this entity among this cohort may be difficult. Associated factors are diverse and do not show an obvious causal relationship. A high index of suspicion must be maintained for diagnosis, because a favorable outcome is expected with prompt treatment.

A leukemic presentation of RMS has been reported in a few case series, although almost all cases of leukemic RMS are not completely mimicking leukemia. We encountered a case with RMS cell infiltration of the bone marrow that resembled floating hematological cells. CASE PRESENTATION: We encountered a rare case of a 15-year-old boy with a 2-week history of left femoral pain. Upon admission, he was afebrile with no other symptoms. No apparent cause of femoral pain was detected on an initial examination. Laboratory findings revealed normal white blood cell (WBC) count and hemoglobin concentration, with a platelet count of 10.3 x 10(4)/muL. WBCs included 2.0% metamyelocytes, 4.5% myelocytes, and 0.5% blasts. Lactate dehydrogenase concentration was 1299 U/L, creatine kinase was 437 U/L, and C-reactive protein was 1.25 mg/dL. Bone marrow aspiration demonstrated hypercellular marrow (nucleated cell count 1.84 x 10(4)/muL) and 89.0% of blast-like cells of all nucleated cells. The proliferating cells were negative for myeloperoxidase and esterase, and strongly positive for CD56. Positron emission tomography exhibited extensive accumulation of (18)F-fludeoxyglucose with a SUVmax of 7.09. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed T1-low intensity, gadolinium-enhanced, diffuse, and irregular lesions on his pelvis and bilateral femurs. These laboratory and imaging findings suggested hematological malignancy with diffuse bone involvement, suggestive of acute leukemia. However, the pathological diagnosis of bone marrow and basal penile muscle biopsy was alveolar RMS. Karyotype analysis of bone marrow cells revealed the characteristic translocation of t(2;13)(q35;q14). The final diagnosis was alveolar RMS with massive involvement of the bone marrow and the primary site in the perineal muscles. The tumor cells both of the primary site and bone marrow were positive for myogenin. CONCLUSIONS: A literature review found a misdiagnosed case of completely mimicking leukemic RMS as natural-killer (NK)-cell leukemia. Such a misdiagnosis can have critical consequences. We experienced a rare case of alveolar RMS with symmetrical diffuse bone marrow involvement completely masquerading as acute leukemia. The results of a surface marker study showing that the tumor cells had a near NK-cell phenotype were misleading.",,"['Imataki, Osamu', 'Uemura, Makiko', 'Uchida, Shumpei', 'Yokokura, Shigeyuki', 'Takeuchi, Akihiro', 'Ishikawa, Ryo', 'Kondo, Akihiro', 'Seo, Kayoko', 'Kadowaki, Norimitsu']","['Imataki O', 'Uemura M', 'Uchida S', 'Yokokura S', 'Takeuchi A', 'Ishikawa R', 'Kondo A', 'Seo K', 'Kadowaki N']","['Division of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Kagawa University, Kagawa, Japan. oima@med.kagawa-u.ac.jp.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kagawa University, 1750-1 Ikenobe, Miki-cho, Kita-gun, Kagawa, 761-0793, Japan. oima@med.kagawa-u.ac.jp.', 'Division of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Kagawa University, Kagawa, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Kagawa University, Kagawa, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Kagawa University, Kagawa, Japan.', 'Division of Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kagawa University, Kagawa, Japan.', 'Department of diagnostic pathology, Kagawa University, Kagawa, Japan.', 'Division of Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kagawa University, Kagawa, Japan.', 'Division of Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kagawa University, Kagawa, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Kagawa University, Kagawa, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20171102,England,Diagn Pathol,Diagnostic pathology,101251558,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', '*Diagnosis, Differential', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Male', 'Muscle, Skeletal/pathology', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma, Alveolar/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic/*immunology']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute leukemia', 'Flow cytometry', 'Mimicking', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma']",2017/11/04 06:00,2018/08/09 06:00,['2017/11/04 06:00'],"['2017/07/05 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/11/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13000-017-0667-7 [doi]', '10.1186/s13000-017-0667-7 [pii]']",epublish,Diagn Pathol. 2017 Nov 2;12(1):77. doi: 10.1186/s13000-017-0667-7.,PMC5669030,,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5332-1316'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHOD: Heparinized bone marrow samples were obtained from enrolled five patients (identified as A to E and visits identified by number) at initial diagnosis (A1-E1) and in the DAS-resistance advanced phase (A2-E2). Meanwhile, highly DAS-resistant cells, named K562-R cells, were obtained from K562-W cells with increasing concentrations of DAS. Stable under-expressing EphB4 cells (K562-R-EphB4-sh) were obtained from K562-R cells by RNA interference. K562-W, K562-R and K562-R-EphB4-sh cells (10(8)) were respectively injected subcutaneously on the dorsal surface of BALB/C female nude mice to establish the xenografts models. RESULT: The mRNA/protein of EphB4 was overexpressed in the DAS-resistant A2-E2 in comparison with the A1-E1 human cell lines. Further, compared with K562-R cells, the expressions of EphB4 and p-Rac1/Cdc42 protein/mRNA were significantly downregulated in K562-R-EphB4-sh cells (P<0.01). K562-R cells showed the highest DAS resistance (IC50 10.54+/-0.67mug/ml), but K562-R-EphB4-sh cells became sensitive to DAS (IC50 1.02+/-0.1mug/ml, P<0.01). The expression of EphB4/p-RhoA/MCL-1 protein was gradually increased in the stimulating of EphrinB2-Fc, which partly made K562-R-EphB4-sh cells restore sensitivity to DAS (4.18+/-0.30mug/ml). Meanwhile, the K562-R-EphB4-sh xenografts group had relatively good efficacy compared to K562-R xenografts nude mice receiving the same dose of DAS. The analysis of xenografts tissue also suggested parallel results with the overexpression of EphB4/RhoA/ROCK1/PTEN/MCL-1 in K562-R xenografts, which decreased in the A2-R-EphB4-sh xenografts (P<0.01).

MRD was assessed by the quantitative expression of the pan-leukemic marker Wilms' tumor (WT1) gene, according to the validated LeukemiaNet method. Between 2005 and 2016, 122 consecutive AML patients, WT1 positive at diagnosis, received allo-SCT in cytologic complete remission (cCR). The median age at SCT was 53 years (range 18-70). Quantitative analysis of WT1 gene expression (bone marrow samples) was available in all cases both at diagnosis (100% of samples overexpressed WT1 with a mean of 8607+/-8187 copies/10(4) Abelson) and immediately before allo-SCT. Eighty one cases (66%) were MRD-WT1 negative (WT1 <250 copies) and 41/122 (44%) cases were MRD-WT1 positive (WT1 >250 copies) prior to allo-SCT. We evaluated post-SCT overall survival (OS), disease free survival (DFS) and relapse rate (RR), according to MRD-WT1 status pre-SCT. Both post-allo-SCT OS and DFS were significantly improved in patients who were MRD-WT1 negative at the time of SCT compared with those who were MRD-WT1 positive, with a median OS and DFS not reached in the MRD-WT1 negative group and 9 and 8 months, respectively, in the WT1 positive group (OS log-rank p<0.0001; hazard ratio [HR] 3.9, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 2.0-7.38; DFS log-rank p<0.0001; HR 3.73, 95% CI 2.0-6.72). The RR after SCT was 15% (12/81) in pre-SCT MRD-WT1 negative cases and 44% (18/41) in MRD-WT1 positive cases (p=0.00073). Univariate analysis showed that MRD-WT1 negativity pre-SCT and grade <2 acute GVHD were significant prognostic factors for improved OS and DFS. However multivariate analysis showed MRD-WT1 negativity pre-SCT was the only independent prognostic factor for improved OS and DFS. These data show that pre allo-SCT molecular MRD evaluation using WT1 expression is a powerful predictor of post allo-SCT outcomes in AML undergoing SCT in cCR. Patients with both cCR and MRD-WT1 negativity before SCT have a very good outcome with lower RR and improved OS. The pre allo-SCT MRD-WT1 stratification in AML is a valuable tool to identify patients at high risk of post-SCT relapse, and can influence conditioning regimen intensification and/or post-SCT preemptive strategies.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

METHODS: Retrospective study using MarketScan claims from January 2006 to December 2014. The first analysis evaluated occurrence of T2DM, defined as >/=2 claims with a T2DM ICD-9 code or 1 diagnosis claim and an antidiabetic medication. The second analysis evaluated occurrence of HLD, defined as >/=2 claims with an HLD ICD-9 code, or 1 diagnosis claim and an anti-HLD medication. Incidence rates were computed as number of events divided by sum of person years (PY) at risk for all subjects. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for T2DM or HLD. RESULTS: There were 2004 and 1280 patients who met the criteria for the T2DM analysis (n = 1272 dasatinib, n = 732 nilotinib) and HLD analysis (n = 845 dasatinib, n = 435 nilotinib). The incidence rate of T2DM was 40.4 per 1000 PY (95% CI: 27.60, 56.98) for nilotinib and 17.6 per 1000 PY (95% CI: 11.14, 26.38) for dasatinib. HR for occurrence of T2DM was 2.77 (95% CI: 1.58, 4.86), indicating that patients on nilotinib had a significantly higher adjusted risk for incident T2DM. The incidence rate of HLD was 74.6 per 1000 PY (95% CI: 50.70, 105.94) for nilotinib and 46.4 per 1000 PY (95% CI: 33.00, 63.45) for dasatinib. HR for occurrence of HLD was 1.75 (95% CI: 1.07, 2.87) indicating that patients on nilotinib had a significantly higher adjusted risk for incident HLD.

ATO often causes severe health hazards such as hepatotoxicity, dermatosis, neurotoxicity, nephrotoxicity and cardiotoxicity. The production of reactive oxygen species, (ROS) play a significant role in ATO-induced hepatotoxicity. The oral hypoglycemic drug, metformin, is considered to be a potential novel agent for chemoprevention in the treatment of cancer. Moreover, metformin has also been shown to have hepatoprotective effects. In the present study, we demonstrated that metformin protected normal hepatocytes from ATO-induced apoptotic cell death in vitro and in vivo. Gene expression screening revealed that glucose metabolism might be related to the metformin-induced protective effect on ATO-treated AML12 cells. The metformin-promoted or induced glycolysis was not responsible for the protection of AML12 cells from ATO-induced apoptotic cell death. Instead, metformin increased the intracellular NADH/NAD+ ratio by inhibiting mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I, further decreasing the intracellular ROS induced by ATO. Treatment with low glucose or rotenone, a mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I inhibitor, also protected AML12 cells from ATO-induced apoptotic cell death. We show for the first time that metformin protects the hepatocyte from ATO by regulating the mitochondrial function. With its properties of chemoprevention, chemosensitization and the amelioration of liver damage, metformin has great prospects for clinical application other than type 2 diabetes mellitus

Moreover, the 3-year disease-free survival (3-DFS) of patients was determined. Patients' BMIS were compared with that of subjects with normal bone marrow. The study examined 93 children, including 78 Pre-B and 15 T-cell ALL patients. BMIS did not differ between the children with ALL and those with no evidence of cancer. BMIS was increased in 26.6% of patients at the end of the first year of treatment. Drug resistance and BM relapses were more prevalent in cases with high BMIS in both Pre-B and T-cell groups. Bone marrow iron store is not considered a risk factor for childhood ALL. However, high levels of BMIS are associated with poor response to treatment and the risk of relapse.

And it can alter the intracellular environment, similar to other herpesviruses, for viral replication and survival. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of HCMV infection on autophagy in human acute monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1 cells). METHODS: Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), western blot, and transmission electron microscope (TEM) were used to examine autophagy level. The concentrations of autophagy-related proteins Beclin 1, Atg5, and the light chain three (LC3) were counted when compared with actin level. RESULTS: The expression levels of Beclin1, Atg5, and LC3II mRNAs increased gradually between 1 and 5 days(d) postinfection (p.i.) and subsequently decreased little by little when compared with the control THP-1 cells. However, results of western blot analysis displayed that the level of LC3II increased gradually after 1 day p.i. and decreased at 7 days after infection. But the levels of Atg5 and Beclin1 increased gradually after 2 days p.i. and began to decrease at 5 days after infection, respectively. CONCLUSION: These results suggested that HCMV infection can facilitate the autophagy and autophagy level may decrease in latent phase. More studies on the relationship between HCMV latency and autophagy are needed to determine the role of autophagy in HCMV latent infection that may help find out a therapeutic approach for clinical treatment.",,"['Liu, Yujie', 'Pan, Jianwei', 'Liu, Lifang', 'Li, Wei', 'Tao, Ran', 'Chen, Yinghu', 'Li, Huamei', 'Shang, Shiqiang']","['Liu Y', 'Pan J', 'Liu L', 'Li W', 'Tao R', 'Chen Y', 'Li H', 'Shang S']","[""Department of Central Laboratory, Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,IM,"['*Autophagy', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Cytomegalovirus/*physiology', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology/*virology', 'Virus Latency/*physiology']",,,2017/11/03 06:00,2017/11/29 06:00,['2017/11/03 06:00'],"['2017/11/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/29 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000008298 [doi]', '00005792-201711030-00009 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2017 Nov;96(44):e8298. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000008298.,PMC5682777,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, L-asparaginase is involved in the biosynthesis of amino acids such as lysine, methionine and threonine. These enzymes have been used as chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and other haematopoietic malignancies since the tumour cells cannot synthesize sufficient L-asparagine and are thus killed by deprivation of this amino acid. L-Asparaginases are also used in the food industry and have potential in the development of biosensors, for example for asparagine levels in leukaemia. The thermostable type I L-asparaginase from Thermococcus kodakarensis (TkA) is composed of 328 amino acids and forms homodimers in solution, with the highest catalytic activity being observed at pH 9.5 and 85 degrees C. It has a Km value of 5.5 mM for L-asparagine, with no glutaminase activity being observed. The crystal structure of TkA has been determined at 2.18 A resolution, confirming the presence of two alpha/beta domains connected by a short linker region. The N-terminal domain contains a highly flexible beta-hairpin which adopts `open' and `closed' conformations in different subunits of the solved TkA structure. In previously solved L-asparaginase structures this beta-hairpin was only visible when in the `closed' conformation, whilst it is characterized with good electron density in all of the subunits of the TkA structure. A phosphate anion resides at the active site, which is formed by residues from both of the neighbouring monomers in the dimer. The high thermostability of TkA is attributed to the high arginine and salt-bridge content when compared with related mesophilic enzymes.",,"['Guo, Jingxu', 'Coker, Alun R', 'Wood, Steve P', 'Cooper, Jonathan B', 'Chohan, Shahid Mahmood', 'Rashid, Naeem', 'Akhtar, Muhummad']","['Guo J', 'Coker AR', 'Wood SP', 'Cooper JB', 'Chohan SM', 'Rashid N', 'Akhtar M']","['Division of Medicine, University College London, Gower Street, London WC1E 6BT, England.', 'Division of Medicine, University College London, Gower Street, London WC1E 6BT, England.', 'Division of Medicine, University College London, Gower Street, London WC1E 6BT, England.', 'Division of Medicine, University College London, Gower Street, London WC1E 6BT, England.', 'School of Biological Sciences, University of the Punjab, Quaid-e-Azam Campus, Lahore 54590, Pakistan.', 'School of Biological Sciences, University of the Punjab, Quaid-e-Azam Campus, Lahore 54590, Pakistan.', 'School of Biological Sciences, University of the Punjab, Quaid-e-Azam Campus, Lahore 54590, Pakistan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20171020,United States,Acta Crystallogr D Struct Biol,"Acta crystallographica.

We retrospectively analysed 199 adult patients with FA transplanted between 1991 and 2014. Patients were a median of 16 years of age when diagnosed with FA, and underwent transplantation at a median age of 23 years. Time between diagnosis and transplant was shortest (median 2 years) in those patients who had a human leucocyte antigen identical sibling donor. Fifty four percent of patients had bone marrow (BM) failure at transplantation and 46% had clonal disease (34% myelodysplasia, 12% acute leukaemia). BM was the main stem cell source, the conditioning regimen included cyclophosphamide in 96% of cases and fludarabine in 64%. Engraftment occurred in 82% (95% confidence interval [CI] 76-87%), acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) grade II-IV in 22% (95% CI 16-28%) and the incidence of chronic GvHD at 96 months was 26% (95% CI 20-33). Non-relapse mortality at 96 months was 56% with an overall survival of 34%, which improved with more recent transplants. Median follow-up was 58 months. Patients transplanted after 2000 had improved survival (84% at 36 months), using BM from an identical sibling and fludarabine in the conditioning regimen.

We describe the clinical features of two patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia: a 79-year-old woman and a 53-year-old man who developed nail plate abnormalities approximately 6 and 4 months, respectively, after beginning ibrutinib therapy. We also review the characteristics of other patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia with ibrutinib-associated nail plate abnormalities. The PubMed database was used to search the following terms: abnormal, abnormalities, adverse, brittle, chronic, cutaneous, dystrophy, events, effects, ibrutinib, lymphocytic, leukemia, nail, plate, and side.

The typical translocation partner is the NUP214 gene. BCR-ABL translocations are relatively rare in this entity. Furthermore, while there have been unique patterns of amplification noted among the NUP214-ABL fusion genes, there have been few such reports among cases with BCR-ABL fusion genes. Case presentation: Here we report a unique case of a 44-year old patient with T-ALL in which the blasts demonstrated a derivative chromosome 9 involving a 9;22 translocation and a dicentric Philadelphia chromosome 22 with a homogeneously staining region at the interface of the 9;22 translocation, leading to BCR-ABL1 gene amplification. Fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) showed abnormal BCR/ABL1 fusions with the BCR-ABL1 gene amplification in 48% of the interphase cells analyzed. The translocation was confirmed by SNP array. Conclusions: We present a novel derivative chromosome 9 that shows BCR-ABL gene fusion along with a dicentric Philadelphia chromosome 22 with BCR-ABL1 gene amplification. This is a unique pattern of BCR-ABL fusion which has never been described in T-ALL. It is significant that the patient responded to standard treatment with the CALGB 10403 protocol and supplementation with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Identification of additional patients with this pattern of BCR-ABL fusion will allow for enhanced risk assessment and prognostication.",,"['Koka, Rima', 'Bade, Najeebah A', 'Sausville, Edward A', 'Ning, Yi', 'Zou, Ying']","['Koka R', 'Bade NA', 'Sausville EA', 'Ning Y', 'Zou Y']","['Department of Pathology, University of Maryland School of Medicine Baltimore, 22 S.

Experiments using the 6-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)pentyl ester, 2c, revealed that this compound activates caspases-3/7 and causes poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase 1 (PARP-1) fragmentation in THP-1 and U937 cells, indicating the induction of apoptotic cell death.

Hematopoietic stressors may contribute to leukemic transformation by increasing the mutation rate in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) and/or by promoting clonal hematopoiesis. We sequenced the exome of individual hematopoietic colonies derived from 13 patients with congenital neutropenia to measure total mutation burden and performed error-corrected sequencing on a panel of 46 genes on 80 patients with congenital neutropenia to assess for clonal hematopoiesis. An average of 3.6 +/- 1.2 somatic mutations per exome was identified in HSPCs from patients with SCN compared with 3.9 +/- 0.4 for healthy controls (P = NS). Clonal hematopoiesis due to mutations in TP53 was present in 48% (13/27) of patients with SDS but was not seen in healthy controls (0/17, P < .001) or patients with SCN (0/40, P < .001). Our SDS cohort was young (median age 6.3 years), and many of the patients had multiple TP53 mutations. Conversely, clonal hematopoiesis due to mutations of CSF3R was present in patients with SCN but was not detected in healthy controls or patients with SDS. These data show that hematopoietic stress, including granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, do not increase the mutation burden in HSPCs in congenital neutropenia. Rather, distinct hematopoietic stressors result in the selective expansion of HSPCs carrying specific gene mutations. In particular, in SDS there is enormous selective pressure to expand TP53-mutated HSPCs, suggesting that acquisition of TP53 mutations is an early, likely initiating event, in the transformation to myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia in patients with SDS.",['(c) 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Xia, Jun', 'Miller, Christopher A', 'Baty, Jack', 'Ramesh, Amrita', 'Jotte, Matthew R M', 'Fulton, Robert S', 'Vogel, Tiphanie P', 'Cooper, Megan A', 'Walkovich, Kelly J', 'Makaryan, Vahagn', 'Bolyard, Audrey A', 'Dinauer, Mary C', 'Wilson, David B', 'Vlachos, Adrianna', 'Myers, Kasiani C', 'Rothbaum, Robert J', 'Bertuch, Alison A', 'Dale, David C', 'Shimamura, Akiko', 'Boxer, Laurence A', 'Link, Daniel C']","['Xia J', 'Miller CA', 'Baty J', 'Ramesh A', 'Jotte MRM', 'Fulton RS', 'Vogel TP', 'Cooper MA', 'Walkovich KJ', 'Makaryan V', 'Bolyard AA', 'Dinauer MC', 'Wilson DB', 'Vlachos A', 'Myers KC', 'Rothbaum RJ', 'Bertuch AA', 'Dale DC', 'Shimamura A', 'Boxer LA', 'Link DC']","['Division of Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine.', 'McDonnell Genome Institute, and.', 'Division of Biostatistics, Department of Internal Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine.', 'McDonnell Genome Institute, and.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Center for Human Immunobiology, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX."", 'Division of Rheumatology, Department of Pediatrics, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Department of Pediatrics and Communicable Diseases, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI.', 'Department of Medicine/General Internal Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.', 'Department of Medicine/General Internal Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO.', ""The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Division of Hematology/Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Cohen Children's Medical Center, New York, NY."", ""Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation and Immune Deficiency, The Cancer and Blood Diseases Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH."", 'Division of Gastroenterology and Nutrition, Department of Pediatrics, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO.', ""Hematology/Oncology Section, Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX; and."", 'Department of Medicine/General Internal Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.', ""Bone Marrow Failure and Myelodysplastic Syndrome Program, Dana-Farber/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Boston, MA."", 'Division of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Department of Pediatrics and Communicable Diseases, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20171101,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Congenital Bone Marrow Failure Syndromes', 'Exome', 'Female', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Mutation', 'Mutation Rate', 'Neutropenia/*congenital/genetics/pathology/physiopathology', 'Young Adult']",,,2017/11/03 06:00,2019/05/14 06:00,['2017/11/03 06:00'],"['2017/08/14 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/14 06:00 [medline]', '2017/11/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)32526-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2017-08-801985 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2018 Jan 25;131(4):408-416. doi: 10.1182/blood-2017-08-801985.

Historically, those who relapse from this condition have a dismal prognosis. Recent developments in immunoconjugate usage has changed the landscape of lymphoid B-cell malignancy therapy. One recent development is the FDA approved therapy inotuzumab ozogamicin which has the potential to reduce the overall toxicity of intensive regimens for ALL, as well as to possibly increase the number of patients who may achieve a state of minimal residual disease. Areas covered: In this review, the pre-clinical and clinical experiences with inotuzumab ozogamicin in lymphoma and ALL are reviewed. The article further includes the published phase I, II and III studies in ALL and considers the safety and efficacy of this treatment. Expert opinion: Inotuzumab ozogamicin is likely to be used, primarily, as a potent agent for relapsed ALL, either as the first choice or for those who fail treatment with blinatumumab. Its potential in newly diagnosed patients is currently unknown, such that the overall impact is likely to be important, but limited.",,"['Tvito, Ariella', 'Rowe, Jacob M']","['Tvito A', 'Rowe JM']","['a Department of Hematology , Shaare Zedek Medical Center , Jerusalem , Israel.', 'a Department of Hematology , Shaare Zedek Medical Center , Jerusalem , Israel.', 'b Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation , Rambam Health Care Campus , Haifa , Israel.', 'c Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine , Technion, Israel Institute of Technology , Haifa , Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20171101,England,Expert Opin Biol Ther,Expert opinion on biological therapy,101125414,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Immunoconjugates/therapeutic use', 'Inotuzumab Ozogamicin', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Prognosis']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Inotuzumab ozogamicin', '*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*immunoconjugate', '*lymphoma']",2017/11/03 06:00,2018/02/13 06:00,['2017/11/03 06:00'],"['2017/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/13 06:00 [medline]', '2017/11/03 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/14712598.2017.1387244 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Biol Ther. 2017 Dec;17(12):1557-1564. doi: 10.1080/14712598.2017.1387244.

Leukemic lymphocytes have prolonged longevity, defined by resistance to apoptosis. These cells can accumulate in peripheral blood, bone marrow, and solid lymphoid organs. CLL may be indolent or aggressive and has a range of prognostic factors such as expression of CD38 and ZAP-70, immunophenotypic and cytogenetic changes, imbalanced apoptosis proteins, and others. Although CLL has a low mortality rate, this disease is generally not considered curable until today. CLL treatment involves alkylating agents and glucocorticoids, purine analogs, monoclonal antibody therapies, and bone marrow transplantation. In recent decades, new drugs have appeared focusing on new targets and specific molecules, such as the BCR receptor, Bruton's tyrosine kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, spleen tyrosine kinase, apoptosis proteins and microRNAs. The most appropriate treatment for CLL is one that involves in its protocol a combination of drugs according to the prognostic factors presented by each patient. In this sense, treatment individualization is essential. This article examines standard treatments for CLL and explores new treatments and potential new targets, as well as schematic protocols to understand where we are, how the treatment has evolved, and the advantages and disadvantages of new targets for CLL therapy.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

However, there has not been any tangible improvement in this treatment beyond induction through chemotherapy and consolidation with allogeneic stem cell transplantation or chemotherapy. Residual AML cells which later cause relapse mostly persist even after rigorous standard therapy. It is imperative therefore to find an alternative therapy that can take care of the residual AML cells. With a better understanding of how the immune system works to destroy tumor cells and inhibit their growth, another therapeutic option immunotherapy has emerged to address the difficulties associated with the standard therapy. Identification of leukemia-associated antigens (LAA) and the fact that T and NK cells can be activated to exert cytotoxicity on AML cells have further introduced diverse immunotherapeutic development strategies.

29091516,NLM,MEDLINE,20190715,20210105,1527-7755 (Electronic) 0732-183X (Linking),36,3,2018 Jan 20,Bosutinib Versus Imatinib for Newly Diagnosed Chronic Myeloid Leukemia: Results From the Randomized BFORE Trial.,231-237,10.1200/JCO.2017.74.7162 [doi],"Purpose Bosutinib is a potent dual SRC/ABL kinase inhibitor approved for adults with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) resistant and /or intolerant to prior therapy. We assessed the efficacy and safety of bosutinib versus imatinib for first-line treatment of chronic-phase CML. Methods In this ongoing, multinational, phase III study, 536 patients with newly diagnosed chronic-phase CML were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive 400 mg of bosutinib once daily (n = 268) or imatinib (n = 268). Per protocol, efficacy was assessed in patients who were Philadelphia chromosome-positive with typical (e13a2/e14a2) transcripts (bosutinib, n = 246; imatinib, n = 241). Patients with Philadelphia chromosome-negative-/ BCR-ABL1-positive status and those with unknown Philadelphia chromosome status and/or atypical BCR-ABL1 transcript type were excluded from this population. Results The major molecular response (MMR) rate at 12 months (primary end point) was significantly higher with bosutinib versus imatinib (47.2% v 36.9%, respectively; P = .02), as was complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) rate by 12 months (77.2% v 66.4%, respectively; P = .0075). Cumulative incidence was favorable with bosutinib (MMR: hazard ratio, 1.34; P = .0173; CCyR: hazard ratio, 1.38; P < .001), with earlier response times. Four patients (1.6%) receiving bosutinib and six patients (2.5%) receiving imatinib experienced disease progression to accelerated/blast phase. Among treated patients, 22.0% of patients receiving bosutinib and 26.8% of patients receiving imatinib discontinued treatment, most commonly for drug-related toxicity (12.7% and 8.7%, respectively). Grade >/= 3 diarrhea (7.8% v 0.8%) and increased ALT (19.0% v 1.5%) and AST (9.7% v 1.9%) levels were more common with bosutinib. Cardiac and vascular toxicities were uncommon. Conclusion Patients who received bosutinib had significantly higher rates of MMR and CCyR and achieved responses faster than those who received imatinib. Consistent with the known safety profile, GI events and transaminase elevations were more common with bosutinib. Results indicate bosutinib may be an effective first-line treatment for chronic-phase CML.",,"['Cortes, Jorge E', 'Gambacorti-Passerini, Carlo', 'Deininger, Michael W', 'Mauro, Michael J', 'Chuah, Charles', 'Kim, Dong-Wook', 'Dyagil, Irina', 'Glushko, Nataliia', 'Milojkovic, Dragana', 'le Coutre, Philipp', 'Garcia-Gutierrez, Valentin', 'Reilly, Laurence', 'Jeynes-Ellis, Allison', 'Leip, Eric', 'Bardy-Bouxin, Nathalie', 'Hochhaus, Andreas', 'Brummendorf, Tim H']","['Cortes JE', 'Gambacorti-Passerini C', 'Deininger MW', 'Mauro MJ', 'Chuah C', 'Kim DW', 'Dyagil I', 'Glushko N', 'Milojkovic D', 'le Coutre P', 'Garcia-Gutierrez V', 'Reilly L', 'Jeynes-Ellis A', 'Leip E', 'Bardy-Bouxin N', 'Hochhaus A', 'Brummendorf TH']","[""Jorge E.

However, the majority of patients will show initial resistance or will relapse after initial complete remission. Genetic variability in genes involved in anthracyclines metabolic pathway could be one of the causes of the interindividual differences in clinical outcomes. METHODS: A systematic review of published studies in AML cohorts was carried out in order to analyze the influence of polymorphisms in genes of anthracycline metabolism on efficacy and toxicity. RESULTS: Polymorphisms in the main enzymes of anthracyclines metabolism (CBR, AKR, NQO1, NOS3) have been related to lower enzymatic activity and higher cardiotoxicity. Moreover, variant alleles in the genes of carcinogens and chemotherapy neutralizing enzymes (GST, SULT, NADP(H) oxidase) have been associated with ROS generation and drug efficacy, influencing the survival rates and cardiac toxicities. In addition, genetic variability in the transporters of anthracyclines could affect the intake in cells, including influx (SLC28A3, SLC22A12, SLCO1B1) and efflux transporters (ABCB1, ABCC1, ABCC3, ABCG2). CONCLUSION: The knowledge of the role of pharmacogenetics in anthracyclines metabolism could explain the differences observed in their disposition in leukemic cells. These genetic variants are proposed biomarkers in clinical practice in order to individualize chemotherapy schemes, potentially increasing the effectiveness and reducing the toxicities.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.org.']","['Megias-Vericat, Juan Eduardo', 'Martinez-Cuadron, David', 'Herrero, Maria Jose', 'Alino, Salvador F', 'Poveda, Jose Luis', 'Sanz, Miguel Angel', 'Montesinos, Pau']","['Megias-Vericat JE', 'Martinez-Cuadron D', 'Herrero MJ', 'Alino SF', 'Poveda JL', 'Sanz MA', 'Montesinos P']","['Unidad de Farmacogenetica, Instituto Investigacion Sanitaria La Fe and Area del Medicamento, Hospital Universitario y Politecnico La Fe.

Erwinia asparaginase is efficacious, but has a short half-life, requiring six doses to replace one dose of the most commonly used first-line asparaginase, pegaspargase, a polyethylene glycol (PEG) conjugated E. coli asparaginase. Pegcristantaspase, a recombinant PEGylated Erwinia asparaginase with improved pharmacokinetics, was developed for patients with hypersensitivity to pegaspargase. Here, we report a series of patients treated on a pediatric phase 2 trial of pegcrisantaspase. PROCEDURE: Pediatric patients with ALL or lymphoblastic lymphoma and hypersensitivity to pegaspargase enrolled on Children's Oncology Group trial AALL1421 (Jazz 13-011) and received intravenous pegcrisantaspase. Serum asparaginase activity (SAA) was monitored before and after dosing; immunogenicity assays were performed for antiasparaginase and anti-PEG antibodies and complement activation was evaluated. RESULTS: Three of the four treated patients experienced hypersensitivity to pegcrisantaspase manifested as clinical hypersensitivity reactions or rapid clearance of SAA. Immunogenicity assays demonstrated the presence of anti-PEG immunoglobulin G antibodies in all three hypersensitive patients, indicating a PEG-mediated immune response. CONCLUSIONS: This small series of patients, nonetheless, provides data, suggesting preexisting immunogenicity against the PEG moiety of pegaspargase and poses the question as to whether PEGylation may be an effective strategy to optimize Erwinia asparaginase administration. Further study of larger cohorts is needed to determine the incidence of preexisting antibodies against PEG-mediated hypersensitivity to pegaspargase.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Rau, Rachel E', 'Dreyer, ZoAnn', 'Choi, Mi Rim', 'Liang, Wei', 'Skowronski, Roman', 'Allamneni, Krishna P', 'Devidas, Meenakshi', 'Raetz, Elizabeth A', 'Adamson, Peter C', 'Blaney, Susan M', 'Loh, Mignon L', 'Hunger, Stephen P']","['Rau RE', 'Dreyer Z', 'Choi MR', 'Liang W', 'Skowronski R', 'Allamneni KP', 'Devidas M', 'Raetz EA', 'Adamson PC', 'Blaney SM', 'Loh ML', 'Hunger SP']","[""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Texas Children's Cancer Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas."", 'Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', ""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Texas Children's Cancer Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas."", 'Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Palo Alto, California.', 'Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Palo Alto, California.', 'Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Palo Alto, California.', 'Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Palo Alto, California.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Colleges of Medicine, Public Health and Health Professions, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah.', ""Department of Pediatrics and the Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", ""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Texas Children's Cancer Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of California School of Medicine, San Francisco, California.', ""Department of Pediatrics and the Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20171101,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Asparaginase/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', '*Bacterial Proteins/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Hypersensitivity/*epidemiology', 'Erwinia/*enzymology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', '*Polyethylene Glycols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*epidemiology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*asparaginase', '*hypersensitivity']",2017/11/02 06:00,2019/03/27 06:00,['2017/11/02 06:00'],"['2017/09/12 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/03 00:00 [revised]', '2017/10/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/27 06:00 [medline]', '2017/11/02 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.26873 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2018 Mar;65(3). doi: 10.1002/pbc.26873.

The aim of the current study was to establish a simple workflow for reliable genetic analysis of single LSC-enriched blasts from pediatric patients. PROCEDURE: For three AMLs with mutations in nucleophosmin 1 and/or fms-like tyrosine kinase 3, we performed whole genome amplification on sorted single-cell DNA followed by whole exome sequencing (WES). The corresponding bulk bone marrow DNAs were also analyzed by WES and by targeted sequencing (TS) that included 54 genes associated with myeloid malignancies. RESULTS: Analysis revealed that read coverage statistics were comparable between single-cell and bulk WES data, indicating high-quality whole genome amplification. From 102 single-cell variants, 72 single nucleotide variants and insertions or deletions (70%) were consistently found in the two bulk DNA analyses. Variants reliably detected in single cells were also present in TS. However, initial screening by WES with read counts between 50-72x failed to detect rare AML subclones in the bulk DNAs. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our study demonstrated that single-cell WES combined with bulk DNA TS is a promising tool set for detecting AML subclones and possibly LSCs.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Walter, Christiane', 'Pozzorini, Christian', 'Reinhardt, Katarina', 'Geffers, Robert', 'Xu, Zhenyu', 'Reinhardt, Dirk', 'von Neuhoff, Nils', 'Hanenberg, Helmut']","['Walter C', 'Pozzorini C', 'Reinhardt K', 'Geffers R', 'Xu Z', 'Reinhardt D', 'von Neuhoff N', 'Hanenberg H']","[""Department of Pediatrics III, University Children's Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany."", 'Sophia Genetics Inc., Saint-Sulpice, Switzerland.', ""Department of Pediatrics III, University Children's Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany."", 'Genome Analytics, Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Sophia Genetics Inc., Saint-Sulpice, Switzerland.', ""Department of Pediatrics III, University Children's Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany."", ""Department of Pediatrics III, University Children's Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany."", ""Department of Pediatrics III, University Children's Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany."", 'Department of Otorhinolaryngology and Head/Neck Surgery (ENT), Heinrich Heine University, Dusseldorf, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20171101,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Genome, Human', '*High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['pediatric AML', 'single-cell analysis', 'targeted sequencing', 'whole exome sequencing', 'whole genome amplification']",2017/11/02 06:00,2017/12/28 06:00,['2017/11/02 06:00'],"['2017/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2017/09/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/28 06:00 [medline]', '2017/11/02 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.26848 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2018 Feb;65(2). doi: 10.1002/pbc.26848.

Hispanic patients had significantly lower 5-year event-free survival (EFS) (79.4%; 95% CI: 71.6-85.2) and overall survival (OS) (89.2%; 95% CI: 82.7-93.4) than non-Hispanic patients (EFS: 87.5%; 95% CI: 84.5-90.0, P = 0.004; OS: 92.7%; 95% CI: 90.2-94.6, P = 0.006). Exploratory analyses revealed differences between Hispanic and non-Hispanic patients in the frequency of common variants in genes related to toxicity or ALL outcome. CONCLUSION: Hispanic children treated for ALL on DFCI 05-001 had fewer bone-related toxicities and inferior survival than non-Hispanic patients. While disease biology is one explanatory variable for outcome disparities, these findings suggest that biologic and non-biologic mechanisms affecting drug delivery and exposure in this population may be important contributing factors as well.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Kahn, Justine M', 'Cole, Peter D', 'Blonquist, Traci M', 'Stevenson, Kristen', 'Jin, Zhezhen', 'Barrera, Sergio', 'Davila, Randy', 'Roberts, Emily', 'Neuberg, Donna S', 'Athale, Uma H', 'Clavell, Luis A', 'Laverdiere, Caroline', 'Leclerc, Jean-Marie', 'Michon, Bruno', 'Schorin, Marshall A', 'Welch, Jennifer J G', 'Sallan, Stephen E', 'Silverman, Lewis B', 'Kelly, Kara M']","['Kahn JM', 'Cole PD', 'Blonquist TM', 'Stevenson K', 'Jin Z', 'Barrera S', 'Davila R', 'Roberts E', 'Neuberg DS', 'Athale UH', 'Clavell LA', 'Laverdiere C', 'Leclerc JM', 'Michon B', 'Schorin MA', 'Welch JJG', 'Sallan SE', 'Silverman LB', 'Kelly KM']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology/Stem Cell Transplantation, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York.', ""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital at Montefiore, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York."", 'Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Economics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Department of Psychology, University of California, Davis, California.', 'Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.', ""Division of Pediatric Oncology, San Jorge Children's Hospital, San Juan, Puerto Rico."", 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Hospital Sainte-Justine, University of Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Hospital Sainte-Justine, University of Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', ""Division of Hematology-Oncology, Centre Hospitalier de l'Universite Laval, Quebec City, Canada."", 'Inova Fairfax Hospital for Children, Falls Church, Virginia.', ""Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Hasbro Children's Hospital, Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts."", 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology/Stem Cell Transplantation, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York.', ""Roswell Park Cancer Institute and Women and Children's Hospital, University at Buffalo School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Buffalo, New York.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171101,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Fractures, Bone/chemically induced/ethnology/mortality', '*Hispanic or Latino', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Male', '*Osteonecrosis/chemically induced/ethnology/mortality', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/ethnology/mortality', 'Survival Rate']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Hispanic', '*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*ethnicity', '*outcomes', '*survival', '*toxicities']",2017/11/02 06:00,2019/03/27 06:00,['2017/11/02 06:00'],"['2017/06/02 00:00 [received]', '2017/09/26 00:00 [revised]', '2017/09/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/27 06:00 [medline]', '2017/11/02 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.26871 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2018 Mar;65(3). doi: 10.1002/pbc.26871.

This two-part, phase 1, multicenter, open-label, sequential-group, dose-escalation study aimed to determine dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and safety/tolerability of quizartinib, a selective and highly potent FLT3 inhibitor, when administered as maintenance therapy after allo-HCT. Thirteen subjects with documented FLT3-ITD-mutated AML in morphological remission following allo-HCT received one of two quizartinib dihydrochloride dose levels (DL): 40 mg/d (DL1; n = 7) and 60 mg/d (DL2; n = 6), administered orally in 28-day cycles for up to 24 cycles. Median age of participants was 43 years. All subjects received human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched allo-HCT. One subject treated at DL1 and 1 treated at DL2 had DLTs that required drug interruption (grade 3 gastric hemorrhage and grade 3 anemia, respectively). Ten subjects (77%) received quizartinib for >1 year; 5 (38%) completed 24 cycles. Four subjects (31%) discontinued quizartinib due to adverse events. One subject (8%) experienced relapse during cycle 1 and discontinued treatment. Most common grade 3/4 adverse events were neutropenia (23%), anemia (15%), leukopenia (15%), lymphopenia (15%), and thrombocytopenia (15%). This study demonstrated acceptable tolerability and early evidence of reduced relapse rate following allo-HCT with quizartinib maintenance compared to historical cohorts.

With the advances in molecular techniques, the two-hit hypothesis was replaced by a multi-hit model, which also emphasizes the importance of aberrant epigenetic regulation in the pathogenesis of AML. IDH1 and IDH2 are two isoforms of isocitrate dehydrogenase that perform crucial roles in cellular metabolism. Somatic mutations in either of these two genes impart a neomorphic enzymatic activity upon the encoded enzymes resulting in the ability to convert alpha-ketoglutarate (alphaKG) into the oncometabolite R2-hydroxyglutarate (R2-HG), which can competitively inhibit multiple alphaKG-dependent dioxygenases. Inhibition of various classes of alphaKG-dependent dioxygenases results in dramatic epigenetic changes in hematopoietic cells, which has been found to directly impair differentiation. In addition to a global dysregulation of gene expression, other mechanisms have been described through which R2-HG promotes leukemic transformation including the induction of B cell lymphoma 2 dependency and stimulation of the EglN family of prolyl 4-hydroxylases (EglN). Due to the fact that mutations in IDH1 and IDH2 are acquired early during AML clonal evolution as well as because these mutations tend to remain stable during AML progression, the pharmaceutical industry has prompted the development of specific mutant IDH enzyme inhibitors. More recently, the FDA approved the first mutant IDH2 inhibitor, enasidenib (AG-221), for patients with relapsed or refractory IDH2-mutated AML (RR-AML). This has brought a lot of excitement to researchers, clinicians, and patients, especially because the treatment of AML remains challenging and is still associated with a high mortality.",,"['Nassereddine, Samah', 'Lap, Coen J', 'Haroun, Faysal', 'Tabbara, Imad']","['Nassereddine S', 'Lap CJ', 'Haroun F', 'Tabbara I']","['The George Washington University School of Medicine, Washington, DC, USA.', 'The George Washington Cancer Center, Washington, DC, USA.', 'The George Washington Cancer Center, Washington, DC, USA.', 'The George Washington University School of Medicine, Washington, DC, USA.', 'The George Washington University School of Medicine, Washington, DC, USA. itabbara@mfa.gwu.edu.', 'The George Washington Cancer Center, Washington, DC, USA. itabbara@mfa.gwu.edu.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology and GW Cancer Center, George Washington University Medical Faculty Associates, 2150 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC, 20037, USA. itabbara@mfa.gwu.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20171031,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,"['Aminopyridines/*therapeutic use', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Isocitrate Dehydrogenase/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/mortality', 'Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Triazines/*therapeutic use']",['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'Clinical trial', 'Enasidenib', 'IDH', 'Leukemogenesis']",2017/11/02 06:00,2017/12/01 06:00,['2017/11/02 06:00'],"['2017/08/19 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/01 06:00 [medline]', '2017/11/02 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-017-3161-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-017-3161-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2017 Dec;96(12):1983-1991. doi: 10.1007/s00277-017-3161-0.

HTLV-1 oncogenes can induce malignancy through controlled gene expression of cell cycle checkpoints in the host cell. HTLV-I genes play a pivotal role in overriding cell cycle checkpoints and deregulate cellular division. In this study, we aimed to determine and compare the HTLV-1 proviral load and the gene expression levels of cyclin-dependent kinase-2 (CDK2), CDK4, p53, and retinoblastoma (Rb) in ATLL and carrier groups. METHODS: A total of twenty-five ATLL patients (12 females and 13 males) and 21 asymptomatic carriers (10 females and 11 males) were included in this study. TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction assay was used for evaluation of proviral load and gene expression levels of CDK2, CDK4, p53, and Rb. Statistical analysis was used to compare proviral load and gene expression levels between two groups, using SPSS version 18. RESULTS: The mean scores of the HTLV-1 proviral load in the ATLL patients and healthy carriers were 13067.20+/-6400.41 and 345.79+/-78.80 copies/10(4) cells, respectively (P=0.000). There was a significant correlation between the gene expression levels of CDK2 and CDK4 (P=0.01) in the ATLL group. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrated a significant difference between the ATLL patients and healthy carriers regarding the rate of proviral load and the gene expression levels of p53 and CDK4; accordingly, proviral load and expression levels of these genes may be useful in the assessment of disease progression and prediction of HTLV-1 infection outcomes.",,"['Torshizi, Reza', 'Ghayour Karimani, Ehsan', 'Etminani, Kobra', 'Akbarin, Mohammad Mehdi', 'Jamialahmadi, Khadijeh', 'Shirdel, Abbas', 'Rahimi, Hossein', 'Allahyari, Abolghasem', 'Golabpour, Amin', 'Rafatpanah, Houshang']","['Torshizi R', 'Ghayour Karimani E', 'Etminani K', 'Akbarin MM', 'Jamialahmadi K', 'Shirdel A', 'Rahimi H', 'Allahyari A', 'Golabpour A', 'Rafatpanah H']","['Department of Modern Sciences and Technologies, Molecular Medicine Department, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Molecular Diagnostic Unit, Research and Education Department, Razavi Hospital, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Informatics, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran, Iran.', 'Inflammation and Inflammatory Diseases Research Centre, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Biotechnology Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Biotechnology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Hematology Department, Ghaem Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Hematology Department, Ghaem Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Hematology Department, Imam Reza Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Informatics, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran, Iran.', 'Inflammation and Inflammatory Diseases Research Centre, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Iran,Rep Biochem Mol Biol,Reports of biochemistry & molecular biology,101637937,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Adult T-cell leukemia/ lymphoma', 'CDKs', 'HTLV-I', 'Retinoblastoma', 'p53']",2017/11/02 06:00,2017/11/02 06:01,['2017/11/02 06:00'],"['2017/11/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/02 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Rep Biochem Mol Biol. 2017 Oct;6(1):88-94.,PMC5643448,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there is hardly any documentation of the use of tranexamic acid in laparoscopic cholecystectomy. AIMS: This study was conducted to evaluate the role of tranexamic acid in limiting blood loss in laparoscopic cholecystectomy and to evaluate the effect of blood loss on morbidity in terms of hospital stay and mortality of the patient. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The study was conducted on sixty patients admitted with gallstones, candidates for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Thirty patients received an intravenous 20 mg/kg bolus dose of tranexamic acid at induction of anesthesia (Group A), and another thirty did not receive the aforementioned drug at induction (Group B). STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The two groups were compared, and the data collected were entered and tabulated using Microsoft Office Excel and analyzed using appropriate statistical tests. RESULTS: The mean postoperative hospital stay (2.4 vs. 2.63, P = 0.4147), drain fluid hemoglobin (Hb) (0.83 vs. 0.90, P = 0.2087), drain fluid hematocrit (0.2434 vs. 0.2627, P = 0.3787), mean drain output (85 vs. 87.23, P = 0.9271), mean pulse rate at the start of surgery (74.2 vs. 75, P > 0.999), mean pulse rate 24 h after surgery (75.9 vs. 76.4, P = 0.5775), and mean change in Hb (0.240 vs. 0.266, P = 0.2502) in both the groups were not significant.

EuroFlow has previously designed an AL orientation tube (ALOT) to guide towards the relevant classification panel (T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), B-cell precursor (BCP)-ALL and/or acute myeloid leukemia (AML)) and final diagnosis. Now we built a reference database with 656 typical AL samples (145 T-ALL, 377 BCP-ALL, 134 AML), processed and analyzed via standardized protocols. Using principal component analysis (PCA)-based plots and automated classification algorithms for direct comparison of single-cells from individual patients against the database, another 783 cases were subsequently evaluated. Depending on the database-guided results, patients were categorized as: (i) typical T, B or Myeloid without or; (ii) with a transitional component to another lineage; (iii) atypical; or (iv) mixed-lineage. Using this automated algorithm, in 781/783 cases (99.7%) the right panel was selected, and data comparable to the final WHO-diagnosis was already provided in >93% of cases (85% T-ALL, 97% BCP-ALL, 95% AML and 87% mixed-phenotype AL patients), even without data on the full-characterization panels.

A significant proportion of both pediatric and adult AML patients cannot be cured and since the upper limits of chemotherapy intensification have been reached, there is an urgent need for novel therapeutic approaches. The transcription factor c-MYB has been shown to play a central role in the development and progression of AML driven by several different oncogenes, including mixed lineage leukemia (MLL)-fusion genes. Here, we have used a c-MYB gene expression signature from MLL-rearranged AML to probe the Connectivity Map database and identified mebendazole as a c-MYB targeting drug. Mebendazole induces c-MYB degradation via the proteasome by interfering with the heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) chaperone system. Transient exposure to mebendazole is sufficient to inhibit colony formation by AML cells, but not normal cord blood-derived cells. Furthermore, mebendazole is effective at impairing AML progression in vivo in mouse xenotransplantation experiments. In the context of widespread human use of mebendazole, our data indicate that mebendazole-induced c-MYB degradation represents a safe and novel therapeutic approach for AML.",,"['Walf-Vorderwulbecke, V', 'Pearce, K', 'Brooks, T', 'Hubank, M', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink, M M', 'Zwaan, C M', 'Adams, S', 'Edwards, D', 'Bartram, J', 'Samarasinghe, S', 'Ancliff, P', 'Khwaja, A', 'Goulden, N', 'Williams, G', 'de Boer, J', 'Williams, O']","['Walf-Vorderwulbecke V', 'Pearce K', 'Brooks T', 'Hubank M', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink MM', 'Zwaan CM', 'Adams S', 'Edwards D', 'Bartram J', 'Samarasinghe S', 'Ancliff P', 'Khwaja A', 'Goulden N', 'Williams G', 'de Boer J', 'Williams O']","['Cancer Section, Developmental Biology and Cancer Programme, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, London, UK.', 'UCL Genomics, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, London, UK.', 'UCL Genomics, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, London, UK.', 'UCL Genomics, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, London, UK.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus-MC Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus-MC Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", 'SIHMDS-Haematology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, London, UK.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, London, UK.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, London, UK.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, London, UK.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, London, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, UCL Cancer Institute, London, UK.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, London, UK.', ""Wolfson Centre for Age-Related Diseases, King's College London, London, UK."", 'Cancer Section, Developmental Biology and Cancer Programme, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, London, UK.', 'Cancer Section, Developmental Biology and Cancer Programme, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171101,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mebendazole/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Oncogenes/drug effects', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Proteolysis/*drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb/*metabolism']",,,2017/11/02 06:00,2019/03/21 06:00,['2017/11/02 06:00'],"['2017/06/13 00:00 [received]', '2017/09/27 00:00 [revised]', '2017/10/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/21 06:00 [medline]', '2017/11/02 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2017317 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2017.317 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2018 Apr;32(4):882-889. doi: 10.1038/leu.2017.317.

Circulating exosomes can deliver suppressive cargos to immune recipient cells, inhibiting anti-tumor activities. Pre-therapy plasma of refractory/relapsed AML patients contains elevated levels of immunosuppressive exosomes which interfere with anti-leukemia functions of activated immune cells. We show that exosomes isolated from pre-therapy plasma of the AML patients receiving adoptive NK-92 cell therapy block anti-leukemia cytotoxicity of NK-92 cells and other NK-92 cell functions. NK-92 cells do not internalize AML exosomes. Instead, signaling via surface receptors expressed on NK-92 cells, AML exosomes simultaneously deliver multiple inhibitory ligands to the cognate receptors. The signals are processed downstream and activate multiple suppressive pathways in NK-92 cells. AML exosomes reprogram NK-92 cells, interfering with their anti-leukemia functions and reducing the therapeutic potential of adoptive cell transfers.

While autophagy has been shown to function in host antiviral defense by eliminating intracellular viruses and regulating adaptive immunity, several viruses have evolved molecular mechanisms to get benefits from it. The deltaretrovirus human T-cell leukemia virus type-1 (HTLV-1) has been reported to profit its replication from enhancing autophagosome accumulation. Here, we reported that HLA-DMB (generally referred to here as DMB), the beta chain of the non-classical MHC-II protein HLA-DM, had strong expression in HTLV-1-transformed T-cell lines and could be induced in Hela, PMA-differentiated THP1 (PMA-THP1) or primary human monocytes by HTLV-1 infection. Immunoblot and real-time PCR assays demonstrated that overexpression of DMB decreased HTLV-1 protein expression while the knockdown of DMB increased HTLV-1 protein expression. Immunoblot and confocal microscopy assays indicated that overexpression of DMB decreased HTLV-1 induced autophagosome accumulation while the knockdown of DMB yielded the opposite effects. Coimmunoprecipitation and immunoprecipitation experiments suggested DMB interacted with autophagy-related gene (ATG) 7 and increased the acetylation of ATG7.

Many kinase inhibitors have been approved for clinical use, but their practical application is often limited. Here, we describe a collection of 23 novel 2,6,9-trisubstituted purine derivatives with nanomolar inhibitory activities against PDGFRalpha, a receptor tyrosine kinase often found constitutively activated in various tumours. The compounds demonstrated strong and selective cytotoxicity in the human eosinophilic leukemia cell line EOL-1, whereas several other cell lines were substantially less sensitive. The cytotoxicity in EOL-1, which is known to express the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene encoding an oncogenic kinase, correlated significantly with PDGFRalpha inhibition. EOL-1 cells treated with the compounds also exhibited dose-dependent inhibition of PDGFRalpha autophosphorylation and suppression of its downstream signaling pathways with concomitant G1 phase arrest, confirming the proposed mechanism of action. Our results show that substituted purines can be used as platforms for preparing tyrosine kinase inhibitors with specific activity towards eosinophilic leukemia.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

There may be a role for beta blockers (BB), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) in the prevention of LVD. Areas covered: There are multiple definitions for LVD based on clinical and/or imaging features. Molecular-targeted therapies cause reversible LVD. Therapies with well-reported LVD are inhibitors of human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2), angiogenesis, Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog (ABL) and the proteasome. BB, ACEI and ARB seem to have a role in the prevention of LVD associated with anthracyclines. Few trials have investigated the role of BB, ACEI and ARB as primary prevention of LVD in molecular-targeted therapies. Their results are not conclusive but a beneficial role cannot be excluded. Expert opinion: Because of inconclusive data, future interventional studies should not include all treated patients with molecular-targeted therapy, but focus on patients at risk for developing LVD. Another option is to study patients who show early signs of LVD to prevent progression to overt heart failure.",,"['Awada, Gil', 'de Azambuja, Evandro', 'Awada, Ahmad']","['Awada G', 'de Azambuja E', 'Awada A']","['a Department of Internal Medicine , Universitair Ziekenhuis Brussel, Vrije Universiteit Brussel , Brussels , Belgium.', 'b Medical Oncology Clinic , Institut Jules Bordet, Universite Libre de Bruxelles , Brussels , Belgium.', 'b Medical Oncology Clinic , Institut Jules Bordet, Universite Libre de Bruxelles , Brussels , Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20171106,England,Expert Opin Drug Metab Toxicol,Expert opinion on drug metabolism & toxicology,101228422,IM,"['Adrenergic beta-Antagonists/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Heart Failure/etiology/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/adverse effects/methods', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Ventricular Dysfunction, Left/chemically induced/*prevention & control']",['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer', 'angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor', 'angiotensin receptor blocker', 'beta blocker', 'left ventricular dysfunction', 'prevention', 'targeted therapy']",2017/11/02 06:00,2017/12/13 06:00,['2017/11/02 06:00'],"['2017/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/13 06:00 [medline]', '2017/11/02 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17425255.2017.1398733 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Drug Metab Toxicol. 2017 Dec;13(12):1205-1215. doi: 10.1080/17425255.2017.1398733.

We observed that activated (autophosphorylated) CaMKIIgamma was invariably present in T-ALL cell lines and in the majority of primary T-ALL samples. Overexpression of CaMKIIgamma enhanced the proliferation, colony formation, in vivo tumorigenesis and increased DNA damage of T-ALL leukemia cells. Furthermore, inhibition of CaMKIIgamma activity with a pharmacologic inhibitor, gene knock-out, dominant-negative constructs or enhancement of CaMKIIgamma activity by overexpression constructs revealed that the activated CaMKIIgamma could phosphorylate FOXO3a. In Jurkat cells, the activated CaMKIIgamma phosphorylated FOXO3a via directly or indirectly phosphorylating AKT, excluded FOXO3a from the nucleus and inhibited its transcriptional activity.

Current therapies have serious side effects, and are only partially effective in patients with metastatic tumors. Thus, the need for novel and less toxic therapies is urgent. Moreover, hormonal and antibody therapies effective in other subtypes are not effective in Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC). Immunotherapeutic strategies directed against specific tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) and mediated by specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) have been largely underexplored in this disease. Cancer-testis antigens (CTA) are a group of TAAs displaying the ideal characteristics of promising vaccine targets, i.e. strong immunogenicity and cancer specificity. The CTA, Sperm Protein 17 (SP17), has been found to be aberrantly expressed in different neoplasms, including ovarian and esophageal cancers, nervous system tumors and multiple myeloma, and has been suggested as a candidate target for immunotherapy. Here, we evaluated SP17 expression levels in breast cancer cell lines, invasive ductal breast carcinoma, including patients with TNBC, and adjacent non-neoplastic breast tissue, and determined whether SP17 was capable of generating SP17-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes in vitro. We showed that SP17 is expressed in breast cancer cell lines and primary breast tumors and importantly in TNBC subtype, but not in adjacent non-tumoral breast tissue or unaffected tissues, except in male germinal cells.

Overexpression of miR-302a, by targeting the 3'UTR of Rad52, enhanced VP-16 sensitivity in the HL-60 and U937 cell. Accordingly, knockdown of Rad52 sensitized the HL-60 and U937 cells to VP-16-induced apoptosis and proliferation suppression. In addition, miR-302a enhanced the tumor-suppressive effect of VP-16 in a xenograft model of human HL-60 and U937 cell lines.

The TRK (tropomyosin-related kinase) tyrosine kinase receptors (TRKA, TRKB, TRKC) are high affinity receptors for NTs. There is increasing data demonstrating an important role of the TRK family in cancer initiation and progression. NTs have been known for many years to promote chemotaxis, maturation, and survival of mast cells. However, the role of NT signaling in the pathogenesis of mastocytosis is not well understood. In this study, we demonstrate that activation of TRKA by its ligand nerve growth factor (NGF) is potent to trigger a disease in mice with striking similarities to human systemic mastocytosis (SM). Moreover, activation of TRKA by NGF strongly rescues KIT inhibition-induced cell death of mast cell lines and primary mast cells from patients with SM, and this rescue effect can be efficiently blocked by entrectinib (a new pan TRK specific inhibitor). HMC-1 mast cell leukemia cells that are resistant to KIT inhibition induced by TRKA activation show reactivation of MAPK/ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) and strong upregulation of early growth response 3 (EGR3), suggesting an important role of MAPK-EGR3 axis in the development of resistance to KIT inhibition. Targeting both TRK and KIT significantly prolongs survival of mice xenotransplanted with HMC-1 cells compared with targeting KIT alone. Thus, these data strongly suggest that TRKA signaling can improve neoplastic mast cell fitness. This might explain at least in part why treatment with KIT inhibitors alone so far has been disappointing in most published clinical trials for mastocytosis. Our data suggest that targeting both KIT and TRKs might improve efficacy of molecular therapy in SM with KIT mutations.",,"['Yang, Min', 'Pan, Zengkai', 'Huang, Kezhi', 'Busche, Guntram', 'Feuerhake, Friedrich', 'Chaturvedi, Anuhar', 'Nie, Danian', 'Heuser, Michael', 'Thol, Felicitas', 'von Neuhoff, Nils', 'Ganser, Arnold', 'Li, Zhixiong']","['Yang M', 'Pan Z', 'Huang K', 'Busche G', 'Feuerhake F', 'Chaturvedi A', 'Nie D', 'Heuser M', 'Thol F', 'von Neuhoff N', 'Ganser A', 'Li Z']","['Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Pathology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170519,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,,['NOTNLM'],"['KIT', 'TRK', 'mastocytosis', 'resistance', 'targeted therapy']",2017/11/02 06:00,2017/11/02 06:01,['2017/11/02 06:00'],"['2017/02/23 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/02 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.18027 [doi]', '18027 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2017 May 19;8(43):73871-73883. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.18027. eCollection 2017 Sep 26.,PMC5650308,,,,,,,"['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors do not declare any competing financial', 'interests.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the past 15 years, diagnostic evaluations, prognostication, and treatment of MDS have improved substantially. However, with the discovery of molecular markers and advent of novel targeted therapies, new challenges have emerged in the complex field of MDS. For example, MDS-related molecular lesions may be detectable in healthy individuals and increase in prevalence with age. Other patients exhibit persistent cytopenia of unknown etiology without dysplasia. Although these conditions are potential pre-phases of MDS they may also transform into other bone marrow neoplasms. Recently identified molecular, cytogenetic, and flow-based parameters may add in the delineation and prognostication of these conditions. However, no generally accepted integrated classification and no related criteria are as yet available. In an attempt to address this challenge, an international consensus group discussed these issues in a working conference in July 2016. The outcomes of this conference are summarized in the present article which includes criteria and a proposal for the classification of pre-MDS conditions as well as updated minimal diagnostic criteria of MDS. Moreover, we propose diagnostic standards to delineate between normal , pre-MDS, and MDS.

BORIS is both a transcription factor and an architectural chromatin protein. BORIS' normal role is to establish a germline-like gene expression and remodel the epigenetic landscape in testis; it similarly remodels chromatin when activated in human cancer. Critically, at least one cancer cell line, K562, is dependent on BORIS for its self-renewal and survival. Here, we downregulate BORIS expression in the K562 cancer cell line to investigate downstream pathways regulated by BORIS. RNA-seq analyses of both mRNA and small ncRNAs, including miRNA and piRNA, in the knock-down cells revealed a set of differentially expressed genes and pathways, including both testis-specific and general proliferation factors, as well as proteins involved in transcription regulation and cell physiology. The differentially expressed genes included important transcriptional regulators such as SOX6 and LIN28A. Data indicate that both direct binding of BORIS to promoter regions and locus-control activity via long-distance chromatin domain regulation are involved.

Recently, it was reported that EF-24-induced apoptosis was mediated by a redox-dependent mechanism. Here, we studied the effects of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on EF-24-induced cell death. We also addressed the question of whether the main drug transporters, ABCB1 and ABCG2, affect the cytotoxic of EF-24. We observed that EF-24 induced cell death with apoptotic hallmarks in human leukemia K562 cells. Importantly, the loss of cell viability was preceded by production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and by a decrease of reduced glutathione (GSH). However, neither ROS production nor the decrease in GSH predominantly contributed to the EF-24-induced cell death. We found that EF-24 formed an adduct with GSH, which is likely the mechanism contributing to the decrease of GSH. Although NAC abrogated ROS production, decreased GSH and prevented cell death, its protective effect was mainly due to a rapid conversion of intra- and extra-cellular EF-24 into the EF-24-NAC adduct without cytotoxic effects. Furthermore, we found that neither overexpression of ABCB1 nor ABCG2 reduced the antiproliferative effects of EF-24. In conclusion, a redox-dependent-mediated mechanism only marginally contributes to the EF-24-induced apoptosis in K562 cells. The main mechanism of NAC protection against EF-24-induced apoptosis is conversion of cytotoxic EF-24 into the noncytotoxic EF-24-NAC adduct.

Previous studies with monoclonal antibody have implicated a regulated expression of 6-sulfo-alpha2-6-sialyl LacNAc on B cells in peripheral lymph nodes and the circulating peripheral blood lymphocytes but its occurrence on leukemia cells or lymphomas have not been critically addressed. In this study, we have extended our previously developed MS-based sulfoglycomic platform by incorporating additional complementary analytical approaches in order to achieve a high sensitivity mapping and relative quantification of the detected sulfated glycotopes down to the level of defining their sialyl linkages. We showed that discovery mode sulfoglycomics and precise location of sulfate were best achieved by multimode MS analyses of fractionated, permethylated sulfated N-glycans. On the other hand, the relative degree of sulfation on individual N-glycans could be more efficiently inferred from the respective extracted ion chromatograms of native, non-sulfated and sulfated target N-glycans in single LC-MS/MS runs. The GlcNAc-6-O-sulfated alpha2-6-sialyl LacNAc, which constitutes the higher affinity ligand for the human inhibitory co-receptor of B cells, CD22, was found to be commonly carried on a range of complex type N-glycans from human CD19+ and CD4+ lymphocytes. We further showed that its occurrence on the most abundant alpha2-6-disialylated biantennary structure from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients diagnosed as B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia varied within +/-2-fold abundance from the mean value determined for isolated CD19+ lymphocytes and cultured B-CLL cells.","['(c) The Author 2017.

Hence, there is a great demand for novel chemotypes of BET inhibitors. The drug repurposing strategy offers great benefits to find inhibitors with known safety and pharmacokinetic profiles, thus increasing medicinal chemists' interest in recent years. Using the drug repurposing strategy, a BRD4-specific score based virtual screening campaign on an in-house drug library was conducted followed by the ALPHA screen assay test. Nitroxoline, an FDA-approved antibiotic, was identified to effectively disrupt the interaction between the first bromodomain of BRD4 (bromodomain-containing protein 4) and acetylated H4 peptide with IC50 of 0.98 muM. Nitroxoline inhibited all BET family members with good selectivity against non-BET bromodomain-containing proteins, thus it is defined as a selective BET inhibitor. Based on the crystal structure of the nitroxoline-BRD4_BD1 complex, the mechanism of action as well as BET specificity of nitroxoline were determined. Since the anticancer activity of nitroxoline against MLL leukemia, one of the BET related diseases, has not been studied before, we tested whether nitroxoline might serve as a potential repurposing drug candidate for MLL leukemia. Nitroxoline effectively inhibited the proliferation of MLL leukemia cells by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The profound efficacy is, at least in part, due to the inhibition of BET and downregulation of target gene transcription.

Medicare Part D plans charge relatively high cost-sharing costs for specialty drugs. A provision in the Affordable Care Act reduced cost sharing in the Part D coverage gap phase in an attempt to mitigate the financial burden of beneficiaries with high drug spending. We examined the early impact of the Part D in-gap discount on specialty cancer drug use and patients' out-of-pocket (OOP) spending. STUDY DESIGN: Natural experimental design. METHODS: We compared changes in outcomes before and after the in-gap discount among beneficiaries with and without low-income subsidies (LIS). Beneficiaries with LIS, who were not affected by the in-gap discount, made up the control group. We studied a random sample of elderly standalone prescription drug plan enrollees with relatively uncommon cancers (eg, leukemia, skin, pancreas, kidney, sarcomas, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma) between 2009 and 2013. We constructed 4 outcome variables annually: 1) use of any specialty cancer drug, 2) the number of specialty cancer drug fills, 3) total specialty drug spending, and 4) OOP spending for specialty cancer drugs. RESULTS: The in-gap discount did not influence specialty cancer drug use, but reduced annual OOP spending for specialty cancer drugs among users without LIS by $1108. CONCLUSIONS: In-gap discounts in Part D decreased patients' financial burden to some extent, but resulted in no change in specialty drug use.

The aim of the study was to describe the inpatient dermatological consultations in a pediatric teaching hospital. POPULATION AND METHODS: Recorded data from inpatient pediatric dermatology consultation requests on a total of 539 consecutive inpatients (aged 0-18 years) from January 2004 to April 2010 were analyzed for consult diagnosis, dermatological disease group, primary diagnosis, requesting department, diagnostic pattern, treatment modality and referral to another department. RESULTS: Of the 539 inpatients, 310 (57.51%) were males and 229 (42.49%) were females. The most frequent requesting department was general pediatrics (37.5%) followed by oncology (15.6%) and pediatric surgery (11.1%). Most of the patients (32.1%) had been hospitalized for dermatological or related disease followed by acute lymphoblastic leukemia (4.1%), chronic renal failure (2.6%), bronchopneumonia (2.6%) and epilepsy (2.4%). Allergic skin diseases (47.1%) were the leading group of dermatoses, which were followed by infectious diseases (14.7%), and systemic diseases with cutaneous manifestations (10.2%). Atopic dermatitis (7.4%) and unclassified eczema (7.4%) were the most frequent dermatoses followed by papular urticaria (5.4%). Most of the patients (80.0%) had diagnosis on clinical basis, whereas skin biopsy was performed in 15.9% and laboratory investigation in 4.1% of the patients.

RESULTS: A novel series of twenty quinazolinone-based rhodanines were synthesized via Knoevenagel condensation between 4-[3-(substitutedphenyl)-3,4-dihydro-4-oxoquinazolin-2-yl)methoxy]substituted-ben zaldehydes and rhodanine. Elemental and spectral analysis were used to confirm structures of the newly synthesized compounds. The newly synthesized compounds were biologically evaluated for in vitro cytotoxic activity against the human fibrosarcoma cell line HT-1080 as a preliminary screen using the MTT assay. CONCLUSIONS: All the target compounds were active, displaying IC50 values roughly in the range of 10-60 microM. Structure-activity relationship study revealed that bulky, hydrophobic, and electron withdrawing substituents at the para-position of the quinazolinone 3-phenyl ring as well as methoxy substitution on the central benzene ring, enhance cytotoxic activity. The four most cytotoxic compounds namely, 45, 43, 47, and 37 were further tested against two human leukemia cell lines namely, HL-60 and K-562 and showed cytotoxic activity in the low micromolar range with compound 45 being the most active, having IC50 values of 1.2 and 1.5 muM, respectively. Interestingly, all four compounds were devoid of cytotoxicity against normal human fibroblasts strain AG01523, indicating that the synthesized rhodanines may be selectively toxic against cancer cells.

Cardiovascular events are a main challenge for patients with MPN and can lead to their death. OBJECTIVE: JAK2V617F mutation is observed in Philadelphia-negative MPNs such as ET and PV, increasing the risk of cardiovascular complications in these patients. JAK2 mutation can affect cardiac arteries and veins in ET and PV, which results in thrombosis, ischemia and other cardiovascular events. JAK/STAT signaling pathway plays an important role in heart diseases. In this review, we will survey the cardiovascular events in JAK2-positive MPN patients. METHOD: Relevant English-language literature were searched and retrieved from PubMed search engine (1995-2017). The following keywords were used: ""Cardiovascular Events"", ""JAK2"" and ""Myeloproliferative Neoplasms"". Forty three articles were selected by using the key words. RESULTS: JAK2 phosphorylates the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT). Various factors like angiotensin II (ANG II) and cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1) can bind their receptors on myocytes and increase the expression of angiotensinogen (Ao) gene by binding of STAT proteins to these factors in myocytes, causing different cardiovascular complications through autocrine mechanisms. CONCLUSION: JAK2 mutation is observed in patients with thrombosis, ischemia and other cardiovascular complications having abnormal increase in cell count even without definite clinical diagnosis of MPN. Therefore, identification of this mutation in these patients contributes to definite diagnosis of cardiovascular events. Also, cardiovascular complications in MPN patients can be prevented by targeting the factors involved in JAK/STAT signaling pathway.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.org.']","['Haybar, Habib', 'Khodadi, Elahe', 'Shahjahani, Mohammad', 'Saki, Najmaldin']","['Haybar H', 'Khodadi E', 'Shahjahani M', 'Saki N']","['Atherosclerosis Research Center, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran.', 'Hematopoeitic Stem Cell Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University, of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Thalassemia & Hemoglobinopathy Research Center, Research Institute of Health, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran.', 'Thalassemia & Hemoglobinopathy Research Center, Research Institute of Health, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Cardiovasc Hematol Disord Drug Targets,Cardiovascular & hematological disorders drug targets,101269160,IM,"['Cardiovascular Diseases/complications/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*genetics/metabolism', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/complications/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Cardiovascular events', '*JAK2', '*hematologic malignancies', '*myelofibrosis', '*myeloproliferative neoplasms', '*platelets.']",2017/11/01 06:00,2019/03/16 06:00,['2017/11/01 06:00'],"['2017/06/28 00:00 [received]', '2017/09/29 00:00 [revised]', '2017/10/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/16 06:00 [medline]', '2017/11/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['CHDDT-EPUB-86583 [pii]', '10.2174/1871529X17666171030122345 [doi]']",ppublish,Cardiovasc Hematol Disord Drug Targets. 2017;17(3):161-166. doi: 10.2174/1871529X17666171030122345.,,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The gp85-coding sequence of ALV-J is known to be prone to mutation, but any association between the gp85 gene and breed of chicken remains unclear. A comprehensive and systematic study of the evolutionary process of ALV-J in China is needed. In this study, we compared and analyzed gp85 gene sequences from 198 ALV-J isolates, originating from China, USA, UK and France during 1989-2016. These were sorted into five clusters. Cluster 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 included isolates from chicken types of different genetic backgrounds, e.g. white-feather broiler, Guangxi indigenous chicken breeds, Yellow chickens and layer chickens respectively. A correlation comparison of amino acid sequence similarities in the gp85 protein among the five clusters showed significant differences (P < 0.01) with the exception being when the third and fifth cluster were compared (P > 0.05). Results of entropy analysis of the gp85 sequences revealed that cluster 3 had the largest variation and cluster 1 had the least variation. The N-glycosylation sites in the majority of isolates numbered 14, 16, 17, 16 and 16, respectively, with regards to clusters 1-5. In addition, 5 isolates from cluster 3 had one more glycosylation site than the other isolates from cluster 3.

In the present study, we showed that z-FA-CMK readily depletes intracellular glutathione (GSH) with a concomitant increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. The toxicity of z-FA-CMK in Jurkat T cells was completely abrogated by N-acetylcysteine (NAC), suggesting that the toxicity mediated by z-FA-CMK is due to oxidative stress. We found that L-buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) which depletes intracellular GSH through the inhibition of GSH biosynthesis in Jurkat T cells did not promote ROS increase or induce cell death. However, NAC was still able to block z-FA-CMK toxicity in Jurkat T cells in the presence of BSO, indicating that the protective effect of NAC does not involve GSH biosynthesis. This is further corroborated by the protective effect of the non-metabolically active D-cysteine on z-FA-CMK toxicity. Furthermore, in BSO-treated cells, z-FA-CMK-induced ROS increased which remains unchanged, suggesting that the depletion of GSH and increase in ROS generation mediated by z-FA-CMK may be two separate events.

Bisulfite sequencing polymerase chain reaction (BSP) was performed to determine the methylation density of cytosine-guanine pair islands in the promoter region of EPHB4, in bone marrow samples from 40 children with ALL. The mRNA and protein expression levels of EPHB4 were detected using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis. A total of 10 children with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) were recruited as controls. The results revealed that the average methylation density of the bone marrow samples from the patients with ALL was significantly higher, compared with the patients with ITP (P=0.046). The relative mRNA expression levels of EPHB4 in the patients with ITP (25.08+/-4.03) and the patients with ALL without methylation (12.33+/-2.16) were significantly higher, compared with that observed in the patients with ALL with methylation (6.48+/-2.73; P<0.01). Pearson analysis revealed a significant negative linear correlation between EPHB4 gene methylation and its expression levels (r=-0.957; P<0.01). Western blot analysis indicated that EPHB4 protein expression levels were low in the methylated ALL samples. An evaluation of the two-year disease-free survival (DFS) of the patients with ALL was performed, which revealed that the patients with unmethylated ALL exhibited a significantly higher two-year DFS rate, as compared with patients with methylated ALL (P=0.036). These results suggest that the methylation of the EPHB4 gene is prevalent in childhood ALL and may result in expressional inactivation, which consequently promotes ALL pathogenesis and is associated with an unfavorable prognosis.

METHODS: Patients were divided into UI and control groups. Endometrium samples were collected at the midluteal phase. Levels of cannabinoid type 1 (CB1), fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), and LIF were examined. LIF productions were measured after AEA, CB1 antagonist AM251, and CB2 antagonist AM630 stimulation. RESULTS: Rates of available embryo, successful implantation and pregnancy, and the endometrial thickness of UI group were significantly lower than control, suggesting uterine receptivity was decreased in UI group. FAAH and LIF levels were significantly decreased, whereas endometrial CB1 was slightly increased in UI group. LIF production was promoted by low amount of AEA administration (1-10 muM), while the promotion was reduced by higher concentration of AEA (50 muM). LIF levels were decreased by AM251 or AM630, compared with AEA alone. Expressions of FAAH and LIF were closely associated with uterus receptivity and implantation rate of UI patients. Different concentrations of AEA could stimulate dynamic changes in LIF production.

Human ASNS activity is highly responsive to cellular stress, primarily by increased transcription from a single gene located on chromosome 7. Elevated ASNS protein expression is associated with resistance to asparaginase therapy in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. There is evidence that ASNS expression levels may also be inversely correlated with asparaginase efficacy in certain solid tumors as well. Children with mutations in the ASNS gene exhibit developmental delays, intellectual disability, microcephaly, intractable seizures, and progressive brain atrophy. Thus far, 15 unique mutations in the ASNS gene have been clinically associated with asparagine synthetase deficiency (ASD).

This was the first time ALV-J had been seen in the UK since its eradicationand the case highlights the importance of continued surveillance of backyard and hobby chickens to detect potential new and re-emerging disease threats, such as ALV-J, which may be of significance to the wider poultry population.","['(c) British Veterinary Association (unless otherwise stated in the text of the', 'article) 2018.

These translocations result in oncogenic fusions that mediate aberrant recruitment of the transcription machinery to MLL target genes. The N-terminus of MLL and MLL-fusions form a complex with lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF/p75; encoded by the PSIP1 gene) and MENIN. This complex contributes to the association of MLL and MLL-fusion multiprotein complexes with the chromatin. Several studies have shown that both MENIN and LEDGF/p75 are required for efficient MLL-fusion-mediated transformation and for the expression of downstream MLL-regulated genes such as HOXA9 and MEIS1 In light of developing a therapeutic strategy targeting this complex, understanding the function of LEDGF/p75 in normal hematopoiesis is crucial. We generated a conditional Psip1 knockout mouse model in the hematopoietic compartment and examined the effects of LEDGF/p75 depletion in postnatal hematopoiesis and the initiation of MLL leukemogenesis. Psip1 knockout mice were viable but showed several defects in hematopoiesis, reduced colony-forming activity in vitro, decreased expression of Hox genes in the hematopoietic stem cells, and decreased MLL occupancy at MLL target genes. Finally, in vitro and in vivo experiments showed that LEDGF/p75 is dispensable for steady-state hematopoiesis but essential for the initiation of MLL-mediated leukemia. These data corroborate the MLL-LEDGF/p75 interaction as novel target for the treatment of MLL-rearranged leukemia.",['(c) 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['El Ashkar, Sara', 'Schwaller, Juerg', 'Pieters, Tim', 'Goossens, Steven', 'Demeulemeester, Jonas', 'Christ, Frauke', 'Van Belle, Siska', 'Juge, Sabine', 'Boeckx, Nancy', 'Engelman, Alan', 'Van Vlierberghe, Pieter', 'Debyser, Zeger', 'De Rijck, Jan']","['El Ashkar S', 'Schwaller J', 'Pieters T', 'Goossens S', 'Demeulemeester J', 'Christ F', 'Van Belle S', 'Juge S', 'Boeckx N', 'Engelman A', 'Van Vlierberghe P', 'Debyser Z', 'De Rijck J']","['Laboratory for Molecular Virology and Gene Therapy, Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences, Katholieke Universiteit (KU) Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', ""Department of Biomedicine, University Children's Hospital (UKBB), University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland."", 'Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent (CRIG), Ghent, Belgium.', 'Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent (CRIG), Ghent, Belgium.', 'Laboratory for Molecular Virology and Gene Therapy, Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences, Katholieke Universiteit (KU) Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Laboratory for Molecular Virology and Gene Therapy, Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences, Katholieke Universiteit (KU) Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Laboratory for Molecular Virology and Gene Therapy, Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences, Katholieke Universiteit (KU) Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', ""Department of Biomedicine, University Children's Hospital (UKBB), University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland."", 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University Hospital Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Oncology, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; and.', 'Department of Cancer Immunology and AIDS, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.', 'Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent (CRIG), Ghent, Belgium.', 'Laboratory for Molecular Virology and Gene Therapy, Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences, Katholieke Universiteit (KU) Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Laboratory for Molecular Virology and Gene Therapy, Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences, Katholieke Universiteit (KU) Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171030,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/physiology', 'Animals', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Transcription Factors/physiology']",,,2017/11/01 06:00,2018/10/13 06:00,['2017/11/01 06:00'],"['2017/05/26 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/13 06:00 [medline]', '2017/11/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)32588-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2017-05-786962 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2018 Jan 4;131(1):95-107. doi: 10.1182/blood-2017-05-786962.

Histone deacetylases (HDACs) modulate acetylation of lysine residues, a protein modification important for regulation of numerous biological processes. Here, we show that Hdac8 is most highly expressed in the phenotypic LT-HSC population within the adult hematopoietic hierarchy. Using an Hdac8-floxed allele and a dual-fluorescence Cre reporter allele, largely normal hematopoietic differentiation capacity of Hdac8-deficient cells was observed. However, the frequency of phenotypic LT-HSC population was significantly higher shortly after Hdac8 deletion, and the expansion had shifted to the phenotypic multipotent progenitor population by 1 year. We show that Hdac8-deficient hematopoietic progenitors are compromised in colony-forming cell serial replating in vitro and long-term serial repopulating activity in vivo. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that the HDAC8 protein interacts with the p53 protein and modulates p53 activity via deacetylation. Hdac8-deficient LT-HSCs displayed hyperactivation of p53 and increased apoptosis under genotoxic and hematopoietic stress. Genetic inactivation of p53 reversed the increased apoptosis and elevated expression of proapoptotic targets Noxa and Puma seen in Hdac8-deleted LT-HSCs. Dramatically compromised hematopoietic recovery and increased lethality were seen in Hdac8-deficient mice challenged with serial 5-fluorouracil treatment. This hypersensitivity to hematopoietic ablation was completely rescued by inactivation of p53. Altogether, these results indicate that HDAC8 functions to modulate p53 activity to ensure LT-HSC maintenance and cell survival under stress.",['(c) 2017 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Hua, Wei-Kai', 'Qi, Jing', 'Cai, Qi', 'Carnahan, Emily', 'Ayala Ramirez, Maria', 'Li, Ling', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Kuo, Ya-Huei']","['Hua WK', 'Qi J', 'Cai Q', 'Carnahan E', 'Ayala Ramirez M', 'Li L', 'Marcucci G', 'Kuo YH']","['Department of Hematological Malignancies Translational Science, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematologic Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA.', 'Department of Hematological Malignancies Translational Science, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematologic Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA.', 'Department of Hematological Malignancies Translational Science, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematologic Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA.', 'Department of Hematological Malignancies Translational Science, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematologic Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA.', 'Department of Hematological Malignancies Translational Science, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematologic Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA.', 'Department of Hematological Malignancies Translational Science, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematologic Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA.', 'Department of Hematological Malignancies Translational Science, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematologic Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA.', 'Department of Hematological Malignancies Translational Science, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematologic Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171030,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Acetylation', 'Animals', 'Antimetabolites/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics', 'Fluorouracil/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Histone Deacetylases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Stress, Physiological/genetics', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics/metabolism']",,,2017/11/01 06:00,2017/12/28 06:00,['2017/11/01 06:00'],"['2017/03/06 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/28 06:00 [medline]', '2017/11/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)32642-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2017-03-771386 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2017 Dec 14;130(24):2619-2630. doi: 10.1182/blood-2017-03-771386.

However, it is still poorly understood how these alterations affect clinical features and prognosis. We investigated the effects of genetic alterations commonly found in ATL on disease phenotypes and clinical outcomes, based on genotyping data obtained from 414 and 463 ATL patients using targeted-capture sequencing and single nucleotide polymorphism array karyotyping, respectively. Aggressive (acute/lymphoma) subtypes were associated with an increased burden of genetic and epigenetic alterations, higher frequencies of TP53 and IRF4 mutations, and many copy number alterations (CNAs), including PD-L1 amplifications and CDKN2A deletions, compared with indolent (chronic/smoldering) subtypes. By contrast, STAT3 mutations were more characteristic of indolent ATL. Higher numbers of somatic mutations and CNAs significantly correlated with worse survival. In a multivariate analysis incorporating both clinical factors and genetic alterations, the Japan Clinical Oncology Group prognostic index high-risk, older age, PRKCB mutations, and PD-L1 amplifications were independent poor prognostic factors in aggressive ATL. In indolent ATL, IRF4 mutations, PD-L1 amplifications, and CDKN2A deletions were significantly associated with shorter survival, although the chronic subtype with unfavorable clinical factors was only marginally significant. Thus, somatic alterations characterizing aggressive diseases predict worse prognosis in indolent ATL, among which PD-L1 amplifications are a strong genetic predictor in both aggressive and indolent ATL. ATL subtypes are further classified into molecularly distinct subsets with different prognosis. Genetic profiling might contribute to improved prognostication and management of ATL patients.",['(c) 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Kataoka, Keisuke', 'Iwanaga, Masako', 'Yasunaga,

ALL accounts for approximately 2 percent of the lymphoid neoplasms diagnosed in the United States. Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia occurs slightly more frequently in males than females, and three times as frequently in Whites as in Blacks. Patients with Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia typically present with symptoms related to anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia due to the replacement of the bone marrow with the tumor. Symptoms can include fatigue, easy or spontaneous bruising/bleeding, and infections. B-symptoms, such as fever, night sweats, and unintentional weight loss are often present but may be mild. Hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy can be seen in up to half of adults on presentation.

As shown in our previous studies, Tag7 specifically interacts with the major heat shock protein Hsp70 to form a stable Tag7-Hsp70 complex with cytotoxic activity against tumor cells. A stable complex of Tag7 with the calcium-binding protein Mts1 (S100A4) stimulates migration of lymphocytes. Moreover, Tag7 can activate cytotoxic lymphocytes that recognize and kill HLA-negative tumor cells. Here, we have shown that Tag 7 treatment of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) results in activation of different cytotoxic lymphocyte populations-natural killer (NK) cells and CD8(+) NKG2D(+) T lymphocytes-that kill Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) infected SC-1 cells using different mechanisms of cell death induction. This mechanism in NK cells is based on the release of granzymes, which activate apoptosis in target cells, while CD8(+) NKG2D(+) T lymphocytes recognize the noncanonical MicA antigen on the surface of virus-containing cells and kill them via the FasL-Fas interaction, triggering the apoptotic or necroptotic cell death pathway. Preliminary incubation of PBMCs with virus-infected cells and following incubation with Tag7 results in activation of lymphocytes with a different phenotype. These lymphocytes change the spectrum of target cells and the mechanism of cell death induction, and their interaction with target cells is not species-specific.

Thus, our study provides proof of concept that PU.1 inhibition has potential as a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of AML and for the development of small-molecule inhibitors of PU.1.",,"['Antony-Debre, Ileana', 'Paul, Ananya', 'Leite, Joana', 'Mitchell, Kelly', 'Kim, Hye Mi', 'Carvajal, Luis A', 'Todorova, Tihomira I', 'Huang, Kenneth', 'Kumar, Arvind', 'Farahat, Abdelbasset A', 'Bartholdy, Boris', 'Narayanagari, Swathi-Rao', 'Chen, Jiahao', 'Ambesi-Impiombato, Alberto', 'Ferrando, Adolfo A', 'Mantzaris, Ioannis', 'Gavathiotis, Evripidis', 'Verma, Amit', 'Will, Britta', 'Boykin, David W', 'Wilson, W David', 'Poon, Gregory Mk', 'Steidl, Ulrich']","['Antony-Debre I', 'Paul A', 'Leite J', 'Mitchell K', 'Kim HM', 'Carvajal LA', 'Todorova TI', 'Huang K', 'Kumar A', 'Farahat AA', 'Bartholdy B', 'Narayanagari SR', 'Chen J', 'Ambesi-Impiombato A', 'Ferrando AA', 'Mantzaris I', 'Gavathiotis E', 'Verma A', 'Will B', 'Boykin DW', 'Wilson WD', 'Poon GM', 'Steidl U']","['Department of Cell Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Organic Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, New York, USA.', 'Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA.', 'Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Medicine (Oncology), Division of Hemato-Oncology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine-Montefiore Medical Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry.', 'Albert Einstein Cancer Center, and.', 'Ruth L. and David S.

Expert commentary: Blinatumomab has demonstrated encouraging response rates in MRD-positive and R/R in adults with Philadelphia chromosome-positive and -negative ALL, as well as in children with R/R ALL. Blinatumomab has a favorable safety profile, although reversible CNS events and cytokine release syndrome can occur.

The addition of a monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody to Chl substantially increases response rates and prolongs progression-free survival (PFS) in these patients, without increasing toxicity. As a result, the ESMO guidelines recommend that previously untreated CLL patients with relevant co-morbidity, but without TP53 deletion/mutation, should be treated with the combination of Chl plus an anti-CD20 antibody (rituximab, ofatumumab or obinutuzumab). Areas covered: This review focuses on the treatment approach of elderly and unfit patients with untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Expert commentary: The addition of a monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody to Chl is currently the suggested treatment in this subset of CLL patients. The choice of the anti-CD20 antibody remains an open question, although obinutuzumab was found to be superior to rituximab, in a head-to-head comparison of Chl-based combinations, in untreated CLL patients with comorbidities, with higher progression free survival, complete remission rates and minimal residual disease-negative remissions.

However, the mechanism that underlies the sexual differentiation of song nuclei is still not well understood. Using a combination of anatomical, pharmacological, genetic, and behavioral approaches, the present study investigated the role of erbb2 (a homolog of the avian erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2) and the erbb2-interacting gene, erbin, in the sexual differentiation of the song nucleus HVC in the Bengalese finch. We first found that both erbin and erbb2 were expressed in the developing HVC at posthatch day (PHD) 15 in a male-biased fashion using qRT-PCR and in situ hybridization. Following the addition of a pharmaceutical inhibitor of the ErbB2 signaling pathway to the culture medium, cell proliferation in the cultured ventricle zone (VZ) that overlies the developing HVC decreased significantly. After the injection of erbin- or erbb2-interfering lentiviruses into the HVC and its overlying VZ at PHD 15, the cell proliferation in the VZ at PHD 24, the number of the differentiated neurons (Hu(+) /BrdU(+) or NeuN(+) /BrdU(+) ) in the HVC at PHD 31 or PHD 130, and the number of RA-projecting cells at PHD 130 all decreased significantly. Additionally, the adult songs displayed serious abnormalities. Finally, 173 male-biased genes were expressed in the developing HVC at PHD 15 using cDNA microarrays, of which 27.2% were Z-linked genes and approximately 20 genes were involved in the Erbin- or ErbB2-related signaling pathways. Our results provide some specific genetic factors that contribute to neurogenesis and sex differentiation in a song nucleus of songbirds. (c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The majority of them are generated through chromosomal rearrangement or abnormal transcription. With the development of techniques, high-throughput sequencing method makes it possible to detect fusion genes systematically in multiple human cancers. Owing to their biological significance and tumor-specific expression, some of the fusion genes are attractive diagnostic tools and therapeutic targets. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) targeting BCR-ABL1 fusions have been widely used to treat CML. The combination of ATRA and ATO targeting PML-RARA fusions has proven to be effective in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Moreover, therapy with high dose cytarabine (HDAC) has significantly improved the prognosis of core binding factor (CBF) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. Therefore, studies on fusion genes may benefit patients with leukemia by providing more diagnostic markers and therapies in the future. CONCLUSION: The presented review focuses on the history of fusion genes, mechanisms of formation, and treatments against specific fusion genes in leukemia.",,"['Wang, Yuhui', 'Wu, Nan', 'Liu, Duo', 'Jin, Yan']","['Wang Y', 'Wu N', 'Liu D', 'Jin Y']","['Laboratory of Medical Genetics, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, Heilongjiang, P.R.

Methods: From January 2013 to August 2016, data of CML-CP patients in Peking University People's Hospital which were not enrolled in clinical trials were retrospectively collected and analyzed. Results: Data of 662 CML-CP patients were collected. With a median follow-up after TKI-therapy of 26 months (range, 3-187 months) , 187 patients (28.2%) experienced TKI cessation of at least 2 weeks. Causes of TKI discontinuation included hematologic adverse events 57.8% (n=108) , non-hematologic adverse events 30.4% (n=57) , financial burden 25.1% (n=47) , and others 7.0% (n= 13) . Multivariate analyses showed female, >/=40 years, no co-morbidity, and interval from diagnosis to TKI initiation >/=6 months, TKI switch and patients from other hospitals were factors associated with TKI discontinuation because of hematologic adverse effects. Female and patients from other hospitals were factors associated with TKI discontinuation because of non-hematologic adverse effect. TKI switch, generic TKI used and patients from other hospitals were factors associated with TKI discontinuation because of financial toxicity. Patients TKI discontinuation because of hematologic, non-hematologic or financial toxicity achieved a lower complete cytogenetic response or complete molecular response (CMR) than those with uninterrupted TKI-therapy. Patients with TKI discontinuation because of hematologic or financial toxicity had a shorter progression-free survival than those with uninterrupted TKI-therapy. 5 of 7 patients who obtained sustained CMR and discontinued TKI-therapy experienced disease recurrence with a median duration of 3 months (range, 2-32 months) . In 39 patients from other hospitals who aimed to confirm their optimal response of sustained CMR in Peking University People's Hospital, 21 (53.8%) were BCR-ABL positive. Conclusion: In the real world in China, half of CML-CP patients who discontinued TKI-therapy were incurred to TKI-related hematologic adverse effect, and both a quarter of them, TKI-related non-hematologic toxicities and financial toxicity, respectively. Discontinued TKI-therapy due to hematologic adverse events or financial toxicity was associated with lower TKI-therapy response rates.

In non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, islet inflammation starts early in life, suggesting the presence of an endogenous trigger for the spontaneous autoimmune response in this T1D mouse model. In this review, we argue that abnormal release of exosomes might be the trigger of the early inflammatory and autoimmune responses in the islets. RECENT FINDINGS: Exosomes are nano-sized membrane complexes that are secreted by cells following fusion of late endosomes and/or multivesicular bodies with the plasma membrane. They are known extracellular messengers, communicating among neighboring cells via transporting large molecules from parent cells to recipient cells. Recent evidence demonstrates that these extracellular vesicles can modulate immune responses. It has been shown that insulinoma and islet mesenchymal stem cell-released exosomes are potent immune stimuli that can induce autoreactive B and T cells. Searching for candidate antigens in the exosomes identified endogenous retrovirus (ERV) Env and Gag antigens, which are homologous to an endogenous murine leukemia retrovirus. Autoantibodies and autoreactive T cells spontaneously developed in NOD mice can react to these retroviral antigens. More importantly, expression of the retroviral antigens in the islet mesenchymal stem cells is associated with disease susceptibility, and the expression is restricted to T1D-susceptible but not resistant mouse strains. Exosomes are novel autoimmune targets, carrying autoantigens that can stimulate innate and adaptive immune responses. An abnormal or excess release of exosomes, particularly those ones containing endogenous retroviral antigens might be responsible for triggering tissue-specific inflammatory and autoimmune responses.",,"['Dai, Yang D', 'Sheng, Huiming', 'Dias, Peter', 'Jubayer Rahman, M', 'Bashratyan, Roman', 'Regn, Danielle', 'Marquardt, Kristi']","['Dai YD', 'Sheng H', 'Dias P', 'Jubayer Rahman M', 'Bashratyan R', 'Regn D', 'Marquardt K']","['Department of Immunology and Microbial Science, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA, USA. ydai@scripps.edu.', 'Biomedical Research Institute of Southern California, San Diego, CA, USA. ydai@scripps.edu.', 'Torrey Pines Institute for Molecular Studies, San Diego, CA, USA.', 'Tongren Hospital Affiliated to SJTU, School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Biomedical Research Institute of Southern California, San Diego, CA, USA.', 'Torrey Pines Institute for Molecular Studies, San Diego, CA, USA.', 'Department of Immunology and Microbial Science, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Department of Immunology and Microbial Science, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Department of Immunology and Microbial Science, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20171028,United States,Curr Diab Rep,Current diabetes reports,101093791,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens/*immunology', '*Autoimmunity', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/*immunology', 'Exosomes/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",['NOTNLM'],"['Endogenous retrovirus', 'Exosomes', 'Extracellular vesicles', 'NOD mice', 'Type 1 diabetes']",2017/10/31 06:00,2018/02/10 06:00,['2017/10/30 06:00'],"['2017/10/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11892-017-0962-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s11892-017-0962-4 [pii]']",epublish,Curr Diab Rep. 2017 Oct 28;17(12):130. doi: 10.1007/s11892-017-0962-4.,,['0 (Antigens)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The improved outcomes of AML can largely be attributed to advances in supportive care and hematopoietic cell transplantation as opposed to conventional chemotherapy. However, as the 5-year survival rate remains low due to a high incidence of relapse, novel and effective treatments are urgently needed. Increasing attention is focusing on identifying suitable immunotherapeutic strategies for AML. Here, we describe the immunological features, mechanisms of immune escape, and recent progress in immunotherapy for AML. Problems encountered in the clinic will also be discussed. Although current outcomes may be limited, ongoing preclinical or clinical efforts are aimed at improving immunotherapy modalities and designing novel therapies, such as vaccines, monoclonal antibody therapy, chimeric antibody receptor-engineered T cells (CAR-T), TCR-engineered T cells (TCR-T), and checkpoint inhibitors, which may provide promising and effective therapies with higher specificity and efficacy for AML.",,"['Yang, Dan', 'Zhang, Xiuqun', 'Zhang, Xuezhong', 'Xu, Yanli']","['Yang D', 'Zhang X', 'Zhang X', 'Xu Y']","[""Department of Hematology, Nanjing First Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, 68 Changle Road, Nanjing, 210006, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Nanjing First Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, 68 Changle Road, Nanjing, 210006, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Nanjing First Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, 68 Changle Road, Nanjing, 210006, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Nanjing First Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, 68 Changle Road, Nanjing, 210006, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China. xuyanli62@sohu.com.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20171028,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/therapeutic use', 'Cancer Vaccines/therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods/trends', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/mortality/*therapy', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics/immunology', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/transplantation']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'CAR-T', 'Checkpoint inhibitors', 'Immunotherapy', 'Natural killer cell', 'Vaccines']",2017/10/31 06:00,2017/12/01 06:00,['2017/10/30 06:00'],"['2017/06/19 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/01 06:00 [medline]', '2017/10/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-017-3148-x [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-017-3148-x [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2017 Dec;96(12):1965-1982. doi: 10.1007/s00277-017-3148-x.

In this study we investigated association of HLA-A,-B and-DRB1 alleles with overall survival (OS) in 186 patients undergoing allo-HSCT for lymphoid malignancies. Analyses confirmed significantly better OS for HLA-DRB1 *04 carriers compared with non-carriers (p=0.01). Survival benefit was confined to male patients (in multivariate analyses p=0.034, hazard ratio 0.35, 95% confidence interval 0.13-0.92), whereas in females no difference was noted (p=0.82). Furthermore, donor gender also affected outcome and transplantation from female HLA-DRB1 *04 carrier donors resulted in superior survival compared with female non-carrier donors (p=0.01). Combined analyses including recipient/donor gender and HLA-DRB1 *04 showed that survival of male patients varied significantly according to donor gender and HLA-DRB1 *04 carriership (p=0.04) with best survival among HLA-DRB1 *04 carriers transplanted from female donors. Of relevance to our results, HLA-DRB1 *04 has been documented as risk allele group for lymphoid malignancies, and studies described a male-specific risk. We believe that our findings provide further supporting evidence for sex-specific alterations secondary to HLA-DRB1 *04 or related genes. Further studies are warranted to evaluate whether in contrast to general favour of male donors HLA-DRB1 *04 carrier patients with lymphoid malignancies could benefit from transplantation from female donors.","['Copyright (c) 2017 American Society for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

CONCLUSIONS: This case demonstrates that, although pericarditis induced by cytarabine is rare, early recognition of this potentially life-threatening complication and appropriate management will usually result in the patient's recovery.",,"['Yang, Xia', 'Liu, Wei', 'Lyons, Allie', 'Song, Zaiwei', 'Zhai, Suodi', 'Hu, Kai']","['Yang X', 'Liu W', 'Lyons A', 'Song Z', 'Zhai S', 'Hu K']","['Department of Pharmacy, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'Therapeutic Drug Monitoring and Clinical Toxicology Center, Peking University, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'College of Pharmacy, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, 40506, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'Therapeutic Drug Monitoring and Clinical Toxicology Center, Peking University, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, 100191, China. xiaohu7079@sina.com.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20171027,Germany,Eur J Clin Pharmacol,European journal of clinical pharmacology,1256165,IM,"['Adult', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/adverse effects', 'Cytarabine/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Pericarditis/*chemically induced']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Cytarabine', 'Pericarditis']",2017/10/29 06:00,2018/08/14 06:00,['2017/10/29 06:00'],"['2017/08/26 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/14 06:00 [medline]', '2017/10/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00228-017-2355-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s00228-017-2355-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Eur J Clin Pharmacol. 2018 Feb;74(2):181-182. doi: 10.1007/s00228-017-2355-7.

On the other hand, the induction of telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) and the activation of telomerase is a key step in AML development. Here, we sought to determine whether FLT3ITD regulates hTERT expression in AML cells and whether hTERT expression affects FLT3 inhibitors' therapeutic efficacy on AML. FLT3ITD-harboring AML cell lines and primary cells treated with the FLT3 inhibitor PKC412 displayed a rapid decline in the levels of hTERT mRNA and telomerase activity. Moreover, PKC412 inhibited hTERT gene transcription in a c-MYC-dependent manner. The ectopic expression of hTERT significantly attenuated the apoptotic effect of PKC412 on AML cells. Mechanistically, hTERT enhanced the activity of FLT3 downstream effectors or alternative RTK signaling, thereby enhancing AKT phosphorylation, in AML cells treated with PKC412. Collectively, PKC412 downregulates hTERT expression and telomerase activity in a MYC-dependent manner and this effect is required for its optimal anti-AML efficacy, while hTERT over-expression confers AML cells resistance to a targeted therapeutic agent PKC412. These findings suggest that the functional interplay between FLT3ITD and hTERT contributes to the AML pathogenesis and interferes with the efficacy of FLT3ITD-targeted therapy.",,"['Zhang, Xiaolu', 'Li, Bingnan', 'Yu, Jingya', 'Dahlstrom, Jenny', 'Tran, Anh Nhi', 'Bjorkholm, Magnus', 'Xu, Dawei']","['Zhang X', 'Li B', 'Yu J', 'Dahlstrom J', 'Tran AN', 'Bjorkholm M', 'Xu D']","['Center for Hematology, Department of Medicine and Center for Molecular Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital Solna and Karolinska Institutet, SE-171 76, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Center for Hematology, Department of Medicine and Center for Molecular Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital Solna and Karolinska Institutet, SE-171 76, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Center for Hematology, Department of Medicine and Center for Molecular Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital Solna and Karolinska Institutet, SE-171 76, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Center for Hematology, Department of Medicine and Center for Molecular Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital Solna and Karolinska Institutet, SE-171 76, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Karolinska University Hospital and Karolinska Institutet, SE-171 76, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Center for Hematology, Department of Medicine and Center for Molecular Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital Solna and Karolinska Institutet, SE-171 76, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Center for Hematology, Department of Medicine and Center for Molecular Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital Solna and Karolinska Institutet, SE-171 76, Stockholm, Sweden.

The primary objectives were safety and pregnancy outcomes. Of 3721 registered patients, 3649 received cytoreductive therapy. At registration, 3611 were receiving: anagrelide (Xagrid((R))) (n=804), other cytoreductive therapy (n=2666), or anagrelide + other cytoreductive therapy (n=141). The median age was 56 vs. 70 years for anagrelide vs. other cytoreductive therapy. Event rates (patients with events/100 patient-years) were 1.62 vs. 2.06 for total thrombosis and 0.15 vs. 0.53 for venous thrombosis. Anagrelide was more commonly associated with hemorrhage (0.89 vs. 0.43), especially with anti-aggregatory therapy (1.35 vs. 0.33) and myelofibrosis (1.04 vs. 0.30). Other cytoreductive therapies were more associated with acute leukemia (0.28 vs. 0.07) and other malignancies (1.29 vs. 0.44). Post hoc multivariate analyses identified increased risk for thrombosis with prior thrombohemorrhagic events, age >/=65, cardiovascular risk factors, or hypertension. Risk factors for transformation were prior thrombohemorrhagic events, age >/=65, time since diagnosis, and platelet count increase.

We detected MRD by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) of rearranged immunoglobulin/T-cell receptor genes (IG/TR) and/or BCR/ABL1 fusion transcript to investigate its predictive value in patients receiving Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM) high-risk (HR) therapy and post-induction intermittent imatinib (the European intergroup study of post-induction treatment of Philadelphia-chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (EsPhALL) study). MRD was monitored after induction (time point (TP)1), consolidation Phase IB (TP2), HR Blocks, reinductions, and at the end of therapy. MRD negativity progressively increased over time, both by IG/TR and BCR/ABL1. Of 90 patients with IG/TR MRD at TP1, nine were negative and none relapsed, while 11 with MRD<5x10(-4) and 70 with MRD>/=5x10(-4) had a comparable 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse of 36.4 (15.4) and 35.2 (5.9), respectively. Patients who achieved MRD negativity at TP2 had a low relapse risk (5-yr cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR)=14.3[9.8]), whereas those who attained MRD negativity at a later date showed higher CIR, comparable to patients with positive MRD at any level. BCR/ABL1 MRD negative patients at TP1 had a relapse risk similar to those who were IG/TR MRD negative (1/8 relapses). The overall concordance between the two methods is 69%, with significantly higher positivity by BCR/ABL1. In conclusion, MRD monitoring by both methods may be functional not only for measuring response but also for guiding biological studies aimed at investigating causes for discrepancies, although from our data IG/TR MRD monitoring appears to be more reliable. Early MRD negativity is highly predictive of favorable outcome. The earlier MRD negativity is achieved, the better the prognosis.",['Copyright(c) 2018 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],"['Cazzaniga, Giovanni', 'De Lorenzo, Paola', 'Alten, Julia', 'Rottgers, Silja', 'Hancock, Jeremy', 'Saha, Vaskar', 'Castor, Anders', 'Madsen, Hans O', 'Gandemer, Virginie', 'Cave, Helene', 'Leoni, Veronica', 'Kohler, Rolf', 'Ferrari, Giulia M', 'Bleckmann, Kirsten', 'Pieters, Rob', 'van der Velden, Vincent', 'Stary, Jan', 'Zuna, Jan', 'Escherich, Gabriele', 'Stadt, Udo Zur', 'Arico, Maurizio', 'Conter, Valentino', 'Schrappe, Martin', 'Valsecchi, Maria Grazia', 'Biondi, Andrea']","['Cazzaniga G', 'De Lorenzo P', 'Alten J', 'Rottgers S', 'Hancock J', 'Saha V', 'Castor A', 'Madsen HO', 'Gandemer V', 'Cave H', 'Leoni V', 'Kohler R', 'Ferrari GM', 'Bleckmann K', 'Pieters R', 'van der Velden V', 'Stary J', 'Zuna J', 'Escherich G', 'Stadt UZ', 'Arico M', 'Conter V', 'Schrappe M', 'Valsecchi MG', 'Biondi A']","['Associazione Italiana Ematologia Oncologia Pediatrica (AIEOP), Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, Pediatric Department, University of Milano-Bicocca, Monza, Italy gianni.cazzaniga@hsgerardo.org.', 'Associazione Italiana Ematologia Oncologia Pediatrica (AIEOP), Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, Pediatric Department, University of Milano-Bicocca, Monza, Italy.', 'European intergroup study of post-induction treatment of Philadelphia-chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (EsPhALL) Trial Data Center, School of Medicine and Surgery, University of Milano-Bicocca, Monza, Italy.', 'Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster Group Germany (BFM-G), Germany and Switzerland.', 'Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster Group Germany (BFM-G), Germany and Switzerland.', ""Children's Cancer and Leukaemia Group (CCLG), UK."", ""Children's Cancer and Leukaemia Group (CCLG), UK."", 'Nordic Society of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology (NOPHO), Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland and Iceland.', 'Nordic Society of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology (NOPHO), Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland and Iceland.', 'French Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Study Groups (French Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Study Group, FRALLE and European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer, EORTC), Italy.', 'French Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Study Groups (French Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Study Group, FRALLE and European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer, EORTC), Italy.', 'Associazione Italiana Ematologia Oncologia Pediatrica (AIEOP), Pediatric Department, University of Milano-Bicocca, Fondazione MBBM, Monza, Italy.', 'Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster Group Germany (BFM-G), Germany and Switzerland.', 'Associazione Italiana Ematologia Oncologia Pediatrica (AIEOP), Pediatric Department, University of Milano-Bicocca, Fondazione MBBM, Monza, Italy.', 'Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster Group Germany (BFM-G), Germany and Switzerland.', 'Dutch Childhood Oncology Group (DCOG), the Netherlands.', 'Dutch Childhood Oncology Group (DCOG), the Netherlands.', 'Czech Pediatric Hematology Working Group (CPH), Czech Republic.', 'Czech Pediatric Hematology Working Group (CPH), Czech Republic.', 'Cooperative study group for treatment of ALL (COALL), Germany.', 'Cooperative study group for treatment of ALL (COALL), Germany.', 'Associazione Italiana Ematologia Oncologia Pediatrica (AIEOP), Azienda Sanitaria Provinciale, Ragusa, Italy.', 'Associazione Italiana Ematologia Oncologia Pediatrica (AIEOP), Pediatric Department, University of Milano-Bicocca, Fondazione MBBM, Monza, Italy.', 'Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster Group Germany (BFM-G), Germany and Switzerland.', 'European intergroup study of post-induction treatment of Philadelphia-chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (EsPhALL) Trial Data Center, School of Medicine and Surgery, University of Milano-Bicocca, Monza, Italy.', 'Associazione Italiana Ematologia Oncologia Pediatrica (AIEOP), Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, Pediatric Department, University of Milano-Bicocca, Monza, Italy.', 'Associazione Italiana Ematologia Oncologia Pediatrica (AIEOP), Pediatric Department, University of Milano-Bicocca, Fondazione MBBM, Monza, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20171027,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,"['Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/therapeutic use', 'Immunoglobulins/*genetics', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2017/10/29 06:00,2019/07/25 06:00,['2017/10/29 06:00'],"['2017/07/19 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/25 06:00 [medline]', '2017/10/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2017.176917 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2017.176917 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2018 Jan;103(1):107-115. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2017.176917.

However, in patients with cancer, both signals are frequently impaired. Hence, we developed a novel strategy that combines both essential signals in 1 transgene by expressing the nonlymphoid hematopoietic growth factor receptor c-MPL (myeloproliferative leukemia), the receptor for thrombopoietin (TPO), in T cells. c-MPL signaling activates pathways shared with conventional costimulatory and cytokine receptor signaling. Thus, we hypothesized that host-derived TPO, present in the tumor microenvironment, or pharmacological c-MPL agonists approved by the US Food and Drug Administration could deliver both signals to c-MPL-engineered TCR-transgenic T cells. We found that c-MPL(+) polyclonal T cells expand and proliferate in response to TPO, and persist longer after adoptive transfer in immunodeficient human TPO-transgenic mice. In TCR-transgenic T cells, c-MPL activation enhances antitumor function, T-cell expansion, and cytokine production and preserves a central memory phenotype. c-MPL signaling also enables sequential tumor cell killing, enhances the formation of effective immune synapses, and improves antileukemic activity in vivo in a leukemia xenograft model. We identify the type 1 interferon pathway as a molecular mechanism by which c-MPL mediates immune stimulation in T cells. In conclusion, we present a novel immunotherapeutic strategy using c-MPL-enhanced transgenic T cells responding to either endogenously produced TPO (a microenvironment factor in hematologic malignancies) or c-MPL-targeted pharmacological agents.",['(c) 2017 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Nishimura, Christopher D', 'Brenner, Daniel A', 'Mukherjee, Malini', 'Hirsch, Rachel A', 'Ott, Leah', 'Wu, Meng-Fen', 'Liu, Hao', 'Dakhova, Olga', 'Orange, Jordan S', 'Brenner, Malcolm K', 'Lin, Charles Y', 'Arber, Caroline']","['Nishimura CD', 'Brenner DA', 'Mukherjee M', 'Hirsch RA', 'Ott L', 'Wu MF', 'Liu H', 'Dakhova O', 'Orange JS', 'Brenner MK', 'Lin CY', 'Arber C']","[""Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston Methodist Hospital and Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX; and."", ""Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston Methodist Hospital and Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX; and."", 'Center for Human Immunobiology.', ""Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston Methodist Hospital and Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX; and."", 'Center for Human Immunobiology.', 'Department of Molecular and Human Genetics.', ""Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston Methodist Hospital and Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX; and."", 'Department of Biostatistics, Dan L.

The ANS gene in Pseudomonas fluorescens MTCC 8127 which produces l-asparaginase was cloned and expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3). The expressed recombinant protein (PfAns) which was purified, showed l-asparaginase activity. The enzyme was further characterized. The pH and temperature optima were found to be 7.5 and 37 degrees C. The recombinant enzyme was stable to temperature and pH. The enzyme was homotetramer with the molecular weight of the monomer being 35 kDa and a whole protein molecular weight of 140 kDa. The purified l-asparaginase had a specific activity of 26 U/mg with a Km and Vmax of 0.050 M and 4.032 mol(-1)min. The enzyme exhibited a high affinity towards l-asparagine and showed a very minimal activity with glutamine as a substrate. The enzyme activity was inhibited by PMSF, suggesting the presence of serine at the active site. The presence of Mg(2+) enhanced PfAns activity by 49%, and SDS strongly inhibited the enzyme activity.

In consideration of a worldwide increase in antibiotic resistance, the issue of FQ prophylaxis during neutropenia was re-evaluated. METHODS: Literature review of randomised controlled trials (RCT) and observational studies published in years 2006-2014 was performed. Their results were analysed in meta-analysis. Meta-regression model was applied to evaluate whether the rates of FQ resistance in community and hospital settings influenced the efficacy of FQ prophylaxis. The impact of FQ prophylaxis on colonisation and infection with resistant bacteria was reviewed. RESULTS: Two RCTs and 12 observational studies were identified. FQ prophylaxis did not have effect on mortality (pooled OR 1.01, 95%CI 0.73-1.41), but was associated with lower rate of bloodstream infections (BSI) (pooled OR 0.57, 95%CI 0.43-0.74) and episodes of fever during neutropenia (pooled OR 0.32, 95%CI 0.20-0.50). No effect of the background rate of FQ resistance on the efficacy of FQ prophylaxis was observed. In few studies, FQ prophylaxis resulted in an increased colonisation or infection with FQ- or multi-drug resistant strains. CONCLUSIONS: The possible benefits of FQ prophylaxis on BSI rate, but not on overall mortality, should be weighed against its impact in terms of toxicity and changes in local ecology in single centres.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The British Infection Association.

Chromosomal rearrangements, including del(3q/5q/7q/11q/12p/20q), loss of 5/7/Y, trisomy 8/19, i(17q), etc. frequently detected in MDS with variable frequencies and combinations, are the integral components of the 5-tier risk-stratification and WHO-2016 classification. Observations on mutations in genes involved in RNA-splicing, DNA methylation, chromatin modification, transcription factor, signal transduction/kinases, RAS pathway, cohesin complex, DNA repair and other pathways have given insights in independent effects and biological interaction of co-occurrence on disease-phenotype and treatment outcome. However, recent concepts of clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) and idiopathic cytopenia of undetermined significance (ICUS) have urged a re-definition of mutational events in non-clonal cytopenia and non-MDS healthy elderly but with a higher risk of overt leukemia. Considering gene mutations, chromosomal alterations, CHIP, ICUS and their significance in classification and risk-scoring certainly presents a comprehensive picture of disease-phenotype towards better understanding of MDS-pathogenesis, its evolution to AML and its response to therapeutic agents.

In this study, we focus on the features and effect of DNMT3A (R882) mutation in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in the presence or absence of NPM1 and FLT3 mutations. METHODS: A total of 174 cytogenetically normal (CN)-AML cases were analyzed for NPM1, FLT3, and DNMT3A mutations. For NPM1 mutation detection, we used the pyrosequencing technique; for FLT3 mutations, polymerase chain reaction and RFLP with ECO-RV techniques were used, and for DNMT3A mutation analysis, we used Sanger sequencing and RFLP (Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism) techniques. RESULTS: NPM1 mutation was found in 40.80%, DNMT3A in 12.06%, and FLT3 mutation was found in 16.66% of 174 CN-AML patients. We also found seven cases which were (NPM1+, FLT3+), 10 cases which were (NPM1+, DNMT3A+), and two cases were found positive for (DNMT3A+, FLT3+) mutations. Adult patients had significantly higher frequency of NPM1 mutation than children (72.22% vs. 16.66%; p=.020), whereas FLT3/ITD and DNMT3A mutation was associated with higher white blood count (p=.081). Immunophenotypically, NPM1 and DNMT3A mutations were significantly associated with the lack of CD34, whereas FLT3/ITD mutation was positively associated with the expression of CD7. We also assessed the overall survival and progression-free survival of DNMT3A mutation status among patients with CN-AML. Indeed, DNMT3A mutations within the CN-AML subset were associated with significantly shorter overall survival and progression-free survival compared to NPM1 and FLT3 mutated patients (p=.067 and p=.065, respectively). CONCLUSION: DNMT3A R882 mutation plays an important role in CN-AML patients' prognosis and clinical outcomes in the presence and absence of NPM1 and FLT3 mutations.","['Copyright (c) 2017 King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Centre.

We previously confirmed the effects of naloxone on inhibiting upregulation of inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta). Production of mature form IL-1beta is mediated by the nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, a multiprotein complex composed of NLRP3, and the adaptor protein apoptosis-associated speck-like protein contains a caspase recruitment domain (ASC). We elucidated whether naloxone could inhibit the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. MATERIAL AND METHODS: To induce IL-1beta production and NLRP3 inflammasome activation, the human monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 cells were first primed with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 1 mug/mL) and then activated with adenosine triphosphate (ATP, 1 mM). For NLRP3 transcription, THP-1 cells were only treated with LPS priming. RESULTS: Enzyme-link immunosorbent assay data revealed that the concentration of IL-1beta in THP-1 cells treated with LPS plus ATP was significantly higher than that in THP-1 cells treated with LPS plus ATP plus naloxone (0.1 muM) (P < 0.001). Real-time quantitative reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction data also revealed that NLRP3 mRNA concentration in THP-1 cells treated with LPS was significantly higher than that in THP-1 cells treated with LPS plus naloxone (P = 0.001). ASC speck formation, that is, ASC assembles into a large protein complex, is an indicator for NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Our data revealed that the percentage of cells containing ASC specks in THP-1 cells treated with LPS plus ATP was also significantly higher than that in THP-1 cells treated with LPS plus ATP plus naloxone (P < 0.001).

Critical factors involved in invasion have been identified using biochemical and genetic approaches including specific knockdowns of genes of interest from primary CD34(+) hematopoietic stem cells (cRBCs). Here we report the development of a robust in vitro culture system to produce RBCs that allow the generation of gene knockouts via CRISPR/Cas9 using the immortal JK-1 erythroleukemia line. JK-1 cells spontaneously differentiate, generating cells at different stages of erythropoiesis, including terminally differentiated nucleated RBCs that we term ""jkRBCs."" A screen of small-molecule epigenetic regulators identified several bromodomain-specific inhibitors that promote differentiation and enable production of synchronous populations of jkRBCs. Global surface proteomic profiling revealed that jkRBCs express all known Pfalciparum host receptors in a similar fashion to cRBCs and that multiple Pfalciparum strains invade jkRBCs at comparable levels to cRBCs and RBCs. Using CRISPR/Cas9, we deleted two host factors, basigin (BSG) and CD44, for which no natural nulls exist. BSG interacts with the parasite ligand Rh5, a prominent vaccine candidate. A BSG knockout was completely refractory to parasite invasion in a strain-transcendent manner, confirming the essential role for BSG during invasion. CD44 was recently identified in an RNAi screen of blood group genes as a host factor for invasion, and we show that CD44 knockout results in strain-transcendent reduction in invasion.

Here we describe a high-throughput CRISPR-Cas9-based saturated mutagenesis approach to generate comprehensive libraries of point mutations at a defined genomic location and systematically study their effect on cell growth. As proof of concept, we mutagenized a selected region within the leukemic oncogene BCR-ABL1 Using bulk competitions with a deep-sequencing readout, we analyzed hundreds of mutations under multiple drug conditions and found that the effects of mutations on growth in the presence or absence of drug were critical for predicting clinically relevant resistant mutations, many of which were cancer adaptive in the absence of drug pressure. Using this approach, we identified all clinically isolated BCR-ABL1 mutations and achieved a prediction score that correlated highly with their clinical prevalence. The strategy described here can be broadly applied to a variety of oncogenes to predict patient mutations and evaluate resistance susceptibility in the development of new therapeutics.",['Published under the PNAS license.'],"['Ma, Leyuan', 'Boucher, Jeffrey I', 'Paulsen, Janet', 'Matuszewski, Sebastian', 'Eide, Christopher A', 'Ou, Jianhong', 'Eickelberg, Garrett', 'Press, Richard D', 'Zhu, Lihua Julie', 'Druker, Brian J', 'Branford, Susan', 'Wolfe, Scot A', 'Jensen, Jeffrey D', 'Schiffer, Celia A', 'Green, Michael R', 'Bolon, Daniel N']","['Ma L', 'Boucher JI', 'Paulsen J', 'Matuszewski S', 'Eide CA', 'Ou J', 'Eickelberg G', 'Press RD', 'Zhu LJ', 'Druker BJ', 'Branford S', 'Wolfe SA', 'Jensen JD', 'Schiffer CA', 'Green MR', 'Bolon DN']","['Department of Molecular, Cell and Cancer Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01605.', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01605.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01605.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01605.', 'School of Life Sciences, Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239.', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239.', 'Department of Molecular, Cell and Cancer Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01605.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Department of Pathology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Department of Pathology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239.', 'Department of Molecular, Cell and Cancer Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01605.', 'Programs in Molecular Medicine and Bioinformatics and Integrative Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01605.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239.', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239.', 'Department of Genetics and Molecular Pathology, Centre for Cancer Biology, SA Pathology, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia.', 'School of Pharmacy and Medical Science, University of South Australia, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia.', 'School of Medicine, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA 5005.', 'School of Biological Sciences, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.', 'Department of Molecular, Cell and Cancer Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01605.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01605.', 'School of Life Sciences, Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01605.', 'Department of Molecular, Cell and Cancer Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01605; Michael.Green@umassmed.edu Dan.Bolon@umassmed.edu.', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01605.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01605; Michael.Green@umassmed.edu Dan.Bolon@umassmed.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171016,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'CRISPR-Cas Systems/drug effects/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats/drug effects/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/*genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis/drug effects/*genetics', 'Oncogenes/genetics', 'Point Mutation/drug effects/genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*BCR-ABL', '*CRISPR-Cas9-based genome editing', '*drug resistance', '*saturated mutagenesis', '*tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",2017/10/29 06:00,2018/06/19 06:00,['2017/10/29 06:00'],"['2017/10/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/19 06:00 [medline]', '2017/10/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['1708268114 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1708268114 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2017 Oct 31;114(44):11751-11756. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1708268114.

Recent integrated-genome analysis has revealed mutations in many genes involved in the T-cell signaling pathway, suggesting that the aberration of this pathway is an important factor in ATL pathogenesis and ATL-cell proliferation. We screened a siRNA library to examine signaling-pathway functionality and found that the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is critical to ATL-cell proliferation. We therefore investigated the effect of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors, including the dual inhibitors PP242 and AZD8055 and the mTORC1 inhibitors rapamycin and everolimus, on human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1)-infected-cell and ATL-cell lines. Both dual inhibitors inhibited the proliferation of all tested cell lines by inducing G1-phase cell-cycle arrest and subsequent cell apoptosis, whereas the effects of the 2 mTORC1 inhibitors were limited, as they did not induce cell apoptosis. In the ATL-cell lines and in the primary ATL samples, both dual inhibitors inhibited phosphorylation of AKT at serine-473, a target of mTORC2, as well as that of S6K, whereas the mTORC1 inhibitors only inhibited mTORC1. Furthermore, AZD8055 more significantly inhibited the in vivo growth of the ATL-cell xenografts than did everolimus. These results indicate that the PI3K/mTOR pathway is critical to ATL-cell proliferation and might thus be a new therapeutic target in ATL.","['(c) 2017 The Authors.

Conventional immunotherapy targets for AML such as CD33 and CD123 have been proposed as targets for chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-engineered T-cells (CAR-T-cells), a therapy that has been highly successful in the treatment of B-cell leukemia and lymphoma. However, CD33 and CD123 are present on hematopoietic stem cells, and targeting with CAR-T-cells has the potential to elicit long-term myelosuppression. C-type lectin-like molecule-1 (CLL1 or CLEC12A) is a myeloid lineage antigen that is expressed by malignant cells in more than 90% of AML patients. CLL1 is not expressed by healthy Hematopoietic Stem Cells (HSCs), and is therefore a promising target for CAR-T-cell therapy. Here, we describe the development and optimization of an anti-CLL1 CAR-T-cell with potent activity on both AML cell lines and primary patient-derived AML blasts in vitro while sparing healthy HSCs. Furthermore, in a disseminated mouse xenograft model using the CLL1-positive HL60 cell line, these CAR-T-cells completely eradicated tumor, thus supporting CLL1 as a promising target for CAR-T-cells to treat AML while limiting myelosuppressive toxicity.",,"['Laborda, Eduardo', 'Mazagova, Magdalena', 'Shao, Sida', 'Wang, Xinxin', 'Quirino, Herlinda', 'Woods, Ashley K', 'Hampton, Eric N', 'Rodgers, David T', 'Kim, Chan Hyuk', 'Schultz, Peter G', 'Young, Travis S']","['Laborda E', 'Mazagova M', 'Shao S', 'Wang X', 'Quirino H', 'Woods AK', 'Hampton EN', 'Rodgers DT', 'Kim CH', 'Schultz PG', 'Young TS']","['Department of Biology, California Institute for Biomedical Research (Calibr), La Jolla, CA 11119, USA. elaborda@calibr.org.', 'Department of Biology, California Institute for Biomedical Research (Calibr), La Jolla, CA 11119, USA. magdalena.mazagova@vrtx.com.', 'Department of Chemistry and The Skaggs Institute for Chemical Biology, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 11119, USA. sidashao@scripps.edu.', 'Department of Biology, California Institute for Biomedical Research (Calibr), La Jolla, CA 11119, USA. xwang@poseida.com.', 'Department of Biology, California Institute for Biomedical Research (Calibr), La Jolla, CA 11119, USA. hquirino@calibr.org.', 'Department of Biology, California Institute for Biomedical Research (Calibr), La Jolla, CA 11119, USA. awoods@calibr.org.', 'Department of Biology, California Institute for Biomedical Research (Calibr), La Jolla, CA 11119, USA. ehampton@calibr.org.', 'Department of Biology, California Institute for Biomedical Research (Calibr), La Jolla, CA 11119, USA. drodgers@regulusrx.com.', 'Department of Biology, California Institute for Biomedical Research (Calibr), La Jolla, CA 11119, USA. kimchanhyuk@kaist.ac.kr.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon 34141, Korea. kimchanhyuk@kaist.ac.kr.', 'Department of Biology, California Institute for Biomedical Research (Calibr), La Jolla, CA 11119, USA. schultz@scripps.edu.', 'Department of Chemistry and The Skaggs Institute for Chemical Biology, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 11119, USA. schultz@scripps.edu.', 'Department of Biology, California Institute for Biomedical Research (Calibr), La Jolla, CA 11119, USA. tyoung@calibr.org.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20171027,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/methods', 'Lectins, C-Type/*antagonists & inhibitors/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*immunology/*metabolism/therapy', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Mitogen/*antagonists & inhibitors/immunology', '*Recombinant Fusion Proteins', 'Single-Chain Antibodies/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'CAR-T-cell', 'CLL-1', 'hematopoiesis', 'optimization']",2017/10/28 06:00,2018/06/21 06:00,['2017/10/28 06:00'],"['2017/10/04 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/23 00:00 [revised]', '2017/10/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/10/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/21 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms18112259 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms18112259 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2017 Oct 27;18(11). pii: ijms18112259. doi: 10.3390/ijms18112259.,PMC5713229,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CLEC12A protein, human)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Mitogen)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Single-Chain Antibodies)']",,,,,,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have analyzed international agency for research on cancer TP53 database to reevaluate age and variant-dependent tumor patterns. RECENT FINDINGS: Genome-wide studies suggest that germline variants are more frequent than estimated prevalence of Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), suggesting that many carriers of potentially pathogenic mutations may not develop the syndrome. Carriers of a germline TP53 mutation who are detected in a clinical context have a penetrance of 80% at age 70. Penetrance varies according to age, sex and mutation type. Temporal tumor patterns show distinct phases, with childhood phase (0-15 years, 22% of all cancers) characterized by adrenal cortical carcinoma, choroid plexus carcinoma, rhabdomyosarcoma and medulloblastoma; early adulthood phase (16-50 years, 51%) including breast cancer, osteosarcoma, soft tissue sarcomas, leukemia, astrocytoma and glioblastoma, colorectal and lung cancer; late adulthood phase (51-80 years, 27%) including pancreatic and prostate cancer. SUMMARY: Germline pathogenic variants in TP53 gene have different consequences according to cell, tissue, context and age. The occurrence of frequent variants in patients with no criteria suggestive of LFS calls for attention in predicting individual risk and highlights the need of additional predictors for assigning carriers to appropriate surveillance programs.",,"['Amadou, Amina', 'Achatz, Maria I W', 'Hainaut, Pierre']","['Amadou A', 'Achatz MIW', 'Hainaut P']","['Team of Tumor Molecular Pathology and Biomarker, Institute for Advanced Bioscience, University Grenoble Alpes, INSERM U 1209, CNRS UMR 5309, Grenoble, France.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute/National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Team of Tumor Molecular Pathology and Biomarker, Institute for Advanced Bioscience, University Grenoble Alpes, INSERM U 1209, CNRS UMR 5309, Grenoble, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Oncol,Current opinion in oncology,9007265,IM,"['Animals', '*Genes, p53', '*Germ-Line Mutation', 'Humans', 'Li-Fraumeni Syndrome/*genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics']",,,2017/10/28 06:00,2017/12/16 06:00,['2017/10/28 06:00'],"['2017/10/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/16 06:00 [medline]', '2017/10/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/CCO.0000000000000423 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Oncol. 2018 Jan;30(1):23-29. doi: 10.1097/CCO.0000000000000423.,,['0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)'],,,,"['Curr Opin Oncol. 2019 Jan;31(1):52.

A total of 95,807 Japanese subjects (45,937 men and 49,870 women; age 40-69 years at baseline) were followed to the end of 2012, for an average of 18 years.

During 1,751.956 person-years, we identified 85 AML cases and 70 MDS cases. Our findings showed no significant association between coffee consumption and the risk of AML, or between green tea consumption and the risk of AML or MDS. In contrast, we observed a decreasing dose-response relationship between coffee consumption and the risk of MDS among men (almost none: reference, 1-4 times/week: HR = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.43-1.62; >/=1cups/day: HR = 0.47, 0.22-0.99, p for trend = 0.049).

By contrast, epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) resembling postimplantation epiblast are relatively more methylated and show a limited potential for chimerism. Here, for the first time, we reveal advanced pluripotent stem cells (ASCs), which are developmentally beyond the pluripotent cells in the inner cell mass but with higher potency than EpiSCs. Accordingly, a single ASC contributes very efficiently to the fetus, germline, yolk sac and the placental labyrinth in chimeras. Since they are developmentally more advanced, ASCs do not contribute to the trophoblast. ASCs were derived from blastocysts in two steps in a chemically defined medium supplemented with Activin A and basic fibroblast growth factor, followed by culturing in ABCL medium containing ActA, BMP4, CHIR99021 and leukemia inhibitory factor. Notably, ASCs exhibit a distinct transcriptome with the expression of both naive pluripotency genes, as well as mesodermal somatic genes; Eomes, Eras, Tdgf1, Evx1, hand1, Wnt5a and distinct repetitive elements.

Following the tremendous success in adults, imatinib also became licensed for treatment of CML in minors. The rarity of pediatric CML hampers the conduction of formal trials. Thus, imatinib is still the single TKI approved for CML treatment in childhood. Areas covered: This review attempts to provide an overview of the literature on pharmacology, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacogenetic of imatinib concerning pediatric CML treatment. Articles were identified through a PubMed search and by reviewing abstracts from relevant hematology congresses. Additional information was provided from the authors' libraries and expertise and from our own measurements of imatinib trough plasma levels in children. Pharmacokinetic variables (e.g. alpha 1-acid glycoprotein binding, drug-drug/food-drug interactions via cytochrome P450 3A4/5, cellular uptake mediated via OCT-1-influx variations and P-glycoprotein-mediated drug efflux) still await to be addressed in pediatric patients systematically. Expert commentary: TKI response rates vary among different individuals and pharmacokinetic variables all can influence CML treatment success. Adherence to imatinib intake may be the most prominent factor influencing treatment outcome in teenagers thus pointing towards the potential benefits of regular drug monitoring.",,"['Suttorp, Meinolf', 'Bornhauser, Martin', 'Metzler, Markus', 'Millot, Frederic', 'Schleyer, Eberhard']","['Suttorp M', 'Bornhauser M', 'Metzler M', 'Millot F', 'Schleyer E']","[""a Pediatric Hematology and Oncology , University Hospital 'Carl Gustav Carus' , Dresden , Germany."", ""b I.

New sequential approaches employing T-cell depleted transplantation directly after chemotherapy show promise but are burdened by viral infection and require donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) to augment donor chimerism and graft-versus-leukaemia effects. T-replete transplantation in sequential approaches could reduce both viral infection and DLI usage. We therefore performed a single-arm prospective Phase II clinical trial of sequential chemotherapy and T-replete transplantation using reduced-intensity conditioning without planned DLI. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Forty-seven patients with relapsed/refractory AML or high-risk myelodysplasia were enrolled; 43 proceeded to transplantation. High levels of donor chimerism were achieved spontaneously with no DLI. Overall survival of transplanted patients was 45% and 33% at 1 and 3 years. Only one patient developed cytomegalovirus disease. Cumulative incidences of treatment-related mortality and relapse were 35% and 20% at 1 year. Patients with relapsed AML and myelodysplasia had the most favourable outcomes. Late-onset graft-versus-host disease protected against relapse. In conclusion, a T-replete sequential transplantation using reduced-intensity conditioning is feasible for relapsed/refractory AML and myelodysplasia and can deliver graft-versus-leukaemia effects without DLI.",['(c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Davies, Jeff K', 'Hassan, Sandra', 'Sarker, Shah-Jalal', 'Besley, Caroline', 'Oakervee, Heather', 'Smith, Matthew', 'Taussig, David', 'Gribben, John G', 'Cavenagh, Jamie D']","['Davies JK', 'Hassan S', 'Sarker SJ', 'Besley C', 'Oakervee H', 'Smith M', 'Taussig D', 'Gribben JG', 'Cavenagh JD']","['Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK.', ""Department of Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Centre, St Bartholomew's Hospital, Barts Health NHS Trust, London, UK."", 'Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK.', 'Centre for Experimental Cancer Medicine, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK.', 'Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK.', ""Department of Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Centre, St Bartholomew's Hospital, Barts Health NHS Trust, London, UK."", ""Department of Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Centre, St Bartholomew's Hospital, Barts Health NHS Trust, London, UK."", 'Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK.', ""Department of Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Centre, St Bartholomew's Hospital, Barts Health NHS Trust, London, UK."", 'Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK.', ""Department of Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Centre, St Bartholomew's Hospital, Barts Health NHS Trust, London, UK."", 'Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK.', ""Department of Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Centre, St Bartholomew's Hospital, Barts Health NHS Trust, London, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171026,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/drug therapy/etiology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*immunology/mortality/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/*immunology/mortality/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Transplantation Chimera', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Virus Activation', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*T-replete', '*acute myeloid leukaemia', '*myelodysplasia', '*sequential conditioning', '*stem cell transplantation']",2017/10/28 06:00,2018/02/23 06:00,['2017/10/28 06:00'],"['2017/06/26 00:00 [received]', '2017/09/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/23 06:00 [medline]', '2017/10/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.14980 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2018 Feb;180(3):346-355. doi: 10.1111/bjh.14980.

New insights into the biology and genetics of ALL as well as novel clinical observations and new drugs are changing the way we diagnose, risk-stratify and treat adult patients with ALL. New genetic subtypes and alterations refine risk stratification and uncover new actionable therapeutic targets. The incorporation of more intensive, paediatric and paediatric-inspired approaches for young adults seem to have a positive impact on survival in this population. Minimal residual disease at different time points can assist in tailoring risk-adapted interventions for patients based on individual response. Finally, novel targeted approaches with monoclonal antibodies, immunotherapies and small molecules are moving through clinical development and entering the clinic. The aim of this review is to consolidate the abundance of emerging data and to review and revisit the concepts of risk-stratification, choice of induction and post-remission strategies as well as to discuss and update the approach to specific populations with ALL, such as young adult, elderly/unfit and relapsed/refractory patients with ALL.",['(c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Wolach, Ofir', 'Amitai, Irina', 'DeAngelo, Daniel J']","['Wolach O', 'Amitai I', 'DeAngelo DJ']","['Institute of Haematology, Davidoff Cancer Centre, Beilinson Hospital, Rabin Medical Centre, Petah-Tikva and Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel.', 'Institute of Haematology, Davidoff Cancer Centre, Beilinson Hospital, Rabin Medical Centre, Petah-Tikva and Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171026,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Central Nervous System/pathology', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemic Infiltration/prevention & control', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Philadelphia-negative acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', '*allogeneic transplantation', '*high-risk genetic subgroups', '*novel drugs', '*paediatric/paediatric inspired therapy']",2017/10/28 06:00,2017/12/05 06:00,['2017/10/28 06:00'],"['2017/10/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/05 06:00 [medline]', '2017/10/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.14916 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2017 Dec;179(5):705-723. doi: 10.1111/bjh.14916.

As ligands, VEGFs act on three structurally related VEGFRs (VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3 [also termed FLT1, KDR and FLT4, respectively]) that deliver downstream signals. Haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), megakaryocytic cell lines, cultured megakaryocytes (MKs), primary MKs and abnormal MKs express and secrete VEGFs. During the development from HSCs to MKs, VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3 are expressed at different developmental stages, respectively, and re-expressed, e.g., VEGFR2, and play different roles in commitment, differentiation, proliferation, survival and polyplodization of HSCs/MKs via autocrine, paracrine and/or even intracrine loops. Moreover, VEGFs and their receptors are abnormally expressed in MK-related diseases, including myeloproliferative neoplasms, myelodysplastic syndromes and acute megakaryocytic leukaemia (a rare subtype of acute myeloid leukaemia), and they lead to the disordered proliferation/differentiation of bone marrow cells and angiogenesis, indicating that they are closely related to these diseases.

This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of use and costs of biological and non-biological targeted therapies for cancer treatment in a general population of Southern Italy in the years 2010-2014. METHODS: This was a retrospective, observational study using data from the healthcare administrative databases of Messina Province for the years 2010-2014. In this study, users of biological and non-biological targeted therapies for cancer treatment were characterized and the prevalence of use and costs were calculated over time. The potential impact of biosimilars on the expenditure was also estimated. RESULTS: Of a population of 653,810 residents in the Messina area during the study years, 2491 (0.4%) patients received at least one study drug. The most frequently used were monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) (n = 1607; 64.5%) and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) (n = 609; 24.4%). mAbs were mainly used by females (60.3%) for metastasis due to an unspecified primary tumor, lymphomas, or breast cancer (24.2, 16.7, and 13.7%, respectively). Most users of small molecules were males (56.3%) being treated for multiple myeloma, metastasis due to unspecified primary tumor, leukemia, and lung cancer (13.1, 12.6, 9.5, and 8.9%, respectively). During the study years, the prevalence of use doubled from 0.9 to 1.8 per 1000 inhabitants; likewise, the related expenditure grew from euro6.6 to euro13.6 million. Based on our forecasts, this expenditure will grow to euro25 million in 2020. Assuming a 50% biosimilar uptake (trastuzumab and rituximab), a potential yearly saving of almost euro1 million may be achieved. CONCLUSIONS: In recent years, the use and costs of biological and non-biological targeted therapies in cancer patients dramatically increased in a large population from Southern Italy. This trend may be counterbalanced by adopting biosimilars once they are available. Claims databases represent a valid tool to monitor the uptake of newly marketed biological drugs and biosimilars as well as other non-biological targeted therapies.",,"['Lucchesi, Simona', 'Marciano, Ilaria', 'Panagia, Paolo', 'Intelisano, Rosanna', 'Randazzo, Maria Pia', 'Sgroi, Carmela', 'Altavilla, Giuseppe', 'Santarpia, Mariacarmela', 'Adamo, Vincenzo', 'Franchina, Tindara', 'Ferrau, Francesco', 'Reitano, Paolina', 'Trifiro, Gianluca']","['Lucchesi S', 'Marciano I', 'Panagia P', 'Intelisano R', 'Randazzo MP', 'Sgroi C', 'Altavilla G', 'Santarpia M', 'Adamo V', 'Franchina T', 'Ferrau F', 'Reitano P', 'Trifiro G']","['Department of Chemical Sciences, Biological, Pharmaceutical and Environmental, University of Messina, Messina, Italy.', 'Clinical Pharmacology Unit, A.O.U.

Expression level of mTOR was upregulated in more than 50% of cases of ALL. In T-ALL, high expression of mTOR was commonly seen, more in adults than children (82 vs. 55% cases), while in B-ALL it was same (~ 63% cases) in both adults and children. Mean fold change of mTOR expression was significantly higher in non-responders compared to responders of both adult B-ALL (7.4 vs. 2.7, p = 0.05) and T-ALL (13.9 vs. 2.4, p = 0.001). Similar results were seen in pediatric non-responders when compared to responders of both B-ALL (14.5 vs. 2.5, p = 0.006) and T-ALL (24.2 vs. 1.7, p = 0.002). Interestingly, we have observed that mTOR expression was two times higher in non-responders of children compared to adults in both B-ALL (14.5 vs. 7.4, p = 0.05) and T-ALL (24.2 vs. 13.9, p = 0.01).

Mycoplasma contamination can be eliminated by intraperitoneal injection of BALB/c mice with contaminated cells combined with screening monoclonal cells. However, in vivo passage in mice after injection with contaminated cells requires a long duration (20-54 days). Furthermore, it is important to monitor for cross-contamination of mouse and human cells, xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV) infection, and altered cell function after the in vivo treatment. The present study aimed to validate a reliable and simplified method to eliminate mycoplasma contamination from human hepatocytes. BALB/c mice were injected with paraffin oil prior to injection with cells, in order to shorten duration of intraperitoneal passage. Cross-contamination of mouse and human cells, XMRV infection and cell function-related genes and proteins were also evaluated. Methods: PCR and DNA sequencing were used to confirm Mycoplasma hyorhinis (M. hyorhinis) contamination in human hepatocyte C3A cells. Five BALB/c mice were intraperitoneally injected with 0.5 ml paraffin oil 1 week before injection of the cells. The mice were then intraperitoneally injected with C3A hepatocytes (5.0 x 10(6)/ml) contaminated with M. hyorhinis (6.2 +/- 2.2 x 10(8) CFU/ml). Ascites were collected for monoclonal cell screening on the 14th day after injection of contaminated cells. Elimination of mycoplasma from cells was determined by PCR and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Human-mouse cell and XMRV contamination were also detected by PCR. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR and western blotting were used to compare the expression of genes and proteins among treated cells, non-treated infected cells, and uninfected cells. Results: Fourteen days after injection with cells, 4 of the 5 mice had ascites. Hepatocyte colonies extracted from the ascites of four mice were all mycoplasma-free. There was no cell cross-contamination or XMRV infection in treated cell cultures. Elimination of Mycoplasma resulted in partial or complete recovery in the expression of ALB, TF, and CYP3A4 genes as well as proteins.

Recently, direct sequencing of samples from human AMLs and pre-leukemic diseases has unveiled their mutational landscapes and significantly advanced the molecular understanding of AML pathogenesis. The newly identified recurrent mutations frequently ""hit"" genes encoding epigenetic modulators, a wide range of chromatin-modifying enzymes and regulatory factors involved in gene expression regulation, supporting aberration of chromatin structure and epigenetic modification as a main oncogenic mechanism and cancer-initiating event. Increasing body of evidence demonstrates that chromatin modification aberrations underlying the formation of blood cancer can be reversed by pharmacological targeting of the responsible epigenetic modulators, thus providing new mechanism-based treatment strategies. Here, we summarize recent advances in development of small-molecule inhibitors specific to chromatin factors and their potential applications in the treatment of genetically defined AMLs. These compounds selectively inhibit various subclasses of ""epigenetic writers"" (such as histone methyltransferases MLL/KMT2A, G9A/KMT1C, EZH2/KMT6A, DOT1L/KMT4, and PRMT1), ""epigenetic readers"" (such as BRD4 and plant homeodomain finger proteins), and ""epigenetic erasers"" (such as histone demethylases LSD1/KDM1A and JMJD2C/KDM4C).

We report two cases of fetal myelosuppression following high-dose cytarabine administration for acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

Urgent cesarean section was performed. The infant had an initial pH of 6.78 and pancytopenia (hematocrit 13.3%, platelets 3 K/UL, and white blood cell count 2.0 K/UL). Initially transfusion dependent, the neonate had count recovery by 3 weeks. CASE 2: A 30-year-old G4P3 with AML at 26 weeks was monitored for fetal anemia twice weekly and growth monthly. At 34 weeks (after cycle 1), she was admitted with neutropenic fever. The fetal MCA PSV was borderline at 1.48 MoM. It improved to 1.38 MoM at 35 weeks but the fetal tracing worsened. At delivery the fetus was found to have a hematocrit of 30%, but with normal platelet and WBC. The fetus did not require any transfusions.

The initial plan of treatment was to treat along the lines of Philadelphia negative B-ALL/LBL. During this time, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and PCR testing for BCR-ABL1 rearrangements were being performed on the marrow specimens as a part of routine diagnostic workup. While the FISH returned negative, PCR testing unexpectedly detected BCR-ABL1 fusion transcripts at a low level of 0.48%. Given their presence, we performed FISH for BCR/ABL1 rearrangement in both testicular and L5 vertebral specimens which were 80-90% positive. He subsequently received rituximab, hyper-CVAD, and dasatinib, along with prophylactic intrathecal prophylactic chemotherapy. The patient achieved a prolonged remission but eventually relapsed, 4 years later.

IVLBCL is a rare, aggressive type of extranodal B-cell lymphoma, defined by proliferation of lymphomatous cells within small-to medium-sized vessels. A 60-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital with anemia, thrombocytopenia and fever. Bone marrow biopsy findings included trilineage hematopoiesis, increased numbers of immature cells, markedly abnormal and enlarged megakaryocytes, and diffuse fibrosis in multiple focal areas throughout the entire bone marrow space. When the patient was first hospitalized, hepatosplenomegaly was not present. Although initially considered during differential diagnosis, an aggressive lymphoma could not be diagnosed prior to colonoscopy, which was conducted 4 weeks after admission. A biopsy of the terminal ileum revealed IVLBCL with cells with atypical nuclei. Immunophenotyping of the atypical large cells yielded a positive result for CD79a and negative results for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, myeloperoxidase, CD3, CD10, CD20, B-cell lymphoma (Bcl)-2, Bcl-6 and cytomegalovirus.

However, tumor cells may develop resistance against such drugs via hyperactivation of N-Ras, which explains why novel therapeut-ic approaches. In this sense, the Institute Curie- Universite Pierre et Marie Curie (Paris 6) designed peptides in order to disturb Ras/Raf interaction which showed pro-apoptotic properties. These peptides were patented as WO2015001045 A2 (PCT/EP2014/064243)5. OBJECTIVE: In order to check the anti-tumoral action of WO2015001045 A2 peptides in a very aggressive BALB/c mice spontaneous leukemia called LB, we performed the present study. METHOD & RESULTS: 50 BALB/c mice inoculated with 106 LB tumor cells were randomly assigned either to control (placebo) or treatment group (that daily received 3 mg of peptide per kg of mice) during 30 days. By day 15 only 24% of the control group was alive vs. 100% of the treatment group. The average survival in treated group was 20,27 days while in control group the mean survival was 15,48 days.

Here we demonstrate that these four viruses may be present in normal and benign breast tissues 1 to 11 years before the development of same virus breast cancer in the same patients. METHODS: We combined the data we developed during investigations of the individual four oncogenic viruses and breast cancer. Patients who had benign breast biopsies 1-11 years prior to developing breast cancer were identified by pathology reports from a large Australian pathology service (Douglas Hanly Moir Pathology). Archival formalin fixed specimens from these patients were collected. The same archival specimens were used for (i) investigations of mouse mammary tumour virus (also known as human mammary tumour virus) conducted at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York and at the University of Pisa, Italy, (ii) bovine leukemia virus conducted at the University of California at Berkeley,(iii) human papilloma virus and Epstein Barr virus conducted at the University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia. Seventeen normal breast tissues from cosmetic breast surgery conducted on Australian patients were used as controls. These patients were younger than those with benign and later breast cancer. RESULTS: Standard and in situ polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods were used to identify the four viruses. The detailed methods are outlined in the separate publications.: mouse mammary tumor virus, human papilloma virus and Epstein Barr virus (Infect Agent Cancer 12:1, 2017, PLoS One 12:e0179367, 2017, Front Oncol 5:277, 2015, PLoS One 7:e48788, 2012). Epstein Barr virus and human papilloma virus were identified in the same breast cancer cells by in situ PCR. Mouse mammary tumour virus was identified in 6 (24%) of 25 benign breast specimens and in 9 (36%) of 25 breast cancer specimens which subsequently developed in the same patients. Bovine leukemia virus was identified in 18 (78%) of 23 benign breast specimens and in 20 (91%) of 22 subsequent breast cancers in the same patients. High risk human papilloma viruses were identified in 13 (72%) of 17 benign breast specimens and in 13 (76%) of 17 subsequent breast cancers in the same patients. Epstein Barr virus was not identified in any benign breast specimens but was identified in 3 (25%) of 12 subsequent breast cancers in the same patients. Mouse mammary tumour virus 3 (18%), bovine leukemia virus 6 (35%), high risk human papilloma virus 3 (18%) and Epstein Barr virus 5 (29%) were identified in 17 normal control breast specimens. CONCLUSIONS: These findings add to the evidence that multiple oncogenic viruses have potential roles in human breast cancer. This is an important observation because evidence of prior infection before the development of disease is a key criterion when assessing causation.",,"['Lawson, James S', 'Glenn, Wendy K']","['Lawson JS', 'Glenn WK']","['School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, University of New South Wales, Sydney, 2052 Australia.0000 0004 4902 0432grid.1005.4', 'School of BABS, University of NSW, Sydney, NSW 2110 Australia.0000 0004 4902 0432grid.1005.4', 'School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, University of New South Wales, Sydney, 2052 Australia.0000 0004 4902 0432grid.1005.4']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20171016,England,Infect Agent Cancer,Infectious agents and cancer,101276559,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Benign breast', 'Bovine leukemia virus', 'Breast cancer', 'Epstein Barr virus', 'Human papilloma virus', 'Mouse mammary tumor virus']",2017/10/28 06:00,2017/10/28 06:01,['2017/10/28 06:00'],"['2017/07/27 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/10/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/28 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13027-017-0165-2 [doi]', '165 [pii]']",epublish,Infect Agent Cancer. 2017 Oct 16;12:55. doi: 10.1186/s13027-017-0165-2. eCollection 2017.,PMC5644159,,,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-2385-8304'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Side effects of available treatment are still main concern. Thymoquinone (TQ), a natural compound isolated from Nigella sativa, induces growth inhibition and apoptosis in several cancer cell lines. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of TQ alone and in combination with doxorubicine on the proliferation inhibition and apoptosis induction of TQ in a lymphoblastic leukemia cell line. Jurkat cell line was cultured in standard condition and with concentrations of TQ (0-30 mum) and doxorubicine for 24, 48 and 72 h. Cell viability was measured by MTS assay. Apoptosis induction by TQ was assessed by annexin V-FITC/PI and flow cytometry analysis. TQ and DOX decreased cell viability with a time and dose dependent manner. The IC50 values were 19.461 +/- 1.141, 17.342 +/- 1.949 and 14.123 +/- 1.874 muM in 24, 48 and 72 h, respectively for TQ. IC50 values for DOX were. 075 +/- .0124, .028 +/- .007 and.007 +/- .001 muM in 24, 48 and 72 h, respectively. The level of cell apoptosis in all used concentrations of TQ (4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 mum) was higher than control group (10.2, 14.1, 36.6, 87.5 and 93.3% respectively after 24 h; 10.7, 13.9, 64.6, 92.2 and 93.1 respectively after 48 h; 2.83, 5.83, 41.4, 71.6 and 86.6% respectively after 72 h) and reached to a significant level at 12, 16 and 20 mum concentration for 24 and 48 h and 16 and 20 mum for 72 h incubation. Combination of doxorubicine and TQ lead to a synergistic cytotoxicity as compared to any of them alone. The study indicated that TQ is effective on proliferation inhibition and is a strong apoptotic inducer in Jurkat lymphoblastic cell line and has synergistic effect in combination with DOX. This combination strategy can be an alternative way for more powerful anticancer effects. Therefore, the study of the mechanism of apoptosis induction of TQ can be a step forward to in target therapy which might be considered in the future studies.",,"['Soltani, Amin', 'Pourgheysari, Batoul', 'Shirzad, Hedayatollah', 'Sourani, Zahra']","['Soltani A', 'Pourgheysari B', 'Shirzad H', 'Sourani Z']","['Department of Immunology, Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences, Shahrekord, Iran.0000 0004 0384 8883grid.440801.9', 'Medical Plants Research Center, Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences, Shahrekord, Iran.0000 0004 0384 8883grid.440801.9', 'Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences, Shahrekord, Iran.0000 0004 0384 8883grid.440801.9', 'Department of Medical Laboratory Technology, Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences, Shahrekord, Iran.0000 0004 0384 8883grid.440801.9']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161208,India,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus,Indian journal of hematology & blood transfusion : an official journal of Indian Society of Hematology and Blood Transfusion,9425818,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Thymoquinone']",2017/10/28 06:00,2017/10/28 06:01,['2017/10/28 06:00'],"['2016/06/26 00:00 [received]', '2016/11/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/10/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/28 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12288-016-0758-8 [doi]', '758 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus. 2017 Dec;33(4):516-524. doi: 10.1007/s12288-016-0758-8.

Genomic features as zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70 (ZAP70) expression and CD38 expression provide further differentiation of disease prognosis. Extensive studies have confirmed the oncogenic activities of IL-9 in lymphoma. The aim of the current study was to investigate the contribution of IL-9 expression to the pathogenesis of CLL and its correlation to other prognostic parameters. This study was conducted on 80 patients at diagnosis with CLL and 80 healthy controls. Using real time polymerase chain reaction and enzyme linked immunosorbant assay, IL-9 mRNA expression and its serum level were compared between patients and controls. They were both correlated with other prognostic factors. RESULTS: There was an overexpression of IL-9 in CLL patients that correlated with modified Rai staging, ZAP70, CD38 and all hallmarks of an active and aggressive disease. The correlation between IL-9 upregulation and patient characteristics provided direct clinical evidence for its contribution to the pathogenesis of CLL. In conclusion, significantly higher expression of IL-9 measured at both the mRNA and the protein levels in patients with CLL that correlates with more complex course of the disease and worse prognosis may allow one to speculate its importance in the pathogenesis of the disease and its possible impact on prognosis.",,"['Abbassy, Hadeer A', 'Aboelwafa, Reham A', 'Ghallab, Omar M']","['Abbassy HA', 'Aboelwafa RA', 'Ghallab OM']","['Clinical Pathology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt.0000 0001 2260 6941grid.7155.6', 'Clinical Pathology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt.0000 0001 2260 6941grid.7155.6', 'Internal Medicine Department, Faculty of Medicine, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt.0000 0001 2260 6941grid.7155.6']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170317,India,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus,Indian journal of hematology & blood transfusion : an official journal of Indian Society of Hematology and Blood Transfusion,9425818,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CLL', 'Egyptian patients', 'Expression', 'Interleukin-9', 'Therapeutic target']",2017/10/28 06:00,2017/10/28 06:01,['2017/10/28 06:00'],"['2016/07/14 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/10/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/28 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12288-017-0804-1 [doi]', '804 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus. 2017 Dec;33(4):477-482. doi: 10.1007/s12288-017-0804-1.

Whether this phenomenon also occurs in early CLL phases and its underlying mechanisms have yet to be fully elucidated. In this study, we prospectively enrolled 36 consecutive treatment-naive patients to analyse skeletal structure and bone marrow distribution using a computational approach to PET/CT images. This evaluation was combined with the analysis of RANK/RANKL loop activation in the leukemic clone, given recent reports on its role in CLL progression. Bone erosion was particularly evident in long bone shafts, progressively increased from Binet stage A to Binet stage C, and was correlated with both local expansion of metabolically active bone marrow documented by FDG uptake and with the number of RANKL + cells present in the circulating blood. In immune-deficient NOD/Shi-scid, gammacnull (NSG) mice, administration of CLL cells caused an appreciable compact bone erosion that was prevented by Denosumab. CLL cell proliferation in vitro correlated with RANK expression and was impaired by Denosumab-mediated disruption of the RANK/RANKL loop.

Mechanism of action was investigated using antibody-mediated blocking assays and recombinant protein treatment assays.Results: Expanded DNTs from healthy donors target a majority (36/46) of primary AML cells, including 9 chemotherapy-resistant patient samples in vitro, and significantly reduce the leukemia load in patient-derived xenograft models in a DNT donor-unrestricted manner. Importantly, allogeneic DNTs do not attack normal hematopoietic cells or affect hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell engraftment and differentiation, or cause xenogeneic GVHD in recipients. Mechanistically, DNTs express high levels of NKG2D and DNAM-1 that bind to cognate ligands preferentially expressed on AML cells. Upon recognition of AML cells, DNTs rapidly release IFNgamma, which further increases NKG2D and DNAM-1 ligands' expression on AML cells. IFNgamma pretreatment enhances the susceptibility of AML cells to DNT-mediated cytotoxicity, including primary AML samples that are otherwise resistant to DNTs, and the effect of IFNgamma treatment is abrogated by NKG2D and DNAM-1-blocking antibodies.Conclusions: This study supports healthy donor-derived allogeneic DNTs as a therapy to treat patients with chemotherapy-resistant AML and also reveals interrelated roles of NKG2D, DNAM-1, and IFNgamma in selective targeting of AML by DNTs.

FLT3 inhibitors have limited and transient clinical activity, and concurrent treatment with inhibitors of parallel or downstream signaling may improve responses. The oncogenic serine/threonine kinase Pim-1 is upregulated downstream of FLT3-ITD and also promotes its signaling in a positive feedback loop, suggesting benefit of combined Pim and FLT3 inhibition.Experimental Design: Combinations of clinically active Pim and FLT3 inhibitors were studied in vitro and in vivoResults: Concurrent treatment with the pan-Pim inhibitor AZD1208 and FLT3 inhibitors at clinically applicable concentrations abrogated in vitro growth of FLT3-ITD, but not wild-type FLT3 (FLT3-WT), cell lines. AZD1208 cotreatment increased FLT3 inhibitor-induced apoptosis of FLT3-ITD, but not FLT3-WT, cells measured by sub-G1 fraction, annexin V labeling, mitochondrial membrane potential, and PARP and caspase-3 cleavage. Concurrent treatment with AZD1208 and the FLT3 inhibitor quizartinib decreased growth of MV4-11 cells, with FLT3-ITD, in mouse xenografts, and prolonged survival, enhanced apoptosis of FLT3-ITD primary AML blasts, but not FLT3-WT blasts or remission marrow cells, and decreased FLT3-ITD AML blast colony formation. Mechanistically, AZD1208 and quizartinib cotreatment decreased expression of the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1. Decrease in Mcl-1 protein expression was abrogated by treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, and was preceded by downregulation of the Mcl-1 deubiquitinase USP9X, a novel mechanism of Mcl-1 regulation in AML.Conclusions: The data support clinical testing of Pim and FLT3 inhibitor combination therapy for FLT3-ITD AML.

Patients resistant/intolerant to hydroxycarbamide (HC) have a poor outlook. MAJIC (ISRCTN61925716) is a randomized phase 2 trial of ruxolitinib (JAK1/2 inhibitor) vs best available therapy (BAT) in ET and polycythemia vera patients resistant or intolerant to HC. Here, findings of MAJIC-ET are reported, where the modified intention-to-treat population included 58 and 52 patients randomized to receive ruxolitinib or BAT, respectively. There was no evidence of improvement in complete response within 1 year reported in 27 (46.6%) patients treated with ruxolitinib vs 23 (44.2%) with BAT (P = .40). At 2 years, rates of thrombosis, hemorrhage, and transformation were not significantly different; however, some disease-related symptoms improved in patients receiving ruxolitinib relative to BAT. Molecular responses were uncommon; there were 2 complete molecular responses (CMR) and 1 partial molecular response in CALR-positive ruxolitinib-treated patients. Transformation to myelofibrosis occurred in 1 CMR patient, presumably because of the emergence of a different clone, raising questions about the relevance of CMR in ET patients. Grade 3 and 4 anemia occurred in 19% and 0% of ruxolitinib vs 0% (both grades) in the BAT arm, and grade 3 and 4 thrombocytopenia in 5.2% and 1.7% of ruxolitinib vs 0% (both grades) of BAT-treated patients. Rates of discontinuation or treatment switching did not differ between the 2 trial arms. The MAJIC-ET trial suggests that ruxolitinib is not superior to current second-line treatments for ET.

PAF is preferentially overexpressed in GSCs. Its depletion impairs maintenance of self-renewal without promoting differentiation and reduces tumor-initiating cell frequency. Combined transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses revealed that PAF supports GSC maintenance, in part, by influencing DNA replication and pyrimidine metabolism pathways. PAF interacts with PCNA and regulates PCNA-associated DNA translesion synthesis (TLS); consequently, PAF depletion in combination with radiation generated fewer tumorspheres compared with radiation alone. Correspondingly, pharmacological impairment of DNA replication and TLS phenocopied the effect of PAF depletion in compromising GSC self-renewal and radioresistance, providing preclinical proof of principle that combined TLS inhibition and radiation therapy may be a viable therapeutic option in the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).",['Published under the PNAS license.'],"['Ong, Derrick Sek Tong', 'Hu, Baoli', 'Ho, Yan Wing', 'Sauve, Charles-Etienne Gabriel', 'Bristow, Christopher A', 'Wang, Qianghu', 'Multani, Asha S', 'Chen, Peiwen', 'Nezi, Luigi', 'Jiang, Shan', 'Gorman, Claire Elizabeth', 'Monasterio, Marta Moreno', 'Koul, Dimpy', 'Marchesini, Matteo', 'Colla, Simona', 'Jin, Eun-Jung', 'Sulman, Erik P', 'Spring, Denise J', 'Yung, Wai-Kwan Alfred', 'Verhaak, Roel G W', 'Chin, Lynda', 'Wang, Y Alan', 'DePinho, Ronald A']","['Ong DST', 'Hu B', 'Ho YW', 'Sauve CG', 'Bristow CA', 'Wang Q', 'Multani AS', 'Chen P', 'Nezi L', 'Jiang S', 'Gorman CE', 'Monasterio MM', 'Koul D', 'Marchesini M', 'Colla S', 'Jin EJ', 'Sulman EP', 'Spring DJ', 'Yung WA', 'Verhaak RGW', 'Chin L', 'Wang YA', 'DePinho RA']","['Department of Cancer Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Physiology, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117597, Singapore.', 'Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Agency for Science, Technology, and Research, Singapore 138673, Singapore.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Neurological Surgery, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA 15213.', ""Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA 15213."", 'Department of Cancer Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Institute for Applied Cancer Science, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Genomic Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Genetics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Genomic Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Institute for Applied Cancer Science, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Neuro-Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Wonkwang University, Iksan, CB, 570-749, Korea.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Neuro-Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'The Jackson Laboratory, Farmington, CT 06032.', 'Department of Genomic Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030;

29072891,,Publisher,,,,,,1993,Poikiloderma with Neutropenia,,,"CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Poikiloderma with neutropenia (PN) is characterized by an inflammatory eczematous rash (ages 6-12 months) followed by post-inflammatory poikiloderma (age >2 years) and chronic noncyclic neutropenia typically associated with recurrent sinopulmonary infections in the first two years of life and (often) bronchiectasis. There is increased risk for myelodysplastic syndrome and, rarely, acute myelogenous leukemia. Other ectodermal findings include nail dystrophy and palmar/plantar hyperkeratosis. Most affected individuals also have reactive airway disease and some have short stature, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, midfacial retrusion, calcinosis cutis, and non-healing skin ulcers. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: Often the diagnosis of PN can be established in a proband based on clinical findings (post-inflammatory poikiloderma and congenital chronic neutropenia). Unequivocal confirmation of the diagnosis of PN relies on detection of biallelic USB1 pathogenic variants on molecular genetic testing. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Dermatologic manifestations are treated with gentle skin care using bland emollients and diligent sun protection; very pruritic palmar/plantar hyperkeratosis can be treated with a strong topical steroid or a topical keratolytic if secondary dermatophyte infection has been ruled out. Although use of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) increases the absolute neutrophil count, there is little evidence of its clinical effect (such as decreased frequency of infections). Myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myelogenous leukemia are treated in the usual manner. Sinopulmonary, middle ear, and skin infections require aggressive treatment with antibiotics. Reactive airway disease and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism are treated in the usual manner. Prevention of secondary complications: Annual influenza vaccine; dental cleaning and evaluation for gingivitis/caries every three to six months; liberal use of sunscreens with both UVA and UVB protection to reduce the risk of skin cancer. Surveillance: Annual evaluation: By a physician familiar with PN of CBC with differential and platelet count (for evidence of anemia and/or thrombocytopenia signs of possible myelodysplastic syndrome); By a pulmonologist for those with bronchiectasis, chronic cough, and/or reactive airway disease; By a dermatologist (starting at age 10 years) for skin cancer screening. In children: routine monitoring of growth, developmental milestones, school progress, and pubertal development. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Excessive sun exposure (to decrease risk of skin cancer); exposure to second-hand cigarette or wood smoke and persons with respiratory illnesses (to decrease the risk of respiratory infections). Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic older and younger sibs of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from prompt initiation of treatment and surveillance for potential complications. GENETIC COUNSELING: PN is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Once the USB1 pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.","['Copyright (c) 1993-2022, University of Washington, Seattle.

This study assessed HRQOL in bosutinib-treated patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML and resistance or intolerance to 1 (chronic-phase second-line [CP2L]) or more (chronic-phase third-line [CP3L]) tyrosine kinase inhibitors who had 264 weeks or more of follow-up (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00261846). METHODS: Patient-reported HRQOL was assessed with the EuroQol 5-Dimensions Questionnaire (EQ-5D) and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Leukemia (FACT-Leu). RESULTS: In total, 284 and 119 patients composed the CP2L and CP3L cohorts, respectively. At treatment completion, more than 50% of the patients in the CP2L and CP3L cohorts completed the EQ-5D and FACT-Leu assessments. The EQ-5D and EQ-5D visual analog scale scores were stable in both cohorts throughout treatment. The mean FACT-Leu scores were generally stable over time but were lower in magnitude in the CP3L cohort versus the CP2L cohort. The FACT-Leu scale scores of a subset of patients with chronic diarrhea (CP2L, n = 101; CP3L, n = 30) were similar to the scores of the larger cohorts. Minimally important differences (MIDs) from baseline for the FACT-Leu scale scores were observed for the following: emotional well-being (EWB), Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) Total, FACT-Leu Total, and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Trial Outcome Index (FACT-TOI) in the CP2L cohort and FACT-Leu Total in the CP3L cohort. Among patients with chronic diarrhea, MIDs were observed for EWB, FACT-G Total, FACT-Leu Total, and FACT-TOI in the CP2L cohort and for EWB, FACT-G Total, and FACT-Leu Total in the CP3L cohort. CONCLUSIONS: HRQOL was maintained with long-term bosutinib treatment for patients with CP2L and CP3L CML. Cancer 2018;124:587-95. (c) 2017 The Authors.

To study the in vivo role of CITED2 in AML maintenance, AML cells were transduced with a lentiviral construct for RNAi-mediated knockdown of CITED2. Mice transplanted with CITED2-knockdown AML cells (n=4) had a significantly longer survival compared to mice transplanted with control AML cells (P<0.02). In vitro, the reduction of CITED2 resulted in increased p53-mediated apoptosis and CDKN1A expression, whereas BCL2 levels were reduced. The activation of p53 upon CITED2 knockdown is not a direct consequence of increased CBP/p300-activity towards p53, since no increased formation of CBP/p300/p53 complexes was demonstrated and inhibition of CBP/p300-activity could not rescue the phenotype of CITED2-deficient cells. Instead, loss of CITED2 had an inhibitory effect on the AKT-signaling pathway, which was indicated by decreased levels of phosphorylated AKT and altered expression of the AKT-pathway regulators PHLDA3 and SOX4. Notably, simultaneous upregulation of BCL2 or downregulation of the p53-target gene PHLDA3 rescued the apoptotic phenotype in CITED2-knockdown cells. Furthermore, knockdown of CITED2 led to a decreased interaction of p53 with its inhibitor MDM2, which results in increased amounts of total p53 protein. In summary, our data indicate that CITED2 functions in pathways regulating p53 activity and therefore represents an interesting target for AML therapy, since de novo AML cases are characterized by an inactivation of the p53 pathway or deregulation of apoptosis-related genes.",,"['Mattes, Katharina', 'Berger, Gerbrig', 'Geugien, Marjan', 'Vellenga, Edo', 'Schepers, Hein']","['Mattes K', 'Berger G', 'Geugien M', 'Vellenga E', 'Schepers H']","['Department of Hematology, Cancer Research Center Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Research Center Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Research Center Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Research Center Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Research Center Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171026,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism']",,,2017/10/27 06:00,2018/07/03 06:00,['2017/10/27 06:00'],"['2017/07/03 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/28 00:00 [revised]', '2017/09/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/03 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2017548 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2017.548 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2017 Oct 26;8(10):e3132. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2017.548.,PMC5680917,"['0 (CITED2 protein, human)', '0 (Cited2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, anti-cancer function and the underlying mechanisms of demethylzeylasteral in melanoma cells remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that demethylzeylasteral has an anti-tumor property in melanoma cells. Demethylzeylasteral not only inhibits cell proliferation through cell cycle arrest at S phase, but also induces cell apoptosis in melanoma cells. MCL1 is an anti-apoptotic protein in BCL2 family, and amplifies frequently in multiple human cancers. MCL1 is also known as a potential contributor for the resistance of BCL2 inhibitors, as well as various chemotherapeutic drugs. MCL1 is, therefore, regarded as a potential target for cancer therapy. Here, for the first time, we unveil that demethylzeylasteral suppresses the expression of MCL1. Interestingly, MCL1 interacts with S phase-related protein CDK2, and thereby inhibits it's ubiquitin-dependent degradation. Together, demethylzeylasteral is a promising anti-tumor compound in melanoma cells.

While previously described in acute leukemia, the infiltration in our case represents central nervous system (CNS) metastasis of Burkitt-type lymphoma that developed as a complication of solid-organ transplantation, resulting in a bilateral infiltrative optic neuropathy with sequential, bilateral central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) and devastating vision loss. METHODS: The medical record, serial ophthalmic examination findings, clinical course, and imaging including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), fundus photographs, and fluorescein angiography of a single patient were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: MRI demonstrated multifocal cortical and leptomeningeal CNS involvement, including the left optic nerve. Serial fundus examination/photography and fluorescein angiography showed that despite urgent whole-brain irradiation and systemic chemotherapy, CNS disease progressed to bilateral optic nerve infiltration and CRAO with no light perception vision in both eyes.

On the gold chip surface, the cascade self-assembly process is triggered after the introduction of PML/RARalpha. The different fragments of PML/RARalpha can specifically hybridize with capture probes (Cp) immobilized on the chip and the hybridization DNA1 (H1). Then, the nonlinear HCR is initiated by the complex of Cp-PML/RARalpha-H1 with the introduction of two hybridization DNA chains (H2 and H3). As a result, a dendritic nanostructure is achieved on the surface of chip, leading to a significant SPR amplification signal owing to its high molecular weight. The developed method shows good specificity and high sensitivity with detection limit of 0.72 pM for ""L"" subtype and 0.65 pM for ""S"" subtype. Moreover, this method has been successfully applied for efficient identification of clinical positive and negative PCR samples of the PML/RARalpha subtype. Thus, this developed biosensing strategy presents a potential platform for analysis of fusion gene and early diagnosis of clinical disease.",,"['Guo, Bin', 'Cheng, Wei', 'Xu, Yongjie', 'Zhou, Xiaoyan', 'Li, Xinmin', 'Ding, Xiaojuan', 'Ding, Shijia']","['Guo B', 'Cheng W', 'Xu Y', 'Zhou X', 'Li X', 'Ding X', 'Ding S']","['Key Laboratory of Clinical Laboratory Diagnostics (Ministry of Education), College of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 400016, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, The Affiliated Hospital of North Sichuan Medical College, Nanchong, 637000, China.', 'The Center for Clinical Molecular Medical Detection, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 400016, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Clinical Laboratory Diagnostics (Ministry of Education), College of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 400016, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Clinical Laboratory Diagnostics (Ministry of Education), College of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 400016, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Clinical Laboratory Diagnostics (Ministry of Education), College of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 400016, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Clinical Laboratory Diagnostics (Ministry of Education), College of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 400016, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Clinical Laboratory Diagnostics (Ministry of Education), College of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 400016, China. dingshijia@163.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171025,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,,,,,2017/10/27 06:00,2017/10/27 06:01,['2017/10/27 06:00'],"['2017/05/17 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/27 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-017-14361-5 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-017-14361-5 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2017 Oct 25;7(1):14037. doi: 10.1038/s41598-017-14361-5.,PMC5656617,,,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-2127-8154'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the same variants are also found in individuals with no hematological disease, making their functional relevance obscure. Through NOD.Cg-Prkdc(scid)Il2rg(tmlWjl)/Sz (NSG) xenotransplantation, we functionally identified preleukemic and leukemic stem cell populations present in FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 internal tandem duplication-positive (FLT3-ITD)(+) AML patient samples. By single-cell DNA sequencing, we identified clonal structures and linked mutations with in vivo fates, distinguishing mutations permissive of nonmalignant multilineage hematopoiesis from leukemogenic mutations. Although multiple somatic mutations coexisted at the single-cell level, inhibition of the mutation strongly associated with preleukemic to leukemic stem cell transition eliminated AML in vivo. Moreover, concurrent inhibition of BCL-2 (B cell lymphoma 2) uncovered a critical dependence of resistant AML cells on antiapoptotic pathways. Co-inhibition of pathways critical for oncogenesis and survival may be an effective strategy that overcomes genetic diversity in human malignancies.

To identify the functional determinants of chNHE1 responsible for the ALV-J receptor activity, a series of chimeric receptors was created by exchanging the extracellular loops (ECL) of human NHE1 (huNHE1) and chNHE1 and by ECL replacement with a hemagglutinin (HA) tag. These chimeric receptors then were used in binding and entry assays to map the minimal ALV-J gp85-binding domain of chNHE1. We show that ECL1 of chNHE1 (chECL1) is the critical functional ECL that interacts directly with ALV-J gp85; ECL3 is also involved in ALV-J gp85 binding. Amino acid residues 28 to 39 of the N-terminal membrane-proximal region of chECL1 constitute the minimal domain required for chNHE1 binding of ALV-J gp85. These residues are sufficient to mediate viral entry into ALV-J nonpermissive cells. Point mutation analysis revealed that A30, V33, W38, and E39 of chECL1 are the key residues mediating the binding between chNHE1 and ALV-J gp85. Further, the replacement of residues 28 to 39 of huNHE1 with the corresponding chNHE1 residues converted the nonfunctional ALV-J receptor huNHE1 to a functional one. Importantly, soluble chECL1 and huECL1 harboring chNHE1 residues 28 to 39 both could effectively block ALV-J infection. Collectively, our findings indicate that residues 28 to 39 of chNHE1 constitute a domain that is critical for receptor function and mediate ALV-J entry.IMPORTANCE chNHE1 is a cellular receptor of ALV-J, a retrovirus that causes infections in chickens and serious economic losses in the poultry industry. Until now, the domains determining the chNHE1 receptor function remained unknown. We demonstrate that chECL1 is critical for receptor function, with residues 28 to 39 constituting the minimal functional domain responsible for chNHE1 binding of ALV-J gp85 and efficiently mediating ALV-J cell entry. These residues are located in the membrane-proximal region of the N terminus of chECL1, suggesting that the binding site of ALV-J gp85 on chNHE1 is probably located on the apex of the molecule; the receptor-binding mode might be different from that of retroviruses. We also found that soluble chECL1, as well as huECL1 harboring chNHE1 residues 28 to 39, effectively blocked ALV-J infection. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the ALV-J infection mechanism and also provide new insights into the control strategies for ALV-J infection.",['Copyright (c) 2017 American

Targeting LSCs may be an attractive strategy to override this thorny problem. Given that EZH2 was overexpressed in primary CML CD34(+) cells, our purpose in this study was to evaluate the effects of targeting EZH2 on CML LSCs and clarify its underlying mechanism.Experimental Design: Human primary CML CD34(+) cells and retrovirally BCR-ABL-driven CML mouse models were employed to evaluate the effects of suppression of EZH2 by GSK126- or EZH2-specific shRNA in vitro and in vivo Recruitment of EZH2 and H3K27me3 on the promoter of tumor-suppressor gene PTEN in CML cells was measured by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay.Results: Our results showed that pharmacologic inhibition of EZH2 by GSK126 not only elicited apoptosis and restricted cell growth in CML bulk leukemia cells, but also decreased LSCs in CML CD34(+) cells while sparing those from normal bone marrow CD34(+) cells. Suppression of EZH2 by GSK126 or specific shRNA prolonged survival of CML mice and reduced the number of LSCs in mice. EZH2 knockdown resulted in elevation of PTEN and led to impaired recruitment of EZH2 and H3K27me3 on the promoter of PTEN gene. The effect of EZH2 knockdown in the CML mice was at least partially reversed by PTEN knockdown.Conclusions: These findings improve the understanding of the epigenetic regulation of stemness in CML LSCs and warrant clinical trial of GSK126 in refractory patients with CML.

METHODS: SKM-1 cells were transfected by lentiviral particles with vector of GFP. The GFP positive single cell clone was isolated by limiting dilution and continued being cultured. The cells were injected into mice subcutaneously and were screened in vivo. Then SKM-1/GFP cells were obtained after tumour plaque was separated and cultivated. The cell morphology was observed by fluorescence microscopy. The GFP expression was further detected by flow cytometry. The cell proliferation was analysed by CCK-8 assay. SKM-1/GFP cells were inoculated to subcutaneous tissue of the immunodeficiency mice. The growth and invasion of the tumour were observed after tumour formation. RESULTS: No differences in cell morphology and growth characteristics were observed between SKM-1 cells and SKM-1/GFP cells. The rate of GFP expression was 100%. No differences in cell proliferation were observed between SKM-1 cells and SKM-1/GFP cells. The tumour mass was observed after 14 days of subcutaneous vaccination in NOD/SCID mice. Spontaneous fluorescence from plaque was observed by living fluorescence microscopy at 30th day after vaccination. Homogenous GFP positive cells were observed by fluorescence microscopy in the frozen section of tumour mass. The invasion of SKM-1/GFP cells was also detected in heart, liver, stomach and kidney of mice. CONCLUSION: A myelody-splastic syndrome transformed to leukemia cell line stably expressing green fluorescent protein has been established successfully, which can track tumor cell sensitively and can be applied to the research of minimal residual leukemia.

METHODS: The expression levels of SOCS3 mRNA in bone marrow mononuclear cells from 45 cases of newly diagnosed ALL at initial diganosis and induction remission and 13 normal children as controls were detected by SYBR Green fluorescence quantitative PCR; the correlation of SOCS3 mRNA expression level with risk and clinical characteristics of ALL was analyzed by means of statistical method; the immunofluorescence histochemistry method and laser confocal microscopy were used to detect the sites and expression level of SOCS3 mRNA in bone marrow samples of ALL patients. RESULTS: The SOCS3 mRNA expression level at initial diagnosis of 45 ALL patients was significantly lower than that of normal controls (P<0.05), and that in induction remission of 45 patients was not significant different from normal controls (P<0.05); the SOCS3 mRNA expression level at initial diagnosis of patients with standasd and high risk was higher than that of patients with low risk (P<0.05). The 45 patients were divided into high expression and low expression groups according to SOCS3 mRNA expression level at initial diagnosis by median method, comparison of clinical characteristics in 2 groups was found that the SOCS3 mRNA high expression group had even more higher leukocyte count in peripheral blood, even more higher LDH level and much more poor prognostic genes; in addition, the high expression group showed more higher risk in comparison between 2 group. CONCLUSION: The SOCS3 mRNA expression is down-regulated at initial diagnosis, while recovered to normal level after induction remission of disease, thus the SOCS3 can be used as an indicator for evaluation of disease status. The high expression of SOCS3 mRNA up-regulates the disease risk, therefore the SOCS3 mRNA can be used as a factor for evaluation of ALL risk.

METHODS: Seven pediatric patients with newly diagnosed mature B-ALL were treated by CCCG-BNHL-2015 protocol (risk group R4) in Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University from November 2014 to January 2017. RESULTS: The median age of patients at initial diagnosis was 7.2 years (range 4.1 to 11.75 years) with a male predominance (5:2), the clinical characters were as follows: 4 cases combined with thoracic and/or abdominal lumps, only lymphonode was involved in 1 case, bone destruction was complicated in 2 cases and 1 case was complicated with central nervous system leukemia. In 2 children, tumor lysis syndrome appeared at early phase. The lactate dehydrogenase level at diagnosis of all patients extremely increased. All patients achieved complete remission after 2 to 4 courses of therapy. Two among them underwent autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. One with primary central nervous system leukemia relapsed before the last course, then the treatment was abandoned. The rest of 6 patients survived with a median follow-up period of 14 months (ranged from 7 to 28 months), and suffered from different degrees of myelosuppression and infection. No one died from serious complications.

METHODS: The bone marrow or peripheral blood were collected and heparinized from 21 newly diagnosed FLT3(-) AML patients, then the mononuclear cells from bone marrow or peripheral blood were isolated by density-gradient method. The sensitivity of leukemia cells to PKC412 of 8 concentration in vitro was detected by ATP-bioluminescence-tumor chemosensitivity assay (ATP-TCA), and the relationship among sensitivity results in vitro, risk stratification and therapeutic efficacy was analyzed. RESULTS: The leukemia cells of 21 patients with AML displayed different sensitivities to PKC412 in vitro. The rate of sensitivity in vitro was 42.9%, and sensitive concentration in vitro were between 1 micromol/L and 5 micromol/L. There was no significant relationship between risk stratification and sensitivity results of PKC412 in vitro. There was also no significant relationship between clinical efficacy and sensitivity results of PKC412 in vitro. The survival of patients in low-risk and intermediate-risk groups was better than that of patients in high-risk groups (P=0.015).

METHODS: The ABO blood group was detected in 110 newly diagnosed acute leukemia patients(including 68 cases of AML and 42 cases of ALL) and 68 normal controls. Then the leukemia subtype, age, sex, laboratory test, risk status of leukemia patients, and DNA methylation of ABO promoter were compared between patients with weak and normal ABO antigen. RESULTS: The weak ABO antigen was found in patients with newly diagnosed acute leukemia, and was not found in ALL patients or normal group. No statistical differences were found in the distribution of ABO blood group, age, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenovarix, plt, precursor cell clusters derived from bone marrow, immunopheno-typing, LDH level, and risk status between AL patients of weak and normal ABO antigen groups (P>0.05). Compared with patients in normal ABO antigen group, the pateins in weak ABO antigen group had higher percentage of male(77.8% vs 30%), lower WBC(32.26x10(9)/L vs 82.69x10(9)/L) and Hb level(64.00 g/L vs 85.94 g/L) and higher DNA methylation level (18.91% vs 10.76%) (P<0.05).

METHODS: We identified 6 cases of composite SLL/CLL and FL in our database and studied their clinical, histologic, immunophenotypic, and cytogenetic features. A literature review of the existing cases was also conducted. RESULTS: The patients included 4 males and 2 females, with a median age of 72 years. Four patients presented with lymphadenopathy and 2 with extranodal diseases. Lymphocytosis was seen in 2 cases. Serum lactate dehydrogenase levels were within normal range in all but one case. There were 2 histologic patterns: SLL/CLL predominant pattern (type I) and FL predominant or mixed pattern (type II). The type I pattern was exclusively associated with in situ follicular neoplasia (ISFN). The SLL/CLL showed typical morphology and immunophenotype in all the cases. The FL component included low grade (n = 3), ISFN (n = 2), and primary cutaneous FL (n = 1). Four cases had staging bone marrow biopsies including 3 cases with involvement by SLL/CLL and 1 case with involvement by SLL/CLL and FL. Four patients received treatments, one was under clinical surveillance, and one had no available information. All patients were alive after a median follow-up of 22 months.

They typically affect the elderly but, when making treatment decisions, considering chronological age may be insufficient because it poorly correlates with patient frailty: the challenge is to select the optimal treatment in these patients by balancing efficacy and toxicity. Areas covered: This review discusses the rationale for and methods of personalizing the treatment of elderly MDS patients. Expert commentary: Decisions concerning treatment strategies for elderly MDS patients should be made after assessing their frailty on the basis of a geriatric assessment and an estimate of age-adjusted life expectancy.

Fit patients should receive standard dose treatment; pre-frail patients should receive individualized therapy; and frail patients should receive symptom-related therapy.

Approximately one-third of cases have a FLT3-ITD or FLT3-TKD mutation which leads to constitutive tyrosine kinase activation which contributes to leukemogenesis. The FLT3-ITD mutation is associated with a particularly poor prognosis. Midostaurin is a multi-kinase inhibitor active against the FLT3 receptor. Midostaurin was approved by the US FDA in April 2017 for treatment of newly diagnosed FLT3-mutant AML in combination with chemotherapy. Areas covered: Standard treatment of FLT3-mutant AML and outcomes. Early clinical development of midostaurin including pharmacokinetics and metabolism. The development of midostaurin in FLT3-mutant AML is then outlined including review of the phase I, II, and III trials of midostaurin as a single agent and in combination with chemotherapy. Expert commentary: The approval of midostaurin represents the first new therapy for AML in several decades. It is also the first targeted therapy approved for AML. Future studies will focus on defining mechanisms of resistance to midostaurin as well as establishing the role of midostaurin in combination with hypomethylating agents and as maintenance therapy. Second generation, more potent and selective FLT3 inhibitors are also in development; these agents need to be compared to midostaurin.",,"['Luskin, Marlise R', 'DeAngelo, Daniel J']","['Luskin MR', 'DeAngelo DJ']","['a Department of Medical Oncology , Dana-Farber Cancer Institute , Boston , MA , USA.', 'b Harvard Medical School , Boston , MA , USA.', 'a Department of Medical Oncology , Dana-Farber Cancer Institute , Boston , MA , USA.', 'b Harvard Medical School , Boston , MA , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20171030,England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Drug Approval', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', '*Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Staurosporine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*FLT3', '*Midostaurin', '*PKC412', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*targeted therapy']",2017/10/27 06:00,2018/07/06 06:00,['2017/10/27 06:00'],"['2017/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/06 06:00 [medline]', '2017/10/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17474086.2017.1397510 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2017 Dec;10(12):1033-1045. doi: 10.1080/17474086.2017.1397510.

Besides the contribution of the microenvironment to tumor proliferation and survival, there is direct evidence that interactions between tumor cells and their microenvironment alter sensitivity to anti-cancer agents. Neutrophils, a key player in the innate immune system, have been less studied than many other immune cells regarding their impact on cancer cell response to anti-cancer agents. In our 2D and 3D coculture systems, human neutrophils and differentiated HL60 cells attenuated the sensitivity of various lymphoma cell lines to several anti-cancer agents, including targeted therapies. Neutrophil-induced protection was dependent on cell-cell interaction between CD11b and ICAM-1 expressed by neutrophils and B cells, respectively and was shown to be Mcl-1-dependent. The protective effect of neutrophils was validated in vivo using immune-compromised mice inoculated with human NHL with our without neutrophils then followed by treatment with chemotherapy. Similar findings were made on primary cells purified from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, treated with fludarabine or targeted agents in the presence of autologous neutrophils. In a clinical study, patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with increased neutrophil counts displayed a reduced response rate to therapy.

Yet the patterns and prognostic significance of their expression in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remain unexplored. Here we analyzed the expression patterns of 11 DOCK family genes in AML cells based on the array data of 347 patients from our cohort and several other published datasets. We further focused on the implications of the expression of DOCK1 since it was the only one in DOCK family to be associated with survival. Physiological functions and biological pathways associated with DOCK1 were identified using bioinformatics approaches. With a median follow up of 57 months, higher DOCK1 expression was associated with shorter disease free and overall survival. The finding could be validated by two independent cohorts. Multivariate analysis showed higher DOCK1 expression as a strong independent unfavorable prognostic factor. Higher DOCK1 expression was closely associated with older age, higher platelet and peripheral blast counts, intermediate-risk cytogenetics, FLT3-ITD, MLL-PTD and mutations in PTPN11, NPM1, RUNX1, ASXL1 and DNMT3A. Functional enrichment analysis suggested the association of DOCK1 overexpression with several key physiological pathways including cell proliferation, motility, and chemotaxis. Therefore, we suggested that AML with higher DOCK1 expression showed characteristic clinical and biological features. DOCK1 expression is an important prognostic marker and a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of AML. Studies in large prospective cohorts are necessary to confirm our findings.

The alpha1-adrenergic receptor (alpha1-AR)/TG2-mediated signaling pathway regulated GD3 functions, including gene expression and production, to differentiate CML K562 cells into erythroid lineage cells. Epinephrine, an AR agonist, increased membrane recruitment as well as GTP-photoaffinity of TG2, inducing GD3 synthase gene expression. Epinephrine activated PI3K/Akt signaling and GTPase downstream of TG2 activated Akt. The coupling of TG2 and GD3 production was specifically suppressed by prazosin (alpha1-AR antagonist), but not by propranolol (beta-AR antagonist) or rauwolscine (alpha2-AR antagonist), indicating alpha1-AR specificity. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) experiment results indicated that the alpha1-AR/TG2-mediated signaling pathway activated PKCs alpha and delta to induce GD3 synthase gene expression. Transcription factors CREB, AP-1, and NF-kappaB regulated GD3 synthase gene expression during alpha1-AR-induced differentiation in CML K562 cells. In addition, GD3 synthase gene expression was upregulated in TG2-transfected cells via alpha1-AR with expression of erythroid lineage markers and benzidine-positive staining. alpha1-AR/TG2 signaling pathway-directed GD3 production is a crucial step in erythroid differentiation of K562 cells and GD3 interacts with alpha1-AR/TG2, inducing GD3/alpha1-AR/TG2-mediated erythroid differentiation.

Development of effective new therapies is essential to improve the clinical outcome of AML patients. Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) and lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) play important roles in epigenetic regulation and their altered expressions have been observed in cancer. Although EZH2 and LSD1 have opposite histone methylation functions, we found that both enzymes were paradoxically up-regulated in AML cells. Importantly, a combined inhibition of EZH2 and LSD1 resulted in a synergistic activity against AML in vitro and in vivo. Such synergy was mechanistically correlated with up-regulation of H3K4me1/2 and H3K9Ac and down-regulation of H3K27me3, leading to a decrease of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. These epigenetic alterations also compromised the mitochondrial respiration capacity and glycolytic activity and resulted in ATP depletion, a key event contributing to the potent cytotoxic effect of the drug combination. Taken together, our work identified a novel therapeutic approach against AML by combining two small molecules that inhibit different histone methylation-modulating proteins with apparently opposite enzyme activities. Such a new drug combination strategy likely has significant clinical implications since epigenetic modulators are currently in clinical trials.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We describe a case of a 40 year old woman diagnosed with de novo AML with a novel t(7;14)(q21,q32) and trisomy 4 with poor clinical outcome. Methods: Morphologic, flow cytometry and cytogenetic results of the patient's peripheral blood and bone marrow samples were analyzed. Results: The diagnostic bone marrow was hypercellular for age (>95%) with increased blasts (62%) that by flow cytometry exhibited myeloid differentiation with a few T/NK lineage markers. Cytogenetics showed a t(7;14)(q21,q32) and trisomy 4. The patient had extremely poor response to two rounds of induction chemotherapy with persistent leukemia following therapy. Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, the t(7;14) is a novel cytogenetic abnormality that has not been reported previously in acute myeloid leukemia, and is important to report as it appears to be associated with poor prognosis.","['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2017.

The Arbeitsgemeinschaft fuer Gynaekologische Onkologie (AGO) trial compared intense dose-dense (idd) adjuvant chemotherapy with conventionally scheduled chemotherapy in high-risk BC patients. Here we report the final, 10-year follow-up analysis. Patients and methods: Enrolment took place between December 1998 and April 2003. A total of 1284 patients with 4 or more involved axillary lymph nodes were randomly assigned to receive 3 courses each of idd sequential epirubicin, paclitaxel and cyclophosphamide (iddEPC) q2w or standard epirubicin/cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel (EC --> P) q3w. Event-free survival (EFS) was the primary end point. Results: A total of 658 patients were assigned to receive iddEPC and 626 patients were assigned to receive EC --> P. The median duration of follow-up was 122 months. EFS was 47% (95% CI 43% to 52%) in the standard group and 56% (95% CI 52% to 60%) in the iddEPC group [hazard ratio (HR) 0.74, 95% CI 0.63-0.87; log-rank P = 0.00014, one-sided]. This benefit was independent of menopausal, hormone receptor or HER2 status. Ten-year overall survival (OS) was 59% (95% CI 55% to 63%) for patients in the standard group and 69% (95% CI 65% to 73%) for patients in the iddEPC group (HR = 0.72, 95% CI 0.60-0.87; log-rank P = 0.0007, two-sided). Nine versus two cases of secondary myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome were observed in the iddEPC and the EC --> P arm, respectively. Conclusion: The previously reported OS benefit of iddEPC in comparison to conventionally dosed EC --> P has been further increased and achieved an absolute difference of 10% after 10 years of follow-up.","['(c) The Author 2017.

In very rare cases, immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) can be a complication of CMML (""CMML-associated ITP""). However, treatment of severe thrombocytopenia in patients with CMML is still a challenge. PATIENT CONCERNS: Case 1 was a 61-year-old female patient admitted to our hospital because of skin petechiae and purpura for 6 days. She had increased monocyte cell count (1.82 x 10/L), markedly decreased platelet count (2 x 10/L), hypercellularity of the megakaryocyte lineage with many immature megakaryocytes, and ZRSR2(zinc finger CCCH-type, RNA binding motif and serine/arginine rich 2) mutation. She failed to the treatment of corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), TPO (thrombopoietin), and cyclosporin A (CsA). Case 2 was a 72-year-old female patient with thrombocytosis and monocytosis for 4 years, and thrombocytopenia for 6 months. After 10 courses of decitabine therapy, she had a persistent severe thrombocytopenia and decreased number of megakaryocytes, TET2 (tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2) and SRSF2 (serine and arginine rich splicing factor 2) mutations were detected. She was dependent on platelet transfusion. DIAGNOSES: Case 1 was diagnosed as CMML-associated ITP, and case 2 as CMML with decitabine therapy-induced thrombocytopenia. INTERVENTIONS: Both patients were treated with eltrombopag. OUTCOMES: In both patients, the platelet counts returned to the normal within 1 week after eltrombopag therapy. The platelet count in case 1 patient remained stable at 141-200 x 10/L for 20 months with stopping therapy for 3 months. In case 2 patient, eltrombopag was stopped 1 month later. Her platelet count decreased to 41 x 10/L, but was stable at approximately 30 x 10/L for 3 months with platelet transfusion independency for 12 months. Both patients had no adverse effects with eltrombopag. LESSONS: CMML-associated ITP is very rare and easily misdiagnosed. To the best of our knowledge, case 1 is the first reported case of the successful treatment of CMML-associated ITP with eltrombopag. Both CMML-associated ITP and decitabine therapy-induced thrombocytopenia in these 2 patients were highly sensitive and safe to eltrombopag therapy.",,"['Gao, Yayue', 'Gong, Ming', 'Zhang, Chunxia', 'Kong, Xudong', 'Ma, Yigai']","['Gao Y', 'Gong M', 'Zhang C', 'Kong X', 'Ma Y']","['Department of Hematology Department of Pharmacology, China-Japan Friendship Hospital, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,IM,"['Aged', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/adverse effects', 'Azacitidine/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives', 'Benzoates/*administration & dosage', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Decitabine', 'Dioxygenases', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Female', 'Hematologic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Hydrazines/*administration & dosage', '*Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/blood/complications/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Platelet Count/methods', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', '*Purpura, Thrombocytopenic, Idiopathic/diagnosis/drug therapy/etiology/physiopathology', 'Pyrazoles/*administration & dosage', 'Ribonucleoproteins/genetics', 'Serine-Arginine Splicing Factors/genetics', '*Thrombocytopenia/chemically induced/diagnosis/drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Thrombopoietin/*agonists', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2017/10/27 06:00,2017/11/02 06:00,['2017/10/26 06:00'],"['2017/10/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000008337 [doi]', '00005792-201710270-00034 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2017 Oct;96(43):e8337. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000008337.,PMC5671840,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Benzoates)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Hematologic Agents)', '0 (Hydrazines)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Ribonucleoproteins)', '0 (ZRSR2 protein, human)', '147153-65-9 (SRSF2 protein, human)', '170974-22-8 (Serine-Arginine Splicing Factors)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Dioxygenases)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (TET2 protein, human)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)', 'S56D65XJ9G (eltrombopag)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to study whether the expression of immune system-associated miRNAs would differ between adult and pediatric patients with ALL at the time of diagnosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Inflammation-associated miRNA analysis was performed in 19 adults and 79 pediatric patients with ALL and involved miR-10, miR-15, miR-16, miR-17-92 cluster, miR-33, miR-146a, miR-150, miR-155, miR-181a, miR-222, miR-223, and miR-339. MiRNAs were first analyzed by miRNA microarray and thereafter validated by qRT-PCR. Sufficient RNA for qRT-PCR was available for 42 pediatric and 19 adult patients. RESULTS: Of the studied miRNAs, only miR-18a differed significantly in microarray analysis between adult and pediatric ALL, being lower in children (FC, -3.74; P, 0.0037). Results were confirmed by qRT-PCR (down-regulated in pediatric patients, P 0.003161). The other members of the miR-17-92 cluster did not differ significantly. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric and adult patients with ALL have remarkably similar patterns of immune-cell-associated miRNAs in their bone marrow at diagnosis.

We sought to comprehensively profile pediatric AML microRNA (miRNA) samples to identify dysregulated genes and assess the utility of miRNAs for improved outcome prediction. Patients and Methods To identify miRNA biomarkers that are associated with treatment failure, we performed a comprehensive sequence-based characterization of the pediatric AML miRNA landscape. miRNA sequencing was performed on 1,362 samples-1,303 primary, 22 refractory, and 37 relapse samples. One hundred sixty-four matched samples-127 primary and 37 relapse samples-were analyzed by using RNA sequencing. Results By using penalized lasso Cox proportional hazards regression, we identified 36 miRNAs the expression levels at diagnosis of which were highly associated with event-free survival. Combined expression of the 36 miRNAs was used to create a novel miRNA-based risk classification scheme (AMLmiR36). This new miRNA-based risk classifier identifies those patients who are at high risk (hazard ratio, 2.830; P </= .001) or low risk (hazard ratio, 0.323; P </= .001) of experiencing treatment failure, independent of conventional karyotype or mutation status. The performance of AMLmiR36 was independently assessed by using 878 patients from two different clinical trials (AAML0531 and AAML1031). Our analysis also revealed that miR-106a-363 was abundantly expressed in relapse and refractory samples, and several candidate targets of miR-106a-5p were involved in oxidative phosphorylation, a process that is suppressed in treatment-resistant leukemic cells. Conclusion To assess the utility of miRNAs for outcome prediction in patients with pediatric AML, we designed and validated a miRNA-based risk classification scheme. We also hypothesized that the abundant expression of miR-106a could increase treatment resistance via modulation of genes that are involved in oxidative phosphorylation.",,"['Lim, Emilia L', 'Trinh, Diane L', 'Ries, Rhonda E', 'Wang, Jim', 'Gerbing, Robert B', 'Ma, Yussanne', 'Topham, James', 'Hughes, Maya', 'Pleasance, Erin', 'Mungall, Andrew J', 'Moore, Richard', 'Zhao, Yongjun', 'Aplenc, Richard', 'Sung, Lillian', 'Kolb, E Anders', 'Gamis, Alan', 'Smith, Malcolm', 'Gerhard, Daniela S', 'Alonzo, Todd A', 'Meshinchi, Soheil', 'Marra, Marco A']","['Lim EL', 'Trinh DL', 'Ries RE', 'Wang J', 'Gerbing RB', 'Ma Y', 'Topham J', 'Hughes M', 'Pleasance E', 'Mungall AJ', 'Moore R', 'Zhao Y', 'Aplenc R', 'Sung L', 'Kolb EA', 'Gamis A', 'Smith M', 'Gerhard DS', 'Alonzo TA', 'Meshinchi S', 'Marra MA']","[""Emilia L.

Nevertheless, intrinsic and acquired resistance remains an obstacle for the potential application of the inhibitor in the treatment of the disease. Here we report that Mcl-1 is important for survival of colon cancer cells in the presence of AUY922. Mcl-1 was upregulated in mutant KRAS colon cancer cells selected for resistance to AUY922-induced apoptosis. This was due to its increased stability mediated by Bcl-2-associated athanogene domain 3 (BAG3), which was also increased in resistant colon cancer cells by heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) as a result of chronic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Functional investigations demonstrated that inhibition of Mcl-1, BAG3, or HSF1 triggered apoptosis in resistant colon cancer cells, and rendered AUY922-naive colon cancer cells more sensitive to the inhibitor. Together, these results identify that the HSF1-BAG3-Mcl-1 signal axis is critical for protection of mutant KRAS colon cancer cells from AUY922-induced apoptosis, with potential implications for targeting HSF1/BAG3/Mcl-1 to improve the efficacy of AUY922 in the treatment of colon cancer.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Wang, Chun Yan', 'Guo, Su Tang', 'Croft, Amanda', 'Yan, Xu Guang', 'Jin, Lei', 'Zhang, Xu Dong', 'Jiang, Chen Chen']","['Wang CY', 'Guo ST', 'Croft A', 'Yan XG', 'Jin L', 'Zhang XD', 'Jiang CC']","['School of Biomedical Sciences and Pharmacy, The University of Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia.', 'School of Biomedical Sciences and Pharmacy, The University of Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia.', 'School of Biomedical Sciences and Pharmacy, The University of Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia.', 'School of Biomedical Sciences and Pharmacy, The University of Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia.', 'School of Medicine and Public Health, The University of Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia.', 'School of Biomedical Sciences and Pharmacy, The University of Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia.', 'School of Medicine and Public Health, The University of Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171114,United States,Mol Carcinog,Molecular carcinogenesis,8811105,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*metabolism', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Heat Shock Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Isoxazoles/*pharmacology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/*metabolism', 'Resorcinols/*pharmacology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*AUY922', '*BAG3', '*Mcl-1', '*colon cancer', '*heat shock protein 90']",2017/10/27 06:00,2018/11/21 06:00,['2017/10/26 06:00'],"['2017/05/26 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/05 00:00 [revised]', '2017/10/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/21 06:00 [medline]', '2017/10/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mc.22755 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Carcinog. 2018 Feb;57(2):284-294. doi: 10.1002/mc.22755.

AIM: The aim of this study is to determine, in the case of the Abbott Architect rHTLV I/II assay, whether a signal/cut-off (S/CO) ratio higher than the manufacturer's recommendation of 1.0 could be applied to diagnose significant HTLV-1 seroreactivity. BACKGROUND: The detection of human T cell leukaemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infection is primarily based on serology often utilising random access platforms. Although current assays have high sensitivity and specificity, in low-prevalence regions, significant numbers of false-positive reactions occur. A comprehensive follow-up is difficult within the time frame of organ donation. This can lead to donor tissue wastage. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 12 250 samples previously tested on the Abbott Architect rHTLV I/II platform and further tested by confirmatory serology/molecular detection to determine the sensitivity and positive predictive value in the S/CO ratio range was conducted. RESULTS: Where the sample S/CO ratio was >20 (n = 498), HTLV infection was confirmed in all but eight subjects. All of these eight had indeterminate confirmatory results, and none were found to be uninfected. Conversely, in the samples within the S/CO ratio range 1-4 (n = 271), no subject was subsequently found to be HTLV-infected although HTLV infection could not be excluded in all cases, primarily due to lack of follow-up samples (n = 60/271). CONCLUSIONS: Samples with an S/CO ratio of <4.0 on the Abbott Architect rHTLV I/II platform represent a low risk of HTLV infection in the UK, and organs from such donors might reasonably be considered for transplantation, within the context of appropriate risk-benefit assessment.","['(c) 2017 The Authors.

There are few studies, however, on the monitoring of multiple fusion transcripts and evaluation of their accuracy as indicators of MRD at multiple time points. METHODS: We retrospectively examined RNA obtained from 82 pediatric AML patients enrolled in the Japanese Pediatric Leukemia/Lymphoma Study Group (JPLSG) AML-05 study. The expression of six important fusion transcripts (AML1(RUNX1)-ETO, CBFB-MYH11, MLL(KMT2A)-AF9, MLL-ELL, MLL-AF6, and FUS-ERG) was analyzed at five time points 30-40 days apart following diagnosis. RESULTS: In patients with AML1-ETO (n = 36 at time point 5), all six patients with >3,000 copies and four of 30 patients with </=3,000 copies relapsed. AML1-ETO transcripts persisted during treatment even in patients without relapse, as well as CBFB-MYH11 transcripts. In contrast, in patients with MLL-AF9 (n = 9 at time point 5), two patients were positive for MLL-AF9 expression (>50 copies) and both relapsed. Only one of seven MLL-AF9-negative patients relapsed. In the AML1-ETO group, MRD-positive patients (>3,000 copies at time point 5) had significantly lower relapse-free survival (RFS; P < 0.0001) and overall survival (OS; P = 0.009) than MRD-negative patients. Similarly, in the MLL-AF9 group, MRD-positive patients (>50 copies at time point 5) had significantly lower RFS (P = 0.002) and OS (P = 0.002) than MRD-negative patients. CONCLUSIONS: Detection of MLL-AF9 transcripts on real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction is a promising marker of relapse in pediatric AML. In contrast, the clinical utility of detecting AML1-ETO and CBFB-MYH11 expression is limited, although higher AML1-ETO expression can be a potential predictor of relapse when assessed according to an optimal threshold.",['(c) 2017 Japan Pediatric Society.'],"['Matsuo, Hidemasa', 'Iijima-Yamashita, Yuka', 'Yamada, Miho', 'Deguchi, Takao', 'Kiyokawa, Nobutaka', 'Shimada, Akira', 'Tawa, Akio', 'Tomizawa, Daisuke', 'Taga, Takashi', 'Kinoshita, Akitoshi', 'Adachi, Souichi', 'Horibe, Keizo']","['Matsuo H', 'Iijima-Yamashita Y', 'Yamada M', 'Deguchi T', 'Kiyokawa N', 'Shimada A', 'Tawa A', 'Tomizawa D', 'Taga T', 'Kinoshita A', 'Adachi S', 'Horibe K']","['Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center, Aichi, Japan.', 'Department of Human Health Sciences, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Kyoto University Hospital, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center, Aichi, Japan.', 'Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center, Aichi, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Mie University, Mie, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Research, National Research Institute for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Okayama University Hospital, Okayama, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Osaka National Hospital, Osaka, Japan.', ""Division of Leukemia and Lymphoma, Children's Cancer Center, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Shiga University of Medical Science, Shiga, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, St Marianna University School of Medicine, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Department of Human Health Sciences, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center, Aichi, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Australia,Pediatr Int,Pediatrics international : official journal of the Japan Pediatric Society,100886002,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/metabolism', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies']",['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'fusion gene', 'minimal residual disease', 'polymerase chain reaction', 'prognosis']",2017/10/27 06:00,2018/06/21 06:00,['2017/10/26 06:00'],"['2017/07/23 00:00 [received]', '2017/09/10 00:00 [revised]', '2017/10/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/21 06:00 [medline]', '2017/10/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ped.13440 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Int. 2018 Jan;60(1):41-46. doi: 10.1111/ped.13440.,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)']",,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7578-006X'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A reliable screening method based on pattern recognition of 8-OHdG using stochastic sensors designed with graphene materials decorated with nanoparticles of TiO2Ag or TiO2Au was developed. 5,10,15,20-Tetraphenyl-21H,23H porphyrin (P), 2,6-bis((E)-2-(furan-2-yl)vinyl)-4-(4,6,8-trimethylazulen-1-yl)pyridine (Py1), and 2,6-bis((E)-2-(thiophen-3-yl)vinyl)-4-(4,6,8-trimethylazulen-1-yl)pyridine (Py2) were used as modifiers of the graphene paste in the design of sensors. The screening method used for pattern recognition was developed for two pH values accordingly with the nature of the biological fluid to be screened: pH = 3.02 for urine samples and pH = 7.49 for whole blood samples. High sensitivities and low limits of determination for 8-OHdG obtained at both pH values favored the early detection of leukemia.

METHODS: After IRB approval, all MDS/AML patients hospitalized at the University of Maryland Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center between August 2011 and December 2013 were identified. Medical charts were reviewed for demographics, clinical information, development of CDI, complications of CDI, and mortality. Patients with CDI, defined as having a positive stool PCR done for clinical suspicion of CDI, were compared to those without CDI in order to identify predictors of disease. A t-test was used for comparison of continuous variables and chi-square or Fisher's exact tests were used for categorical variables, as appropriate. RESULTS: Two hundred and twenty-three patients (60.1% male, mean age 61.3 years, 13% MDS, 87% AML) had 594 unique hospitalizations during the study period. Thirty-four patients (15.2%) were diagnosed with CDI. Factors significantly associated with CDI included lower albumin at time of hospitalization (P < 0.0001), prior diagnosis of CDI (P < 0.0001), receipt of cytarabine-based chemotherapy (P = 0.015), total days of neutropenia (P = 0.014), and total days of hospitalization (P = 0.005). Gender (P = 0.10), age (P = 0.77), proton-pump inhibitor use (P = 0.73), receipt of antibiotics (P = 0.66), and receipt of DNA hypomethylating agent-based chemotherapy (P = 0.92) were not significantly associated with CDI. CONCLUSION: CDI is common in the MDS/AML population. Factors significantly associated with CDI in this population include low albumin, prior CDI, use of cytarabine-based chemotherapy, and prolonged neutropenia.

ETP leukemia is a form of T-cell ALL (T-ALL) with poor prognosis. The NUP214-ABL1 gene is present in ~6% of T-ALL cases, however the prevalence of NUP214-ABL1 gene expression in ETP-ALL in particular has not yet been verified. The current study reports the rare case of a 29-year-old man with ETP-ALL harboring the NUP214-ABL1 fusion gene, presenting with low-grade fever, stomachache and splenomegaly. The patient was successfully treated with dasatinib and vincristine, idarubicin, cyclophosphamide and prednisone (VICP) chemotherapy. The therapeutic efficacy of selinexor and dasatinib was also evaluated in vitro. Apoptosis was analyzed using Annexin V/propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry, and poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage was detected using western blot analysis. The results demonstrated that the apoptotic cell population significantly increased following selinexor or dasatinib treatment compared with the control (P<0.05). Furthermore, combined selinexor and dasatinib treatment led to a significant increase in cell apoptosis compared with either treatment alone (P<0.05). The apoptosis results were confirmed by PARP cleavage. Thus, NUP214-ABL1 fusion gene expression should be tested in T-ALL, including ETP-ALL. Dasatinib used in combination with traditional induction chemotherapy may reverse the high induction failure of ETP-ALL with NUP214-ABL1 fusion gene; however, further prospective studies are required to confirm this. Therefore, selinexor with or without dasatinib may serve as a potential salvage therapy in the case of relapse and may be developed as a novel treatment for ETP-ALL with the NUP214-ABL1 fusion gene.",,"['Chen, Yan', 'Zhang, Li', 'Huang, Jiankun', 'Hong, Xiuli', 'Zhao, Jiangning', 'Wang, Zhao', 'Zhang, Kejie']","['Chen Y', 'Zhang L', 'Huang J', 'Hong X', 'Zhao J', 'Wang Z', 'Zhang K']","['Department of Hematology, Zhongshan Hospital, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian 361004, P.R.

Mutations in the C-terminal domain of NPM that impair native folding and localization are associated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We have performed a high-throughput screening searching for compounds that stabilize the C-terminal domain. We identified three hit compounds which show the ability to increase the thermal stability of both the C-terminal domain as well as full-length NPM. The best hit also seemed to favor folding of an AML-like mutant. Computational pocket identification and molecular docking support a stabilization mechanism based on binding of the phenyl/benzene group of the compounds to a particular hydrophobic pocket and additional polar interactions with solvent-accessible residues.

The cell functions of cyclin D1 depend on its partners and/or subcellular distribution, resulting in different oncogenic properties. We observed the accumulation of cyclin D1 in the cytoplasm of a subset of MCL cell lines and primary cells. In primary cells, this cytoplasmic distribution was correlated with a more frequent blastoid phenotype. We performed immunoprecipitation assays and mass spectrometry on enriched cytosolic fractions from two cell lines. The cyclin D1 interactome was found to include several factors involved in adhesion, migration and invasion. We found that the accumulation of cyclin D1 in the cytoplasm was associated with higher levels of migration and invasiveness. We also showed that MCL cells with high cytoplasmic levels of cyclin D1 engrafted more rapidly into the bone marrow, spleen, and brain in immunodeficient mice. Both migration and invasion processes, both in vivo and in vitro, were counteracted by the exportin 1 inhibitor KPT-330, which retains cyclin D1 in the nucleus.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 2003 to December 2014, 72 children diagnosed with pre-B ALL were analyzed. We analyzed the prognostic value of DI and its relations with other prognostic factors. RESULTS: The DI cut-point of 1.16 did not discriminate significantly the groups between high and low survivals (DI>/=1.16 versus <1.16; 5-year OS, 90.5% vs. 82.8%, p=0.665). We explored the survivals according to the level of DI (<1.00, 1.00, 1.01-1.30, 1.31-1.60, 1.61-1.90, and >1.90), and the survival of children with a DI between 1.00-1.90 were significantly higher than that of children with DI of <1.00 or >1.90 (5-year OS, 90.6% vs. 50.0%, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The DI of 1.16 was not a significant cut-point discriminating the risk group in children with pre-B ALL. However, the DI divided by specific ranges of values remained an independent prognostic factor. Further studies are warranted to re-evaluate the prognostic value and cut-point of DI in children treated with recent treatment protocols.","['(c) 2017 by the Association of Clinical Scientists, Inc.']","['Noh, O Kyu', 'Park, Se Jin', 'Park, Hyeon Jin', 'Ju, HeeYoung', 'Han, Seung Hyon', 'Jung, Hyun Joo', 'Park, Jun Eun']","['Noh OK', 'Park SJ', 'Park HJ', 'Ju H', 'Han SH', 'Jung HJ', 'Park JE']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon.', 'Department of Biomedical Informatics, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon.', 'Center for Pediatric Cancer, National Cancer Center, Goyang, Republic of Korea.', 'Center for Pediatric Cancer, National Cancer Center, Goyang, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon pedpje@ajou.ac.kr.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",,United States,Ann Clin Lab Sci,Annals of clinical and laboratory science,0410247,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Cancer Care Facilities', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'Diploidy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hospitals, University', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', '*Ploidies', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Republic of Korea', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Survival Analysis']",['NOTNLM'],"['Ploidies', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia', 'Prognosis']",2017/10/27 06:00,2018/01/27 06:00,['2017/10/26 06:00'],"['2017/10/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/27 06:00 [medline]']",['47/5/535 [pii]'],ppublish,Ann Clin Lab Sci. 2017 Sep;47(5):535-540.,,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In January 2013, Centers for Disease and Prevention (CDC) introduced a new surveillance definition of mucosal barrier injury-associated laboratory-confirmed bloodstream infection (MBI-LCBI). This study was to determine the impact of MBI-LCBI on CLABSIs and compare the clinical characteristics of MBI versus non-MBI-LCBI cases. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 250 consecutive patients. They were admitted in department of hematology at Aichi Medical University Hospital. We applied the revised 2013 CLABSI surveillance protocol to all CLABSI cases identified during the 47-months period from May 2012 through June 2016. RESULTS: A total of 44 CLABSIs were identified. The median patient age was 65 years (range, 12 to 89). Among 44 patients, 31 patients were diagnosed as leukemia (70.5%) and 12 patients as lymphoma (27.3%). Six patients underwent bone transplantation for leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (13.6%). A total of 20 patients (45.5%) were classified as MBI-LCBI and 24 (54.5%) were classified as non-MBI-LCBI. The primary disease type (P = 0.018), neutropenic within 3 days before CLABSI (MBI-LCBI vs. non-MBI-LCBI: 95.0% vs. 26.3%, P = <0.0001), line(s) removed owing to CLABSI (15.0% vs. 54.2%, P = 0.011) and Gram-negative organisms cultured (70.0% vs. 37.5%, P = 0.004) showed significantly difference between the groups. CONCLUSION: Our data showed that MBI-LCBI cases account for 45.5% of the CLABSI cases identified in blood cancer patients, and constituted a significant burden to this high-risk patient population.","['Copyright (c) 2017 Japanese Society of Chemotherapy and The Japanese Association', 'for Infectious Diseases.

The comparative in vitro studies using the ligand 1, the complex 2, CuCl2x2H2O salt (salt 3) and the 1:2 mixture of the salt 3 and ligand 1 (mixture 4) were performed on normal (WI38), human carcinoma (HeLa, CaCo2, MiaPaCa2, SW620), lymphoma (Raji) and leukemia (K562) cell lines. Significantly elevated concentration of the intracellular copper after treatment of K562 cells and HeLa cells during 2h with complex 2 (7.83 vs. 5.4 times) was detected by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Cytotoxicity was analyzed by MTT assay. We found that antiproliferative capacity of the tested compounds varies (IC50 after 72h of exposure: 0.6x10(-6)M to>100x10(-6)M). Leukemia and lymphoma cells were found the most sensitive to complex 2 which showed more than 100 times higher in vitro activity against K562 cells than ligand 1. Apoptotic morphological changes, an externalization of phosphatydilserine, and changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential of treated cells were found. The caspase-3 activity in HeLa and K562 cells was measured by caspase-3 colorimetric assay kit. Caspase-3 was not activated in the treated K562 cells while salt 3 and the mixture 4 in the HeLa cells significantly increased tested enzyme activity. These findings suggest that copper(II) in the molecular complex 2 by improving entry of the N-1-tosylcytosine 1 into cells increases its antiproliferative capacity. In summary, the present study demonstrated that complex 2 possesses an antileukemic effect on K562 cells, and its anticancer activity was attributed with induction of apoptosis. The exact mechanism of apoptosis induction by complex 2 must be further investigated.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier GmbH.

These organelles, composed of caveolin and cavin proteins, are important for cellular signaling and survival. Caveolae play incompletely defined roles in human kidneys. Induction of caveolin-1/CAV1 in diseased tubules has been described previously, but the responsible mechanism remains to be defined. METHODS: Healthy and atrophying human kidneys were stained for caveolar proteins, (caveolin 1-3 and cavin 1-4) and examined by electron microscopy. Induction of caveolar proteins was studied in isolated proximal tubules and primary renal epithelial cells. These cells were challenged with hypoxia or H2O2. Primary tubular cells were also subjected to viral overexpression of megakaryoblastic leukemia 1 (MKL1) and MKL1 inhibition by the MKL1 inhibitor CCG-1423. Putative coregulators of MKL1 activity were investigated by Western blotting for suppressor of cancer cell invasion (SCAI) and filamin A (FLNA). Finally, correlative bioinformatic studies of mRNA expression of caveolar proteins and MKL1 were performed. RESULTS: In healthy kidneys, caveolar proteins were expressed by the parietal epithelial cells (PECs) of Bowman's capsule, endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle. Electron microscopy confirmed caveolae in the PECs. No expression was seen in proximal tubules. In contrast, caveolar proteins were expressed in proximal tubules undergoing atrophy. Caveolar proteins were also induced in cultures of primary epithelial tubular cells. Expression was not enhanced by hypoxia or free radical stress (H2O2), but proved sensitive to inhibition of MKL1. Viral overexpression of MKL1 induced caveolin-1/CAV1, caveolin-2/CAV2 and SDPR/CAVIN2. In kidney tissue, the mRNA level of MKL1 correlated with the mRNA levels for caveolin-1/CAV1, caveolin-2/CAV2 and the archetypal MKL1 target tenascin C (TNC), as did the MKL1 coactivator FLNA. Costaining for TNC as readout for MKL1 activity demonstrated overlap with caveolin-1/CAV1 expression in PECs as well as in atrophic segments of proximal tubules. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the view that MKL1 contributes to the expression of caveolar proteins in healthy kidneys and orchestrates the induction of tubular caveolar proteins in renal injury.",,"['Krawczyk, Krzysztof M', 'Hansson, Jennifer', 'Nilsson, Helen', 'Krawczyk, Katarzyna K', 'Sward, Karl', 'Johansson, Martin E']","['Krawczyk KM', 'Hansson J', 'Nilsson H', 'Krawczyk KK', 'Sward K', 'Johansson ME']","['Department of Translational Medicine, Clinical Pathology, Lund University, SUS Malmo, Jan Waldenstroms gata 59, SE-20502, Malmo, Sweden.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Translational Medicine, Clinical Pathology, Lund University, SUS Malmo, Jan Waldenstroms gata 59, SE-20502, Malmo, Sweden.', 'Department of Experimental Medical Science, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Experimental Medical Science, Lund University, Lund, Sweden. karl.sward@med.lu.se.', 'Department of Translational Medicine, Clinical Pathology, Lund University, SUS Malmo, Jan Waldenstroms gata 59, SE-20502, Malmo, Sweden. martin.johansson@med.lu.se.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20171024,England,BMC Nephrol,BMC nephrology,100967793,IM,"['Acute Kidney Injury/chemically induced/*metabolism', 'Caveolae/drug effects/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Caveolin 1/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/toxicity', 'Kidney Tubules/drug effects/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Kidney Tubules, Proximal/drug effects/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Trans-Activators/*physiology']",['NOTNLM'],"['Caveolae', 'Caveolin', 'Cavin', 'FLNA', 'Kidney fibrosis', 'MKL1', 'SCAI']",2017/10/27 06:00,2018/06/14 06:00,['2017/10/26 06:00'],"['2016/11/11 00:00 [received]', '2017/09/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12882-017-0738-8 [doi]', '10.1186/s12882-017-0738-8 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Nephrol. 2017 Oct 24;18(1):320. doi: 10.1186/s12882-017-0738-8.,PMC5655893,"['0 (CAV1 protein, human)', '0 (CAVIN1 protein, human)', '0 (Caveolin 1)', '0 (MRTFA protein, human)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)']",,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8510-3102'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous research has demonstrated that chalcones exhibit a wide variety of biological activities, including anticancer, antifungal, and antibiotic properties. OBJECTIVE: Our goal is to synthesize novel heterocyclic-containing chalcones and have their biological activities evaluated. Methods Sixteen chalcones were synthesized by the crossed aldol condensation of substituted tetralones with substituted pyridinylaldehydes. The products were purified by recrystallization in MeOH/H2O and characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and HRMS. Anticancer assays were performed by NCI (National Cancer Institute) against the NCI-60 panel of 60 different human cancer cell lines, including leukemia, non-small-cell lung cancer, colon, central nervous system, melanoma, ovarian, renal, prostate, and breast cancer. Antimicrobial assays were performed by COADD (Community for Open Antimicrobial Drug Discovery) against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii, and Candida albicans. RESULT: Chalcone 3d had demonstrated growth inhibition greater than 60% against a variety of cancers: leukemia (MOLT-4, SR), non-small cell lung cancer (NCI-H522), colon cancer (HCT- 116), prostate cancer (DU-145), and breast cancer (MCF7, MDA-MB-468) and was also cytotoxic to three different cell lines (CCRF-CEM, RPMI-8226, and KM12). 5c was active against leukemia (CCRF-CEM, RPMI-8226, SR) and breast cancer (MCF7) and 5e was active only against leukemia (RPMI-8226, SR). 5h was partially active and the best compound with growth inhibition of MRSA by 75%. 3b was the best compound against EC, KP, and PA and 3f had the greatest activity against AB. For fungi, 3f and 3e demonstrated the best growth inhibition. CONCLUSION: A small library of heterocyclic-containing chalcones was developed and initial screening demonstrates modest activity against cancers, bacteria, and fungi.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.org.']","['Gibson, Maya Z', 'Nguyen, Minh A', 'Zingales, Sarah K']","['Gibson MZ', 'Nguyen MA', 'Zingales SK']","['Department of Chemistry & Physics, Georgia Southern University, Savannah, GA, United States.', 'Department of Chemistry & Physics, Georgia Southern University, Savannah, GA, United States.', 'Department of Chemistry & Physics, Georgia Southern University, Savannah, GA, United States.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Med Chem,Medicinal chemistry (Shariqah (United Arab Emirates)),101240303,IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Antifungal Agents/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Candida albicans/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chalcones/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cryptococcus neoformans/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Molecular Structure', 'Pyridines/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Staphylococcus aureus/drug effects', 'Tetralones/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology']",['NOTNLM'],"['Aldol condensation', 'antibacterial', 'anticancer', 'chalcones', 'pyridine', 'tetralone.']",2017/10/27 06:00,2018/08/18 06:00,['2017/10/26 06:00'],"['2017/05/10 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/11 00:00 [revised]', '2017/10/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/18 06:00 [medline]', '2017/10/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['MC-EPUB-86463 [pii]', '10.2174/1573406413666171020121244 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Chem. 2018;14(4):333-343. doi: 10.2174/1573406413666171020121244.,,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Chalcones)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Tetralones)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patient started treatment with sertraline three months after starting imatinib. From the beginning of sertraline treatment, the patient developed vomiting, and five weeks later she developed a severe hepatic failure and was admitted to the hospital. The Naranjo nomogram showed a probable correlation between this adverse effect and the interaction between imatinib and sertraline. This interaction is extremely rare and the mechanism of action is not clear; it could be a mix of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic processes.

We report herein the development of a microfluidic voltage-assisted liquid desorption electrospray ionization (VAL-DESI) source to overcome this limitation. Liquid DESI is achieved for the first time in a microfluidic format. Direct analysis of urine, serum, and cell lysate samples by using the proposed microfluidic VAL-DESI-MS/MS method to detect chemical compounds of biomedical interest, including nucleosides, monoamines, amino acids, and peptides is demonstrated. Analyzing a set of urine samples spiked with dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) showed that the assay had a linear calibration curve with r(2) value of 0.997 and a limit of detection of 0.055 muM DOPA. The method was applied to simultaneous quantification of nucleosides, that is, cytidine, adenosine, uridine, thymidine, and guanosine in cell lysates using 8-bromoadenosine as internal standard. Adenosine was found most abundant at 26.5 +/- 0.57 nmol/10(6) cells, while thymidine was least at 3.1 +/- 0.31 nmol/10(6) cells. Interestingly, the ratio of adenosine to deoxyadenosine varied significantly from human red blood cells (1.07 +/- 0.06) to cancerous cells, including lymphoblast TK6 (0.52 +/- 0.02), skin melanoma C32 (0.82 +/- 0.04), and promyelocytic leukemia NB4 cells (0.38 +/- 0.06). These results suggest that the VAL-DESI-MS/MS technique has a good potential in direct analysis of biofluids. Further, because of the simplicity in its design and operation, the proposed microfluidic liquid DESI source can be fabricated as a disposable device for point-of-care measurements.",,"['Li, Xiangtang', 'Xu, Rui', 'Wei, Xin', 'Hu, Hankun', 'Zhao, Shulin', 'Liu, Yi-Ming']","['Li X', 'Xu R', 'Wei X', 'Hu H', 'Zhao S', 'Liu YM']","['Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Jackson State University , Jackson, Mississippi 39217, United States.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Jackson State University , Jackson, Mississippi 39217, United States.', 'Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University , Wuhan 430071, China.', 'Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University , Wuhan 430071, China.', 'State Key Laboratory for the Chemistry and Molecular Engineering of Medicinal Resources, Guangxi Normal University , Guilin 541004, China.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Jackson State University , Jackson, Mississippi 39217, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20171103,United States,Anal Chem,Analytical chemistry,0370536,IM,"['Caffeine/*blood/chemistry/*urine', 'Erythrocytes/chemistry', 'Humans', '*Microfluidic Analytical Techniques', 'Molecular Structure', '*Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,2017/10/27 06:00,2019/04/16 06:00,['2017/10/26 06:00'],"['2017/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/16 06:00 [medline]', '2017/10/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.analchem.7b02398 [doi]'],ppublish,Anal Chem. 2017 Nov 21;89(22):12014-12022. doi: 10.1021/acs.analchem.7b02398.

CARs consist of a single chain variable fragment (scFv) of a monoclonal antibody, a spacer domain, a transmembrane domain, an intracellular signaling domain, and additional costimulatory domains. The bulk of clinical data available is on CD19-targeting CAR T cells for the treatment of B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (B-ALL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Results so far have been promising with impressive rates and depth of remission especially among B-ALL patients. However, CAR T-cell therapy is a complex multi-step process, and clinical trials so far differ profoundly in CAR construct used, gene transfer method, composition of the cellular product, lymphodepletion, and CAR T-cell dose used. Randomized trials will be needed to conclusively evaluate the implications of these differences. The treatment concept is associated with significant neurotoxicity and potentially lethal cytokine release syndrome, both of which require specific management. Improvements in CAR design may help to overcome toxicity, the effects of an immunosuppressive microenvironment, and tumor escape by development of antigen-negative clones. This review will explain the mechanism of action, summarize the clinical experience with this treatment modality so far, and explore future developments in the field.","['(c) 2017 S.

CD123 has been shown to be a unique marker of leukaemic stem cells within the CD34+CD38- compartment. The aim of this study was to identify the percentage of CD34+CD38-CD123+ cells in AML blasts, AML CD34+CD38- stem cells, and normal and regenerating bone marrow CD34+CD38- stem cells from non-myeloid malignancies. METHODS: Thirty-eight adult de novo AML patients with intention to treat were enrolled after the application of inclusion criteria from February 2012 to February 2017. The percentage of the CD34+CD38-CD123+ phenotype in the blast population at diagnosis was determined using a CD45-gating strategy and CD34+ backgating by flow cytometry. We studied the CD34+CD38-CD123+ fraction in AML blasts at diagnosis, and its utility as a unique phenotype for minimal residual disease (MRD) of AML patients. RESULTS: CD123+ cells were present in 97% of AML blasts in patients at diagnosis (median 90%; range 21-99%). CD123+ cells were also present in 97% of the CD34+CD38- compartment (median 0.8164%, range 0.0262-39.7%). Interestingly, CD123 was not present in normal and regenerating CD34+CD38- bone marrow stem cells (range 0.002- 0.067 and 0.004-0.086, respectively). CONCLUSION: The CD34+CD38-CD123+ phenotype is present in virtually all AML blasts and it may be used as a unique single phenotype for MRD detection in AML patients.","['(c) 2017 The Author(s) Published by S.

Two years after the end of treatments, children show gross and fine motor skill delays that may persist even when patients are considered healed. The goal of the present study was to assess motor skills difficulties in pre-school children with leukemia one year after treatment. Particular attention has been paid to those patients who had undergone Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) and to the relationship between motor delays and age bands. Participants were 60 children (median age of 5; inter quartile range: 3.07-5.76), including 31 females and 29 males, 91.7% of them were affected by acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and 8.3% by acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Five children had undergone HCST. Parents were interviewed by Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS) on children's motor skills and filled in the Italian Temperament Questionnaire (QUIT). VABS's total scores were converted into equivalent mental age scores (EMA). A score difference of at least three months between current age and equivalent mental age was considered a developmental delay. Non-parametric analyses were run to understand if HSCT treatment and a specific age band influence children's motor skills. Significant delays were found in global motor skills (56.7%) as well as in fine and gross motor domains. Mann Whitney U tests showed that children with HSCT were reported to have lower gross motor mean ranks (U = 62; p = 0.004; Mean rank = 15.40) than peers without HSCT (Mean rank = 31.87) and lower mean rank values on motor temperament scale (U = 9; p = 0.003; HSCT Mean rank = 4.75 versus no HSCT Mean rank = 27.81). Kruskal Wallis' tests identified the high risk treatment showing that HSCT experience negatively impacted the motor skills and temperamental motor activity of pre-school children one year after the diagnosis of leukemia.",,"['Taverna, Livia', 'Tremolada, Marta', 'Bonichini, Sabrina', 'Tosetto, Barbara', 'Basso, Giuseppe', 'Messina, Chiara', 'Pillon, Marta']","['Taverna L', 'Tremolada M', 'Bonichini S', 'Tosetto B', 'Basso G', 'Messina C', 'Pillon M']","['Faculty of Education, Free University of Bolzano-Bozen, Faculty of Education, Brixen, Italy.', 'Department of Developmental Psychology and Socialization, Faculty of Psychology, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Developmental Psychology and Socialization, Faculty of Psychology, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Medical School for Health Professions ""Claudiana"", Bolzano, Italy.', 'Department of Child and Woman Health, Oncology Hematology Division, University-Hospital of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Child and Woman Health, Oncology Hematology Division, University-Hospital of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Child and Woman Health, Oncology Hematology Division, University-Hospital of Padua, Padua, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20171024,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Motor Skills', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*physiopathology/therapy', 'Risk Factors']",,,2017/10/25 06:00,2017/11/14 06:00,['2017/10/25 06:00'],"['2017/06/07 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/10/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0186787 [doi]', 'PONE-D-17-21846 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2017 Oct 24;12(10):e0186787. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0186787. eCollection 2017.,PMC5655450,,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3230-5725'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We included studies that assessed any infection in childhood prior to the diagnosis of ALL in children aged 0-19 years compared to children without cancer. The primary analysis synthesised any infection against the odds of ALL, and secondary analyses assessed the frequency, severity, timing of infections, and specific infectious agents against the odds of ALL. Subgroup analyses by data source were investigated. RESULTS: In our primary analysis of 12 496 children with ALL and 2 356 288 children without ALL from 38 studies, we found that any infection was not associated with ALL (odds ratio (OR)=1.10, 95% CI: 0.95-1.28). Among studies with laboratory-confirmed infections, the presence of infections increased the odds of ALL by 2.4-fold (OR=2.42, 95% CI: 1.54-3.82).

Here we addressed the hypothesis that the protein junctional adhesion molecule-A (JAM-A) may represent a novel target and a clinical biomarker in MM. We evaluated JAM-A expression in MM cell lines and in 147 MM patient bone marrow aspirates and biopsies at different disease stages. Elevated JAM-A levels in patient-derived plasma cells were correlated with poor prognosis. Moreover, circulating soluble JAM-A (sJAM-A) levels were significantly increased in MM patients as compared with controls. Notably, in vitro JAM-A inhibition impaired MM migration, colony formation, chemotaxis, proliferation and viability. In vivo treatment with an anti-JAM-A monoclonal antibody (alphaJAM-A moAb) impaired tumor progression in a murine xenograft MM model. These results demonstrate that therapeutic targeting of JAM-A has the potential to prevent MM progression, and lead us to propose JAM-A as a biomarker in MM, and sJAM-A as a serum-based marker for clinical stratification.",,"['Solimando, A G', 'Brandl, A', 'Mattenheimer, K', 'Graf, C', 'Ritz, M', 'Ruckdeschel, A', 'Stuhmer, T', 'Mokhtari, Z', 'Rudelius, M', 'Dotterweich, J', 'Bittrich, M', 'Desantis, V', 'Ebert, R', 'Trerotoli, P', 'Frassanito, M A', 'Rosenwald, A', 'Vacca, A', 'Einsele, H', 'Jakob, F', 'Beilhack, A']","['Solimando AG', 'Brandl A', 'Mattenheimer K', 'Graf C', 'Ritz M', 'Ruckdeschel A', 'Stuhmer T', 'Mokhtari Z', 'Rudelius M', 'Dotterweich J', 'Bittrich M', 'Desantis V', 'Ebert R', 'Trerotoli P', 'Frassanito MA', 'Rosenwald A', 'Vacca A', 'Einsele H', 'Jakob F', 'Beilhack A']","['Department of Internal Medicine II, Interdisciplinary Center for Clinical Research Laboratory, University Hospital of Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine II, University Hospital of Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', ""Department of Biomedical Sciences and Human Oncology, Section of Internal Medicine 'G.

Nonetheless, in each of the subgroups, prominent disparateness of biological characteristics associates to a large heterogeneity of clinical presentation, with very different prognostic implications.

Notably, this trend has also been observed among those involved in the healthcare field. With its ability to readily connect diverse groups of stakeholders in a given area of interest, Twitter has become a focal point for those involved in increasing awareness and information exchange in orphan disease fields. Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) is a rare, aggressive hematologic malignancy with generally poor long-term outcomes for adult patients and no standard therapeutic guidelines. Coupled with its low incidence rate, the disease has experienced a number of name changes over the past three decades (e.g., blastic NK cell lymphoma, CD4+CD56+ hematodermic tumor), thereby historically resulting in difficulties in its clinico-pathologic diagnosis and treatment approaches. All of these factors have led to a striking gap in terms of accurate information available to patients and the general public. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the development of more venues for the dissemination of information, particularly online, for this rare cancer.

However, there is no consensus yet regarding a standardized approach to measuring MRD that is most clinically meaningful. We review multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and discuss a framework for assessing remission MRD using next-generation sequencing (NGS). RECENT FINDINGS: MFC and RT-PCR may not fully capitalize on the major advances that have been made in characterizing the genetic landscape of AML, which has offered insight into the biological and clinical implications of clonal genetic architecture. NGS has increasingly been shown to provide a qualitative and quantitative assessment of MRD with significant prognostic implications. The assessment of clonal architecture by NGS may complement or extend existing approaches for MRD monitoring. Long-term serial monitoring of diagnostic, remission, and relapse samples with clinical correlation will need to be performed in order to determine the impact of various MRD patterns using this technique.",,"['Vedula, Rahul S', 'Lindsley, R Coleman']","['Vedula RS', 'Lindsley RC']","['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, 450 Brookline Ave., DA-530C, Boston, MA, 02115, USA.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, 450 Brookline Ave., DA-530C, Boston, MA, 02115, USA. coleman_lindsley@dfci.harvard.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,Current hematologic malignancy reports,101262565,IM,"['Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/pathology', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis/pathology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Clonal evolution', '*Clonal remission', '*Measurable residual disease', '*Next-generation sequencing']",2017/10/25 06:00,2018/07/10 06:00,['2017/10/25 06:00'],"['2017/10/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/10 06:00 [medline]', '2017/10/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11899-017-0428-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s11899-017-0428-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Hematol Malig Rep. 2017 Dec;12(6):574-581. doi: 10.1007/s11899-017-0428-4.,,,['K08 CA204734/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clinical implementation of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in cytogenetic laboratories allows for high-resolution analysis of recurrent structural chromosomal rearrangements specific to AML, especially in AML with normal karyotypes, which comprises approximately 33-50% of AML-positive specimens. Here, we review the use of several FISH probe strategies in the diagnosis of AML. We also review the standards and guidelines currently in place for use by clinical cytogenetic laboratories in the evaluation of AML.

Preliminary results for several of these investigations have shown evidence of safety, tolerability, and encouraging evidence of efficacy. Targeting IDH mutations in AML is a biologically informed and rational strategy to promote clinical responses, primarily through differentiation and maturation of the malignant clone.

Consequently, CDKs have garnered intense interest as therapeutic targets for the treatment of cancer. We describe herein the molecular and cellular effects of CCT068127, a novel inhibitor of CDK2 and CDK9. Optimized from the purine template of seliciclib, CCT068127 exhibits greater potency and selectivity against purified CDK2 and CDK9 and superior antiproliferative activity against human colon cancer and melanoma cell lines. X-ray crystallography studies reveal that hydrogen bonding with the DFG motif of CDK2 is the likely mechanism of greater enzymatic potency. Commensurate with inhibition of CDK activity, CCT068127 treatment results in decreased retinoblastoma protein (RB) phosphorylation, reduced phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II, and induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The transcriptional signature of CCT068127 shows greatest similarity to other small-molecule CDK and also HDAC inhibitors. CCT068127 caused a dramatic loss in expression of DUSP6 phosphatase, alongside elevated ERK phosphorylation and activation of MAPK pathway target genes. MCL1 protein levels are rapidly decreased by CCT068127 treatment and this associates with synergistic antiproliferative activity after combined treatment with CCT068127 and ABT263, a BCL2 family inhibitor.

Unfortunately, the underlying mechanism of leukemogenesis is poorly known, and there has been little progress in the treatment for AML. Studies have shown that X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP), one of the inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs), is highly expressed and contributes to chemoresistance in AML. Hence, a novel drug, RO6867520 (RO-BIR2), developed by Roche targeting the BIR2 domain in XIAP to reactivate blocked apoptosis, is a promising therapy for AML. The monotherapy of RO-BIR2 had minimal effect on most of the AML cell lines tested except U-937. In contrast to AML cell lines, in general, RO-BIR2 alone has been shown to inhibit the proliferation of primary AML patient samples effectively and induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. A combination of RO-BIR2 with TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) led to highly synergistic effect on AML cell lines and AML patient samples. This combination therapy is capable of inducing apoptosis, thereby leading to an increase in specific apoptotic cell population, along with the activation of caspase 3/7. A number of apoptotic-related proteins such as XIAP, cleavage of caspase 3, cleavage of caspase 7, and cleaved PARP were changed upon combination therapy. Combination of RO-BIR2 with Ara-C had similar effect as the TRAIL combination.

About 2-10% of CLL patients develop aggressive histological transformation, most commonly to diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), historically called Richter transformation (RT). Clinical features suggestive of RT include elevated LDH and non-specific symptoms such as fever, weight loss, and lymphadenopathy. 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (18-FDG) uptake is increased on PET scan (standardized uptake value max most commonly >/= 10). PET/CT study can identify optimal site for excisional biopsy, which is the gold standard for RT diagnosis, as well as aid in disease staging and prognostication. In addition to clinical prognostic features such lactate dehydrogenase level, platelet count, and performance status, important predictors of poor outcome in RT are TP53 disruption and clonal relationship of DLBCL to underlying CLL. Chemoimmunotherapy constitutes the standard treatment for RT, followed by stem cell transplant (SCT) in eligible patients. However, the majority of patients do not proceed to allogeneic SCT, either due to inadequate disease control with initial therapy, poor performance status, or lack of donor availability. Overall outcome is dismal. Some novel agents under investigation, particularly PD-1 inhibitors, are showing clinical activity in Phase I and II trials. An ongoing incidence of RT has been noted in studies of previously treated patients receiving targeted therapies such as ibrutinib and venetoclax; the frequency of RT in patients initially treated with novel agents rather than chemoimmunotherapy will be important to determine with longer follow-up. This review focuses on the development, clinicopathologic features, and treatment of RT in the context of novel therapies.",,"['Khan, Maliha', 'Siddiqi, Rabbia', 'Thompson, Philip A']","['Khan M', 'Siddiqi R', 'Thompson PA']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1400 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX, 77030-4009, USA.', 'Dow University of Health Sciences, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1400 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX, 77030-4009, USA. pathompson2@mdanderson.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20171023,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,"['*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/pathology', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology/*therapy', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Risk Factors', 'Syndrome', 'Therapies, Investigational/*methods/*trends']",['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'Pathophysiology', 'Richter syndrome', 'Richter transformation', 'Risk factors', 'Treatment']",2017/10/25 06:00,2018/01/31 06:00,['2017/10/25 06:00'],"['2017/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/31 06:00 [medline]', '2017/10/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-017-3149-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-017-3149-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2018 Jan;97(1):1-15. doi: 10.1007/s00277-017-3149-9.

METHODS: The dynamic monitoring of lineage-specific cell subtypes (B, T, and NK cells) was made in 20 B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) patients following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). In the early period after allo-HSCT, the latest establishment of B-cell complete chimerism (CC) was observed in a majority of patients. RESULTS: The percentage of donor cells of B-cell lineage was lower than the percent of T-cell lineage in most of the mixed chimerism (MC) patients. During graft rejection, the frequency of patients with decreasing MC of B-, T- and NK-cell lineage were 5/5, 2/5, and 2/5. When disease relapsed, five patients showed a faster decrease of the donor percent of B-cells than of T- or NK-cells. Only one patient displayed a more rapid decrease in NK-cells than in T- or B-cells. CONCLUSION: Monitoring of B-cell chimerism after HSCT seems to be valuable for insuring complete engraftment, anticipating graft rejection, and relapse in B-ALL patients.",,"['Yang, Yi-Ning', 'Wang, Xiao-Rui', 'Qin, You-Wen', 'Wan, Li-Ping', 'Jiang, Ying', 'Wang, Chun']","['Yang YN', 'Wang XR', 'Qin YW', 'Wan LP', 'Jiang Y', 'Wang C']","['Department of Hematology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University affiliated with Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai 200000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University affiliated with Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai 200000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University affiliated with Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai 200000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University affiliated with Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai 200000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University affiliated with Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai 200000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University affiliated with Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai 200000, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150323,China,Chronic Dis Transl Med,Chronic diseases and translational medicine,101679934,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT)', 'B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL)', 'B-cell', 'Chimerism', 'T-cell']",2015/03/23 00:00,2015/03/23 00:01,['2017/10/25 06:00'],"['2014/11/22 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/23 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.cdtm.2015.02.004 [doi]', 'S2095-882X(15)00005-5 [pii]']",epublish,Chronic Dis Transl Med. 2015 Mar 23;1(1):48-54. doi: 10.1016/j.cdtm.2015.02.004. eCollection 2015 Mar.,PMC5643789,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two of these genes, tax and hbz, also promote proliferation of the infected cell, and both genes are thought to contribute to oncogenesis in adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma. The regulation of HTLV-1 proviral latency is not understood. tax, on the proviral plus strand, is usually silent in freshly-isolated cells, whereas the minus-strand-encoded hbz gene is persistently expressed at a low level. However, the persistently activated host immune response to Tax indicates frequent expression of tax in vivo. Methods: We used single-molecule RNA-FISH to quantify the expression of HTLV-1 transcripts at the single-cell level in a total of >19,000 cells from five T-cell clones, naturally infected with HTLV-1, isolated by limiting dilution from peripheral blood of HTLV-1-infected subjects. Results: We found strong heterogeneity both within and between clones in the expression of the proviral plus-strand (detected by hybridization to the tax gene) and the minus-strand ( hbz gene). Both genes are transcribed in bursts; tax expression is enhanced in the absence of hbz, while hbz expression increased in cells with high tax expression. Surprisingly, we found that hbz expression is strongly associated with the S and G 2/M phases of the cell cycle, independent of tax expression. Contrary to current belief, hbz is not expressed in all cells at all times, even within one clone. In hbz-positive cells, the abundance of hbz transcripts showed a very strong positive linear correlation with nuclear volume. Conclusions: The occurrence of intense, intermittent plus-strand gene bursts in independent primary HTLV-1-infected T-cell clones from unrelated individuals strongly suggests that the HTLV-1 plus-strand is expressed in bursts in vivo. Our results offer an explanation for the paradoxical correlations observed between the host immune response and HTLV-1 transcription.",,"['Billman, Martin R', 'Rueda, David', 'Bangham, Charles R M']","['Billman MR', 'Rueda D', 'Bangham CRM']","['Section of Virology, Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, Norfolk Place, London, UK.', 'Single Molecule Imaging Group, MRC London Institute of Medical Sciences, Du Cane Road, London, UK.', 'Section of Virology, Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital, Du Cane Road, London , UK.', 'Section of Virology, Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, Norfolk Place, London, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170922,England,Wellcome Open Res,Wellcome open research,101696457,,,['NOTNLM'],"['HTLV-', 'RNA-FISH', 'gene burst', 'latency', 'retrovirus', 'smFISH', 'transcription']",2017/10/25 06:00,2017/10/25 06:01,['2017/10/25 06:00'],"['2017/10/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/10/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/25 06:01 [medline]']",['10.12688/wellcomeopenres.12469.2 [doi]'],epublish,Wellcome Open Res. 2017 Sep 22;2:87. doi: 10.12688/wellcomeopenres.12469.2. eCollection 2017.,PMC5645716,,"['WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'MC_UP_1102/5/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2624-3599'],,,['Competing interests: No competing interests were disclosed.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A variety of biobanks exist for example within hospitals, research institutes, pharmaceutical companies and patient organisations. The role of patients in biobanking is changing from being seen simply as donors, to actual collaborators in the design, development and the running of biobanks. In this article, we provide a number of examples of patients acting as partners at the heart of biobanking, where their voice and perspective is being seen and used as a valuable resource for the biobank. Our aim is that these examples can be used by those who work with patients in biobank-based research, to design future strategies for patient and public involvement in all biobanks. ABSTRACT: Biobanks and biobanking research plays an increasingly important role in healthcare research and delivery as health systems become more patient-centred and medicine becomes more personalised. There is also growing acceptance and appreciation of the value that patients, patient advocacy organisations and the public can bring as stakeholders in biobanking and more generally in research. Therefore, the importance of active, early and sustained engagement and involvement of patient and public representatives in biobanks will become increasingly relevant. Organising and facilitating patient and public involvement in biobanking takes considerable time and effort for all stakeholders involved. Therefore, for any biobank operator considering involving patients and the public in their biobanking activities, consideration of best practices, current guidance, ethical issues and evaluation of involvement will be important. In this article, we demonstrate that patients are much more than donors to biobanks-they are collaborators at the heart of biobanking with an important voice to identify perspective, which can be an extremely valuable resource for all biobanks to utilise. The case studies herein provide examples of good practice of patient involvement in biobanking as well as outcomes from these practices, and lessons learned. Our aim is to provide useful insights from these efforts and potential future strategies for the multiple stakeholders that work with patients and the public involved in biobank-based research.",,"['Mitchell, Derick', 'Geissler, Jan', 'Parry-Jones, Alison', 'Keulen, Hans', 'Schmitt, Doris C', 'Vavassori, Rosaria', 'Matharoo-Ball, Balwir']","['Mitchell D', 'Geissler J', 'Parry-Jones A', 'Keulen H', 'Schmitt DC', 'Vavassori R', 'Matharoo-Ball B']","['EU Joint Programme-Neurodegenerative Disease Research (JPND), 1st floor, Liffey Trust Building, 117-126 Upper Sheriff St., Dublin, Ireland.', 'Leukemia Patient Advocates Foundation, Bern, Switzerland.', ""European Patients' Academy on Therapeutic Innovation (EUPATI), Am Rothenanger 1b, 85521 Riemerling, Germany."", 'Wales Cancer Bank, Cardiff University, Room 273, B-C link corridor, 2nd Floor, UHW Main Building, Heath Park, Cardiff, CF14 4XN UK.grid.5600.30000000108075670', 'Chordoma Foundation, PO Box 2127, Durham, NC 27702 USA.grid.470372.5', 'Foundation PATH, Munich, Germany.', 'Italian Association for Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood, Verderio (LC), Italy.', 'Biobank and Clinical Registry for Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood, Verderio (LC), Italy.', 'International Consortium for the Research on Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood, Lyon, France.', 'Nottingham Health Science Biobank, EMPATH Pathology Services, Nottingham University Hospital NHS Trust, City Campus, Nottingham, UK.grid.240404.60000000104401889', 'The David Evans Medical Research Centre, Hucknall Road, Nottingham, NG5 1PB UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150625,England,Res Involv Engagem,Research involvement and engagement,101708164,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Biobank', 'Involvement', 'Partnering', 'Patient', 'Research']",2015/06/25 00:00,2015/06/25 00:01,['2017/10/25 06:00'],"['2014/12/16 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/19 00:00 [revised]', '2015/04/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/25 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40900-015-0001-z [doi]', '1 [pii]']",epublish,Res Involv Engagem. 2015 Jun 25;1:4. doi: 10.1186/s40900-015-0001-z. eCollection 2015.,PMC5598087,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Retrospective analyses of 112 patients newly diagnosed with APL were performed during initial treatment. In our study, the early death rate was 5.36%. Hemorrhage was the leading cause of death during the induction period (4/6). The values of white blood cell count, lactate dehydrogenase, prothrombin time (PT), fibrinogen (Fbg), hemoglobin, and bone marrow leukemic promyelocytes were significantly different in the high-risk group compared to the low/intermediate-risk groups. There were significant differences in the white blood cell count, bone marrow leukemic promyelocytes, platelet (PLT) count, and the levels of lactate dehydrogenase, d-dimer, PT, and Fbg, as well as in FLT3-ITD mutations between patients with major bleeding and those with minor bleeding. Hemostatic variables significantly improved over time during induction therapy. The recovery times of the PLT, PT, and Fbg values were significantly slower in patients with major bleeding than in those with minor bleeding. Specifically, the PLT level in patients with major bleeding was not similar to that in the minor bleeding group until after 4 weeks of treatment. Hemorrhages were the most common cause of induction death in this study. High-risk patients were more prone to serious clinical bleeding symptoms. Patients with major bleeding had more rapid proliferation characteristics and an increased incidence of FLT3-ITD mutations compared to patients with minor bleeding. Hemostatic variables recovered significantly more slowly in patients with major bleeding than in those with minor bleeding. Active induction therapy and blood product infusion are effective in preventing severe bleeding. Our results suggested that low PLT count might be the leading cause of fatal bleeding in patients newly diagnosed with APL.",,"['Song, Yu-Hua', 'Peng, Peng', 'Qiao, Chun', 'Zhang, Run', 'Li, Jian-Yong', 'Lu, Hua']","['Song YH', 'Peng P', 'Qiao C', 'Zhang R', 'Li JY', 'Lu H']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital.', ""Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Nanjing, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Oncology, The Second Hospital of Nanjing, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."", 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20171009,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'all-trans retinoic acid', 'arsenic trioxide', 'coagulation', 'hemorrhage']",2017/10/25 06:00,2017/10/25 06:01,['2017/10/25 06:00'],"['2017/10/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/10/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/25 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S144438 [doi]', 'ott-10-4917 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2017 Oct 9;10:4917-4924. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S144438. eCollection 2017.,PMC5640392,,,,,,,['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Toxoplasmosis in patients who are immunocompromised by virtue of underlying leukemia disease has received relatively little attention. This study was aimed to evaluate IgG and IgM antibodies of T. gondii and to minimize the role of T. gondii and opportunistic infection complication at the early stage of infection in leukemia patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The purpose of this assay was to measure anti-T. gondii IgG and IgM antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique in leukemia patients. RESULTS: IgG antibodies against T. gondii were detected by ELISA in 96 (56.4%) leukemia patients and 72 (42.4%) control group. IgM antibodies were found in 10 patients (5.9%) with leukemia and 3 (1.8%) in the corresponding.

MLL undergoes rearrangement with numerous partners, including a recurrent translocation fusing the epigenetic regulator to a cytoplasmic RAS effector, AF6/afadin. We show here that AF6 employs a non-canonical, evolutionarily conserved alpha-helix to bind RAS, unique to AF6 and the classical RASSF effectors. Further, all patients with MLL-AF6 translocations express fusion proteins missing only this helix from AF6, resulting in exposure of hydrophobic residues that induce dimerization. We provide evidence that oligomerization is the dominant mechanism driving oncogenesis from rare MLL translocation partners and employ our mechanistic understanding of MLL-AF6 to examine how dimers induce leukemia. Proteomic data resolve association of dimerized MLL with gene expression modulators, and inhibiting dimerization disrupts formation of these complexes while completely abrogating leukemogenesis in mice.

Clinical utility for selective inhibition of specific anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins has recently been realized with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of venetoclax (formerly ABT-199/GDC-0199) in relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with 17p deletion. Despite the impressive monotherapy activity in CLL, such responses have rarely been observed in other B-cell malignancies, and preclinical data suggest that combination therapies will be needed in other indications. Additional selective antagonists of Bcl-2 family members, including Bcl-XL and Mcl-1, are in various stages of preclinical and clinical development and hold the promise of extending clinical utility beyond CLL and overcoming resistance to venetoclax. In addition to direct targeting of Bcl-2 family proteins with BH3 mimetics, combination therapies that aim at down-regulating expression of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members or restoring expression of pro-apoptotic BH3 family proteins may provide a means to deepen responses to venetoclax and extend the utility to additional indications. Here, we review recent progress in direct and selective targeting of Bcl-2 family proteins for cancer therapy and the search for rationale combinations.","['(c) 2017 The Author(s).

In this study, we investigated the induction of apoptosis due to ultraviolet A (UVA) light in the presence and absence of LFX in HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells. HL-60 cells were exposed to UVA at an intensity of 1.1 mW/cm(2) for 20 min in the presence and absence of LFX, and the induction of apoptosis was examined by analyzing cell morphology, DNA fragmentation, and caspase-3 activity. Cells treated with 100 muM LFX and UVA clearly showed membrane blebbing and cell shrinkage. The proportion of apoptotic cells was significantly higher in cells treated with both UVA and LFX than in those treated with UVA or LFX alone. In addition, DNA ladder formation and caspase-3 activation were observed in cells treated with both UVA and LFX. A significant reduction in the number of UVA-induced apoptotic cells and caspase-3 activation was observed when histidine was present, which suggested that photodynamically-generated singlet oxygen is an important mediator of apoptosis. These results indicate that the combination of UVA and LFX induces apoptosis in HL-60 cells.","['Copyright(c) 2017, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']","['Nakai, Shouko', 'Imaizumi, Takahiro', 'Watanabe, Takahiro', 'Iwase, Yumiko', 'Nishi, Koji', 'Okudaira, Kazuho', 'Yumita, Nagahiko']","['Nakai S', 'Imaizumi T', 'Watanabe T', 'Iwase Y', 'Nishi K', 'Okudaira K', 'Yumita N']","['School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Toho University, Funabashi, Japan.', 'Yokohama University of Pharmacy, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Yokohama University of Pharmacy, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Yokohama University of Pharmacy, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Yokohama University of Pharmacy, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Yokohama University of Pharmacy, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Yokohama University of Pharmacy, Yokohama, Japan n.yumita@hamayaku.ac.jp.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Caspase 3/*metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Combined Modality Therapy', '*DNA Fragmentation', 'Fluoroquinolones/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects/radiation effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/therapy', 'Photochemotherapy', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'Ultraviolet Therapy']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Apoptosis', '*HL-60', '*caspase-3', '*lomefloxacin', '*reactive oxygen species', '*ultraviolet A']",2017/10/25 06:00,2017/10/27 06:00,['2017/10/25 06:00'],"['2017/08/21 00:00 [received]', '2017/09/20 00:00 [revised]', '2017/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/10/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/27 06:00 [medline]']","['37/11/6407 [pii]', '10.21873/anticanres.12094 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2017 Nov;37(11):6407-6413. doi: 10.21873/anticanres.12094.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Fluoroquinolones)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'L6BR2WJD8V (lomefloxacin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The experiments were performed in vitro on HL-60 and U937 cells, using flow cytometry and electron microscopy methods. RESULTS: Application of PH2, PH3, and PH4 resulted in cell surface exposure of phosphatidylserine and plasma membrane impairment, caspase-8, -9, and -3/7 activation, dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential, DNA breakage, cell-cycle disturbance and cell ultrastructural changes.

The research was conducted using flow cytometry fluorescein diacetate/propidium iodide (PI), fluorescein-conjugated annexin V/PI, CaspGLOW Red Active Caspase-8 and -9, CellEvent Caspase-3/7 Green assays, and tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester test. RESULTS: 4-OOH-IF and 4-OOH-CP distinctly reduced cell viability and triggered apoptosis and necrosis, causing changes in intracellular esterase activity, plasma membrane structure and integrity, caspase activation, and mitochondrial membrane potential. The oxazaphosphorines were responsible for the different antileukemic activities. 4-Hydroperoxyifosfamide appeared to be less cytotoxic against the leukemia cells than 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide.

We recently synthesized and determined the effects of analogs, benzamidoxime derivatives, on mammalian cells and discovered that benzamidoximes had an antiproliferative effect.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We synthesized 12 hydrazonopyrazole derivatives with several constant alkyl chain length or branched chains at the side chain to investigate their anticancer cell activity, using the human myelogenous leukemia cell line HL-60RG. RESULTS: Among all hydrazonopyrazole derivatives we synthesized, the hydrazonopyrazole derivative with a branched chain at the side chain rather than a constant alkyl chain significantly inhibited cell viability. The strongest hydrazonopyrazole derivative, 5-amino-4-cyanopyrazole-1-formaldehydehydrazono-3'-pentanal, tended to damage cells dose-dependently. This cell growth attenuation was a result of apoptosis, activating caspase-3 and fragmented DNA.

In this study, we investigated the effects of ST2825, a synthetic peptidomimetic compound which inhibits MYD88 homodimerization, on their growth. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seven lymphoma and leukaemia cell lines including TMD8, a B-cell lymphoma line with MYD88-activating mutation, were treated with ST2825 and analysed for cell proliferation and expression of NF-kappaB signalling-related molecules. RESULTS: ST2825 suppressed the growth of all cell lines by inducing apoptosis and down-regulating phosphorylation of NF-kappaB pathway components inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B kinase (IkappaB) and reticuloendotheliosis oncogene A (RelA), as well as of MYD88 activator Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK), suggesting that MYD88 may affect BTK activity. ST2825 effects were specific as MYD88-targeting siRNA also suppressed phosphorylation of NF-kappaB signalling proteins and BTK in TMD8 cells.

One of the main anticancer actions of doxorubicin is believed to be involved in ROS (reactive oxygen species) generation. Therefore, the anticancer mechanisms of THP may involve ROS generation. The aim of this study was to clarify the mechanisms of THP-induced apoptosis through ROS generation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed the apoptotic events induced by THP in HL-60 cells and HP100 cells, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-resistant cells derived from HL-60. RESULTS: The apparent cytotoxicity could be detected at above 0.1 muM in HL-60 cells after 24-h incubation, whereas it was suppressed under these conditions in HP100 cells. In HP100 cells, THP-induced apoptosis, evaluated by DNA ladder formation, H2O2 generation, mitochondrial membrane potential decrease and caspase-3/7 activity, was suppressed or delayed compared to those of HL-60 cells. CONCLUSION: These findings can be explained by the involvement of H2O2 generation in the THP apoptotic pathway.

YAP1 is negatively regulated by the tumor suppressor Hippo pathway. In human cancers, the deregulation of the Hippo pathway and YAP1 gene amplification lead to the activation of YAP1, which induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and drug resistance. YAP1 inhibitors are expected to be useful in cancer therapy. On the other hand, in certain cancers, YAP1 upregulates p73-dependent gene transcription and behaves as a tumor suppressor. Moreover, as YAP1 regulates self-renewal and differentiation of tissue stem cells and plays an important role in tissue homeostasis, YAP1 activators may contribute to the regenerative medicine. With this in our mind, we screened for YAP1 activators by using human retinal pigment epithelial ARPE-19 cells expressing the TEAD-responsive fluorescence reporter under the coexpression of YAP1. From an extensive chemical compound library (n = 18,606) 47 candidate YAP1 activators were identified. These compounds were characterized to determine whether this assay provides bona fide YAP1 activators. Importantly, one YAP1 activator was effective against the human multiple myeloma IM-9 cells and chronic myeloid leukemia K562 cells.Implications: YAP1 activation limits growth, induces apoptosis, and may be useful at suppressing hematological cancers.

From B cells of high-risk patients with AML with potent and lasting GVL responses, we isolated monoclonal antibodies directed against antigens expressed on the cell surface of AML cells but not on normal hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells. A number of these donor-derived antibodies recognized the U5 snRNP200 complex, a component of the spliceosome that in normal cells is found in the cell. In AML however, the U5 snRNP200 complex is exposed on the cell membrane of leukemic blasts. U5 snRNP200 complex-specific antibodies induced death of AML cells in an Fc receptor-dependent way in the absence of cytotoxic leukocytes or complement. In an AML mouse model, treatment with U5 snRNP200 complex-specific antibodies led to significant tumor growth inhibition.

One strategy to overcome this obstacle is to identify agents that are selectively lethal to MDR cells. The aim of this study was to discover novel compounds against MDR leukemia and to determine the molecular mechanisms behind collateral sensitivity. A library of 1162 compounds was tested against parental, drug-sensitive CCRF-CEM cells using the resazurin assay. A total of 302 compounds showed reasonable activity (less than 50% cell viability). Eleven out of 30 lawsone derivatives revealed considerable collateral sensitivity in MDR P-glycoprotein (Pgp)-overexpressing CEM/ADR5000 cells. They reduced beta-catenin activity in a Wnt/beta-catenin reporter cell line. Their activities significantly correlated with apolar desolvation (R=0.819). Compound (1) (3-hydroxy-1,4-dioxo-N-phenyl-naphthalene-2-carboxamide) was the most active compound and dose-dependently down-regulated protein expression of beta-catenin, c-MYC, Pgp and Frizzled 7. By molecular docking, we predicted that compound (1) bound to the palmitoyl-binding groove of the cysteine-rich domain of Frizzled-7 and Frizzled-8. Compound (1) neither stimulated ATPase activity of Pgp nor reactive oxygen species generation, both of which have been previously described as possible mechanisms of collateral sensitivity. Instead, we found that Wnt/beta-catenin signaling was selectively inhibited in CEM/ADR5000 cells, but not in CCRF-CEM cells. In conclusion, we found for the first time that the inhibition of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling may represent a novel molecular mechanism of collateral sensitivity in MDR cells. Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, therefore, represents a potential therapeutic target for the selective killing of Pgp-mediated MDR.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

To systematically identify the SNPs that affect gene expression by modulating activities of distal regulatory elements, we adapt the self-transcribing active regulatory region sequencing (STARR-seq) strategy, a high-throughput technique to functionally quantify enhancer activities. RESULTS: From 10,673 SNPs linked with 996 cancer risk-associated SNPs identified in previous GWAS studies, we identify 575 SNPs in the fragments that positively regulate gene expression, and 758 SNPs in the fragments with negative regulatory activities. Among them, 70 variants are regulatory variants for which the two alleles confer different regulatory activities. We analyze in depth two regulatory variants-breast cancer risk SNP rs11055880 and leukemia risk-associated SNP rs12142375-and demonstrate their endogenous regulatory activities on expression of ATF7IP and PDE4B genes, respectively, using a CRISPR-Cas9 approach.

It is a rare finding, and complications are more frequent with a de Garengeot hernia. PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 92 year-old female presented to the emergency department (ED) complaining of abdominal pain. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated a hernia anterior to the inguinal ligament without strangulation. Two weeks later the patient returned to the ED with worsening abdominal pain in the right lower quadrant. Repeat CT scan demonstrated a 7x4cm complex fluid collection in the right inguinal region, and the patient was taken to the operating room for exploration. The hernia sac was entered and found to contain the appendix with evidence of distal perforation. The appendix was taken out, and the hernia defect was repaired. The patient tolerated the procedure well. DISCUSSION: Femoral hernias have a high risk of incarceration due to the tightness of the femoral canal (Talini et al. 2015 [4]). Due to anatomic location of the appendix, de Garengeot hernias are most often seen on the right. Incarceration of the appendix is a clear etiology for appendicitis secondary to ischemia. CONCLUSION: Full preoperative workup for a femoral hernia often fails to diagnose the presence of the appendix within the hernia. It is important to have a high clinical suspicion for a de Garengeot's hernia in patients with incarcerated or strangulated right femoral hernias.",['Copyright (c) 2017 The Authors.

The early diagnosis and the identification of this lymphoma are essential for an effective treatment. The classification of non-Hodgkin lymphomas is a task that continues to rank as one of the main challenges faced by hematologists, pathologists, as well as in the producing of computer vision methods due to its inherent complexity. In this paper, we present a new method to quantify and classify tissue samples of non-Hodgkin lymphomas based on the percolation theory. The method consists of associating multiscale and multidimensional approaches in order to divide the image into smaller regions and then verifying color similarity between pixels. A cluster labeling algorithm was applied to each region of interest to obtain the values for the number of clusters, occurrence of percolation and coverage ratio of the largest cluster. The method was tested on different classifiers aiming to differentiate three different groups of non-Hodgkin lymphomas. The obtained results (AUC rates between 0.940 and 0.993) were compared to those provided by methods consolidated in the Literature, which indicates that the percolation theory is a suitable approach for identifying these three classes of non-Hodgkin lymphomas, those being: mantle cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Although genetic susceptibility to breast cancer in the general population is well studied, large-scale evaluation of breast cancer susceptibility after chest-directed radiotherapy for childhood cancer is lacking. Methods: We conducted a genome-wide association study of breast cancer in female survivors of childhood cancer, pooling two cohorts with detailed treatment data and systematic, long-term follow-up: the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study and St. Jude Lifetime Cohort. The study population comprised 207 survivors who developed breast cancer and 2774 who had not developed any subsequent neoplasm as of last follow-up. Genotyping and subsequent imputation yielded 16 958 466 high-quality variants for analysis. We tested associations in the overall population and in subgroups stratified by receipt of lower than 10 and 10 or higher gray breast radiation exposure. We report P values and pooled per-allele risk estimates from Cox proportional hazards regression models. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: Among survivors who received 10 or higher gray breast radiation exposure, a locus on 1q41 was associated with subsequent breast cancer risk (rs4342822, nearest gene PROX1 , risk allele frequency in control subjects [RAF controls ] = 0.46, hazard ratio = 1.92, 95% confidence interval = 1.49 to 2.44, P = 7.09 x 10 -9 ). Two rare variants also showed potentially promising associations (breast radiation >/=10 gray: rs74949440, 11q23, TAGLN , RAF controls = 0.02, P = 5.84 x 10 -8 ; <10 gray: rs17020562, 1q32.3, RPS6KC1 , RAF controls = 0.0005, P = 6.68 x 10 -8 ). Associations were restricted to these dose subgroups, with consistent findings in the two survivor cohorts. Conclusions: Our study provides strong evidence that germline genetics outside high-risk syndromes could modify the effect of radiation exposure on breast cancer risk after childhood cancer.","['Published by Oxford University Press 2017.

Whether MLAA-34 has an anti-apoptotic role in other tumor cells has not yet been reported. We explored whether MLAA-34 exhibited anti-apoptotic effects in HeLa cervical cancer cells and the possible mechanism of action. We generated a HeLa cell line stably expressing MLAA-34 and found that MLAA-34 overexpression had no effect on the growth, apoptosis and cell cycle of HeLa cells. However, upon treatment with arsenic trioxide (ATO) to induce apoptosis, the cell viability and colony formation ability of ATO-treated MLAA-34 stable HeLa cells were significantly higher than that of ATO-treated controls, and the apoptosis rate and proportion of G2/M cells also decreased. We found that ATO treatment of HeLa cells resulted in significant decreases in the expression of beta-catenin mRNA and protein and the downstream target factors c-Myc, cyclin B1, and cyclin D1 in the Wnt signaling pathway. Notably, ATO-treated MLAA-34 stable HeLa cells showed a significant reduction in the ATO-mediated downregulation of these factors. In addition, MLAA-34 overexpression significantly increased the expression of nuclear beta-catenin protein in ATO-treated cells compared with HeLa cells treated only with ATO. Thus, here we have found that the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway is involved in ATO-induced apoptosis in HeLa cells. MLAA-34 reduces ATO-induced apoptosis and G2/M arrest, and the anti-apoptotic effect may be achieved by activating the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway in HeLa cells.",,"['Zhang, Pengyu', 'Zhao, Xuan', 'Zhang, Wenjuan', 'He, Aili', 'Lei, Bo', 'Zhang, Wanggang', 'Chen, Yinxia']","['Zhang P', 'Zhao X', 'Zhang W', 'He A', 'Lei B', 'Zhang W', 'Chen Y']","[""Department of Hematology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Xi' an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", ""Department of Histology&Embryology, Xi'an Medical College, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", ""Shaanxi Blood Center, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Xi' an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Xi' an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Xi' an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Xi' an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20171023,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*genetics', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals', 'Blotting, Western', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Oxides/*toxicity', '*Signal Transduction', 'Wnt Proteins/*metabolism', 'beta Catenin/*metabolism']",,,2017/10/24 06:00,2017/11/14 06:00,['2017/10/24 06:00'],"['2017/04/28 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0186868 [doi]', 'PONE-D-17-16469 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2017 Oct 23;12(10):e0186868. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0186868. eCollection 2017.,PMC5653344,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (CAB39L protein, human)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (beta Catenin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5962-8044'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to better target this AML subtype, a comprehensive view of how FLT3-ITD impacts AML cell biology is required. Here, we found that FLT3-ITD expression increased basal autophagy in AML cells, and that both pharmacological and genetic inhibition of the receptor reduced autophagy in primary AML samples and cell lines. Conditional expression of shRNAs against key autophagy proteins demonstrated that autophagy is required for AML cell proliferation in vitro and for leukemic cells survival in a mouse model of xenograft. Importantly, autophagy inhibition also overcame FLT3 inhibitor resistance both in vitro and in vivo. The transcription factor ATF4 was identified as an essential actor of FLT3-ITD-induced autophagy. Cellular levels of ATF4 were highly dependent on FLT3-ITD activity, and downregulation of ATF4 inhibited autophagy-dependent AML cell proliferation and improved overall mouse survival similarly to autophagy inhibition. These results suggest that targeting autophagy or ATF4 in patients expressing FLT3 mutations may represent a novel promising and innovative therapeutic strategy for AML.",,"['Heydt, Q', 'Larrue, C', 'Saland, E', 'Bertoli, S', 'Sarry, J-E', 'Besson, A', 'Manenti, S', 'Joffre, C', 'Mansat-De Mas, V']","['Heydt Q', 'Larrue C', 'Saland E', 'Bertoli S', 'Sarry JE', 'Besson A', 'Manenti S', 'Joffre C', 'Mansat-De Mas V']","['Cancer Research Center of Toulouse (CRCT), INSERM U1037, CNRS ERL5294, University of Toulouse, Toulouse, France.', 'Equipe labellisee, La Ligue contre le Cancer, Toulouse, France.', 'Cancer Research Center of Toulouse (CRCT), INSERM U1037, CNRS ERL5294, University of Toulouse, Toulouse, France.', 'Cancer Research Center of Toulouse (CRCT), INSERM U1037, CNRS ERL5294, University of Toulouse, Toulouse, France.', ""Service d'hematologie, Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse-Oncopole (IUCT-O), Toulouse, France."", 'Cancer Research Center of Toulouse (CRCT), INSERM U1037, CNRS ERL5294, University of Toulouse, Toulouse, France.', 'Cancer Research Center of Toulouse (CRCT), INSERM U1037, CNRS ERL5294, University of Toulouse, Toulouse, France.', 'Cancer Research Center of Toulouse (CRCT), INSERM U1037, CNRS ERL5294, University of Toulouse, Toulouse, France.', 'Equipe labellisee, La Ligue contre le Cancer, Toulouse, France.', 'Cancer Research Center of Toulouse (CRCT), INSERM U1037, CNRS ERL5294, University of Toulouse, Toulouse, France.', 'Equipe labellisee, La Ligue contre le Cancer, Toulouse, France.', 'Cancer Research Center of Toulouse (CRCT), INSERM U1037, CNRS ERL5294, University of Toulouse, Toulouse, France.', 'Equipe labellisee, La Ligue contre le Cancer, Toulouse, France.', ""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse-Oncopole, Toulouse, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171023,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Activating Transcription Factor 4/genetics/*metabolism', 'Animals', '*Autophagy', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mutation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics/*metabolism']",,,2017/10/24 06:00,2019/03/12 06:00,['2017/10/24 06:00'],"['2017/03/08 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/08 00:00 [revised]', '2017/08/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/12 06:00 [medline]', '2017/10/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['onc2017376 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2017.376 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2018 Feb 8;37(6):787-797. doi: 10.1038/onc.2017.376.

Because current therapies fail to eradicate these apoptosis-resistant cells, it is essential to identify alternative survival pathways as novel targets for anticancer therapies. Overexpression of cell-surface G protein-coupled receptors drives cell transformation, and thus plays a critical role in malignancies. In this study, we identified neurotensin receptor 2 (NTSR2) as an essential driver of apoptosis resistance in B-CLL. NTSR2 was highly expressed in B-CLL cells, whereas expression of its natural ligand, neurotensin (NTS), was minimal in both B-CLL cells and patient plasma. Surprisingly, NTSR2 remained in a constitutively active phosphorylated state, caused not by a mutation-induced gain-of-function but rather by an interaction with the oncogenic tyrosine kinase receptor TrkB. Functional and biochemical characterization revealed that the NTSR2-TrkB interaction acts as a conditional oncogenic driver requiring the TrkB ligand brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which unlike NTS is highly expressed in B-CLL cells. Together, NTSR2, TrkB and BDNF induce autocrine and/or paracrine survival pathways that are independent of mutation status and indolent or progressive disease course. The NTSR2-TrkB interaction activates survival signaling pathways, including the Src and AKT kinase pathways, as well as expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. When NTSR2 was downregulated, TrkB failed to protect B-CLL cells from a drastic decrease in viability via typical apoptotic cell death, reflected by DNA fragmentation and Annexin V presentation. Together, our findings demonstrate that the NTSR2-TrkB interaction plays a crucial role in B-CLL cell survival, suggesting that inhibition of NTSR2 represents a promising targeted strategy for treating B-CLL malignancy.",,"['Abbaci, A', 'Talbot, H', 'Saada, S', 'Gachard, N', 'Abraham, J', 'Jaccard, A', 'Bordessoule, D', 'Fauchais, A L', 'Naves, T', 'Jauberteau, M O']","['Abbaci A', 'Talbot H', 'Saada S', 'Gachard N', 'Abraham J', 'Jaccard A', 'Bordessoule D', 'Fauchais AL', 'Naves T', 'Jauberteau MO']","['Limoges University, Equipe Accueil 3842, Cellular Homeostasis and Diseases, Faculty of Medicine, Limoges Cedex, France.', 'Limoges University, Equipe Accueil 3842, Cellular Homeostasis and Diseases, Faculty of Medicine, Limoges Cedex, France.', 'Limoges University, Equipe Accueil 3842, Cellular Homeostasis and Diseases, Faculty of Medicine, Limoges Cedex, France.', 'Hematology Laboratory, Dupuytren Hospital University Center of Limoges, Limoges Cedex, France.', 'CNRS-UMR 7276, Limoges University, Limoges Cedex, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Dupuytren Hospital University Center of Limoges, Limoges Cedex, France.', 'CNRS-UMR 7276, Limoges University, Limoges Cedex, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Dupuytren Hospital University Center of Limoges, Limoges Cedex, France.', 'CNRS-UMR 7276, Limoges University, Limoges Cedex, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Dupuytren Hospital University Center of Limoges, Limoges Cedex, France.', 'Limoges University, Equipe Accueil 3842, Cellular Homeostasis and Diseases, Faculty of Medicine, Limoges Cedex, France.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Dupuytren Hospital University Center of Limoges, Limoges Cedex, France.', 'Limoges University, Equipe Accueil 3842, Cellular Homeostasis and Diseases, Faculty of Medicine, Limoges Cedex, France.', 'Limoges University, Equipe Accueil 3842, Cellular Homeostasis and Diseases, Faculty of Medicine, Limoges Cedex, France.', 'Department of Immunology, Dupuytren Hospital University Center of Limoges, Limoges Cedex, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171023,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptor, trkB/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Neurotensin/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,2017/10/24 06:00,2019/03/12 06:00,['2017/10/24 06:00'],"['2017/05/05 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/29 00:00 [revised]', '2017/08/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/12 06:00 [medline]', '2017/10/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['onc2017365 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2017.365 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2018 Feb 8;37(6):756-767. doi: 10.1038/onc.2017.365.

Peripheral lymphocyte profiles were analyzed by flow cytometry. The estimated 12-month treatment-free survival (TFS) was 62.9% (95% confidence interval: 48.5%-74.2%). During dasatinib consolidation, the percentage of total lymphocytes and numbers of CD3(-) CD56(+) natural killer (NK) cells, CD16(+) CD56(+) NK cells and CD56(+) CD57(+) NK-large granular lymphocytes (LGL) were significantly higher in patients with molecular relapse after discontinuation but remained unchanged in patients without molecular relapse for >7 months.

Results of plasma pharmacokinetics analyses demonstrated that exposure to intravenous bosutinib was 3-fold higher than for oral bosutinib (16.2 and 5.5 ng.h/mL/mg, respectively), and mean terminal half-life was similar (35.5 and 31.7 hours).

The objective of this phase 1 study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of venetoclax in Chinese subjects to inform the dose selection of venetoclax in a phase 2 study of patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) CLL in China. Twelve healthy first-generation Han Chinese subjects received a single 100-mg dose of venetoclax following a low-fat breakfast. Pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated using noncompartmental methods. After a single dose of venetoclax in healthy Chinese subjects, the median time to peak concentration was 6 hours (range, 4 to 6 hours), and the mean +/- SD Cmax , AUCinf , and terminal half-life were 1.0 +/- 0.32 mug/mL, 12.6 +/- 5.4 mug.h/mL, and 18.4 +/- 2.97 hours, respectively. On average, venetoclax Cmax and AUCinf values were 94% and 66% higher, respectively, in Chinese subjects compared with those observed historically for non-Asian subjects receiving the same dose. Based on these pharmacokinetic results and the established exposure-response relationship of venetoclax in non-Asian CLL subjects, a 400-mg once-daily dosage regimen was selected for evaluating the venetoclax pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety in the venetoclax phase 2 open-label study in Chinese subjects with R/R CLL.","['(c) 2017, The American College of Clinical Pharmacology.']","['Cheung, Tommy T', 'Salem, Ahmed Hamed', 'Menon, Rajeev M', 'Munasinghe, Wijith P', 'Bueno, Orlando F', 'Agarwal, Suresh K']","['Cheung TT', 'Salem AH', 'Menon RM', 'Munasinghe WP', 'Bueno OF', 'Agarwal SK']","['Phase 1 Clinical Trials Centre, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR.', 'AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, IL, USA.', 'AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, IL, USA.', 'AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, IL, USA.', 'AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, IL, USA.', 'AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, IL, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171023,United States,Clin Pharmacol Drug Dev,Clinical pharmacology in drug development,101572899,,"['Adult', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'China/ethnology', 'Drug Dosage Calculations', 'Female', 'Half-Life', 'Healthy Volunteers', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Sulfonamides/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*ABT-199', '*BCL-2', '*Chinese', '*pharmacokinetics', '*venetoclax']",2017/10/24 06:00,2019/08/14 06:00,['2017/10/24 06:00'],"['2017/03/28 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/14 06:00 [medline]', '2017/10/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cpdd.395 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Pharmacol Drug Dev. 2018 May;7(4):435-440. doi: 10.1002/cpdd.395.

However, the drug resistance is almost inevitable. Increasing evidences suggested that microRNAs (miRNAs) were associated with cancer chemo-resistance. Here, we aimed to explore the possible mechanism of miR-103 affected resistance to ADR in AML cells. Different concentrations of ADR were used to induce K562 and KASUMI-1 cells, and miR-103 mimic, inhibitor were transfected into K562 and KASUMI-1 cells. Cell viability and proliferation were determined by trypan blue staining and MTT assays for evaluating K562 and KASUMI-1 cells drug resistance. The relationship of miR-103 and COP1, Trib1, and C/EBPalpha were analyzed by qRT-PCR and Western blot. Cell proliferation, viability were detected again. Besides, the expressions of main factors of cell cycle and PI3K/AKT signal pathway were analyzed by Western blot. Results showed that ADR inhibited cell viability and proliferation in K562 and KASUMI-1 cells. However, K562 and KASUMI-1 cells appeared drug resistance for 50 passages at 0.8 microM of ADR. In addition, miR-103 expression was up-regulated in ADR-resistant K562 cells (K562/ADR) and overexpression of miR-103 increased K562 cells drug resistance via promoting cell viability and cell cycle-related factors expressions. COP1 was positively regulated by miR-103, suppression of miR-103 recovered K562/ADR cells drug resistance by regulation of COP1, Trib1, and C/EBPalpha. Besides, miR-103 blocked PI3K/AKT signal pathway by regulation of COP1. These data indicated that miR-103 was up-regulated in drug resistant cells and it may regulate ADR-resistance by regulation of COP1 in AML cells.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Wan, Lin', 'Tian, Yanlong', 'Zhang, Rui', 'Peng, Zhuo', 'Sun, Jiangli', 'Zhang, Wanggang']","['Wan L', 'Tian Y', 'Zhang R', 'Peng Z', 'Sun J', 'Zhang W']","[""Emergency Department, Hospital of Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", 'Department of Pathology, No. 215 Hospital of Shaanxi Nuclear Industry, Xianyang, Shaanxi, China.', ""Emergency Department, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", ""Emergency Department, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", ""Emergency Department, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Retracted Publication']",20180122,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,IM,"['Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*biosynthesis/genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*PI3K/AKT', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*adriamycin', '*cell proliferation COP1 microRNA-103']",2017/10/24 06:00,2018/12/12 06:00,['2017/10/24 06:00'],"['2017/07/19 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [medline]', '2017/10/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.26431 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2018 May;119(5):3843-3852. doi: 10.1002/jcb.26431.

However, to detect subclonal mutations upfront, a deep-sequencing approach with high specificity and sensitivity is required. Here, we performed a proof-of-principle study to detect low-level mosaic RAS pathway mutations by deep sequencing using random tagging-based single molecule Molecular Inversion Probes (smMIPs). The smMIP-based approach could sensitively detect variants with allele frequency as low as 0.4%, which could all be confirmed by other techniques. In comparison, with standard deep-sequencing techniques we reached a detection threshold of only 2.5%, which hampered detection of seven low-level mosaic mutations representing 24% of all detected mutations.

Culture results were available for 163 infection-related complications that occurred in 70 patients: 90 (55.2%) events were culture-negative, 32 (19.6%) were gram-positive bacteria, 20 (12.3%) were gram-negative bacteria, 12 (7.4%) were mixed, 6 (3.7%) were viral, 2 (1.2%) were fungal, and 1 (0.6%) was mycobacterial. Infection-related mortality occurred in 3/24 (13%) of gram-negative events, and 0/51 gram-positive events. On average, nearly one third of patients experienced an infection-related complication with each cycle, and the incidence did not decrease during later cycles. In summary, in patients receiving 10-day decitabine, infectious complications are common and may occur during any cycle of therapy.

We retrospectively analyzed the outcomes of 12 patients with relapsed ALL after allo-HSCT who received DAC therapy. Nine patients received DAC combined with chemotherapy and donor stem cell infusion, and 3 patients received single- agent DAC. Ten of the 12 patients achieved complete remission (CR), 1 achieved a partial remission (PR), and 1 had no response (NR) after treatment at the latest follow-up (LFU), the median survival was 11.2 months (range, 3.8-34, 7 months).

However, the contribution of Mkl1 to the development of colitis remains to be elucidated. The expression of Mkl1 is higher in the colonic lamina propria macrophages (LPMac) of DSS-treated mice than in those of control mice. Therefore, we established a transgenic mouse line that overexpresses human MKL1 (MKL1-Tg) specifically in cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage, in order to investigate the potential role of macrophage MKL1 in the pathogenesis of colitis. MKL1-Tg mice displayed spontaneous colon shortening and rectal prolapse. Flow cytometric and quantitative RT-PCR analyses revealed that, in MKL1-Tg mice compared to littermate controls, the population of LPMac was decreased and had an altered inflammatory phenotype indicative of impaired anti-inflammatory properties, whereas bone marrow-derived macrophages from MKL1-Tg mice skewed towards M1 polarisation. In addition, MKL1-Tg mice had higher susceptibility to DSS-induced colitis than their littermate controls. These observations indicated that MKL1 crucially contributes to the development of colitis via the regulation of the function of macrophages, suggesting that it may be a potential therapeutic target for the prevention of IBD.",,"['An, Jianbo', 'Nagaishi, Takashi', 'Watabe, Taro', 'Naruse, Taeko K', 'Watanabe, Mamoru', 'Kimura, Akinori']","['An J', 'Nagaishi T', 'Watabe T', 'Naruse TK', 'Watanabe M', 'Kimura A']","['Department of Molecular Pathogenesis, Medical Research Institute, Tokyo Medical and Dental University (TMDU), Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Graduate School of Medical Science, Tokyo Medical and Dental University (TMDU), Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Graduate School of Medical Science, Tokyo Medical and Dental University (TMDU), Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Pathogenesis, Medical Research Institute, Tokyo Medical and Dental University (TMDU), Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Graduate School of Medical Science, Tokyo Medical and Dental University (TMDU), Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Pathogenesis, Medical Research Institute, Tokyo Medical and Dental University (TMDU), Tokyo, Japan. akitis@mri.tmd.ac.jp.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171020,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,,"['Animals', 'Cell Polarity', 'Colitis/*metabolism/pathology', 'Colon/metabolism/pathology', 'Dextran Sulfate', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Disease Susceptibility/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/metabolism/pathology', 'Macrophages/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Rectal Prolapse/metabolism/pathology', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*metabolism']",,,2017/10/24 06:00,2019/08/07 06:00,['2017/10/24 06:00'],"['2017/02/03 00:00 [received]', '2017/09/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-017-13629-0 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-017-13629-0 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2017 Oct 20;7(1):13650. doi: 10.1038/s41598-017-13629-0.,PMC5651926,"['0 (MRTFA protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '9042-14-2 (Dextran Sulfate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In six model systems, including patient-derived stem cell-like glioblastoma cultures, inhibition of Bcl-xL induces significantly more apoptosis in IDH1-mutated cells than in wild-type IDH1 cells. Anaplastic astrocytoma samples with mutated IDH1 display lower levels of Mcl-1 than IDH1 wild-type tumors and specific knockdown of Mcl-1 broadly sensitizes glioblastoma cells to Bcl-xL inhibition-mediated apoptosis. Addition of 2-HG to glioblastoma cultures recapitulates the effects of the IDH mutation on intrinsic apoptosis, shuts down oxidative phosphorylation and reduces ATP levels in glioblastoma cells. 2-HG-mediated energy depletion activates AMPK (Threonine 172), blunting protein synthesis and mTOR signaling, culminating in a decline of Mcl-1.

FIV-infected cats are at increased risk of FcaGHV1 DNAemia and consistently harbor higher FcaGHV1 loads than FIV-uninfected cats. Whether immune deficiencies unrelated to FIV are associated with similar risks is unknown. Using whole blood FcaGHV1 qPCR, we found no difference in the frequency of DNAemia or DNA load in therapeutically immunosuppressed (P1, n = 18) or feline leukemia virus (FeLV)-infected (P2, n = 57) patients compared with age- and sex-matched controls (C1, n = 58; C2, n = 57). In contrast, FIV/FeLV-co-infected cats (P3, n = 5) were at increased risk of FcaGHV1 DNAemia compared to retrovirus uninfected controls (C3, n = 39; p = 0.0068), and had a higher median FcaGHV1 DNA load, although the latter was not significant. FIV/FeLV-co-infected cats (P3) had a similar frequency of FcaGHV1 DNAemia reported compared to FIV-infected controls (C4). In conclusion, we found no evidence that cats with therapeutic immunosuppression or FeLV infection were at greater risk of FcaGHV1 DNAemia or had higher FcaGHV1 DNA load in whole blood. The risk of DNAemia in FIV/FeLV-co-infected cats was similar to that documented previously in cats infected with FIV alone.",,"['McLuckie, Alicia J', 'Barrs, Vanessa R', 'Wilson, Bethany', 'Westman, Mark E', 'Beatty, Julia A']","['McLuckie AJ', 'Barrs VR', 'Wilson B', 'Westman ME', 'Beatty JA']","['Faculty of Science, Sydney School of Veterinary Science, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia. amcl8135@uni.sydney.edu.au.', 'Faculty of Science, Sydney School of Veterinary Science, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia. vanessa.barrs@sydney.edu.au.', 'Faculty of Science, School of Life and Environmental Sciences, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia. bethany@cafallstats.com.au.', 'Faculty of Science, Sydney School of Veterinary Science, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia. mark.westman@sydney.edu.au.', 'Faculty of Science, Sydney School of Veterinary Science, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia. julia.beatty@sydney.edu.au.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170314,Switzerland,Vet Sci,Veterinary sciences,101680127,,,['NOTNLM'],"['co-infection', 'comparative medicine', 'gammaherpesvirus', 'immunodeficiency', 'immunosuppression', 'lymphoma', 'retrovirus']",2017/10/24 06:00,2017/10/24 06:01,['2017/10/24 06:00'],"['2017/01/17 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/21 00:00 [revised]', '2017/03/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/24 06:01 [medline]']","['vetsci4010016 [pii]', '10.3390/vetsci4010016 [doi]']",epublish,Vet Sci. 2017 Mar 14;4(1). pii: vetsci4010016. doi: 10.3390/vetsci4010016.,PMC5606616,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This heterogeneity reflects the dynamic condition of ESCs and their versatility to promptly respond to signaling effectors promoting naive or primed pluripotency. Here, we report that ESCs lacking Nanog or overexpressing Otx2 exhibit an early primed identity in LIF + FBS and fail to convert into 2i-induced naive state. Conversely, Otx2-null ESCs possess naive identity features in LIF + FBS similar to Nanog-overexpressing ESCs and convert poorly into FGF-induced early primed state. When both Nanog and Otx2 are inactivated, ESCs cultured in LIF + FBS exhibit primed identity and weakened ability to convert into naive state. These data suggest that, through mutual antagonism, NANOG and OTX2 specify the heterogeneous identity of ESCs cultured in LIF + FBS and individually predispose them for optimal response to naive or primed inducing factors.",['Copyright (c) 2017 The Authors.

Many studies demonstrate impairment of this checkpoint in cancer cells. While leukemia is frequently driven by transformed hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), the biology of the spindle assembly checkpoint in such primary cells is not very well understood. Here, we reveal that the checkpoint is fully functional in murine progenitor cells and, to a lesser extent, in hematopoietic stem cells. We show that HSPCs arrest at prometaphase and induce p53-dependent apoptosis upon prolonged treatment with anti-mitotic drugs. Moreover, the checkpoint can be chemically and genetically abrogated, leading to premature exit from mitosis, subsequent enforced G1 arrest, and enhanced levels of chromosomal damage. We finally demonstrate that, upon checkpoint abrogation in HSPCs, hematopoiesis is impaired, manifested by loss of differentiation potential and engraftment ability, indicating a critical role of this checkpoint in HSPCs and hematopoiesis.",['Copyright (c) 2017 The Authors.

In this study, we retrospectively reviewed the treatment of 21 consecutive patients with coagulopathy, complicated by acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) with or without combination with rTM. Surprisingly, none of the 14 rTM-treated patients developed retinoic acid (RA)-related differentiation syndrome (DS). The co-culture of vascular endothelial cell-derived EA.hy926 and APL-derived NB4 cells in the presence of RA increased production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in culture media, in parallel with activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and increased levels of intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1) in EA.hy926 cells. This was also associated with increased levels of the phosphorylated forms of VE-cadherin and enhanced vascular permeability of EA.hy926 monolayers. Importantly, addition of rTM to this co-culture system inhibited the RA-induced phosphorylation of p38 and VE-cadherin and decreased ICAM1 and vascular permeability in EA.hy926 cells, without a decrease inthe levels of TNF-alpha. Taken together, use of rTM may be a promising treatment strategy to prevent DS in APL patients who receive ATRA.",['Copyright (c) 2017.

FLT3-ITD kinase inhibition is a reasonable but palliative experimental treatment alternative in this situation. Information on long-term outcome is not available. METHODS: We performed a long-term follow-up analysis of a previously reported cohort of 29 FLT3-ITD-positive AML patients, which were treated in relapse after allo-SCT with sorafenib monotherapy. FINDINGS: With a median follow-up of 7.5 years, 6 of 29 patients (21%) are still alive. Excluding one patient who received a second allo-SCT, five patients (17%) achieved sustained complete remissions with sorafenib. Four of these patients are in treatment-free remission for a median of 4.4 years.

GR-PTCA nanocomposites on glassy carbon electrodes served as the immunosensor platform. Due to their excellent electrical conductivity and abundant polycarboxylic sites, the GR-PTCA nanocomposites allowed fast electron transfer and good immobilization of primary antibodies, thereby affording a strong immunosensor signal in the presence of ALV-J. The detected signal could be further amplified by the introduction of NC-Au composites as a carrier of secondary antibodies (Ab2) and by harnessing the catalytic properties of Au and ALP. Under optimized testing conditions, the electrochemical immunosensor displayed excellent analytical performance for the detection of ALV-J, showing a linear current response from 10(2.08) to 10(4.0) TCID50/mL (TCID50: 50% tissue culture infective dose) with a low detection limit of 10(1.98) TCID50/mL (S/N = 3).

We evaluated published safety data, focusing on mortality, neoplasms, cerebrovascular events and diabetes across a number of large-scale pharmaceutical company GH registries. DESIGN: A literature review was conducted using PubMed, EMBASE and Google Scholar to identify all relevant safety data from manufacturers' GH registries published between 1988 and April 2016. Results were hand-sorted to exclude nonrelevant publications; bibliographic references from retrieved articles were evaluated for any additional references. RESULTS: The published data do not support an increased risk of mortality in children or adults treated with GH. There was no evidence of an increased risk of stroke, new malignancy, leukaemia, nonleukaemic extracranial tumours or recurrence of intracranial malignancy in patients without risk factors. The risk of a second neoplasm is increased, particularly if patients have received radiation therapy for a central nervous system tumour. There may be an increased risk of type 2 diabetes in GH-treated patients, but this appears to be confined to those with pre-existing risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with risk factors for malignancy or type 2 diabetes should be treated with caution and monitored during follow-up, but current published data provide reassurance on the long-term safety profile of GH in patients receiving GH treatment.",['(c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Stochholm, Kirstine', 'Kiess, Wieland']","['Stochholm K', 'Kiess W']","['Department of Internal Medicine and Diabetes, Endocrinology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Center of Rare Diseases, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Women and Child Health, Hospital for Children and Adolescents, University Hospitals, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20171120,England,Clin Endocrinol (Oxf),Clinical endocrinology,0346653,IM,"['Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/chemically induced', 'Growth Hormone/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Mortality', 'Neoplasms/chemically induced', 'Product Surveillance, Postmarketing', '*Registries']",['NOTNLM'],"['*cancer', '*diabetes', '*growth hormone', '*safety', '*stroke']",2017/10/22 06:00,2019/09/24 06:00,['2017/10/22 06:00'],"['2017/03/02 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/03 00:00 [revised]', '2017/10/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/24 06:00 [medline]', '2017/10/22 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cen.13502 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Endocrinol (Oxf). 2018 Apr;88(4):515-528. doi: 10.1111/cen.13502.

However, the underlying mechanisms connecting RUNX1 to the success of therapy remain elusive. Here we explore the hypothesis that RUNX1 is directly involved in the response of hematopoietic cells to cytotoxic agents. RUNX1 was upregulated posttranscriptionally by cytotoxic agents in C57BL/6 mice in vivo and hematopoietic cell lines. Upregulation was also seen in primary human AML cells after treatment with cytarabine in vitro Upon overexpression, RUNX1 restricted proliferation, promoted apoptosis, and augmented the DNA damage response. This unknown activity of RUNX1 required an intact runt homology domain (RHD), a domain where most leukemia-associated point mutations cluster. Consistent with this, two RHD-defective RUNX1 proteins lacked any antiproliferative or apoptotic activity, and RHD-defective (K83N, N109D) mutant RUNX1 conferred resistance to ionizing radiation when overexpressed in Ba/F3 cells under certain conditions. Our experiments reveal a novel function of RUNX1 and offer an explanation for the link between RUNX1 mutations and chemotherapy and radiation resistance. Moreover, these data suggest that pharmacologic modulation of RUNX1 might be an attractive new approach to treat hematologic malignancies. Cancer Res; 77(24); 6818-24.

Epitope vaccine will be a perspective trend. Previously, we identified a variant antigenic neutralizing epitope in hypervariable region 1 (hr1) of ALV-J, N-LRDFIA/E/TKWKS/GDDL/HLIRPYVNQS-C. BLAST analysis showed that the mutation of A, E, T and H in this epitope cover 79% of all ALV-J strains. Base on this data, we designed a multi-variant epitope ensemble vaccine comprising the four mutation variants linked with glycine and serine. The recombinant multi-variant epitope gene was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21. The expressed protein of the variant multi-variant epitope gene can react with positive sera and monoclonal antibodies of ALV-J, while cannot react with ALV-J negative sera. The multi-variant epitope vaccine that conjugated Freund's adjuvant complete/incomplete showed high immunogenicity that reached the titer of 1:64,000 at 42 days post immunization and maintained the immune period for at least 126 days in SPF chickens. Further, we demonstrated that the antibody induced by the variant multi-variant ensemble epitope vaccine recognized and neutralized different ALV-J strains (NX0101, TA1, WS1, BZ1224 and BZ4). Protection experiment that was evaluated by clinical symptom, viral shedding, weight gain, gross and histopathology showed 100% chickens that inoculated the multi-epitope vaccine were well protected against ALV-J challenge. The result shows a promising multi-variant epitope ensemble vaccine against hypervariable viruses in animals.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

CSCs are able to give rise to bulk tumor cells that have the capability to override antiproliferative signals and evade apoptosis. Numerous pathways are dysregulated in tumor cells, where increased levels of prooxidant reactive oxygen and nitrogen species can lead to localized inflammation to exacerbate all three stages of tumorigenesis: initiation, progression, and metastasis. Modulation of cellular metabolism in tumor cells as well as immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) can impact inflammatory networks. Altering these pathways can potentially serve as a portal for therapy. It is well known that selenium, through selenoproteins, modulates inflammatory pathways in addition to regulating redox homeostasis in cells. Therefore, selenium has the potential to impact the interaction between tumor cells, CSCs, and immune cells. In the sections later, we review the current status of knowledge regarding this interaction, with reference to leukemia stem cells, and the importance of selenium-dependent regulation of inflammation as a potential mechanism to affect the TME and tumor cell survival.",['(c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Manual microscopic examination of peripheral blood or bone marrow aspirate smears is time consuming and less accurate. The first and very important step in blast recognition is the segmentation of the cells from the background for further cell feature extraction and cell classification. In this paper, we aimed to utilize computer technologies in image analysis and artificial intelligence to develop an automatic program for blast recognition and counting in the aspirate smears. METHODS: We proposed a method to analyze the aspirate smear images, which first performs segmentation of the cells by k-means cluster, then builds cell image representing model by HMRF (Hidden-Markov Random Field), estimates model parameters through probability of EM (expectation maximization), carries out convergence iteration until optimal value, and finally achieves second stage refined segmentation. Furthermore, the segmentation results are compared with several other methods using six classes of cells respectively. RESULTS: The proposed method was applied to six groups of cells from 61 bone marrow aspirate images, and compared with other algorithms for its performance on the analysis of the whole images, the segmentation of nucleus, and the efficiency of calculation. It showed improved segmentation results in both the cropped images and the whole images, which provide the base for down-stream cell feature extraction and identification. CONCLUSIONS: Segmentation of the aspirate smear images using the proposed method helps the analyst in differentiating six groups of cells and in the determination of blasts counting, which will be of great significance for the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Red blood cell transfusions are an important component of supportive care in patients with MDS. Prolonged exposure to transfusions can lead to iron overload, which results in iron-induced toxicity caused by the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS accumulation has detrimental effects also on hematopoietic stem cells and may contribute to MDS progression. The observation that iron chelation improves hematologic parameters and reduces transfusion dependence further indicates that iron overload impairs hematopoiesis. Over the past decade, the mechanisms regulating iron homeostasis and the complex interplay between iron overload and toxicity, ineffective hematopoiesis, and transformation to leukemia have become clearer. In this narrative review, we provide an overview of recent findings pertaining to iron overload in patients with MDS and its effects on hematopoiesis.

The aim of this study was to analyse the relationship between clinical appearance and histopathological features of gingival lesions in a large Northern Italian population. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective study of 788 cases of gingival and alveolar mucosal biopsies was set up. Statistical analysis was performed by calculating the odds ratio and 95% confidence interval (C.I.), in order to assess the degree of association between the clinical parameters considered (primary lesions) and the single pathologies, statistically evaluated by Mantel-Haenszel tests. The correlation between clinical and histological diagnosis was classified as follow: 1) expected data (ED): provisional clinical diagnosis; 2) real data (RD): final histopathology diagnosis; 3) concordant data (CD): correspondence between the expected data and real data. The correlation was calculated as follow: CC (complete concordance) = CD x 100 / ED, this expressing the percentage in which the clinical and the histological diagnosis overlapped. RESULTS: The most frequently observed and biopsied primary lesions resulted to be exophytic, followed by mucosal colour changes and finally by losses of substance. The statistically significant association between primary lesion and their manifestation in gingival pathologies was reported. Volume increases, for instance, were positively correlated to plasma cell epulis, pyogenic granuloma, fibrous reactive hyperplasia and hemangioma. Verrucous-papillary lesions were most often seen in verrucous carcinoma, verrucous leukoplakia and mild dysplasia. White lesion resulted to be related to leukoplakia or oral lichen planus. Red lesions resulted to be related only oral lichen planus. Erosive vesicle-bullous lesions were linked to disimmune pathologies. Ulcerative lesions were positively associated to oral squamous cell cancer. Finally, potentially malignant disorders have the most percentage high concordance. Among the malignant lesions, the correlation increased up to the squamous cell carcinoma and leukaemia. CONCLUSIONS: This article presented the frequency and the clinico-pathological concordance of all primary lesions and the histopathological diagnosis of gingival lesions.

The manifestations may include progressive sclerosis-like changes that may involve various body sites, including the oropharynx. METHODS AND RESULTS: We present two cGVHD cases of oropharyngeal fibrotic changes that affected functions that were treated with photobiomodulation (PBM) therapy. These case reports suggest that PBM therapy represents an additional, innovative approach affecting discrete phases in cGVHD-associated fibrotic changes. CONCLUSIONS: We discuss these observations in the context of currently understood molecular mechanisms, especially induction of transforming growth factor beta and NFkappaB that appear to be counter-intuitive to their known roles in matrix synthesis and inflammation that contribute to tissue fibroses. The clinical benefit noted in the two cases presented clearly indicates that there are distinct mechanistic and biological insights in the regulation of these molecular pathways in determining therapeutic efficacy with PBM therapy.",,"['Epstein, Joel B', 'Raber-Durlacher, Judith E', 'Huysmans, Marie-Charlotte', 'Schoordijk, Maria C E', 'Cheng, Jerry E', 'Bensadoun, Rene-Jean', 'Arany, Praveen R']","['Epstein JB', 'Raber-Durlacher JE', 'Huysmans MC', 'Schoordijk MCE', 'Cheng JE', 'Bensadoun RJ', 'Arany PR']","['1 Cancer Dentistry, Samuel Oschin Comprehensive Cancer Institute , Cedars-Sinai Health Center, Los Angeles, California.', '2 Department of Oral Medicine, City of Hope , Duarte, California.', '3 Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Academic Medical Center , Amsterdam, The Netherlands .', '4 Department of Oral Medicine, and Academic Centre for Dentistry Amsterdam (ACTA), University of Amsterdam and VU University Amsterdam , Amsterdam, The Netherlands .', '5 Department of Dentistry, Radboud University Medical Center , Nijmegen, The Netherlands .', '6 Department of Hematology, VU University Amsterdam , The Netherlands .', '2 Department of Oral Medicine, City of Hope , Duarte, California.', '7 Kaiser Permanente , Los Angeles, California.', '8 Centre de Haute Engergie , Nice, France .', '9 Department of Oral Biology, School of Dental Medicine, University at Buffalo , Buffalo, New York.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20171019,United States,Photomed Laser Surg,Photomedicine and laser surgery,101222340,IM,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Female', 'Fibrosis/pathology/radiotherapy', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*surgery', 'Low-Level Light Therapy/*methods', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*surgery', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Sampling Studies', 'Time Factors', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*metabolism', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['dysphagia', 'fibrosis', 'hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'low-level light/laser therapy', 'oral graft versus host disease', 'photobiomodulation therapy', 'trismus']",2017/10/21 06:00,2018/09/11 06:00,['2017/10/21 06:00'],"['2017/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/11 06:00 [medline]', '2017/10/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/pho.2017.4297 [doi]'],ppublish,Photomed Laser Surg. 2018 Feb;36(2):92-99. doi: 10.1089/pho.2017.4297.

It still remains unknown, however, whether the predictive role of higher ALCs reflects general bone marrow recovery or a more specific attribute of immune function. To investigate this question, we implemented a prospective observational cohort study in 20 children with BCP ALL on day 29 (D29) of induction chemotherapy and immunophenotyped their lymphoid (T, B and natural killer cells) and myeloid (neutrophils, monocytes, dendritic cells) compartments. In a first evaluation of a cohort treated with Children's Oncology Group-based induction chemotherapy, the immune cell compartments were differentially depleted at D29. Neither gender, risk status, minimal residual disease, nor bone marrow recovery markers correlated with D29 ALC. In contrast, both CD3(+) T cell and dendritic cell compartments, which did not correlate with age, significantly correlated with D29 ALC (p < 0.0001). In addition, subset complexity of cellular immune compartments was preserved at D29. This study reveals that D29 ALC significantly correlates with distinct immune cell compartments but not with bone marrow recovery markers, suggesting that higher D29 ALCs may contribute to leukemia control by inducing specific host immune activity.",,"['Rolf, Nina', 'Smolen, Kinga K', 'Kariminia, Amina', 'Velenosi, Adam', 'Fidanza, Mario', 'Strahlendorf, Caron', 'Seif, Alix E', 'Reid, Gregor S D']","['Rolf N', 'Smolen KK', 'Kariminia A', 'Velenosi A', 'Fidanza M', 'Strahlendorf C', 'Seif AE', 'Reid GSD']","[""Michael Cuccione Childhood Cancer Research Program, BC Children's Hospital Research Institute, 950 West 28th Avenue, Reid Lab (Room 3062), Vancouver, BC, V5Z 4H4, Canada. ninarolf@mail.com."", 'Division of Pediatric Hem/Onc/BMT, Department of Pediatrics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada. ninarolf@mail.com.', 'Experimental Medicine Program, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', ""Michael Cuccione Childhood Cancer Research Program, BC Children's Hospital Research Institute, 950 West 28th Avenue, Reid Lab (Room 3062), Vancouver, BC, V5Z 4H4, Canada."", ""Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, BC Children's Hospital Biobank, Vancouver, BC, Canada."", ""Michael Cuccione Childhood Cancer Research Program, BC Children's Hospital Research Institute, 950 West 28th Avenue, Reid Lab (Room 3062), Vancouver, BC, V5Z 4H4, Canada."", 'Experimental Medicine Program, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Division of Pediatric Hem/Onc/BMT, Department of Pediatrics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', ""Center for Childhood Cancer Research, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA."", ""Michael Cuccione Childhood Cancer Research Program, BC Children's Hospital Research Institute, 950 West 28th Avenue, Reid Lab (Room 3062), Vancouver, BC, V5Z 4H4, Canada."", 'Division of Pediatric Hem/Onc/BMT, Department of Pediatrics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171020,Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/*methods', 'Infant', 'Lymphocyte Count/*methods', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies']",['NOTNLM'],"['*ALC', '*Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*Children', '*Flow cytometry', '*Immune composition', '*Induction chemotherapy']",2017/10/21 06:00,2018/12/12 06:00,['2017/10/21 06:00'],"['2017/04/20 00:00 [received]', '2017/09/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [medline]', '2017/10/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00262-017-2070-3 [doi]', '10.1007/s00262-017-2070-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2018 Feb;67(2):225-236. doi: 10.1007/s00262-017-2070-3.

DESIGN: Prospective, descriptive.. SETTING: An interdisciplinary oncology outpatient clinic in Germany.. SAMPLE: 35 outpatients with CML on oral TKIs.. METHODS: Adherence and coping strategies were assessed with questionnaires. Clinical data were extracted from medical charts.. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Adherence rates, main coping strategies, and frequency and contents of single coping strategies.. FINDINGS: 18 patients showed adherence according to the applied screening instrument. Main coping strategies were spirituality and search for meaning. The two single items most frequently specified were adhering to medical instructions and trusting in the medical personnel involved.. CONCLUSIONS: The low adherence rate of 51% most likely resulted from using the Basel Assessment of Adherence Scale as the questionnaire of choice. The relevance of spirituality and search for meaning as main coping strategies has not been shown previously in outpatients with CML. Most patients wish to obey medical instructions accurately and put trust in their oncologists; this introduces a resource that should gain relevance considering the increasing number of oral anticancer drugs.. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Nurses are encouraged to routinely assess adherence and spiritual needs in outpatients with CML. Spirituality and search for meaning represent pivotal coping strategies in this group, which has an excellent prognosis.

HTLV-1 research in the past 35 years has been most revealing in the mechanisms of viral oncogenesis. HTLV-1 establishes a lifelong persistent infection in CD4(+) T lymphocytes. The infection outcome is governed by host immunity. ATL develops in 2-5% of infected individuals 30-50 years after initial exposure. HTLV-1 encodes two oncoproteins Tax and HBZ, which are required for initiation of cellular transformation and maintenance of cell proliferation, respectively. HTLV-1 oncogenesis is driven by a clonal selection and expansion process during which both host and viral factors cooperate to impair genome stability, immune surveillance, and other mechanisms of tumor suppression.

MCPyV infection is widespread in the general population. MCPyV-associated MCC is one of the most aggressive skin cancers, killing more patients than other well-known cancers such as cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Currently, however, there is no effective drug for curing this cancer. The incidence of MCC has tripled over the past two decades. With the widespread infection of MCPyV and the increase in MCC diagnoses, it is critical to better understand the biology of MCPyV and its oncogenic potential. In this chapter, we summarize recent discoveries regarding MCPyV molecular virology, host cellular tropism, mechanisms of MCPyV oncoprotein-mediated oncogenesis, and current therapeutic strategies for MCPyV-associated MCC.

Previous studies incorporating daily 6-TG into maintenance chemotherapy demonstrated a high incidence of SOS, typically presenting after prolonged exposures to 6-TG. 6-TG continues to be used as a single, 14-day burst during intensification; however, SOS associated with brief courses of 6-TG is poorly described. We aim to describe this rare though clinically significant phenomenon. METHODS: Children with 6-TG-related SOS were retrospectively identified from 680 de novo patients with ALL at Texas Children's Cancer Center over 8 years. Clinical characteristics and outcomes are described. RESULTS: Ten (1.5%) patients were identified with SOS. No predominant sex, ethnicity, or race was noted. SOS was diagnosed 16.5 (6-42) days from starting 6-TG. Isolated thrombocytopenia (IT) was noted in 9/10 patients and presented a median of 5 days prior to SOS. Refractoriness to platelet transfusions was noted in 8/10 patients, presenting a median of 2 days prior to SOS. Most patients were otherwise clinically stable outpatients upon presenting with IT or transfusion refractoriness. Fever was noted in 7/10 patients at diagnosis and 6/10 had documented or suspected infection within 14 days of SOS. Two patients died, while eight fully recovered. Intermediate thiopurine methyltransferase genotype was noted in 5/8 patients with data available. CONCLUSION: SOS following short courses of 6-TG in DI is clinically distinct from SOS following prolonged courses of 6-TG in maintenance, particularly in its early presentation and outcomes.",,"['McAtee, Casey L', 'Schneller, Netta', 'Brackett, Julienne', 'Bernhardt, M Brooke', 'Schafer, Eric S']","['McAtee CL', 'Schneller N', 'Brackett J', 'Bernhardt MB', 'Schafer ES']","['Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, 1102 Bates St., Suite 1025, Houston, TX, 77030, USA. cxmcatee@texaschildrens.org.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, 1102 Bates St., Suite 1025, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, 1102 Bates St., Suite 1025, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', ""Department of Pharmacy, Texas Children's Hospital, 6701 Fannin St., Houston, TX, 77030, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, 1102 Bates St., Suite 1025, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20171019,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hepatic Veno-Occlusive Disease/*etiology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications', 'Retrospective Studies']",['NOTNLM'],"['6-MP', '6-TG', 'ADR', 'ALL', 'SOS', 'VOD']",2017/10/21 06:00,2017/12/02 06:00,['2017/10/21 06:00'],"['2017/09/14 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/02 06:00 [medline]', '2017/10/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00280-017-3453-z [doi]', '10.1007/s00280-017-3453-z [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2017 Dec;80(6):1261-1264. doi: 10.1007/s00280-017-3453-z.

Symptomatology included dyspnea. She was found to have pathological fracture of the femur caused by CLL. The diagnosis of CLL had been made 6 years previously, but the patient had refused therapy. On admission, the patient required endotracheal intubation, mechanical ventilation, and admission to the medical intensive care unit. Endotracheal intubation extubation was successful after 48 hours. The patient then complained of severe left knee pain. Bone radiograph and femoral computed tomography scan revealed acute pathological fracture of the left distal femur. There was no history of trauma. The fracture was stabilized with extension lock splint. Pathological fracture in patients with CLL is associated with hypercalcemia, Richter's transformation, or multiple myeloma.

Midostaurin is an orally administered type III tyrosine kinase inhibitor which in addition to FLT3 inhibits c-kit, platelet-derived growth factor receptors, src, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor. Midostaurin is the first FLT3 inhibitor that has been shown to significantly improve survival in younger patients with FLT3-mut AML when given in combination with standard cytotoxic chemotherapy based on the recently completed RATIFY study. Its role for maintenance therapy after allogeneic transplantation and use in combination with hypomethylating agents for older patients with FLT3-mut has not yet been defined. Midostaurin also has recently been shown to have significant activity in systemic mastocytosis and related disorders due to its inhibitory effect on c-kit bearing a D816V mutation. Activation of downstream pathways in both of these myeloid malignancies likely plays an important role in the development of resistance, and strategies to inhibit these downstream targets may be synergistic.

Oligodeoxyribonucleotides (ODNs) can be transported into the cytoplasm or nucleus of cells under certain conditions. Among ODNs composed of a single type of nucleotide, the transport efficiency differs with the length and nucleotide composition of the ODNs and varies in different types of leukaemia cells; among the 5 tested random sequence ODNs and 3 aptamers with varying sequences, the data showed that some sequences were associated with significantly higher transport efficiency than others. The transport of ODNs was sodium, energy, and pH-independent, membrane protein-dependent, substrate nonspecific for ODNs and 4-nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBMPR)-insensitive, but it showed a low sensitivity to dipyridamole (IC50 = 35.44 micromol/L), distinguishing it from ENT1-4 and CNTs. The delivery efficiency of ODNs was superior to that of Lipofection and Nucleofection, demonstrating its potential applications in research or therapeutics.

There is compelling evidence that potent selective antileukemic effects can be delivered by donor T cells specific for particular minor histocompatibility (H) antigens. Thus, T-cell receptors (TCRs) isolated from minor H antigen-specific T cells represent an untapped resource for developing targeted T-cell immunotherapy to manage post-HCT leukemic relapse. Recognizing that several elements may be crucial to the efficacy and safety of engineered T-cell immunotherapy, we developed a therapeutic transgene with 4 components: (1) a TCR specific for the hematopoietic-restricted, leukemia-associated minor H antigen, HA-1; (2) a CD8 coreceptor to promote function of the class I-restricted TCR in CD4(+) T cells; (3) an inducible caspase 9 safety switch to enable elimination of the HA-1 TCR T cells in case of toxicity; and (4) a CD34-CD20 epitope to facilitate selection of the engineered cell product and tracking of transferred HA-1 TCR T cells. The T-cell product includes HA-1 TCR CD4(+) T cells to augment the persistence and function of the HA-1 TCR CD8(+) T cells and includes only memory T cells; naive T cells are excluded to limit the potential for alloreactivity mediated by native TCR coexpressed by HA-1 TCR T cells. We describe the development of this unique immunotherapy and demonstrate functional responses to primary leukemia by CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells transduced with a lentiviral vector incorporating the HA-1 TCR transgene construct.",['(c) 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Dossa, Robson G', 'Cunningham, Tanya', 'Sommermeyer, Daniel', 'Medina-Rodriguez, Indira', 'Biernacki, Melinda A', 'Foster, Kimberly', 'Bleakley, Marie']","['Dossa RG', 'Cunningham T', 'Sommermeyer D', 'Medina-Rodriguez I', 'Biernacki MA', 'Foster K', 'Bleakley M']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA; and.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA; and.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA; and.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA; and.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA; and.', 'Department of Medicine and.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA; and.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA; and.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171019,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Cells, Cultured', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia/immunology/*therapy', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/metabolism', 'Oligopeptides/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",,,2017/10/21 06:00,2018/10/13 06:00,['2017/10/21 06:00'],"['2017/07/14 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/13 06:00 [medline]', '2017/10/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)32589-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2017-07-791608 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2018 Jan 4;131(1):108-120. doi: 10.1182/blood-2017-07-791608.

Whether oncogenetic mutation profiles can improve the discrimination of MRD-defined risk categories was unknown. Two hundred and twenty FRALLE2000T-treated patients were tested retrospectively for NOTCH1/FBXW7/RAS and PTEN alterations. Patients with NOTCH1/FBXW7 (N/F) mutations and RAS/PTEN (R/P) germ line (GL) were classified as oncogenetic low risk (gLoR; n = 111), whereas those with N/F GL and R/P GL mutations or N/F and R/P mutations were classified as high risk (gHiR; n = 109). Day 35 MRD status was available for 191 patients. Five-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) and disease-free survival were 36% and 60% for gHiR patients and 11% and 89% for gLoR patients, respectively. Importantly, among the 60% of patients with MRD <10(-4), 5-year CIR was 29% for gHiR patients and 4% for gLoR patients. Based on multivariable Cox models and stepwise selection, the 3 most discriminating variables were the oncogenetic classifier, MRD, and white blood cell (WBC) count. Patients harboring a WBC count >/=200 x 10(9)/L, gHiR classifier, and MRD >/=10(-4) demonstrated a 5-year CIR of 46%, whereas the 58 patients (30%) with a WBC count <200 x 10(9)/L, gLoR classifier, and MRD <10(-4) had a very low risk of relapse, with a 5-year CIR of only 2%. In childhood T-ALL, the N/F/R/P mutation profile is an independent predictor of relapse.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The National Cancer Database was queried to identify patients diagnosed with NLPHL between 2004 and 2012. Overall survival (OS) was determined using univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis. Kaplan-Meier and log-rank analysis were used to estimate differences in OS between treatment groups. RESULTS: A total of 1968 patients were identified for analysis, consisting of stage I (40.4%), stage II (29.3%), stage III (22.3%), and stage IV (8.0%) disease. The median age of patients was 46 years. The following factors were predictive of radiotherapy (RT) omission in treatment: increasing age, black race, Medicare insurance, chemotherapy use, stage II to IV disease, and the presence of B-symptoms. On survival analysis, RT was associated with prolonged OS in all stages of NLPHL (50.1 vs. 42.4 months; P < .01). The OS benefit of RT persisted on multivariate analysis (hazard ratio, 0.37; P < .01). On subset analysis, RT was associated with prolonged OS in early disease (49.8 vs. 45.5 months; P < .01), whereas a trend towards an OS benefit was observed in advanced-stage (54.1 vs. 39.6 months; P = .06) NLPHL. Radiotherapy was also associated with prolonged OS among patients with B-symptoms (49.0 vs. 42.6 months; P < .01). CONCLUSION: The use of RT in NLPHL is less likely among those with advanced-stage disease and B-symptoms. However, we found RT to be associated with prolonged OS in all stages of NLPHL, including those with B-symptoms.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

PMA treatment significantly altered the production of miRNA in K562 cells. Expression of 24.4% of miRNAs were found to be stimulated whereas expression of 10% miRNAs were inhibited by PMA treatment. Our results suggest that miRNA precursors are processed into isomiRs in a deterministic manner. The relative levels of different isomiRs of a miRNA remained mainly unchanged even after PMA treatment irrespective of overall changes in expression (either up-regulation or down-regulation). However, not all miRNAs behave in the same way, about 7% showed a variation of isomiR profiles after PMA treatment. Most of the later class of miRNAs were found to be oncogenic miRNAs. Further, it was also found that number of isomiRs was independent of abundance of a miRNA. Functional importance of different isomiRs was demonstrated using three different isomiRs of miR-22. Our results showed that different isomiRs could inhibit expression of targets genes with different efficiencies. Our study suggests that the heterogeneity of a miRNA population generated during processing is in general regulated and that variation in the generation of an isomiR can be a functionally important regulatory feature.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Using the Danish National Acute Leukemia Registry, we compared relapse risk, relapse-free survival (RFS), and overall survival (OS) between patients with unfavorable cytogenetic features receiving postremission therapy with conventional chemotherapy only versus those undergoing HSCT in CR1. To minimize immortal time bias, we performed Cox proportional hazards regression, included date of allogeneic HSCT as a time-dependent covariate, and stratified the results by age (<60 or >/=60 years) and cytogenetic risk group. Overall, 1031 patients achieved a CR1. Of these, 196 patients (19%) underwent HSCT. HSCT was associated with a lower relapse rate (24% versus 49%) despite a similar median time to relapse (287 days versus 265 days). In all subgroups, the risk of relapse was lower and both RFS and OS were superior in recipients of HSCT (OS, adjusted mortality ratios: all patients, .54 [95% confidence interval (CI), .42-.71]; patients age <60 years, .58 [95% CI, .42-.81]; patients age >/=60 years, .42 [95% CI, .26-.69]; patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics, .63 [95% CI, .43-.87]; patients with adverse-risk cytogenetics, .40 [95% CI, .24-.67]). In conclusion, in this population-based nationwide cohort study, HSCT was associated with improved survival in both younger and older patients and in patients with both intermediate and adverse cytogenetic risk.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Nilotinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets the same receptors as imatinib but with different affinities. We tested the hypothesis that nilotinib is safe and has clinical activity in cGVHD. Thirty-three participants were enrolled in a phase I/II dose escalation and dose extension clinical trial of nilotinib for the treatment of steroid-refractory or- dependent cGVHD (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01155817). We assessed safety, clinical response, and pretreatment anti-platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha chain (anti-PDGFRA) antibody levels. The 200-mg dose was identified as the maximum tolerated dose and used for the phase II dose extension study. At 6 months the incidence of failure-free survival (FFS), cGVHD progression, and nilotinib intolerance resulting in its discontinuation was 50%, 23%, and 23%, respectively. cGVHD responses in skin, joints, and mouth were observed at 3 and 6 months based on improvement in respective National Institutes of Health organ severity scores. Pretreatment anti-PDGFRA antibody levels >/= .150 optical density as measured by ELISA correlated with longer FFS time (P < .0005) and trended with time until cGVHD progression (P < .06) but not drug intolerance. Nilotinib may be effective for corticosteroid-resistant or -refractory cGVHD in some patients, but its use is limited by intolerable side effects. Selection of patients with high pretreatment anti-PDGFRA antibody levels might improve the risk-to-benefit ratio of nilotinib and better justify its side effects.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Large retrospective studies revealed significant differences in terms of outcome, with particularly poor response rates in early or refractory relapses, whereas late relapses usually respond very well to repeated standard induction. Particularly new immunotherapy compounds like the CD19 bispecific antibody Blinatumomab and the conjugated CD22 antibody Inotuzumab yielded promising response rates compared to standard therapies in randomised trials. Long-term survival is however still poor. The optimal use of these compounds remains to be defined. Chimeric antigen receptor T-cells are another promising treatment approach and multicenter clinical trials in adult ALL are awaited. For selected patients molecular directed therapies may have a role in relapsed ALL; standard diagnostic algorithms need to be defined. One of the major challenges is to define the role of stem cell transplantation after relapse. Whereas this procedure appears to be the only chance for cure, the mortality and relapse rate are still high and optimisation is urgently needed.

The International ALL Study jointly conducted by ECOG and MRC completely changed perceptions indicating, surprisingly to many, that transplantation - particularly for patients at standard risk - offered a significant survival advantage. There followed trials of more intensive chemotherapy demonstrating improved results that may obviate the need for allogeneic transplantation.

In the last decade, unbiased genome-wide association studies have identified multiple germline risk factors that strongly modify host response to drug therapy. Some of these genomic associations (e.g. TPMT, NUDT15 and mercaptopurine dosing) have accumulated a significant level of evidence on their clinical utility such that they are warranted as routine clinical tests to guide modification of treatment. Most of these germline associations however, have not yet reached such actionability. Insights have also been gathered on germline factors that affect host susceptibility to adverse effects of antileukemic agents (eg, vincristine, asparaginase, methotrexate).

The prevalence of Ph-like ALL increases with age, ranging from 10-15% of children to over 25% of young adults with ALL. It occurs more frequently in males and is associated with adverse clinical features including elevated minimal residual disease levels and poor survival in both children and adults. The genomic landscape of Ph-like ALL is characterized by a diverse range of genetic alterations that dysregulate cytokine receptor and kinase signaling pathways, including rearrangement of CRLF2 and other tyrosine kinases (predominantly ABL-class and Janus kinases). Compelling preclinical data suggest patients harboring ABL-class rearrangements are candidates for ABL1-inhibitors, whilst alterations activating the JAK-STAT pathway may be amenable to treatment with JAK inhibitors. The success of combinatorial treatment of tyrosine kinase inhibitors with chemotherapy in Ph-positive ALL provides a framework for testing this approach in Ph-like ALL.

Advanced age, comorbidities, high treatment-related death rates with traditional chemotherapy, and relapse combine to yield poor survival. Reduced-intensity induction with BCR-ABL1 targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and corticosteroids yields CR rates 96-100% with no induction mortality but relapse is nearly certain without effective consolidation. Few clinical trials provide guidance on optimal consolidation for older Ph+ ALL. With second-generation TKIs, lower intensity chemotherapy after induction gives similar outcomes to intensive consolidation although long-term survival is still poor. Consolidation with allogeneic or autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation may improve survival for fit older patients. Novel targeted therapies like blinatumomab, inotuzumab ozogamicin, and CD19-targeted CAR T-cells hold promise to improve survival with reduced toxicity.

The five-year overall survival for this older cohort of patients is approximately 20 percent, and there has been no improvement in their survival in decades [2]. The challenge in managing older patients with ALL is achieving balance between efficacy of treatment and the toxicity of multi-agent chemotherapy. The latter approach is highly effective in younger adults, but greatly limited by toxicity in older adults. New classes of agents, bi-specific T-cell engager (BiTE) monoclonal antibody and antibody drug conjugates (ADC) have been introduced into the treatment of ALL, and these agents have achieved therapeutic responses and manageable toxicity in patients of all ages with relapsed refractory ALL. These newer immunotherapy agents may improve the treatment of older adults. This review focuses on the new approaches to treatment of Ph- B-cell ALL in older patients.

Fresh frozen tissues from 10 samples of cervical cancer and 8normal cervical tissues were analyzed for HPIP expression using real-time reverse transcription PCR and Western blot analysis. A total of 129 paraffin-embedded surgical specimens from patients with CC were collected for an immunohistochemistry assay to measure HPIP expression. Correlations of HPIP expression with clinicopathological factors and prognosis of patients with cervical cancer were analyzed.

Because de novo pyrimidine synthesis is inhibited by the immunomodulator teriflunomide and its pro-drug leflunomide, we examined the effect of combined treatment with AZA and teriflunomide on AZA resistance to develop a novel strategy to cancel and prevent AZA resistance. Teriflunomide markedly inhibited the growth of AZA-resistant human leukemia cell lines (R-U937 and R-HL-60) in comparison with their AZA-sensitive counterparts (U937 and HL-60). In the presence of a non-toxic concentration of teriflunomide (1 muM), AZA induced apoptosis in AZA-resistant cells and leukemia cells from AZA-resistant patients. AZA acted as a DNA methyltransferase 3A inhibitor in AZA-resistant cells in the presence of 1 muM teriflunomide. Although AZA-sensitive cells acquired AZA resistance after continuous treatment with AZA for 42 days, the growth of AZA-sensitive cells continuously treated with the combination of AZA and teriflunomide was significantly inhibited in the presence of AZA, demonstrating that the combined treatment prevented AZA resistance.

This includes reports from this laboratory that constitutive Egr1 overrides leukemia conferred by deregulated c-Myc or E2F-1 in the M1 myeloid leukemic cell line by promoting differentiation. To investigate the effect of Egr1 on the initiation and progression of Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML), lethally irradiated syngeneic wild type mice were reconstituted with bone marrow (BM) from either wild type or Egr1 null mice transduced with a 210-kD BCR-ABL-expressing MSCV-retrovirus (bone marrow transplantation {BMT}). Loss of Egr1 was observed to accelerate the development of BCR-ABL driven leukemia in recipient mice, resulting in the development of a more aggressive disease, a significantly shortened median survival time, and increased BCR-ABL expressing leukemic stem/progenitor cells (GFP+Lin-cKit+Sca+). Egr1 deficient progenitors expressing BCR-ABL exhibited decreased apoptosis, and increased cell viability and proliferation relative to WT counterparts. Secondary BMT of BCR-ABL BM revealed that loss of Egr1 resulted in enrichment of LSCs, consistent with shorter survival time and more aggressive disease of these mice compared to WT counterparts. Furthermore, serial re-plating colony assays indicated that loss of Egr1 increased self-renewal ability of BCR-ABL expressing BM. These novel findings on the tumor suppressor role of Egr1 in CML provide the impetus to study the effect of altering Egr1 expression in AML, where the overall five year survival rate remains low. The effect of loss of Egr1 in CML could reflect its established functions in normal hematopoiesis, maintaining quiescence of HSCs and driving terminal differentiation to the monocyte/macrophage lineage. Gain of function studies should validate these conclusions and provide further rationale for increased Egr1 as a therapeutic target in AML.",,"['Maifrede, Silvia', 'Magimaidas, Andrew', 'Sha, Xiaojin', 'Mukherjee, Kaushiki', 'Liebermann, Dan A', 'Hoffman, Barbara']","['Maifrede S', 'Magimaidas A', 'Sha X', 'Mukherjee K', 'Liebermann DA', 'Hoffman B']","['Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Temple University Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Temple University Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Temple University Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Current address: Department of Systems Pharmacology and Translational Therapeutics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania.', 'Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Temple University Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Temple University Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Temple University Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Genetics and Molecular Biochemistry, Temple University Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Temple University Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Genetics and Molecular Biochemistry, Temple University Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170901,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Egr1', 'Leukemic stem cells', 'chronic myelogenous leukemia', 'stress response protein', 'tumor suppressor']",2017/10/21 06:00,2017/10/21 06:01,['2017/10/21 06:00'],"['2017/05/11 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/21 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.20612 [doi]', '20612 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Sep 1;8(41):69281-69294. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.20612. eCollection 2017 Sep 19.,PMC5642478,,"['P50 CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA081168/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA162403/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most ATL patients develop osteolytic lesions and hypercalcemia of malignancy, causing severe skeletal related complications and reduced overall survival. The HTLV-1 virus encodes 2 viral oncogenes, Tax and HBZ. Tax, a transcriptional activator, is critical to ATL development, and has been implicated in pathologic osteolysis. HBZ, HTLV-1 basic leucine zipper transcription factor, promotes tumor cell proliferation and disrupts Wnt pathway modulators; however, its role in ATL induced osteolytic bone loss is unknown. To determine if HBZ is sufficient for the development of bone loss, we established a transgenic Granzyme B HBZ (Gzmb-HBZ) mouse model. Lymphoproliferative disease including tumors, enlarged spleens and/or abnormal white cell counts developed in two-thirds of Gzmb-HBZ mice at 18 months. HBZ positive cells were detected in tumors, spleen and bone marrow. Importantly, pathologic bone loss and hypercalcemia were present at 18 months. Bone-acting factors were present in serum and RANKL, PTHrP and DKK1, key mediators of hypercalcemia and bone loss, were upregulated in Gzmb-HBZ T cells.

Method: The clinical data from 330 ALL children who received 1 242 courses of HD-MTX therapies from September 2012 to November 2016 was collected. The courses were divided into two groups based on the chemotherapies: original scheme group was treated with the 3rd revised regimen, and new scheme group was treated with the 4th revised regimen. The two groups in acute kidney injury (AKI) and MTX blood concentrations were compared. Result: The incidences of AKI with low risk (LR) and intermediate risk (IR) in new scheme group were significantly lower than those in original scheme group (1.3%(3/229) vs. 7.9%(24/303), 4.9%(10/204) vs. 12.8%(26/203), chi(2)=11.831 and 7.888 respectively, both P<0.05). There was no significant difference in the incidence of AKI with high risk (HR) in the two groups (15.2%(10/66) vs. 10.5%(25/237), chi(2)=1.071, P>0.05). The 48h MTX blood concentrations and the interphase from onste to MTX concentrations decreased to the safe level with LR and IR children in new scheme group were significantly lower than those in original scheme group (0.36(0.08-4.00) vs. 0.44(0.06-32.00) mumol/L, 0.49(0.22-33.00) vs. 0.60(0.18-83.00) mumol/L, 3(2-6) vs. 3(2-11) d, 3(2-11) vs. 3(2-19) d, Z=-5.953, -2.658, -4.490 and -4.729 respectively, all P<0.05). The differences with HR were not observed between the two groups (0.61(0.14-36.00) vs. 0.71(0.11-68.00) mumol/L, 3(2-15) vs. 3(2-13) d, Z=-1.465 and -1.179 respectively, both P>0.05).

A systematic investigation of father-mother-child triads in children successfully treated for leukemia.",,10.1002/pbc.26840 [doi],"BACKGROUND: Systematic assessment of emotional distress is recommended in after care. Yet, it is unclear if parent report may be used as a proxy of child report. The aim of this study was to assess agreements and differences and explore possible moderators of disagreement between child and parent ratings. METHODS: Sixty-two young survivors treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (9-18 years) and both parents responded to the Beck Youth Inventory (anxiety and depression) and the distress rating scale on the child's status. Parents completed the Brief Symptom Inventory-18 on their own psychological status. Systematic analyses of agreement and differences were performed. RESULTS: Mother-child and father-child agreements were fair on anxiety, depression, and distress (median intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.37). Differences between parents and children were medium sized (median d = 0.55) with parents giving higher scores than their children on anxiety, depression, and distress. Mothers reported distress more frequently than fathers (39 vs. 17%) when children reported none. The child being female and lower parental income were associated with lower agreement in fathers when rating child distress. Higher levels of parental psychological symptoms were consistently associated with lower agreement. CONCLUSIONS: Parent-child differences when rating adolescent survivors' difficulties may be more important than previously thought. Parent report probably cannot be considered as a valid proxy of older child report on such internalized domains as anxiety, depression, or distress in the after-care clinic. Parents' report is also likely to be influenced by their own mood, a factor that should be corrected for when using their report.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Abate, Cybelle', 'Lippe, Sarah', 'Bertout, Laurence', 'Drouin, Simon', 'Krajinovic, Maja', 'Rondeau, Emelie', 'Sinnett, Daniel', 'Laverdiere, Caroline', 'Sultan, Serge']","['Abate C', 'Lippe S', 'Bertout L', 'Drouin S', 'Krajinovic M', 'Rondeau E', 'Sinnett D', 'Laverdiere C', 'Sultan S']","['Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Psychology, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Psychology, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Universite de Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Universite de Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Universite de Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Psychology, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Universite de Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20171019,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anxiety/*psychology', 'Cancer Survivors/*psychology', 'Child', 'Depression/*psychology', '*Father-Child Relations', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*psychology/therapy', 'Male', '*Mother-Child Relations', 'Stress, Psychological/*psychology']",['NOTNLM'],"['anxiety', 'depression', 'distress', 'leukemia', 'parent-child agreement', 'survivor']",2017/10/20 06:00,2017/12/28 06:00,['2017/10/20 06:00'],"['2017/04/12 00:00 [received]', '2017/09/07 00:00 [revised]', '2017/09/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/28 06:00 [medline]', '2017/10/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.26840 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2018 Feb;65(2). doi: 10.1002/pbc.26840.

Methods: Sixty patients (mean standard deviation age = 13.3 (2.7); 57% male) completed Snyder's Hope Scales, the Children's Depression Inventory, and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory at diagnosis and 3 month intervals for 1 year following pediatric cancer diagnosis. Parents also completed Snyder's Hope Scales. Linear mixed-effect regression was used to assess hope's role in longitudinal models of symptoms of depression and anxiety. Results: Agency was a significant predictor of between-patient differences and within-patient changes in symptoms of depression and anxiety. Neither patient pathways nor either component of parent hope was predictive of symptoms of depression or anxiety. Patients who were more likely to have depressive symptoms at baseline were older, diagnosed with leukemia, and non-Hispanic White as opposed to Hispanic. Patient demographics were not predictive of anxiety. Conclusions: Patient agency is a potential target for intervention to prevent or reduce anxiety and depressive symptoms following pediatric cancer diagnosis.","['(c) The Author 2017.

They most commonly occur in patients with acute or chronic myeloid leukemia. A de novo MS with no evidence of blood system disease is rare, but may represent the first sign of a systemic illness that precedes a full-blown disease. Herein, we report the computed tomography (CT) findings of an extremely rare case of a nonleukemic MS that progressed to acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and simultaneously involved the small intestine, kidneys, mesentery, and mesenteric lymph nodes. Moreover, we provide CT findings before and after AML chemotherapy, which have not been reported previously. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 25-year-old man with intermittent upper abdominal pain for 6 months was admitted to the hospital on November 28, 2015. Initial CT showed concentric wall thickening of the jejunum with an adjacent mesenteric soft tissue mass and mesenteric lymph nodes enlargement. Both kidneys were involved as indicated by the presence of well-defined mildly dilated lesions. During the laparoscopic surgery, the small intestinal tumor, mesenteric soft tissue mass, and mesenteric lymph nodes were removed. DIAGNOSES: The pathological diagnosis was an MS. INTERVENTIONS: The patient refused systemic chemotherapy and was rehospitalized with persistently aggravated abdominal distension on February 17, 2016. Follow-up CT showed diffuse small bowel wall thickening, widespread infiltration of the peritoneum, omentum, and mesentery, mesenteric lymph node enlargement, and large amounts of ascites fluid. The lesions in both kidneys were substantially larger and more numerous than on initial CT. Then the patient was treated with conventional AML chemotherapy. OUTCOMES: The patient achieved complete hematological remission on bone marrow examination. Follow-up CT in September 4, 2016, showed none of the abnormalities seen on initial CT.

In the present study, we investigated the effect of small interfering RNA (siRNA)-induced ALR silencing on cell proliferation and sensitivity to vincristine (VCR) of Jurkat cells. We found that ALR siRNA effectively decreased the ALR expression, then inhibited cell growth and increased sensitivity to VCR in Jurkat cells. Flow cytometry assay revealed that the downregulation of ALR expression promoted cell apoptosis and regulated cell cycle distribution. Following incubation with VCR, apoptosis-related proteins, such as pro-PARP, pro-caspase 8, pro-caspase 3 and Bcl-2 were downregulated in the siRNA/ALR group. Pretreatment with siRNA/ALR in combination with VCR resulted in prolonged G2/M arrest, accompanied by downregulation of cdc25c and cdc2 expression and dissociation of cyclin B1.

Intra-tumor heterogeneity and cancer-cell plasticity give rise to therapeutic resistance and recurrence through clonal replacement and reactivation of dormant CSCs, respectively. WNT signaling cascades cross-talk with the FGF, Notch, Hedgehog and TGFbeta/BMP signaling cascades and regulate expression of functional CSC markers, such as CD44, CD133 (PROM1), EPCAM and LGR5 (GPR49). Aberrant canonical and non-canonical WNT signaling in human malignancies, including breast, colorectal, gastric, lung, ovary, pancreatic, prostate and uterine cancers, leukemia and melanoma, are involved in CSC survival, bulk-tumor expansion and invasion/metastasis. WNT signaling-targeted therapeutics, such as anti-FZD1/2/5/7/8 monoclonal antibody (mAb) (vantictumab), anti-LGR5 antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) (mAb-mc-vc-PAB-MMAE), anti-PTK7 ADC (PF-06647020), anti-ROR1 mAb (cirmtuzumab), anti-RSPO3 mAb (rosmantuzumab), small-molecule porcupine inhibitors (ETC-159, WNT-C59 and WNT974), tankyrase inhibitors (AZ1366, G007-LK, NVP-TNKS656 and XAV939) and beta-catenin inhibitors (BC2059, CWP232228, ICG-001 and PRI-724), are in clinical trials or preclinical studies for the treatment of patients with WNT-driven cancers. WNT signaling-targeted therapeutics are applicable for combination therapy with BCR-ABL, EGFR, FLT3, KIT or RET inhibitors to treat a subset of tyrosine kinase-driven cancers because WNT and tyrosine kinase signaling cascades converge to beta-catenin for the maintenance and expansion of CSCs. WNT signaling-targeted therapeutics might also be applicable for combination therapy with immune checkpoint blockers, such as atezolizumab, avelumab, durvalumab, ipilimumab, nivolumab and pembrolizumab, to treat cancers with immune evasion, although the context-dependent effects of WNT signaling on immunity should be carefully assessed. Omics monitoring, such as genome sequencing and transcriptome tests, immunohistochemical analyses on PD-L1 (CD274), PD-1 (PDCD1), ROR1 and nuclear beta-catenin and organoid-based drug screening, is necessary to determine the appropriate WNT signaling-targeted therapeutics for cancer patients.",,"['Katoh, Masaru']",['Katoh M'],"['Department of Omics Network, National Cancer Center, Tokyo 104-0045, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170919,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,IM,"['Cellular Reprogramming/genetics', '*Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', '*Neoplastic Stem Cells', 'Stem Cell Niche/genetics', 'Wnt Proteins/genetics', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway/*genetics']",,,2017/10/20 06:00,2018/07/24 06:00,['2017/10/20 06:00'],"['2017/07/30 00:00 [received]', '2017/09/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/24 06:00 [medline]', '2017/10/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.3892/ijo.2017.4129 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2017 Nov;51(5):1357-1369. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2017.4129.

This raises the issue of whether there is a common transcriptomic profile existing among the piPSC lines at distinctive state. In this study, we performed conjoint analysis of small RNA-seq and mRNA-seq for three piPSC lines which represent LIF dependence, FGF2 dependence and LFB2i dependence, respectively. Interestingly, we found there are 16 common microRNAs which potentially target 13 common mRNAs among the three piPSC lines. Dual-luciferase reporter assay validated that miR-370, one of the 16 common microRNAs, could directly target the 3'UTR of LIN28A. When the differentiation occurred, miR-370 could be activated in piPSCs and switched off the expression of LIN28A. Ectopic expression of miR-370 in piPSCs could reduce LIN28A expression, decrease the alkaline phosphatase activity, slow down the proliferation, and further cause the downregulation of downstream pluripotent genes (OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, SALL4 and ESRRB) and upregulation of differentiation relevant genes (SOX9, JARID2 and JMJD4). Moreover, these phenotypes caused by miR-370 could be rescued by overexpressing LIN28A. Collectively, our findings suggest that a set of common miRNA-mRNA interactions exist among the distinct piPSC lines, which orchestrate the self-renewal and differentiation of piPSCs independent of their metastable pluripotent states.",,"['Zhang, Shiqiang', 'Xie, Youlong', 'Cao, Hongxia', 'Wang, Huayan']","['Zhang S', 'Xie Y', 'Cao H', 'Wang H']","['College of Veterinary Medicine, Shaanxi Center of Stem Cells Engineering & Technology, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi 712100, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Shaanxi Center of Stem Cells Engineering & Technology, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi 712100, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Shaanxi Center of Stem Cells Engineering & Technology, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi 712100, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Shaanxi Center of Stem Cells Engineering & Technology, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi 712100, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170831,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,IM,"['Alkaline Phosphatase/genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cellular Reprogramming/*genetics', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/genetics/metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Humans', 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Luciferases/genetics/metabolism', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Annotation', 'Signal Transduction', 'Swine', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Zinc Fingers/genetics']",,,2017/10/20 06:00,2018/04/25 06:00,['2017/10/20 06:00'],"['2017/04/17 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/17 00:00 [revised]', '2017/07/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/25 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2017426 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2017.426 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2017 Aug 31;8(8):e3027. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2017.426.,PMC5596602,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This secondary analysis of 2 RCTs assessed whether an early palliative care intervention moderates the relationship between depressive symptoms and survival. METHOD: The relationships among mood, survival, and early palliative care intervention were studied among 529 advanced cancer patients who participated in 2 RCTs. The first (N = 322) compared intervention versus usual care. The second (N = 207) compared early versus delayed intervention (12 weeks after enrollment). The interventions included an in-person consultation, weekly nurse coach-facilitated phone sessions, and monthly follow-up. Mood was measured using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale. Cox proportional hazard analyses were used to examine the effects of baseline CES-D scores, the intervention, and their interaction on mortality risk while controlling for demographic variables, cancer site, and illness severity. RESULTS: The combined sample was 56% male (M = 64.7 years). Higher baseline CES-D scores were significantly associated with greater mortality risk (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.042, 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.017, 1.067], p = .001). However, participants with higher CES-D scores who received the intervention had a lower mortality risk (HR = .963, CI [0.933, 0.993], p = .018) even when controlling for demographics, cancer site, and illness-related variables. CONCLUSION: This study is the first to demonstrate that patients with advanced cancer who also have depressive symptoms benefit the most from early palliative care. Future research should be devoted to exploring the mechanisms responsible for these relationships.

This index defines 4 distinct groups with different outcomes, dividing patients by disease type and status and considering cytogenetics for acute myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Recently, the DRI has been refined to include rare diseases and improve MDS stratification by blast percentage and response to prior therapy. Previous reports on DRI include only a small number of UCBT recipients. The current study aims to determine the applicability of the DRI for patients undergoing unrelated cord blood transplantation (UCBT). We retrospectively analysed 2530 adults receiving UCBT between 2004 and 2014. Diagnosis was acute leukaemia (AL) in 66% of the cases. Overall survival (OS) at 2 years was 56 +/- 3% for patients with low DRI (n = 352), 46 +/- 1% for intermediate DRI (n = 1403), 28 +/- 2% for high (n = 489) and 20 +/- 4% for very high DRI (n = 109) (P < 0.001). In the multivariate model, DRI remained an independent risk factor for OS. Similar findings were observed for PFS and DRI.

Given its activity in relapsed and refractory T acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and T lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL), we sought to define its role in the frontline treatment of adult patients. Therefore, we conducted a single arm phase 2 study to determine the safety and efficacy of nelarabine in combination with hyper-CVAD in newly diagnosed patients. For induction/consolidation, patients received eight cycles of hyper-CVAD alternating with high-dose methotrexate and cytarabine plus two cycles of nelarabine given at a dose of 650 mg/m(2) intravenously daily for 5 days. This was followed by thirty months of POMP maintenance chemotherapy with two additional cycles of nelarabine given instead of cycles 6 and 7 of POMP maintenance. Sixty-seven patients, including 40 with T-ALL and 26 with T-LBL, were enrolled. Complete response rates in both T-ALL and T-LBL were 87% and 100% respectively. Grade 3 to 4 neurotoxic adverse events were reported in 5 patients. There were 21 relapses (31%) including 2 after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Median duration of follow-up was 42.5 months. The 3-year complete remission duration (CRD) and overall survival (OS) rates were 66% and 65%, respectively. Compared to our historic hyper-CVAD data, there was no survival benefit with the addition of nelarabine. In conclusion, hyper-CVAD plus nelarabine was well tolerated and active in the frontline treatment of adult T-ALL/LBL patients.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Abaza, Yasmin', 'M Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Jabbour, Elias', 'Jain, Nitin', 'Thomas, Deborah', 'Kadia, Tapan', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'D Khoury, Joseph', 'Burger, Jan', 'Wierda, William', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra', 'Kebriaei, Partow', 'Dabaja, Bouthaina', 'Kornblau, Steven', 'Alvarado, Yesid', 'Daver, Naval', 'Pemmaraju, Naveen', 'Bose, Prithviraj', 'Thompson, Philip', 'Al Azzawi, Hind', 'Kelly, Mary', 'Garris, Rebecca', 'Jain, Preetesh', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Ravandi, Farhad']","['Abaza Y', 'M Kantarjian H', 'Faderl S', 'Jabbour E', 'Jain N', 'Thomas D', 'Kadia T', 'Borthakur G', 'D Khoury J', 'Burger J', 'Wierda W', ""O'Brien S"", 'Konopleva M', 'Ferrajoli A', 'Kebriaei P', 'Dabaja B', 'Kornblau S', 'Alvarado Y', 'Daver N', 'Pemmaraju N', 'Bose P', 'Thompson P', 'Al Azzawi H', 'Kelly M', 'Garris R', 'Jain P', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Cortes J', 'Ravandi F']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, New Jersey.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, University of California, Irvine, California.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20171103,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Arabinonucleosides/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/*methods', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Survival Analysis', 'Young Adult']",,,2017/10/20 06:00,2017/12/19 06:00,['2017/10/20 06:00'],"['2017/08/23 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/08 00:00 [revised]', '2017/10/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/19 06:00 [medline]', '2017/10/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.24947 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2018 Jan;93(1):91-99. doi: 10.1002/ajh.24947.

The use of first- and second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors has been successful to an extent. However, resistance against such drugs is an emerging problem. Apart from several drug-resistant mechanisms, drug influx/efflux ratio appears to be one of the key determinants of therapeutic outcomes. In addition, intracellular accumulation of drug critically depends on cell membrane fluidity and lipid raft dynamics. Previously, we reported two novel cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), namely, cationic IR15 and anionic SR11 present in tryptic digest of Abrus agglutinin. Here, the potential of IR15 and SR11 to influence intracellular concentration of imatinib has been evaluated. Fluorescent correlation spectroscopy and lifetime imaging were employed to map membrane fluidity and lipid raft distribution following peptide-drug co-administration. Results show that IR15 and SR11 are the two CPPs which can modulate membrane fluidity and lipid raft distribution in K562 cells.

METHODS: Caregivers of 68 children with ALL, ages 3 to 12 years old, completed measures of caregiver guilt and worry, caregiver sleep quality, and child's developmental history and sleep habits. Demographic and treatment correlates of poor caregiver sleep were examined, and caregiver guilt and worry was tested as a moderator between child and caregiver sleep. RESULTS: More than half of caregivers (55.9%) reported clinically significant poor sleep and less than 40% were obtaining adequate sleep durations. Caregiver sleep was significantly related to child age at diagnosis, child sleep, and caregiver guilt and worry. Caregiver guilt and worry did not moderate the relationship between child sleep and caregiver sleep. CONCLUSIONS: Poor sleep is common in caregivers of children with cancer. Further research on the timing of sleep interventions and the most effective intervention targets are needed to maximize caregiver functioning during a child's cancer treatment. Targeted interventions seeking to improve caregiver sleep should be directed towards caregivers of children diagnosed in early childhood, caregivers of children with poor sleep, and caregivers with high guilt and worry.",,"['Daniel, Lauren C', 'Walsh, Colleen M', 'Meltzer, Lisa J', 'Barakat, Lamia P', 'Kloss, Jacqueline D']","['Daniel LC', 'Walsh CM', 'Meltzer LJ', 'Barakat LP', 'Kloss JD']","['Department of Psychology, Rutgers University, Camden, 311 North 5th Street, Camden, NJ, 08102, USA.

Median follow-up is 36 months (range, 9 - 63). For the overall population, overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS), and relapse-free survival (RFS) at 3 years were 69%, 55%, and 62%, respectively. The 12-month RFS and OS after transplant were 71% and 87%, respectively. Landmark analysis at 175 days from the time of CR/CRi (longest time to HCT), showed statistically superior advantages for RFS and OS (p=0.038 and 0.037, respectively) for the transplanted patients. Addition of dasatinib to chemotherapy and HCT for younger patients with Ph+ ALL is feasible and warrants further testing.",,"['Ravandi, Farhad', 'Othus, Megan', ""O'Brien, Susan M"", 'Forman, Stephen J', 'Ha, Chul S', 'Wong, Jeffrey Y C', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'Paietta, Elisabeth', 'Racevskis, Janis', 'Uy, Geoffrey L', 'Horowitz, Mary', 'Takebe, Naoko', 'Little, Richard', 'Borate, Uma', 'Kebriaei, Partow', 'Kingsbury, Laura', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Radich, Jerald P', 'Erba, Harry P', 'Appelbaum, Frederick R']","['Ravandi F', 'Othus M', ""O'Brien SM"", 'Forman SJ', 'Ha CS', 'Wong JYC', 'Tallman MS', 'Paietta E', 'Racevskis J', 'Uy GL', 'Horowitz M', 'Takebe N', 'Little R', 'Borate U', 'Kebriaei P', 'Kingsbury L', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Radich JP', 'Erba HP', 'Appelbaum FR']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'SWOG Statistical Center, Seattle, WA.', 'University of California - Irvine, Orange, CA.', 'City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA.', 'University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX.', 'City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA.', 'Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Cancer Center, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY.', 'Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, NY.', 'Cancer Center, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY.', 'Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, NY.', 'Division of Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO.', 'Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI.', 'Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, Investigational Drug Branch, Bethesda, MD.', 'Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, Investigational Drug Branch, Bethesda, MD.', 'University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'SWOG Statistical Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'University of Alabama at Birmingham and UAB Comprehensive Cancer Center, Birmingham, AL.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,,,,,2017/10/20 06:00,2017/10/20 06:01,['2017/10/20 06:00'],"['2017/10/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/20 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1182/bloodadvances.2016001495 [doi]'],ppublish,Blood Adv. 2016 Dec 27;1(3):250-259. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2016001495.,PMC5642915,,"['U10 CA004919/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA196172/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UG1 HL069278/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 HL109137/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180818/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180820/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA011083/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA046368/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180888/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180816/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01 CA004919/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 HL069294/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA012644/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01 CA013612/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 HL069278/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA076518/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA013612/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180835/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180821/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180801/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180858/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UG1 CA189848/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180846/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA046282/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 HL069294/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180819/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UG1 CA189953/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['NIHMS867643'],"['CONFLICT OF INTEREST DISCLOSURES No COI information to disclose: Partow Kebriaei,', 'Laura Kinsbury, Richard Little, Janis Racevskis, Naoko Takebe, Honoraria: Uma', 'Borate, self, Alexion, Novartis, Amgen;

Leukemia cases are particularly high within Hispanic populations where this disease is among the most frequently occurring cancer. A possible cause is somatic mutations in Janus tyrosine kinase (Jak3). Fourteen somatic mutations have been reported in Jak3, including M511I and A573V, from patients with various forms of leukemia. While several of these Jak3 mutations have been shown to possess transforming ability in cell lines, whether these mutations are susceptible to Jak3 selective inhibitors remains less clear. METHODS: The IL-3 dependent pro-B cell line Ba/F3 was virally transduced with plasmids encoding GFP and different mutant forms of Jak3, some of which conferred IL-3 independence. Sensitivity to pre-clinical and clinical Jak3 selective inhibitors was assessed for cellular viability and growth. RESULTS: Two Jak3 mutations conferred IL-3 independent growth in Ba/F3 cells. However, the level of drug sensitivity varied with respect to Jak3 inhibitors NC1153, CP-690,550, and EP-009. CONCLUSION: Jak3 inhibitors CP-690,550 and NC1153 showed efficacy in reducing viability of Ba/F3 cells transformed with mutant forms of Jak3, thus providing new therapeutic strategies to treat these types of cancer.",,"['Martinez, G Steven', 'Ross, Jeremy A', 'Kirken, Robert A']","['Martinez GS', 'Ross JA', 'Kirken RA']","['Department of Biological Sciences at The University of Texas at El Paso and the Border Biomedical Research Center, USA.', 'Department of Biological Sciences at The University of Texas at El Paso and the Border Biomedical Research Center, USA.', 'Department of Biological Sciences at The University of Texas at El Paso and the Border Biomedical Research Center, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United Arab Emirates,Clin Cancer Drugs,Clinical cancer drugs,101679754,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Janus tyrosine kinase', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'signal transducer and activator of transcription', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",2016/01/01 00:00,2016/01/01 00:01,['2017/10/20 06:00'],"['2017/10/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.2174/2212697X03666160610085943 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Cancer Drugs. 2016;3(2):131-137. doi: 10.2174/2212697X03666160610085943.,PMC5642970,,"['G12 MD007592/MD/NIMHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R25 GM069621/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['NIHMS910635'],"['CONFLICT OF INTEREST The author(s) confirm that this article content has no', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Reactivation of fetal Hb (HbF) expression ameliorates these symptoms of SCD. Nuclear factor (erythroid derived-2)-like 2 (Nrf2) is a transcription factor that triggers cytoprotective and antioxidant pathways to limit oxidative damage and inflammation and increases HbF synthesis in CD34+ stem cell-derived erythroid progenitors. We investigated the ability of dimethyl fumarate (DMF), a small-molecule Nrf2 agonist, to activate gamma-globin transcription and enhance HbF in tissue culture and in murine and primate models. DMF recruited Nrf2 to the gamma-globin promoters and the locus control region of the beta-globin locus in erythroleukemia cells, elevated HbF in SCD donor-derived erythroid progenitors, and reduced hypoxia-induced sickling. Chronic DMF administration in SCD mice induced HbF and increased Nrf2-dependent genes to detoxify heme and limit inflammation. This improved hematological parameters, reduced plasma-free Hb, and attenuated inflammatory markers.

However, cellular promoters result in relatively low transgene expression, often leading to inadequate disease phenotype correction. Vectors derived from foamy virus, a nonpathogenic retrovirus, show higher preference for nongenic integrations than gammaretroviruses/lentiviruses and preferential integration near transcriptional start sites, like gammaretroviruses. We found that strong viral enhancers/promoters placed in foamy viral vectors caused extremely low immortalization of primary mouse hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells compared to analogous gammaretrovirus/lentivirus vectors carrying the same enhancers/promoters, an effect not explained solely by foamy virus' modest insertional site preference for nongenic regions compared to gammaretrovirus/lentivirus vectors. Using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated targeted insertion of analogous proviral sequences into the LMO2 gene and then measuring LMO2 expression, we demonstrate a sequence-specific effect of foamy virus, independent of insertional bias, contributing to reduced genotoxicity. We show that this effect is mediated by a 36-bp insulator located in the foamy virus long terminal repeat (LTR) that has high-affinity binding to the CCCTC-binding factor. Using our LMO2 activation assay, LMO2 expression was significantly increased when this insulator was removed from foamy virus and significantly reduced when the insulator was inserted into the lentiviral LTR. Our results elucidate a mechanism underlying the low genotoxicity of foamy virus, identify a novel insulator, and support the use of foamy virus as a vector for gene therapy, especially when strong enhancers/promoters are required.IMPORTANCE Understanding the genotoxic potential of viral vectors is important in designing safe and efficacious vectors for gene therapy. Self-inactivating vectors devoid of viral long-terminal-repeat enhancers have proven safe; however, transgene expression from cellular promoters is often insufficient for full phenotypic correction. Foamy virus is an attractive vector for gene therapy. We found foamy virus vectors to be remarkably less genotoxic, well below what was expected from their integration site preferences. We demonstrate that the foamy virus long terminal repeats contain an insulator element that binds CCCTC-binding factor and reduces its insertional genotoxicity. Our study elucidates a mechanism behind the low genotoxic potential of foamy virus, identifies a unique insulator, and supports the use of foamy virus as a vector for gene therapy.",['Copyright (c) 2017 American Society for Microbiology.'],"['Goodman, Michael Aaron', 'Arumugam, Paritha', 'Pillis, Devin Marie', 'Loberg, Anastacia', 'Nasimuzzaman, Mohammed', 'Lynn, Danielle', 'van der Loo, Johannes Christiaan Maria', 'Dexheimer, Phillip Joseph', 'Keddache, Mehdi', 'Bauer, Thomas Roy Jr', 'Hickstein, Dennis Durand', 'Russell, David William', 'Malik, Punam']","['Goodman MA', 'Arumugam P', 'Pillis DM', 'Loberg A', 'Nasimuzzaman M', 'Lynn D', 'van der Loo JCM', 'Dexheimer PJ', 'Keddache M', 'Bauer TR Jr', 'Hickstein DD', 'Russell DW', 'Malik P']","[""Division of Allergy and Immunology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA."", ""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA."", ""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA."", ""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA."", ""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA."", ""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA."", ""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA."", ""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA."", ""Division of Biomedical Informatics, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA."", ""Division of Human Genetics, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA."", 'Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, School of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.', ""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA Punam.Malik@cchmc.org.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20171214,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics', 'Animals', 'CRISPR-Cas Systems/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Genetic Therapy/methods', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/virology', '*Insulator Elements', 'LIM Domain Proteins/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Mutagenicity Tests', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Spumavirus/*genetics', '*Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Transgenes']",['NOTNLM'],"['*CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF)', '*CRISPR/Cas', '*foamy virus', '*gene insulator', '*gene therapy', '*genotoxicity']",2017/10/20 06:00,2017/12/21 06:00,['2017/10/20 06:00'],"['2017/09/18 00:00 [received]', '2017/09/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/21 06:00 [medline]', '2017/10/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.01639-17 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01639-17 [doi]']",epublish,J Virol. 2017 Dec 14;92(1). pii: JVI.01639-17. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01639-17.

Recent efforts focused on the development of more potent tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that also inhibit mutant tyrosine kinases such as nilotinib and dasatinib. Although major advances in the treatment of this aggressive disease with potent inhibitors of the BCR/ABL kinases, patients in remission frequently relapse due to drug resistance possibly mediated, at least in part, by compensatory activation of growth-signaling pathways and protective feedback signaling of leukemia cells in response to TKI treatment. Continuous activation of AKT/mTOR signaling and inactivation of p53 pathway were two mechanisms of TKI resistance. Here, we reported that nutlin-3 plus tanshinone IIA significantly potentiated the cytotoxic and apoptotic induction effects of imatinib by down-regulation of the AKT/mTOR pathway and reactivating the p53 pathway deeply in Ph+ ALL cell line. In primary samples from Ph+ ALL patients, nutlin-3 plus tanshinone IIA also exhibited synergetic cytotoxic effects with imatinib. Of note, three samples from Ph+ ALL patients harboring T315I mutation also showed sensitivity to the combined treatment of imatinib, nutlin-3 plus tanshinone IIA. In Ph+ ALL mouse models, imatinib combined with nutlin-3 plus tanshinone IIA also exhibited synergetic effects on reduction in leukemia burden. These results demonstrated that nutlin-3 plus tanshinone IIA combined TKI might be a promising treatment strategy for Ph+ ALL patients.","['(c) 2017 The Author(s).

DNA/RNA viruses often hijack the cellular factors resident in PML-NBs to promote their proliferation in host cells. Hepatitis B virus (HBV), belonging to Hepadnaviridae family, remains undetected in early infection as it does not induce the innate immune response and is known to be the cause of several hepatic diseases leading to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The association of PML-NB proteins and HBV is being addressed in a number of recent studies. Here, we report that the PML-NB protein Speckled 110 kDa (Sp110) is SUMO1-modified and undergoes a deSUMOylation-driven release from the PML-NB in the presence of HBV. Intriguingly, Sp110 knockdown significantly reduced viral DNA load in the culture supernatant by activation of the type I interferon-response pathway. Furthermore, we found that Sp110 differentially regulates several direct target genes of hepatitis B virus protein X (HBx), a viral co-factor. Subsequently, we identified Sp110 as a novel interactor of HBx and found this association to be essential for the exit of Sp110 from the PML-NB during HBV infection and HBx recruitment on the promoter of these genes. HBx, in turn, modulates the recruitment of its associated transcription cofactors p300/HDAC1 to these co-regulated genes, thereby altering the host gene expression program in favor of viral persistence. Thus, we report a mechanism by which HBV can evade host immune response by hijacking the PML-NB protein Sp110, and therefore, we propose it to be a novel target for antiviral therapy.","['(c) 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.']","['Sengupta, Isha', 'Das, Dipanwita', 'Singh, Shivaram Prasad', 'Chakravarty, Runu', 'Das, Chandrima']","['Sengupta I', 'Das D', 'Singh SP', 'Chakravarty R', 'Das C']","['From the Biophysics and Structural Genomics Division, Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics, Kolkata-700064.', 'the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) Virus Unit, Kolkata, Infectious Diseases and Beliaghata General Hospital Campus, Kolkata 700010, and.', 'the Kalinga Gastroenterology Foundation, Beam Diagnostics Premises, Cuttack-753001, India.', 'the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) Virus Unit, Kolkata, Infectious Diseases and Beliaghata General Hospital Campus, Kolkata 700010, and.', 'From the Biophysics and Structural Genomics Division, Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics, Kolkata-700064, chandrima.das@saha.ac.in.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20171018,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers/blood/metabolism', 'DNA, Viral/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Hepatitis B virus/growth & development/immunology/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Hepatitis B, Chronic/immunology/*metabolism/pathology/virology', 'Hepatocytes/immunology/*metabolism/pathology/virology', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Inclusion Bodies, Viral/*metabolism/pathology/virology', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/blood/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/blood/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Transport', 'RNA Interference', '*Sumoylation', 'Trans-Activators/*physiology', 'Viral Load', 'Viral Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins', 'Virus Physiological Phenomena', 'Virus Replication']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Speckled 110 kDa (Sp110)', '*chromatin', '*hepatitis B virus (HBV, Hep B)', '*hepatitis B virus protein x (HBx)', '*promyelocytic leukemia nuclear Bodies', '*signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 (STAT1)', '*small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)', '*type I interferon-response pathway', '*viral protein']",2017/10/20 06:00,2018/01/26 06:00,['2017/10/20 06:00'],"['2017/05/16 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/13 00:00 [revised]', '2017/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/26 06:00 [medline]', '2017/10/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)32775-7 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M117.796839 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2017 Dec 15;292(50):20379-20393. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M117.796839.

Our results suggest that the downregulation of hsa-miR-106b-3p leads to the upregulation of target p21 gene, CDKN1A, and plays a critical role in the cell cycle progression by arresting matrine-treated cells in the G0/G1 phase.",,"['Tetik Vardarli, Asli', 'Duzgun, Zekeriya', 'Erdem, Ceren', 'Kaymaz, Burcin Tezcanli', 'Eroglu, Zuhal', 'Cetintas, Vildan Bozok']","['Tetik Vardarli A', 'Duzgun Z', 'Erdem C', 'Kaymaz BT', 'Eroglu Z', 'Cetintas VB']","['Medical Biology Department, Ege University Medicine Faculty, Izmir, Turkey. aslitetik2007@gmail.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180520,Bosnia and Herzegovina,Bosn J Basic Med Sci,Bosnian journal of basic medical sciences,101200947,IM,"['Alkaloids/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Autophagy', '*Cell Cycle Checkpoints', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'G1 Phase', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'MicroRNAs/metabolism', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'Plant Roots/chemistry', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Quinolizines/*pharmacology', 'Resting Phase, Cell Cycle', 'Sophora/chemistry']",,,2017/10/19 06:00,2018/11/28 06:00,['2017/10/19 06:00'],"['2017/09/15 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/08 00:00 [revised]', '2017/10/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/28 06:00 [medline]', '2017/10/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.17305/bjbms.2017.2457 [doi]'],epublish,Bosn J Basic Med Sci. 2018 May 20;18(2):141-149. doi: 10.17305/bjbms.2017.2457.,PMC5988533,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (IL6 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (MIRN106 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN376C microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Quinolizines)', 'N390W430AC (matrine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Exosomes provide a vehicle through which cancer-specific material can be enriched from the compendium of circulating non-neoplastic tissue-derived nucleic acids. We carried out a comprehensive profiling of the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) exosomal 'surfaceome' in order to identify surface proteins that will render liquid biopsies amenable to cancer-derived exosome enrichment for downstream molecular profiling. Patients and methods: Surface exosomal proteins were profiled in 13 human PDAC and 2 non-neoplastic cell lines by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. A total of 173 prospectively collected blood samples from 103 PDAC patients underwent exosome isolation. Droplet digital PCR was used on 74 patients (136 total exosome samples) to determine baseline KRAS mutation call rates while patients were on therapy. PDAC-specific exosome capture was then carried out on additional 29 patients (37 samples) using an antibody cocktail directed against selected proteins, followed by droplet digital PCR analysis. Exosomal DNA in a PDAC patient resistant to therapy were profiled using a molecular barcoded, targeted sequencing panel to determine the utility of enriched nucleic acid material for comprehensive molecular analysis. Results: Proteomic analysis of the exosome 'surfaceome' revealed multiple PDAC-specific biomarker candidates: CLDN4, EPCAM, CD151, LGALS3BP, HIST2H2BE, and HIST2H2BF. KRAS mutations in total exosomes were detected in 44.1% of patients undergoing active therapy compared with 73.0% following exosome capture using the selected biomarkers. Enrichment of exosomal cargo was amenable to molecular profiling, elucidating a putative mechanism of resistance to PARP inhibitor therapy in a patient harboring a BRCA2 mutation. Conclusion: Exosomes provide unique opportunities in the context of liquid biopsies for enrichment of tumor-specific material in circulation. We present a comprehensive surfaceome characterization of PDAC exosomes which allows for capture and molecular profiling of tumor-derived DNA.","['(c) The Author 2017.

DIAGNOSIS: Hypereosinophilia has generally been defined as a peripheral blood eosinophil count greater than 1500/mm(3) and may be associated with tissue damage. After exclusion of secondary causes of eosinophilia, diagnostic evaluation of primary eosinophilias relies on a combination of morphologic review of the blood and marrow, standard cytogenetics, fluorescent in situ-hybridization, flow immunocytometry, and T-cell clonality assessment to detect histopathologic or clonal evidence for an acute or chronic myeloid or lymphoproliferative disorder. RISK STRATIFICATION: Disease prognosis relies on identifying the subtype of eosinophilia. After evaluation of secondary causes of eosinophilia, the 2016 World Health Organization endorses a semi-molecular classification scheme of disease subtypes which includes the major category ""myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and rearrangement of PDGFRA, PDGFRB, or FGFR1 or with PCM1-JAK2,"" and the ""MPN subtype, chronic eosinophilic leukemia, not otherwise specified"" (CEL, NOS). Lymphocyte-variant hypereosinophilia is an aberrant T-cell clone-driven reactive eosinophila, and idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) is a diagnosis of exclusion. RISK-ADAPTED THERAPY: The goal of therapy is to mitigate eosinophil-mediated organ damage. For patients with milder forms of eosinophilia (e.g., < 1500/mm(3) ) without symptoms or signs of organ involvement, a watch and wait approach with close-follow-up may be undertaken. Identification of rearranged PDGFRA or PDGFRB is critical because of the exquisite responsiveness of these diseases to imatinib. Corticosteroids are first-line therapy for patients with lymphocyte-variant hypereosinophilia and HES. Hydroxyurea and interferon-alpha have demonstrated efficacy as initial treatment and steroid-refractory cases of HES. In addition to hydroxyurea, second line cytotoxic chemotherapy agents and hematopoietic cell transplant have been used for aggressive forms of HES and CEL with outcomes reported for limited numbers of patients. The use of antibodies against interleukin-5 (IL-5) (mepolizumab), the IL-5 receptor (benralizumab), and CD52 (alemtuzumab), as well as other targets on eosinophils remains an active area of investigation.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Gotlib, Jason']",['Gotlib J'],"['Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford, California 94305-5821.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Disease Management', 'Eosinophilia/*diagnosis/etiology/mortality/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Risk', 'World Health Organization']",,,2017/10/19 06:00,2017/10/25 06:00,['2017/10/19 06:00'],"['2017/08/02 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/10/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.24880 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2017 Nov;92(11):1243-1259. doi: 10.1002/ajh.24880.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to characterize the spectrum of genetic lesions causing DBA and identify genotypes that correlate with phenotypes of clinical significance. Seventy-four patients with DBA from across Canada were included. Nucleotide-level mutations or large deletions were identified in 10 ribosomal genes in 45 cases. The RPS19 mutation group was associated with higher requirement for chronic treatment for anemia than other DBA groups. Patients with RPS19 mutations, however, were more likely to maintain long-term corticosteroid response without requirement for further chronic transfusions. Conversely, patients with RPL11 mutations were less likely to need chronic treatment. Birth defects, including cardiac, skeletal, hand, cleft lip or palate and genitourinary malformations, also varied among the various genetic groups. Patients with RPS19 mutations had the fewest number of defects, while patients with RPL5 had the greatest number of birth defects. This is the first study to show differences between DBA genetic groups with regards to treatment. Previously unreported differences in the rate and types of birth defects were also identified.

Here, the mechanisms of KLHL6 function were explored in gastric cancer (GC) cells, in an in vivo experimental tumour model, and the prognostic value of KLHL6 analysis in GC tissue evaluated in a cohort of patients with GC. METHODS: Associations between clinicopathological and survival data and KLHL6 expression in GC tissues were analysed. The effects of downregulation of KLHL6 in GC cells was investigated using proliferation, invasion, apoptosis and lymphangiogenesis assays, and analysis of tumour growth in an in vivo experimental model. RESULTS: KLHL6 was upregulated in 43 per cent of GC tissues compared with 5 per cent of paired non-tumour tissues from 84 patients. KLHL6 protein expression in GC tissues was much higher than that in atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia and dysplasia tissues from benign gastric disease samples. KLHL6 expression was positively related to the intestinal Lauren classification in GC tissues. Downregulated expression of KLHL6 in MGC-803 GC cells reduced colony formation, proliferation, viability, migration and invasion, enhanced apoptosis and inhibited the cell cycle in the G1 phase. Downregulated expression of KLHL6 also suppressed tumour growth in mice. Furthermore, downregulated expression of KLHL6 mRNA reduced the expression of nuclear-associated antigen Ki-67, vascular endothelial growth factor C, hepatocyte growth factor and matrix metalloproteinase 2 in vitro, and KLHL6 protein in tumour tissue of mice. CONCLUSION: Abnormal expression of the KLHL6 oncogene promoted GC progression in vitro and in vivo, and its expression level in tumour tissue was found to be of prognostic value.",['(c) 2017 BJS Society Ltd Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Deng, J', 'Guo, J', 'Ma, G', 'Zhang, H', 'Sun, D', 'Hou, Y', 'Xie, X', 'Guo, X', 'Nie, Y', 'Liang, H']","['Deng J', 'Guo J', 'Ma G', 'Zhang H', 'Sun D', 'Hou Y', 'Xie X', 'Guo X', 'Nie Y', 'Liang H']","[""Department of Gastroenterology, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Hospital, City Key Laboratory of Tianjin Cancer Centre, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer and National Clinical Research Centre for Cancer, Tianjin, China."", ""Department of Gastroenterology, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Hospital, City Key Laboratory of Tianjin Cancer Centre, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer and National Clinical Research Centre for Cancer, Tianjin, China."", ""Department of Gastrointestinal Cancer Biology, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Hospital, City Key Laboratory of Tianjin Cancer Centre, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer and National Clinical Research Centre for Cancer, Tianjin, China."", 'Department of the Third General Surgery, Tianjin Xiqing Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'Lung Cancer Institute, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, First Hospital of Zunyi City, Zunyi, China.', ""Department of Gastroenterology, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Hospital, City Key Laboratory of Tianjin Cancer Centre, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer and National Clinical Research Centre for Cancer, Tianjin, China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Cancer Biology and Xijing Hospital of Digestive Diseases, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, China."", ""Department of Gastroenterology, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Hospital, City Key Laboratory of Tianjin Cancer Centre, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer and National Clinical Research Centre for Cancer, Tianjin, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20171017,England,Br J Surg,The British journal of surgery,0372553,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Hepatocyte Growth Factor/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Ki-67 Antigen/metabolism', 'Male', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 2/metabolism', 'Mice, Nude', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Neoplasms, Experimental', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Stomach Neoplasms/*metabolism/*mortality/pathology', 'Up-Regulation', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor C/metabolism']",,,2017/10/19 06:00,2017/11/29 06:00,['2017/10/19 06:00'],"['2016/11/03 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/04 00:00 [revised]', '2017/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/29 06:00 [medline]', '2017/10/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/bjs.10628 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Surg. 2017 Dec;104(13):1847-1856. doi: 10.1002/bjs.10628.

Multiple transcription elongation factors have been identified in vitro, but the physiological roles of many of them are still not clearly understood. The ELL (Eleven nineteen Lysine rich Leukemia) family of transcription elongation factors are conserved from fission yeast to humans. Schizosaccharomyces pombe contains a single ELL homolog (SpELL) that is not essential for its survival. Therefore to gain insights into the in vivo cellular functions of SpELL, we identified phenotypes associated with deletion of ell1 in S. pombe. Our results demonstrate that SpELL is required for normal growth of S. pombe cells. Furthermore, cells lacking ell1(+) exhibit a decrease in survival when exposed to DNA-damaging conditions, but their growth is not affected under environmental stress conditions. ELL orthologs in different organisms contain three conserved domains, an amino-terminal domain, a middle domain and a carboxyl-terminal domain. We also carried out an in vivo functional mapping of these conserved domains within S. pombe ELL and uncovered a critical role for its amino-terminus in regulating all its cellular functions, including growth under different conditions, transcriptional elongation potential and interaction with S. pombe EAF. Taken together our results suggest that the domain organization of ELL proteins is conserved across species, but the in vivo functions as well as the relationship between the various domains and roles of ELL show species-specific differences.",,"['Sweta, Kumari', 'Dabas, Preeti', 'Jain, Kamal', 'Sharma, Nimisha']","['Sweta K', 'Dabas P', 'Jain K', 'Sharma N']","['University School of Biotechnology, G.G.S.

Using an MLL-AF9 induced AML mouse model, we demonstrated that down modulating of SMC4 expression could prolong the survival time of AML mice. Furthermore, we found that knockdown SMC4 expression decreased the proportion of LSCs and affected its leukemia-initiating capacity.

A total of 23 patients received this regimen for 3 cycles (D-GPBSCs group), and the outcome was compared with that of 19 patients treated with repeated cycles of ID-AraC chemotherapy (chemo group). The two regimens were well tolerated. The median recovery times for neutrophils and platelets were shorter in D-GPBSCs group than in chemo group (p<.05). No graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was observed in D-GPBSCs group.

The engraftment process following ABO-incompatible allogeneic HSCT results in the transition from patient blood group to donor blood group in the recipient. In contrast, most non-hematopoietic tissues retain expression of the patient's original blood group for life, and these antigens may adsorb from the plasma onto the donor-derived RBCs. Correct serologic interpretation of the ABO blood group during this engraftment process can be difficult. We present the serologic findings of a 15-year-old girl of Maori descent, who was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia and transplanted with an HLA-matched unrelated group O, D+ bone marrow. Despite engraftment, her RBCs showed persistence of weak A. This case report showcases the importance of awareness and correct serologic interpretation of weak persistence of recipient ABH substance on the patient's RBCs for clinical decision-making, blood component support, and patient wellbeing.",,"['Grey, Dianne E', 'Fong, Elizabeth A', 'Cole, Catherine', 'Jensen, Jesper', 'Finlayson, Jill']","['Grey DE', 'Fong EA', 'Cole C', 'Jensen J', 'Finlayson J']","['Department of Haematology, PathWest Laboratory Medicine WA, QEII Medical Centre, Hospital Avenue, Nedlands, Western Australia.', 'Transfusion Unit, PathWest Laboratory Medicine WA, QEII Medical Centre, Nedlands, Australia.', 'Head of Department of Haematology, PathWest Laboratory Medicine WA, Princess Margaret Hospital for Children, Subiaco, Australia.', 'Princess Margaret Hospital for Children, PathWest Laboratory Medicine WA, Princess Margaret Hospital for Children, Subiaco, Australia.', 'Head of Department of Haematology, PathWest Laboratory Medicine WA, QEII Medical Centre, Nedlands, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Immunohematology,Immunohematology,8806387,IM,"['*ABO Blood-Group System', 'Adolescent', 'Blood Group Incompatibility', 'Blood Grouping and Crossmatching', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,,2017/10/19 06:00,2019/04/16 06:00,['2017/10/19 06:00'],"['2017/10/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/10/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/16 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Immunohematology. 2017 Sep;33(3):99-104.,,['0 (ABO Blood-Group System)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we found that MAGI-1 expression is decreased in multiple (9 out of 15) human T-cell leukemia cell lines, including adult T-cell leukemia (ATL), T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and chronic T-cell lymphocytic leukemia. The overexpression of MAGI-1 protein in a MAGI-1-low ATL cell line reduced cellular growth. While the overexpression of MAGI-1 protein in a MAGI-1-low ATL cell line reduced the Akt and MEK activities, the knockdown of MAGI-1 in a MAGI-1-high ATL cell line augmented the Akt and MEK activities.

We describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients diagnosed with isolated MS at our institution. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 9 of 497 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients (1.8%) with isolated MS. Isolated MS patients were divided into 2 groups according to the first-line treatment strategy: systemic treatment only (S) or local treatment with or without systemic treatment (LS). RESULTS: The most common site of MS occurrence was the head and neck area (N=4, 44.4%), followed by the anterior mediastinum (N=2, 22.2%) and the gastrointestinal tract (N=2, 22.2%). The tumors of 4 patients (44.4%) eventually evolved to AML, in a median time of 13.4 months (range, 2.4-20.1 mo). The number of patients achieving complete remission after first-line treatment was higher in the LS group (N=5, 83.3%) than in the S group (N=1, 33.3%) (P =0.226). All patients in the LS group survived, but those in the S group died (P=0.012). CONCLUSION: Accurate and rapid diagnosis using various modalities and the early initiation of intensive combined treatment may be the optimal strategies to reduce the risk of isolated MS subsequently evolving to AML. To fully understand the characteristics of isolated MS, a larger number of patients from a multinational study is necessary.",,"['Lee, Jung Yeon', 'Chung, Haerim', 'Cho, Hyunsoo', 'Jang, Ji Eun', 'Kim, Yundeok', 'Kim, Soo-Jeong', 'Kim, Jin Seok', 'Hyun, Shin Young', 'Min, Yoo Hong', 'Cheong, June-Won']","['Lee JY', 'Chung H', 'Cho H', 'Jang JE', 'Kim Y', 'Kim SJ', 'Kim JS', 'Hyun SY', 'Min YH', 'Cheong JW']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Yonsei University Wonju College of Medicine, Wonju, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Graduate School of Medical Science and Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Yonsei University Wonju College of Medicine, Wonju, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170925,Korea (South),Blood Res,Blood research,101605247,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Myeloid sarcoma', 'Treatment']",2017/10/19 06:00,2017/10/19 06:01,['2017/10/19 06:00'],"['2017/04/12 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/20 00:00 [revised]', '2017/06/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/10/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/19 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5045/br.2017.52.3.184 [doi]'],ppublish,Blood Res. 2017 Sep;52(3):184-192. doi: 10.5045/br.2017.52.3.184.

However, the effects of intensified regimen on complete remission (CR), relapse and overall survival (OS) remain unknown. METHODS: We analyzed 1195 patients treated with idarubicin plus cytarabine/BHAC (3+7) from 2002 to 2013. Among them, 731 received early intensification with 3-day cytarabine/BHAC (3+10, N=363) or 2-day idarubicin plus cytarabine/BHAC 3 days (5+10, N=368). The 3+10 and 5+10 strategies were applied to patients with bone marrow blast counts of 5-20% and >20% on day 7 of 3+7, respectively. RESULTS: Early intensification correlated with a younger age (median: 40 vs. 45 yr) and higher t(8;21) frequency (20.4% vs. 7.1%), compared to 3+7. After early intensification, the early death rates were higher among the elderly (3+10 [15.7%], 5+10 [21.7%] vs. 3+7 [6.3%], P=0.038), while the post-induction CR rate was higher in young patients (3+10 [79.8%], 5+10 [75.1%] vs. 3+7 [65.1%], P<0.001). Early relapse rate was also decreased (3+10 [11.8%], 5+10 [11.7%] vs. 3+7 [22.0%], P<0.001). In multivariate analysis, early intensification correlated with an inferior 5-year OS among elderly patients (19.2% vs. 22.8%; hazard ratio [HR]=1.84, 95% confidence interval [CI]; 1.11-3.06, P=0.018) and lower overall relapse rate among young patients (33.0% vs. 41.4%, P=0.023; HR=0.71, 95% CI; 0.55-0.93, P=0.012).

Despite timely diagnosis and appropriate antifungal therapy, clinical outcomes of IFIs remain unsatisfactory, necessitating treatment with a combination of antifungal agents. Therefore, childhood leukemic patients treated with voriconazole plus caspofungin were evaluated for the safety and efficacy of the combination antifungal therapy to treat IFIs. METHODS: In this retrospective study, medical records were retrieved for patients admitted to the Pediatric Department of Yeungnam University Hospital, Daegu, South Korea, between April 2009 and May 2013. Medical records of 22 patients were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 22 patients studied, nine (41%) had been diagnosed with probable IFI, and 13 (59%) with possible IFI. All patients, except one, were already receiving antifungal monotherapy for the treatment of neutropenic fever. After a diagnosis of IFI was confirmed, antifungal monotherapy was replaced with combination therapy. The study's overall response rate was 90.9%, with complete responses in 86.3% of the patients. Two patients experienced a side effect of a small increase in liver enzyme levels.

Approximately 15% of human cancers harbor BRAF mutations as well as other BRAF anomalies (amplifications, fusions). Somatic mutations mainly occur in the catalytic kinase domain (CR3), and the predominant mutation is p.V600E which is the substitution of glutamic acid (E) for valine (V) as result of a mutation at codon 600 of the kinase domain. To our knowledge, the vast majority of the cancers have non-germline BRAF mutations. Here we describe a case of a 60-year-old female with a history of hairy cell leukemia (HCL) who presented with aphasia and forgetfulness. A follow-up Brain CT scan showed three distinct brain lesions which were found to be diagnostic of melanoma (confirmed by immunohistochemistry) with no evidence of a concurrent brain involvement by a B-cell neoplasm. Molecular studies confirmed the same BRAF p.V600E mutation in both malignancies (hairy cell leukemia and melanoma). Thereafter the patient was started on BRAF inhibitor treatment and is now symptom-free after one year of follow up.

However, the incidence of t(1;19) in adults is lower, not exceeding 3%, and the prognosis of adult patients is usually poor. Herein, we report a 52-year-old female patient with pre-B ALL who initially presented as bilateral renal enlargement. The cytogenetic analysis revealed chromosomal abnormalities including t(1;19). The patient underwent three consecutive courses of chemotherapy with VDLP (vincristine, daunorubicin, L-asp, and prednisolone) and gained a short complete remission. Her kidneys recovered to normal size, and renal function returned to normal level. However, after complete remission for only 3 months, the patient exhibited resistance to consolidation chemotherapy and indicated evidence of marrow relapse. Although we increased the drug dosage and attempted to use a different protocol, she died of severe anemia and hemorrhage almost 10 months after she was first admitted.

Patients in the treatment group received the Tiaogeng Yijing decoction continuously for three menstrual cycles in addition to microstimulation, while patients in the control group underwent microstimulation only. The following molecules were measured following treatment: Serum levels of sex hormones, including follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol (E2) and anti-mullerian hormone (AMH); follicular fluid levels of cytokines, including growth differentiation factor (GDF)-9, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF); and endometrial levels of cytokines, including integrin alphaVbeta3, TGF-beta1, LIF, G-CSF and VEGF. In addition, the antral follicle count (AFC), mean ovarian diameter (MOD) and pregnancy outcomes were measured. The results revealed that the Tiaogeng Yijing decoction significantly decreased serum levels of FSH and E2, and significantly increased serum AMH levels, the AFC, follicular fluid levels of GDF-9, TGF-beta1 and VEGF, and endometrial levels of integrin alphaVbeta3, TGF-beta1 and VEGF, in addition to pregnancy outcomes (all P<0.05 vs. the control group). However, no significant differences were found in the MOD or levels of LH, LIF and G-CSF. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that the Tiaogeng Yijing decoction promotes pregnancy outcomes in patients with POR undergoing IVF-ET, and that this effect may be associated with the upregulation of TGF-beta1 and VEGF in the follicular fluid and endometrium.",,"['Xue, Hui', 'Dong, Juan', 'Xu, Huijun', 'Huang, Xin', 'Dai, Huangguan', 'Hao, Cuifang']","['Xue H', 'Dong J', 'Xu H', 'Huang X', 'Dai H', 'Hao C']","['Department of Gynecology, The Affiliated Qingdao Hiser Hospital of Qingdao University, Qingdao, Shandong 266000, P.R.

METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 33 pediatric patients who were diagnosed as having hypertensive encephalopathy in Chonbuk National University Children's Hospital. Among the patients, 18 were excluded because of incomplete data or because brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was not performed. Finally, 17 patients were enrolled and divided into a renal-origin hypertension group and a non-renal-origin hypertension group according to the underlying cause. We compared the clinical features and brain MRI findings between the 2 groups. RESULTS: The renal group included renal artery stenosis (4), acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (2), lupus nephritis (2), and acute renal failure (1); the nonrenal group included essential hypertension (4), pheochromocytoma (2), thyrotoxicosis (1), and acute promyelocytic leukemia (1). The mean systolic blood pressure of the renal group (172.5+/-36.9 mmHg) was higher than that of the nonrenal group (137.1+/-11.1 mmHg, P<0.05). Seizure was the most common neurologic symptom, especially in the renal group (P<0.05). Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), which is the most typical finding of hypertensive encephalopathy, was found predominantly in the renal group as compared with the nonrenal group (66.6% vs. 12.5%, P<0.05). CONCLUSION: We conclude that the patients with renal-origin hypertension had a more severe clinical course than those with non-renal-origin hypertension.

Runx1 is transcribed from two promoters, P1 and P2, to give rise to different protein isoforms. Although the expression of Runx1 must be tightly regulated for normal blood development, the mechanisms that regulate Runx1 isoform expression during haematopoiesis remain poorly understood. Gene regulatory elements located in non-coding DNA are likely to be important for Runx1 transcription. Here we use circular chromosome conformation capture sequencing to identify DNA interactions with the P1 and P2 promoters of Runx1, and the previously identified +24 enhancer, in the mouse multipotent haematopoietic progenitor cell line HPC-7. The active promoter, P1, interacts with nine non-coding regions that are occupied by transcription factors within a 1 Mb topologically associated domain. Eight of nine regions function as blood-specific enhancers in zebrafish, of which two were previously shown to harbour blood-specific enhancer activity in mice. Interestingly, the +24 enhancer interacted with multiple distant regions on chromosome 16, suggesting it may regulate the expression of additional genes. The Runx1 DNA contact map identifies connections with multiple novel and known haematopoietic enhancers that are likely to be involved in regulating Runx1 expression in haematopoietic progenitor cells.",,"['Marsman, Judith', 'Thomas, Amarni', 'Osato, Motomi', ""O'Sullivan, Justin M"", 'Horsfield, Julia A']","['Marsman J', 'Thomas A', 'Osato M', ""O'Sullivan JM"", 'Horsfield JA']","['Department of Pathology, Dunedin School of Medicine, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.', 'Department of Pathology, Dunedin School of Medicine, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.', 'Cancer Science Institute, National University of Singapore, Singapore, 117599, Singapore.', 'International Research Center for Medical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Liggins Institute, The University of Auckland, Private Bag, 92019, Auckland, New Zealand.', 'Maurice Wilkins Centre for Molecular Biodiscovery, The University of Auckland, Private Bag, 92019, Auckland, New Zealand.', 'Department of Pathology, Dunedin School of Medicine, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand. julia.horsfield@otago.ac.nz.', 'Maurice Wilkins Centre for Molecular Biodiscovery, The University of Auckland, Private Bag, 92019, Auckland, New Zealand. julia.horsfield@otago.ac.nz.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171017,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,IM,"['Animals', 'Chromatin/genetics/metabolism', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics/metabolism', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Genetic Loci', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Phenotype', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding']",,,2017/10/19 06:00,2019/07/10 06:00,['2017/10/19 06:00'],"['2017/03/17 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/10/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-017-13748-8 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-017-13748-8 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2017 Oct 17;7(1):13347. doi: 10.1038/s41598-017-13748-8.,PMC5645309,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)']",,,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-2927-450X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9536-7790']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Adoptive immunotherapy with T cells genetically modified to recognize tumors is a promising and evolving treatment option. However, antitumor activity, particularly in the context of progressive leukemia, can be dampened both by limited costimulation and triggering of immunoregulatory checkpoints that attenuate T-cell responses. Expression of CD200 (OX2), a negative regulator of T-cell function that binds CD200 receptor (CD200R), is commonly increased in leukemia and other malignancies and is associated with poor prognosis in leukemia patients. To appropriate and redirect the inhibitory effects of CD200R signaling on transferred CD8(+) T cells, we engineered CD200R immunomodulatory fusion proteins (IFPs) with the cytoplasmic tail replaced by the signaling domain of the costimulatory receptor, CD28. An analysis of a panel of CD200R-CD28 IFP constructs revealed that the most effective costimulation was achieved in IFPs containing a dimerizing motif and a predicted tumor-T-cell distance that facilitates localization to the immunological synapse. T cells transduced with the optimized CD200R-CD28 IFPs exhibited enhanced proliferation and effector function in response to CD200(+) leukemic cells in vitro. In adoptive therapy of disseminated leukemia, CD200R-CD28-transduced leukemia-specific CD8 T cells eradicated otherwise lethal disease more efficiently than wild-type cells and bypassed the requirement for interleukin-2 administration to sustain in vivo activity. The transduction of human primary T cells with the equivalent human IFPs increased proliferation and cytokine production in response to CD200(+) leukemia cells, supporting clinical translation.

Today, various Echinacea spp. preparations are used primarily to treat upper respiratory infections. AIM OF THE STUDY: The goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of an ethanolic E. purpurea (L) Moench root extract and the alkylamide dodeca-2E,4E-dienoic acid isobutylamide (A15) on mast cells, which are important mediators of allergic and inflammatory responses. Inhibition of mast cell activation may help explain the traditional use of Echinacea. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A15 was evaluated for its effects on degranulation, calcium influx, cytokine and lipid mediator production using bone marrow derived mast cells (BMMCs) and the transformed rat basophilic leukemia mast cell line RBL-2H3. Methods included enzymatic assays, fluorimetry, ELISAs, and microscopy. A root extract of E. purpurea, and low and high alkylamide-containing fractions prepared from this extract, were also tested for effects on mast cell function. Finally, we tested A15 for effects on calcium responses in RAW 264.7 macrophage and Jurkat T cell lines. RESULTS: A15 inhibited ss-hexosaminidase release from BMMCs and RBL-2H3 cells after treatment with the calcium ionophore A23187 by 83.5% and 48.4% at 100microM, respectively. Inhibition also occurred following stimulation with IgE anti-DNP/DNP-HSA. In addition, A15 inhibited 47% of histamine release from A23187-treated RBL-2H3 cells. A15 prevented the rapid rise in intracellular calcium following FcepsilonRI crosslinking and A23187 treatment suggesting it acts on the signals controlling granule release. An E. purpurea root extract and a fraction with high alkylamide content derived from this extract also displayed these activities while fractions with little to no detectable amounts of alkylamide did not. A15 mediated inhibition of calcium influx was not limited to mast cells as A23187-stimulated calcium influx was blocked in both RAW 264.7 and Jurkat cell lines with 60.2% and 43.6% inhibition at 1min post-stimulation, respectively. A15 also inhibited the release of TNF-alpha, and PGE2 to a lesser degree, following A23187 stimulation indicating its broad activity on mast cell mediator production. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that Echinacea extracts and alkylamides may be useful for treating allergic and inflammatory responses mediated by mast cells. More broadly, since calcium is a critical second messenger, the inhibitory effects of alkylamides on calcium uptake would be predicted to dampen a variety of pathological responses, suggesting new uses for this plant and its constituents.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This successful basic research led to clinical studies of a WT1 peptide vaccine, and a positive impact on clinical response was first demonstrated in 2003 in the form of a reduction in blast cells of vaccine-treated patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Since then, data on WT1 peptide vaccine-treated patients with immunological and/or clinical response have been accumulated. MDS and acute myeloid leukemia were the major target diseases to provide proof of concept for the therapeutic potential of the WT1 peptide vaccine. WT1 vaccination-induced clinical responses or usefulness were also shown for chronic myeloid leukemia, multiple myeloma, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, as well as various types of solid cancers. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and myeloproliferative neoplasms may also be target diseases because of their WT1 expression. Of note, recent clinical studies have demonstrated that patients with hematological malignancies who have minimal residual disease after chemotherapy or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation may be cured by WT1 peptide vaccination. Further enhancement of the efficacy and usefulness of the WT1 peptide vaccine is expected.","['(c) 2017 S.

Objectives: To compare the incidence of febrile neutropenia in high-risk patients with haematological malignancy receiving a fluoroquinolone with those receiving an oral third-generation cephalosporin (OTGC) as antibacterial prophylaxis during chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. Methods: A retrospective, matched, single-centre study comparing clinical and microbiological outcomes in acute leukaemia patients receiving fluoroquinolones versus OTGCs as antibacterial prophylaxis after chemotherapy. Results: A total of 120 patients (levofloxacin n = 80, OTGC n = 40) were included and matched. The 30 day incidence of febrile neutropenia was 89.7% (95% CI = 82.4-93.9). The rates of febrile neutropenia were similar between antimicrobials (OTGC versus levofloxacin HR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.54-1.52, P = 0.70). The most frequent site of infection was the bloodstream (line related) (n = 24, 62%) and the majority (n = 28, 72%) of infections were caused by Gram-positive organisms. Groups were similar in terms of site of infection (P = 0.91) and morphology of recovered microorganisms (P = 0.74). There were significantly more cultures positive for Enterobacter spp. in the OTGC group (P = 0.043). Three patients died during follow-up (from first dose up to 30 days after the last dose) (30 day survival = 99.2%, 95% CI = 97.5-100), with only two of the reported deaths attributable to infection. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate comparable rates of febrile neutropenia and culture positivity with an increase in cultures positive for Enterobacter spp. when OTGCs are compared with levofloxacin for antibacterial prophylaxis during chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. Further prospective, randomized investigation is warranted.","['(c) The Author 2017. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the', 'British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy.

We report a prospective, double-blind phase III trial to investigate the effect of ATLG (Neovii Biotech, Lexington, MA) on cGVHD-free survival. Patients and Methods Two hundred fifty-four patients 18 to 65 years of age with acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome who underwent myeloablative HLA-matched unrelated hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) were randomly assigned one to one to placebo (n =128 placebo) or ATLG (n = 126) treatment at 27 sites. Patients received either ATLG or placebo 20 mg/kg per day on days -3, -2, -1 in addition to tacrolimus and methotrexate as GVHD prophylaxis. The primary study end point was moderate-severe cGVHD-free survival. Results Despite a reduction in grade 2 to 4 acute GVHD (23% v 40%; P = .004) and moderate-severe cGVHD (12% v 33%; P < .001) in ATLG recipients, no difference in moderate-severe cGVHD-free survival between ATLG and placebo was found (2-year estimate: 48% v 44%, respectively; P = .47). Both progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were lower with ATLG (2-year estimate: 47% v 65% [ P = .04] and 59% v 74% [ P = .034], respectively). Multivariable analysis confirmed that ATLG was associated with inferior PFS (hazard ratio, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.05 to 2.28; P = .026) and OS (hazard ratio, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.12 to 2.71; P = .01). Conclusion In this prospective, randomized, double-blind trial of ATLG in unrelated myeloablative HCT, the incorporation of ATLG did not improve moderate-severe cGVHD-free survival. Moderate-severe cGVHD was significantly lower with ATLG, but PFS and OS also were lower. Additional analyses are needed to understand the appropriate role for ATLG in HCT.",,"['Soiffer, Robert J', 'Kim, Haesook T', 'McGuirk, Joseph', 'Horwitz, Mitchell E', 'Johnston, Laura', 'Patnaik, Mrinal M', 'Rybka, Witold', 'Artz, Andrew', 'Porter, David L', 'Shea, Thomas C', 'Boyer, Michael W', 'Maziarz, Richard T', 'Shaughnessy, Paul J', 'Gergis, Usama', 'Safah, Hana', 'Reshef, Ran', 'DiPersio, John F', 'Stiff, Patrick J', 'Vusirikala, Madhuri', 'Szer, Jeff', 'Holter, Jennifer', 'Levine, James D', 'Martin, Paul J', 'Pidala, Joseph A', 'Lewis, Ian D', 'Ho, Vincent T', 'Alyea, Edwin P', 'Ritz, Jerome', 'Glavin, Frank', 'Westervelt, Peter', 'Jagasia, Madan H', 'Chen, Yi-Bin']","['Soiffer RJ', 'Kim HT', 'McGuirk J', 'Horwitz ME', 'Johnston L', 'Patnaik MM', 'Rybka W', 'Artz A', 'Porter DL', 'Shea TC', 'Boyer MW', 'Maziarz RT', 'Shaughnessy PJ', 'Gergis U', 'Safah H', 'Reshef R', 'DiPersio JF', 'Stiff PJ', 'Vusirikala M', 'Szer J', 'Holter J', 'Levine JD', 'Martin PJ', 'Pidala JA', 'Lewis ID', 'Ho VT', 'Alyea EP', 'Ritz J', 'Glavin F', 'Westervelt P', 'Jagasia MH', 'Chen YB']","['Robert J.

The aim of the study was to analyze the outcome of patients diagnosed with Down syndrome and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in Poland between the years 2003 and 2010. A total of 1848 children were diagnosed with ALL (810 females and 1038 males). Of those, 41 (2.2%) had DS. The children were classified into three risk groups: a standard-risk group-14 patients, an intermediate-risk group-24, a high-risk group-3. All patients were treated according to ALLIC 2002 protocol. The median observation time of all patients was 6.1 years, and in patients with DS 5.3 years. Five-year overall survival (OS) was the same in all patients (86% vs 86%, long-rank test, p = .9). The relapse-free survival (RFS) was calculated as 73% in patients with DS and 81% in patients without DS during a median observation time (long-rank test, p = .3). No statistically significant differences were found in the incidence of nonrelapse mortality between those two groups of patients (p = .72). The study was based on children with ALL and Down syndrome who were treated with an identical therapy schedule as ALL patients without DS, according to risk group.

However, the effects of actein on human leukemia have not been explored before. In this study, the role of actein in regulating apoptosis induction in human leukemia cells was investigated. Actein administration significantly enhanced apoptosis, especially in human leukemia cell line of U937 and the primary human leukemia cells. The promotion was accompanied by caspase-9, caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage, and cytochrome c (Cyto-c) release. Additionally, translocation of Bax into mitochondria was increased by actein, while anti-apoptotic signals of myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) and B cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) were decreased, accompanied by reduced phosphorylated Bcl-2-associated death promoter (Bad). Furthermore, protein kinase B (AKT) activation was downregulated by actein treatment in U937 cells. RhoA, but not caspase-3, regulated Rho kinase 1 (ROCK1) expression induced by actein. Suppression of RhoA and ROCK1 reduced ROCK1 expression, caspase-9, caspase-3 and PARP cleavage. In contrast, AKT inactivity enhanced apoptosis levels, as well as caspase signaling pathway expression. The anticancer role of actein was potentiated by inactivating AKT. In vivo, U937-bearing tumor growth was suppressed by actein, which was related to ROCK1 suppression, AKT dephosphorylation and apoptosis induction. These results indicated that actein has a suppressive role in human leukemia progression through inactivating RhoA/ROCK1 and inducing caspases.",,"['Zhou, Wen-Di', 'Wang, Xiang', 'Sun, Xing-Zhen', 'Hu, Jian', 'Zhang, Rong-Rong', 'Hong, Ze']","['Zhou WD', 'Wang X', 'Sun XZ', 'Hu J', 'Zhang RR', 'Hong Z']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Huai'an First People's Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, Huai'an, Jiangsu 223300, P.R.

Most impressively, CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CART19) have led to impressive responses in patients with B-cell leukemia and lymphoma. CTL019, or KYMRIAH (tisagenlecleucel), a CD19 CAR T cell product developed by Novartis and the University of Pennsylvania, was recently approved for clinical use by the Food and Drug Administration, representing a landmark in the application of adoptive T cell therapies. As CART19 enters routine clinical use, improving the efficacy of this exciting platform is the next step in broader application.

NLRP3 inflammasome activation in cells can lead to the release of IL-1beta cytokine via caspase-1, which is required for inflammatory-induced programmed cell death (pyroptosis). Nanoparticles are commonly used as vaccine adjuvants and drug delivery vehicles to improve the efficacy and reduce the toxicity of chemotherapeutic agents. Several studies indicate that different nanoparticles (e.g., liposomes, polymer-based nanoparticles) can induce NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Generation of a pro-inflammatory response is beneficial for vaccine delivery to provide adaptive immunity, a necessary step for successful vaccination. However, similar immune responses for intravenously injected, drug-containing nanoparticles can result in immunotoxicity (e.g., silica nanoparticles). Evaluation of NLRP3-mediated inflammasome activation by nanoparticles may predict pro-inflammatory responses in order to determine if these effects may be mitigated for drug delivery or optimized for vaccine development. In this protocol, we outline steps to monitor the release of IL-1beta using PMA-primed THP-1 cells, a human monocytic leukemia cell line, as a model system.

LIF has been implicated in various autoimmune inflammatory diseases, but its role still remains elusive in systemic sclerosis (SSc). Therefore, we investigated the potential role of LIF in the development of SSc by evaluating the clinical correlation of serum LIF levels, the expression of LIF and its receptors in skin samples, and in vitro experiments with human dermal microvascular endothelial cells. Serum LIF levels were significantly decreased in patients with SSc, especially in those with disease duration of < 1 year compared with healthy controls. As for clinical correlation, SSc patients with digital ulcers exhibited serum LIF levels significantly lower than those without. In immunohistochemistry, the expression of LIF and its receptors, LIF receptor and gp130, was remarkably decreased in dermal blood vessels of SSc lesional skin relative to those of healthy control skin. Furthermore, gene silencing of transcription factor Fli1, whose deficiency is involved in the development of SSc vasculopathy, suppressed the expression of LIF, LIF receptor, and gp130 and Fli1 bound to the promoters of those genes in human dermal microvascular endothelial cells. Collectively, these results suggest that decreased serum LIF levels may be associated with vasculopathy in SSc and that Fli1 deficiency may contribute to the inhibition of LIF-dependent biological effects on SSc endothelial cells by suppressing the expression of LIF, LIF receptor, and gp130.",,"['Taniguchi, Takashi', 'Miyagawa, Takuya', 'Tamaki, Zenshiro', 'Nakamura, Kouki', 'Yamashita, Takashi', 'Saigusa, Ryosuke', 'Takahashi, Takehiro', 'Toyama, Tetsuo', 'Ichimura, Yohei', 'Yoshizaki, Ayumi', 'Tada, Yayoi', 'Sugaya, Makoto', 'Kadono, Takafumi', 'Sato, Shinichi', 'Asano, Yoshihide']","['Taniguchi T', 'Miyagawa T', 'Tamaki Z', 'Nakamura K', 'Yamashita T', 'Saigusa R', 'Takahashi T', 'Toyama T', 'Ichimura Y', 'Yoshizaki A', 'Tada Y', 'Sugaya M', 'Kadono T', 'Sato S', 'Asano Y']","['Department of Dermatology, University of Tokyo Graduate School of Medicine, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8655, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, University of Tokyo Graduate School of Medicine, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8655, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, University of Tokyo Graduate School of Medicine, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8655, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, University of Tokyo Graduate School of Medicine, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8655, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, University of Tokyo Graduate School of Medicine, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8655, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, University of Tokyo Graduate School of Medicine, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8655, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, University of Tokyo Graduate School of Medicine, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8655, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, University of Tokyo Graduate School of Medicine, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8655, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, University of Tokyo Graduate School of Medicine, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8655, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, University of Tokyo Graduate School of Medicine, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8655, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, University of Tokyo Graduate School of Medicine, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8655, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, University of Tokyo Graduate School of Medicine, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8655, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, University of Tokyo Graduate School of Medicine, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8655, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, University of Tokyo Graduate School of Medicine, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8655, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, University of Tokyo Graduate School of Medicine, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8655, Japan. yasano-tky@umin.ac.jp.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20171016,Germany,Arch Dermatol Res,Archives of dermatological research,8000462,IM,"['Aged', 'Animals', 'Biopsy', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130/*blood', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Female', 'Fingers', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*blood', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit/*blood', 'Male', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Microvessels/cytology', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Scleroderma, Systemic/*blood/genetics/pathology', 'Skin/blood supply/cytology/metabolism/pathology', 'Skin Ulcer/*blood', 'Vascular Diseases/*blood/genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['Digital ulcers', 'Endothelial cells', 'Fli1', 'Leukemia inhibitory factor', 'Systemic sclerosis']",2017/10/19 06:00,2018/06/22 06:00,['2017/10/18 06:00'],"['2016/11/22 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/09/10 00:00 [revised]', '2017/10/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2017/10/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00403-017-1786-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s00403-017-1786-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Arch Dermatol Res. 2017 Dec;309(10):833-842. doi: 10.1007/s00403-017-1786-4.

DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that regulates gene expression and is a key event for tumorigenesis. The continuous search for biomarkers that signal early disease, indicate prognosis, and act as therapeutic targets has led to studies investigating the role of DNA in cancer onset and progression. This review focuses on DNA methylation changes as potential biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, response to treatment, and early toxicity in acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome. Here, we report that distinct changes in DNA methylation may alter gene function and drive malignant cellular transformation during several stages of leukemogenesis. Most of these modifications occur at an early stage of disease and may predict myeloid/lymphoid transformation or response to therapy, which justifies its use as a biomarker for disease onset and progression. Methylation patterns, or its dynamic change during treatment, may also be used as markers for patient stratification, disease prognosis, and response to treatment. Further investigations of methylation modifications as therapeutic biomarkers, which may correlate with therapeutic response and/or predict treatment toxicity, are still warranted.",,"['Dexheimer, Georgia Muccillo', 'Alves, Jayse', 'Reckziegel, Laura', 'Lazzaretti, Gabrielle', 'Abujamra, Ana Lucia']","['Dexheimer GM', 'Alves J', 'Reckziegel L', 'Lazzaretti G', 'Abujamra AL']","['Graduate Program in Biotechnology, UNIVATES, 95914-014 Lajeado, RS, Brazil.', 'Graduate Program in Biotechnology, UNIVATES, 95914-014 Lajeado, RS, Brazil.', 'Biological and Health Sciences Center, UNIVATES, 95914-014 Lajeado, RS, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Hemotherapy Service, Hospital Bruno Born, 95900-010 Lajeado, RS, Brazil.', 'Graduate Program in Biotechnology, UNIVATES, 95914-014 Lajeado, RS, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170906,United States,Dis Markers,Disease markers,8604127,IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', '*DNA Methylation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/pathology']",,,2017/10/19 06:00,2018/06/07 06:00,['2017/10/18 06:00'],"['2017/05/08 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/17 00:00 [revised]', '2017/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/10/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2017/5472893 [doi]'],ppublish,Dis Markers. 2017;2017:5472893. doi: 10.1155/2017/5472893.

In this study the interactions of Leishmania donovani, the causative agent of visceral Leishmaniasis, and Leishmania tropica, the causative agent of cutaneous Leishmaniasis with MCs were studied. Co-culture of Leishmania with Peritoneal Mast Cells (PMCs) from BALB/c mice and Rat Basophilic Leukaemia (RBL-2H3) MCs led to significant killing of L. tropica and to a lesser extent of L. donovani. Also, while there was significant uptake of L. tropica by MCs, L. donovani was not phagocytosed. There was significant generation of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) by MCs on co-culture with these species of Leishmania which may contribute to their clearance. Interactions of MCs with Leishmania led to generation of MC extracellular traps comprising of DNA, histones and tryptase probably to ensnare these pathogens.

Various TNFRSF agonists have been clinically evaluated, but have met with limited efficacy and/or toxicity. Recent insights indicate that 'first-generation' TNFRSF agonists lack efficacy as they do not effectively cross-link their corresponding receptor. Reversely, ubiquitous TNFRSF receptor(s) cross-linking by CD40 and Fas agonistic antibodies resulted in dose-limiting liver toxicity. To overcome these issues, we developed a novel pretargeting strategy exploiting recombinant fusion proteins in which a soluble form of TRAIL, FasL or CD40L is genetically fused to a high-affinity anti-fluorescein scFv antibody fragment (scFvFITC). Fusion proteins scFvFITC:sTRAIL and scFvFITC:sFasL induced potent target antigen-restricted apoptosis in a panel of cancer lines and in primary patient-derived cancer cells, but only when pretargeted with a relevant FITC-labelled antitumour antibody. In a similar pretargeting setting, fusion protein scFvFITC:sCD40L promoted tumour-directed maturation of immature monocyte-derived dendritic cells (iDCs).

Here, by systematic CRISPR/Cas9-assisted deletions of chromatin accessible regions within the Zbtb16 locus in mouse, we identify a critical enhancer controlling PLZF expression exclusively in innate lymphoid lineages. Multiple sites within this enhancer express canonical motifs for the TF Runx1, which is essential for the development of these lineages. Notably, some regulatory sites control the kinetic rather than the overall level of PLZF expression. Thus, our comprehensive, unbiased analysis of regulatory elements in vivo reveals critical mechanisms of Zbtb16 regulation shared between innate and innate-like lymphoid lineages. Zbtb16-encoded transcription factor PLZF directs the differentiation of multiple innate and innate-like cell lineages, but how Zbtb16 itself is regulated remains unclear.

Previous studies in childhood acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have shown a negative correlation of IDO-1 mRNA expression with outcomes. The aim of our study was to develop a practical and objective immunohistochemical technique to quantify IDO-1 expression on diagnostic bone marrow biopsies of AML patients in order to facilitate its use in routine clinical practice. IDO-1 mRNA was extracted from diagnostic bone marrow specimens from 29 AML patients. IDO-1 protein expression was assessed in 40 cases via immunohistochemistry and quantified by a novel 'composite IDO-1 score'. In a univariate analysis, higher age (p = 0.0018), male gender (p = 0.019), high risk cytogenetics (p = 0.002), higher IDO-1 mRNA (p = 0.005), higher composite IDO-1 score (p < 0.0001) and not undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT, p = 0.0005) predicted poor overall survival. In a multivariate model that included the aforementioned variables, higher composite IDO-1 score (p = 0.007) and not undergoing allogeneic SCT (p = 0.007) was found to significantly predict poor outcomes.

Unfortunately, these cells also attack host normal tissues through the often fatal graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Full separation of GVL activity from GVHD has yet to be achieved. Here, we show that, in mice and humans, a population of interleukin-9 (IL-9)-producing T cells activated via the ST2-IL-33 pathway (T9IL-33 cells) increases GVL while decreasing GVHD through two opposing mechanisms: protection from fatal immunity by amphiregulin expression and augmentation of antileukemic activity compared with T9, T1, and unmanipulated T cells through CD8alpha expression.

METHODS: An ancillary data analysis of 398 patients with recurrent ovarian cancer enrolled on eight prospective trials of olaparib capsules was performed. Patients aged 65years and older were stratified into age groups by 5year increments (ages 65-69, 70-74, >/=75years) and compared to those <65. Analysis was restricted to those patients receiving the recommended treatment dose of 400mg PO b.i.d. RESULTS: Of the 398 patients included, 78 were >/=65 (age 65-69 n=38, age 70-74 n=23, age>/=75 n=17). The majority of elderly patients were Caucasian (n=2 Asian) and had received >/=5 prior lines of chemotherapy. In patients <65, 46.9% required dose reduction as compared to 44.7% of patients 65-69years, 47.8% of patients 70-74years, and 64.7% of patients >/=75years (p=0.62). In patients <65years 41.2% required dose interruption, as compared to 50%, 43.5%, and 64.7% of patients aged 65-69, 70-74, and >/=75, respectively (p=0.11). There were no occurrences of myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia in any of the older cohorts. Toxicities, including grade 3/4 nausea, were similar across age groups. CONCLUSIONS: Tolerability and toxicity of olaparib capsules is similar between women >/=65years and <65years of age treated for advanced recurrent ovarian cancer.

Mutational activation of JAKs is also responsible for several haematological malignancies, including myeloproliferative neoplasms and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Accumulating evidence links adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK), an energy sensor and regulator of organismal and cellular metabolism, with the suppression of immune and inflammatory processes. Recent studies have shown that activation of AMPK can limit JAK-STAT-dependent signalling pathways via several mechanisms. These novel findings support AMPK activation as a strategy for management of an array of disorders characterised by hyper-activation of the JAK-STAT pathway. This review discusses the pivotal role of JAK-STAT signalling in a range of disorders and how both established clinically used and novel AMPK activators might be used to treat these conditions.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

However, its association with central nervous system (CNS) tumor risk is yet unclear. The present study examined it, analyzing data obtained from a case-control study conducted among three states from the US. The association with childhood leukemia risk was also further examined. METHODS: In this study, a data set provided by the Comprehensive Epidemiologic Data Resource was analyzed with an official permission. The original case-control study was conducted to examine the association between paternal preconception exposure to ionizing radiation and childhood cancer risk. Cases with childhood cancer were mainly ascertained from local hospitals, and controls were selected, matched with birth year (1-year category), county of residence, sex, ethnicity and maternal age (+/-2 years). Since the ID numbers were unavailable, conventional logistic analyses were conducted adjusting for those matching variables except for the county of residence. In addition to those variables, gestational age, age at diagnosis and study sites as covariables were included in the logistic models. RESULTS: Analyzed subjects were 72 CNS tumor cases, 124 leukemia cases and 822 controls born from 1945 to 1989. The odds ratios (ORs) of CNS tumor risk for children with low BWs (<2500 g) and high BWs (>4000 g) were 2.0 (95% confidence interval [CI]) = 0.7, 5.9) and 2.5 (95%CI = 1.2, 5.2)], respectively. When high-BW children were restricted to those who were large for gestational age (LGA), the OR for high-BW children remained similar (OR = 2.7; 95%CI = 1.1, 6.2). On the other hand, the ORs of leukemia risk for children with low and high BWs were 0.8 (95%CI = 0.2, 3.0) and 1.4 (95%CI = 0.7, 2.6), respectively. In the normal range of BW (2500-4000 g), higher BW was positively associated with CNS tumor risk (beta = 0.0011, p for trend = 0.012). However, the association with leukemia risk was not significant (beta = -0.0002, p for trend = 0.475). CONCLUSION: High-BW and LGA children had an elevated childhood CNS tumor risk. In the normal BW range, the BW itself was positively related to CNS tumor risk. No significant association between BW and childhood leukemia risk was observed in this study.",,"['Tran, Long Thanh', 'Lai, Hang Thi Minh', 'Koriyama, Chihaya', 'Uwatoko, Futoshi', 'Akiba, Suminori']","['Tran LT', 'Lai HTM', 'Koriyama C', 'Uwatoko F', 'Akiba S']","['Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, Kagoshima University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, 8-35-1, Sakuragaoka, Kagoshima, 890-8544, Japan.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, Kagoshima University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, 8-35-1, Sakuragaoka, Kagoshima, 890-8544, Japan.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, Kagoshima University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, 8-35-1, Sakuragaoka, Kagoshima, 890-8544, Japan.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, Kagoshima University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, 8-35-1, Sakuragaoka, Kagoshima, 890-8544, Japan.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, Kagoshima University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, 8-35-1, Sakuragaoka, Kagoshima, 890-8544, Japan. akiba@m.kufm.kagoshima-u.ac.jp.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20171016,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,IM,"['*Birth Weight', 'Body Mass Index', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/complications/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gestational Age', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Maternal Age', 'Pediatric Obesity/complications/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Risk Factors']",['NOTNLM'],"['Birth weight', 'CNS tumors', 'Childhood cancer', 'Leukemia']",2017/10/19 06:00,2018/05/31 06:00,['2017/10/18 06:00'],"['2016/07/01 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/10/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/31 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-017-3681-y [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-017-3681-y [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2017 Oct 16;17(1):687. doi: 10.1186/s12885-017-3681-y.,PMC5644053,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, the viability of KG-1alpha cells transfected with DACT1 was significantly reduced when treated with daunorubicin.

Methods: Subnational data of China from Global Burden of Disease Study 2015 (GBD 2015) was used to rank the causes and risk factors leading to death and disability adjusted life years (DALY) in Chinese adolescents aged between 10 and 19 years old, and thereby to analyze the main cauese and risk factors of death and DALY among Chinese adolescents in different genders. Results: In 2015, among Chinese adolescents aged 10-19 years old, the total DALY was 13 million 490 thousand years, and the total number of deaths was 63 258 cases. The top 3 causes of DALY were skin and subcutaneous diseases, iron-deficiency anemia and road injuries, resulting in DALY (constituent ratio) of 1 411 (10.5%), 1 094 (8.1%) and 1 029 (7.6%) thousand years respectively. The top 3 causes of death were road injuries, drowning and leukemia, causing 13 881 (21.9%), 9 895 (15.6%) and 4 620 (7.3%) deaths (constituent ratio) respectively. The top 3 risk factors of DALY were iron deficiency, alcohol use and drug use, causing 1 094 (8.1%), 487 (3.6%) and 220 thousand years (1.6%) DALY (constituent ratio) respectively. The top 3 risk factors of death were alcohol use, occupational injuries and drug use, causing 5 957 (9.4%), 1 523 (2.4%) and 810 (1.3%) deaths respectively.

PBX1 encodes a three amino acid loop extension (TALE) homeodomain transcription factor that forms multimeric complexes with TALE and HOX proteins to regulate target gene transcription during development. As previously reported, Pbx1 homozygous mutant mice (Pbx1-/-) develop malformations and hypoplasia or aplasia of multiple organs, including the craniofacial skeleton, ear, branchial arches, heart, lungs, diaphragm, gut, kidneys, and gonads. Clinical findings similar to those in Pbx mutant mice were observed in all patients with varying expressivity and severity, including external ear anomalies, abnormal branchial arch derivatives, heart malformations, diaphragmatic hernia, renal hypoplasia and ambiguous genitalia. All patients but one had developmental delays. Previously reported patients with congenital anomalies affecting the kidney and urinary tract exhibited deletions and loss of function variants in PBX1. The sequence variants in our cases included missense substitutions adjacent to the PBX1 homeodomain (p.Arg184Pro, p.Met224Lys, and p.Arg227Pro) or within the homeodomain (p.Arg234Pro, and p.Arg235Gln), whereas p.Ser262Glnfs*2, and p.Arg288* yielded truncated PBX1 proteins. Functional studies on five PBX1 sequence variants revealed perturbation of intrinsic, PBX-dependent transactivation ability and altered nuclear translocation, suggesting abnormal interactions between mutant PBX1 proteins and wild-type TALE or HOX cofactors. It is likely that the mutations directly affect the transcription of PBX1 target genes to impact embryonic development. We conclude that deleterious sequence variants in PBX1 cause intellectual disability and pleiotropic malformations resembling those in Pbx1 mutant mice, arguing for strong conservation of gene function between these two species.","['(c) The Author 2017.

Retrotransposition of active TEs such as LINE-1 (L1) tremendously impacts genetic diversification and genome stability. Therefore, transcription and transposition activities of retrotransposons are tightly controlled. Here, we show that the Kruppel-like zinc finger protein Zfp281 directly binds and suppresses a subset of retrotransposons, including the active young L1 repeat elements, in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. In addition, we find that Zfp281-regulated L1s are highly enriched for 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and H3K4me3. The COMPASS-like H3K4 methyltransferase Mll2 is the major H3K4me3 methylase at the Zfp281-regulated L1s and required for their proper expression. Our studies also reveal that Zfp281 functions partially through recruiting the L1 regulators DNA hydroxymethylase Tet1 and Sin3A, and restricting Mll2 at these active L1s, leading to their balanced expression. In summary, our data indicate an instrumental role of Zfp281 in suppressing the young active L1s in mouse ES cells.","['(c) The Author(s) 2017.

Such methods must not only extract snippets of text that relate to model interactions, but also be able to contextualize the evidence and provide additional confidence scores for the interaction in question. Although various approaches calculating confidence scores have focused primarily on the quality of the extracted information, there has been little work on exploring the textual uncertainty conveyed by the author. Despite textual uncertainty being acknowledged in biomedical text mining as an attribute of text mined interactions (events), it is significantly understudied as a means of providing a confidence measure for interactions in pathways or other biomedical models. In this work, we focus on improving identification of textual uncertainty for events and explore how it can be used as an additional measure of confidence for biomedical models. Results: We present a novel method for extracting uncertainty from the literature using a hybrid approach that combines rule induction and machine learning. Variations of this hybrid approach are then discussed, alongside their advantages and disadvantages. We use subjective logic theory to combine multiple uncertainty values extracted from different sources for the same interaction. Our approach achieves F-scores of 0.76 and 0.88 based on the BioNLP-ST and Genia-MK corpora, respectively, making considerable improvements over previously published work. Moreover, we evaluate our proposed system on pathways related to two different areas, namely leukemia and melanoma cancer research. Availability and implementation: The leukemia pathway model used is available in Pathway Studio while the Ras model is available via PathwayCommons.

Unpacking the association between socioeconomic status (SES) and incidence may offer insight into such etiology. We tested associations between SES and childhood cancer incidence in a population-based case-cohort study (source cohort: Minnesota birth registry, 1989-2014). Cases, ages 0-14 years, were linked from the Minnesota Cancer Surveillance System to birth records through probabilistic record linkage. Controls were 4:1 frequency matched on birth year (2,947 cases and 11,907 controls). We tested associations of individual-level (maternal education) and neighborhood-level (census tract composite index) SES using logistic mixed models. In crude models, maternal education was positively associated with incidence of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (odds ratio (OR) = 1.10, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.02, 1.19), central nervous system tumors (OR = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.21), and neuroblastoma (OR = 1.15, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.30). Adjustment for established risk factors-including race/ethnicity, maternal age, and birth weight-substantially attenuated these positive associations. Similar patterns were observed for neighborhood-level SES. Conversely, higher maternal education was inversely associated with hepatoblastoma incidence (adjusted OR = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.51, 0.98). Overall, beyond the social patterning of established demographic and pregnancy-related exposures, SES is not strongly associated with childhood cancer incidence.",,"['Kehm, Rebecca D', 'Spector, Logan G', 'Poynter, Jenny N', 'Vock, David M', 'Osypuk, Theresa L']","['Kehm RD', 'Spector LG', 'Poynter JN', 'Vock DM', 'Osypuk TL']","['University of Minnesota School of Public Health, Division of Epidemiology and Community Health, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'University of Minnesota, Division of Epidemiology and Clinical Research, Department of Pediatrics, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'University of Minnesota, Division of Epidemiology and Clinical Research, Department of Pediatrics, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'University of Minnesota School of Public Health, Division of Biostatistics, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'University of Minnesota School of Public Health, Division of Epidemiology and Community Health, Minneapolis, Minnesota.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Am J Epidemiol,American journal of epidemiology,7910653,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Minnesota/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects', 'Social Class', 'Young Adult']",,,2017/10/17 06:00,2019/08/31 06:00,['2017/10/17 06:00'],"['2017/06/14 00:00 [received]', '2017/09/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/31 06:00 [medline]', '2017/10/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['4258818 [pii]', '10.1093/aje/kwx322 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Epidemiol. 2018 May 1;187(5):982-991. doi: 10.1093/aje/kwx322.,PMC5928452,,"['P2C HD041023/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009529/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA094061/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA099936/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), central signaling components that regulate essentially all stimulated cellular processes, include the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) that are extremely sensitive to extracellular cues. Anti-phospho-ERK antibodies serve as a readout for ERK1/2 activation and are able to detect minute changes in ERK stimulation. The objective of this study was to explore whether activation of ERK1/2 and other signaling cascades can be used as a readout for responses of a variety of cell types, both transformed and non-transformed, to ELF-MF. METHODS: We applied ELF-MF at various field strengths and time periods to eight different cell types with an exposure system housed in a tissue culture incubator and followed the phosphorylation of MAPKs and Akt by western blotting. RESULTS: We found that the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 is increased in response to ELF-MF. However, the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 is likely too low to induce ELF-MF-dependent proliferation or oncogenic transformation. The p38 MAPK was very slightly phosphorylated, but JNK or Akt were not. The effect on ERK1/2 was detected for exposures to ELF-MF strengths as low as 0.15 microT and was maximal at approximately 10 microT. We also show that ERK1/2 phosphorylation is blocked by the flavoprotein inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium, indicating that the response to ELF-MF may be exerted via NADP oxidase similar to the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in response to microwave radiation. CONCLUSIONS: Our results further indicate that cells are responsive to ELF-MF at field strengths much lower than previously suspected and that the effect may be mediated by NADP oxidase. However, the small increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation is probably insufficient to affect proliferation and oncogenic transformation. Therefore, the results cannot be regarded as proof of the involvement of ELF-MF in cancer in general or childhood leukemia in particular.","['(c) 2017 The Author(s). Published by S.

Drug responsiveness and therapeutics of cancer depend on the accurate detection of clones in a tumor sample. Recent research has considered inferring clonal composition of a tumor sample using computational models based on short read data of the sample generated using next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology. Short reads (segmented DNA parts of different tumor cells) are noisy; therefore, inferring the clones and their mutations from the data is a difficult and complex problem. We develop a new model called HetFHMM, based on factorial hidden Markov models, to infer clones and their proportions from noisy NGS data. In our model, each hidden chain represents the genomic signature of a clone, and a mixture of chains results in the observed data. We make use of Gibbs sampling and exponentiated gradient algorithms to infer the hidden variables and mixing proportions. We compare our model with strong models from previous work (PyClone and PhyloSub) based on both synthetic data and real cancer data on acute myeloid leukemia.

However, its expression profile across leukocytes in leukemia patients has not yet been analyzed. METHODS: A total of 50 AML cases and 14 B-cell ALL patients were consecutively recruited. Bone marrow samples were subjected to flow cytometry. Statistical analysis was applied to compare syncytin-1 expression between B-cell ALL and AML across granulocytes, leukemia cells, and T-lymphocytes (including CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ subsets thereof) and to correlate syncytin-1 expression to leukemia cells and lymphocytes with the T-cell subset percentages. RESULTS: The syncytin-1-expressing leukemia cell% in AML patients was significantly higher than that in B-cell ALL patients (p < 0.05). The CD8+ T-cell% in AML patients was significantly higher than that in B-cell ALL patients (p < 0.05). The syncytin-1 expression rate on leukemia cells was positively correlated with the CD8+ T-cell percentage (r = 0.289, p < 0.05), while the syncytin-1 expression rate on lymphocytes was negatively correlated with the CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T-cell percentages (r = -0.273, -0.450, and -0.307, respectively; p < 0.05).

Direct physical crowding of bone marrow (BM) by accumulating leukaemic cells does not fully account for this haematopoietic failure. Here, analyses from AML patients were applied to both in vitro co-culture platforms and in vivo xenograft modelling, revealing that human AML disease specifically disrupts the adipocytic niche in BM. Leukaemic suppression of BM adipocytes led to imbalanced regulation of endogenous haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, resulting in impaired myelo-erythroid maturation. In vivo administration of PPARgamma agonists induced BM adipogenesis, which rescued healthy haematopoietic maturation while repressing leukaemic growth.

On a molecular level, birch pollen allergy can be linked to the two dominant allergens Bet v 1 and Bet v 2. Bet v 2 belongs to the profilin family, which is abundant in the plant kingdom. Importantly, the homologous plant profilins have a conserved cysteine motif with a currently unknown functional relevance. In particular, it is unknown whether the motif is relevant for disulfide formation and to what extent it would affect the profilins' structural, functional and immunological properties. Here we present crystal structures of Bet v 2 in the reduced and the oxidized state, i.e., without and with a disulfide bridge. Despite overall structural similarity, the two structures distinctly differ at their termini which are stabilized to each other in the oxidized, i.e., disulfide-linked state. These structural differences translate into differences in their proteolytic resistance. Whereas the oxidized Bet v 2 is rather resistant towards the endolysosomal protease cathepsin S, it is rapidly degraded in the reduced form. By contrast, both Bet v 2 forms exhibit similar immunological properties as evidenced by their binding to IgE antibodies from birch pollen allergic patients and by their ability to trigger histamine release in a humanized rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL) assay, independent of the presence or absence of the disulfide bridge. Taken together our findings suggest that the oxidized Bet v 2 conformation should be the relevant species, with a much longer retention time to trigger immune responses.",,"['Soh, Wai Tuck', 'Briza, Peter', 'Dall, Elfriede', 'Asam, Claudia', 'Schubert, Mario', 'Huber, Sara', 'Aglas, Lorenz', 'Bohle, Barbara', 'Ferreira, Fatima', 'Brandstetter, Hans']","['Soh WT', 'Briza P', 'Dall E', 'Asam C', 'Schubert M', 'Huber S', 'Aglas L', 'Bohle B', 'Ferreira F', 'Brandstetter H']","['Department of Molecular Biology, University of Salzburg, Salzburg 5020, Austria. waituck.soh@sbg.ac.at.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, University of Salzburg, Salzburg 5020, Austria.

In this study, sorafenib was added to daunorubicin and cytarabine-based induction and consolidation chemotherapy and was also continued for 12 months of maintenance therapy. The primary end point of the study was overall survival (OS) at 1 year in the FLT3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) cohort. Fifty-four patients with a median age of 67 years (range, 60.3-82.7 years) were enrolled; 39 were FLT3-ITD patients (71%) and 15 were FLT3-TKD (29%) patients. The observed 1-year OS (95% confidence interval [CI]) was 62% (45%-78%) for the FLT3-ITD patients (meeting the primary end point 62% vs 30% for a historical control group, P < .0001) and 71% (42%-92%) for the FLT3-TKD patients. The median disease-free survival and OS were 12.2 months (95% CI, 5-16.9) and 15.0 months (95% CI, 10.4-20.1), respectively, in the FLT3-ITD group and 9.6 (95% CI, 1.9 to not available [NA]) and 16.2 months (95% CI, 5.0 to NA) for the FLT3-TKD group.

To identify such combinations, we previously performed a combinatorial drug screen and identified the Bcl-2 inhibitor venetoclax (VEN) as a promising partner for combination with IBR in Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL). We have opened a multi-institutional clinical trial to test this combination. However, analysis of primary samples from patients with MCL as well as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) revealed unexpected heterogeneous de novo resistance even to the IBR+VEN combination. In the current study, we demonstrate that resistance to the combination can be generated by microenvironmental agonists: IL-10, CD40L and, most potently, CpG-oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG-ODN), which is a surrogate for unmethylated DNA and a specific agonist for TLR9 signaling. Incubation with these agonists caused robust activation of NF-kappaB signaling, especially alternative NF-kappaB, which led to enhanced expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins Mcl-1, Bcl-xL, and survivin, thus decreasing dependence on Bcl-2. Inhibitors of NF-kappaB signaling blocked overexpression of these anti-apoptotic proteins and overcame resistance. Inhibitors of Mcl-1, Bcl-xL, or survivin also overcame this resistance, and showed synergistic benefit with the IBR+VEN combination. We conclude that microenvironmental factors, particularly the TLR9 agonist, can generate de novo resistance to the IBR+VEN combination in CLL and MCL cells. This signaling pathway presents targets for overcoming drug resistance induced by extrinsic microenvironmental factors in diverse B-cell malignancies.",,"['Jayappa, Kallesh D', 'Portell, Craig A', 'Gordon, Vicki L', 'Capaldo, Brian J', 'Bekiranov, Stefan', 'Axelrod, Mark J', 'Brett, L Kyle', 'Wulfkuhle, Julia D', 'Gallagher, Rosa I', 'Petricoin, Emanuel F', 'Bender, Timothy P', 'Williams, Michael E', 'Weber, Michael J']","['Jayappa KD', 'Portell CA', 'Gordon VL', 'Capaldo BJ', 'Bekiranov S', 'Axelrod MJ', 'Brett LK', 'Wulfkuhle JD', 'Gallagher RI', 'Petricoin EF', 'Bender TP', 'Williams ME', 'Weber MJ']","['Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Cancer Biology, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA, United States.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA, United States.', 'Cancer Center, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, United States.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Cancer Biology, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA, United States.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, United States.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, United States.', 'Gilead Sciences, 199 E.

In ALL patients, Stathmin 1 expression was significantly increased, associated with lower age onset and positively correlated with white blood cell counts, but did not impact on clinical outcomes. Functional assays revealed that paclitaxel induces Stathmin 1 phosphorylation at serine 16 (an inhibitory site), microtubule stability and apoptosis in Jurkat and Namalwa cell lines. Paclitaxel treatment did not modulate cell viability of normal peripheral blood leukocytes. In conclusion, our data confirm increased levels of Stathmin 1 in ALL patients and that therapeutic doses of paclitaxel inhibits Stathmin 1 function and promote microtubule stability and apoptosis in ALL cells.",,"['Machado-Neto, Joao Agostinho', 'Rodrigues Alves, Ana Paula Nunes', 'Fernandes, Jaqueline Cristina', 'Coelho-Silva, Juan Luiz', 'Scopim-Ribeiro, Renata', 'Fenerich, Bruna Alves', 'da Silva, Fernanda Borges', 'Scheucher, Priscila Santos', 'Simoes, Belinda Pinto', 'Rego, Eduardo Magalhaes', 'Traina, Fabiola']","['Machado-Neto JA', 'Rodrigues Alves APN', 'Fernandes JC', 'Coelho-Silva JL', 'Scopim-Ribeiro R', 'Fenerich BA', 'da Silva FB', 'Scheucher PS', 'Simoes BP', 'Rego EM', 'Traina F']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Sao Paulo at Ribeirao Preto Medical School, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Sao Paulo at Ribeirao Preto Medical School, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Sao Paulo at Ribeirao Preto Medical School, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Sao Paulo at Ribeirao Preto Medical School, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Sao Paulo at Ribeirao Preto Medical School, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Sao Paulo at Ribeirao Preto Medical School, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Sao Paulo at Ribeirao Preto Medical School, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Sao Paulo at Ribeirao Preto Medical School, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Sao Paulo at Ribeirao Preto Medical School, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Sao Paulo at Ribeirao Preto Medical School, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Sao Paulo at Ribeirao Preto Medical School, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170928,England,Heliyon,Heliyon,101672560,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer research', 'Cell biology', 'Medicine', 'Oncology', 'Pharmaceutical science']",2017/10/17 06:00,2017/10/17 06:01,['2017/10/17 06:00'],"['2017/06/02 00:00 [received]', '2017/09/06 00:00 [revised]', '2017/09/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/17 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.heliyon.2017.e00405 [doi]', 'S2405-8440(17)31466-4 [pii]', 'e00405 [pii]']",epublish,Heliyon. 2017 Sep 28;3(9):e00405. doi: 10.1016/j.heliyon.2017.e00405. eCollection 2017 Sep.,PMC5629349,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously developed a system named bridge-induced translocation (BIT) that allows linking together two different chromosomes exploiting the strong endogenous homologous recombination system of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The BIT system generates a heterogeneous population of cells with different aneuploidies and severe aberrant phenotypes reminiscent of a cancerogenic transformation. In this work, thanks to a complex pop-out methodology of the marker used for the selection of translocants, we succeeded by BIT technology to precisely reproduce in yeast the peculiar chromosome translocation that has been associated with AML, characterized by the fusion between the human genes NUP98 and TOP2B. To shed light on the origin of the DNA fragility within NUP98, an extensive analysis of the curvature, bending, thermostability, and B-Z transition aptitude of the breakpoint region of NUP98 and of its yeast ortholog NUP145 has been performed. On this basis, a DNA cassette carrying homologous tails to the two genes was amplified by PCR and allowed the targeted fusion between NUP145 and TOP2, leading to reproduce the chimeric transcript in a diploid strain of S. cerevisiae. The resulting translocated yeast obtained through BIT appears characterized by abnormal spherical bodies of nearly 500 nm of diameter, absence of external membrane and defined cytoplasmic localization. Since Nup98 is a well-known regulator of the post-transcriptional modification of P53 target genes, and P53 mutations are occasionally reported in AML, this translocant yeast strain can be used as a model to test the constitutive expression of human P53. Although the abnormal phenotype of the translocant yeast was never rescued by its expression, an exogenous P53 was recognized to confer increased vitality to the translocants, in spite of its usual and well-documented toxicity to wild-type yeast strains. These results obtained in yeast could provide new grounds for the interpretation of past observations made in leukemic patients indicating a possible involvement of P53 in cell transformation toward AML.",,"['Tosato, Valentina', 'West, Nicole', 'Zrimec, Jan', 'Nikitin, Dmitri V', 'Del Sal, Giannino', 'Marano, Roberto', 'Breitenbach, Michael', 'Bruschi, Carlo V']","['Tosato V', 'West N', 'Zrimec J', 'Nikitin DV', 'Del Sal G', 'Marano R', 'Breitenbach M', 'Bruschi CV']","['Ulisse Biomed S.r.l., AREA Science Park, Trieste, Italy.', 'Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Primorska, Izola, Slovenia.', 'Yeast Molecular Genetics, ICGEB, AREA Science Park, Trieste, Italy.', 'Clinical Pathology, Hospital Maggiore, Trieste, Italy.', 'Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Primorska, Izola, Slovenia.', 'Biology Faculty, M.V.

Affinity-based CTC isolation methods have been proved to be efficient for CTC detection in clinical blood samples. One of the popular choices for affinity-based CTC isolation is to immobilize capture agents onto an array of microposts in microchannels, providing high CTC capture efficiency due to enhanced interactions between tumor cells and capture agents on the microposts. However, how the cells interact with microposts under different flow conditions and what kind of capture pattern results from the interactions have not been fully investigated; a full understanding of these interactions will help to design devices and choose experimental conditions for higher CTC capture effeciency. We report our study on their interaction and cell distribution patterns around microposts under different flow conditions. Human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells (CCRF-CEM) were used as target cancer cells in this study, while the Sgc8 aptamer that has specific binding with CCRF-CEM cells was employed as a capture agent. We investigated the effects of flow rates and micropost shapes on the cell capture efficiency and capture patterns on microposts. While a higher flow rate decreased cell capture efficiency, we found that the capture pattern around microposts also changed, with much more cells captured in the front half of a micropost than at the back half. We also found the ratio of cells captured on microposts to the cells captured by both microposts and channel walls increased as a function of the flow rate. We compared circular microposts with an elliptical shape and found that the geometry affected the capture distribution around microposts. In addition, we have developed a theoretical model to simulate the interactions between tumor cells and micropost surfaces, and the simulation results are in agreement with our experimental observation.",,"['Chen, Kangfu', 'Georgiev, Teodor Z', 'Sheng, Weian', 'Zheng, Xiangjun', 'Varillas, Jose I', 'Zhang, Jinling', 'Hugh Fan, Z']","['Chen K', 'Georgiev TZ', 'Sheng W', 'Zheng X', 'Varillas JI', 'Zhang J', 'Hugh Fan Z']","['Interdisciplinary Microsystems Group (IMG), Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, University of Florida, P.O.

Accordingly, we conducted a phase 1 multicenter, randomized, open-label study to evaluate decitabine pre-treatment before standard induction therapy in children with newly diagnosed AML to assess safety and tolerability and explore a number of biologic endpoints. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients were fully assessable for all study objectives per protocol (10 in Arm A = epigenetic priming induction, 14 in Arm B = standard induction). All patients experienced neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. The most common grade 3 and 4 non-hematologic adverse events observed were gastrointestinal toxicities and hypophosphatemia. Plasma decitabine PK were similar to previously reported adult data. Overall CR/CRi was similar for the two arms. MRD negativity at end-induction was 85% in Arm A versus 67% in Arm B patients. DNA methylation measured in peripheral blood over the course of treatment tracked with blast clearance and matched marrow aspirates at day 0 and day 21. Unlike end-induction marrow analyses, promoter methylation in blood identified an apparent reversal of response in the lone treatment failure, 1 week prior to the patient's marrow aspirate confirming non-response. Decitabine-induced effects on end-induction (day 35-43 following initiation of treatment) marrows in Arm A were reflected by changes in DNA methylation in matched paired marrow diagnostic aspirates. CONCLUSIONS: This first-in-pediatrics trial demonstrates that decitabine prior to standard combination chemotherapy is feasible and well tolerated in children with newly diagnosed AML. Pre-treatment with decitabine may represent a newer therapeutic option for pediatric AML, especially as it appears to induce important epigenetic alterations. The novel biological correlates studied in this trial offer a clinically relevant window into disease progression and remission. Additional studies are needed to definitively assess whether decitabine can enhance durability responses in children with AML.

AIM: To describe the clinical, histological, and therapeutic particularities of a series of pCNKTCL, pCBCL, and LC patients with pachyderma. RESULTS: In a series of pCNKTCL (n = 70), pCBCL (n = 12), and LC (n = 2) patients followed up during 9 years, 6 cases of pachyderma were observed. Pachyderma occurred on the arms (n = 2), thighs (n = 1), forehead (n = 1), and face (n = 2). The mean age of the patients was 69 years (51-82). The stages were erythrodermic (T4) mycosis fungoides (MF) (n = 1), folliculotropic MF (FMF) (n = 2), classic (T2) MF (n = 2), and chronic myeloid leukemia (n = 1). The erythrodermic MF patient with acute pachyderma on the right arm responded rapidly to oral steroids. The other cases were indolent, appeared progressively, and were highly treatment resistant.

The prognostic significance of these genetic findings is uncertain, even as singular aberrations, with nearly no data on management and outcome when they coexist. MDS evolving during the course of CML may be either treatment-associated or an independently coexisting disease, and is generally considered to have an inferior prognosis. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) directed against BCR-ABL are the mainstay of treatment for CML, whereas treatment modalities that may be utilized for MDS and CML include allogeneic stem cell transplant and - at least conceptually - hypomethylating agents. CASE REPORT Here, we describe the clinical course of such a patient, demonstrating that long-term combined treatment with dasatinib and azacitidine for coexisting CML and MDS is feasible and well tolerated, and may be capable of slowing disease progression. This combination therapy had no deleterious effect on subsequent potentially curative haploidentical bone marrow transplantation. CONCLUSIONS The different prognostic implications of this unusual case and new therapeutic options in CML are discussed, together with a review of the current literature on CML presenting with different types of genomic aberrations and the coincident development of MDS. Additionally, this case gives an example of long-term combined treatment of tyrosine kinase inhibitors and hypomethylating agents, which could be pioneering in CML treatment.",,"['Lang, Fabian', 'Wunderle, Lydia', 'Pfeifer, Heike', 'Schnittger, Susanne', 'Bug, Gesine', 'Ottmann, Oliver G']","['Lang F', 'Wunderle L', 'Pfeifer H', 'Schnittger S', 'Bug G', 'Ottmann OG']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University Hospital, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University Hospital, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University Hospital, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University Hospital, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Division of Cancer and Genetics, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff, Wales, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20171016,United States,Am J Case Rep,The American journal of case reports,101489566,IM,"['Adult', 'Azacitidine/*therapeutic use', 'Dasatinib/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', '*Stem Cell Transplantation']",,,2017/10/17 06:00,2018/01/10 06:00,['2017/10/17 06:00'],"['2017/10/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/10 06:00 [medline]']","['904956 [pii]', '10.12659/ajcr.904956 [doi]']",epublish,Am J Case Rep. 2017 Oct 16;18:1099-1109. doi: 10.12659/ajcr.904956.,PMC5652250,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods Patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in the chronic phase (CML-CP) who were being treated with low-dose imatinib (</=200 mg/day), but were resistant to this agent were enrolled in the current study (referred to as the LD-CML study). Results There subjects included 9 patients (4 men and 5 women); all were treated with dasatinib at a dose of 50 mg once daily. Among 8 patients who had not experienced major molecular response (MMR; BCR-ABL1 transcript </=0.1% according to International Scale [IS]) at study enrollment, 5 attained MMR by 12 months. In particular, 3 of 9 patients demonstrated a deep molecular response (DMR; IS </=0.0069%) by 18 months. Five patients developed lymphocytosis accompanied by cytotoxic lymphocyte predominance. There was no mortality or disease progression, and all continue to receive dasatinib therapy at 18 months with only 2 patients requiring dose reduction. Toxicities were mild-to-moderate, and pleural effusion was observed in 1 patient (grade 1). Conclusion Low-dose dasatinib can attain MMR and DMR without severe toxicity in patients with CML-CP who are unable to achieve MMR with low-dose imatinib.

Excellent treatment options are now available with drugs such as all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), arsenic trioxide (ATO), anthracyclines and cytarabine. The outcome in APL has improved tremendously in the last 50years due to better understanding of the disease, development of effective targeted agents and improvement in supportive care. Carefully selected groups of patients treated in large multi-center trials on a protocol and in experienced centers have shown survival rates in excess of 85%. However population data and other studies show that approximately 30% of patients die during induction. This is an Institutional, national and global problem and remains a pressing and frustrating challenge in APL. While most APL experts are aware of the high rate of early deaths (ED), such awareness is not typically present among general hematologists and oncologists. Our area of focus over the last 7years has been the reduction of ED in both academic and community centers; as a result we have acquired substantial experience in APL induction. Two centers have implemented population-wide prospective trials; Brazil and Georgia/South Carolina, USA with improvement in the ED rate. Both centers used standardized guidelines along with consultative support and sharing of expertise which proved effective and helped to decrease ED. Induction mortality in APL is 30% or greater. We believe ED is largely preventable and population-wide survival can be improved. An effective strategy is to utilize a set of simplified treatment guidelines coupled with support from a group of experts during induction. Treating oncologists in both academic and community hospitals should receive aggressive education about ED and be encouraged to seek advice from a core group of established APL experts. This model could be implemented nationally to improve population-wide survival in this most curable leukemia.",['Copyright (c) 2017.

IL-7 is essential for T-cell generation in the thymus and peripheral T-cell homeostasis. High IL-7 levels have been associated with impaired T-cell reconstitution, increased risk of acute GVHD and treatment-related mortality, but the underlying cellular mechanisms behind these associations have not been investigated previously. We hypothesized that increased levels of IL-7 post-transplant alters the balance between immune-regulatory T cell subsets during the post-transplant lymphocyte recovery towards a more pro-inflammatory profile. We quantified Th17 cells, Tc17 cells and Tregs in 29 children following HSCT. Th17 cell and Treg counts rose significantly from day +90 to +180 post-HSCT, and prior acute GVHD was associated with significant changes in the concentration of Tregs (9.4x10(6)/L vs. 1.3x10(6)/L, P=0.0052) and the Th17/Treg ratio (1.5 vs. 4.2, P=0.025). The plasma level of IL-7 at day +90 correlated inversely with Th17 cell counts (rs=-0.65, P=0.0002) and the proportion of Tc17 cells (rs=0.64, P=0.0005) at day +90, but not with Tregs. Furthermore, high IL-7 levels at day +7 were predictive of a less naive T-cell phenotype at day +90. These findings add further evidence that IL-7 is a key regulatory factor that may tune the balance between functionally different T-cell subsets following HSCT.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier GmbH.

Despite an increasingly recognized occurrence, no clear consensus exists regarding how best to manage the syndrome, because most cases of PRES have reported in single-case reports or small series. Aim of this paper is to identify incidence, clinical features, management, and outcome of PRES in a large series of hematology-oncology pediatric patients. METHODS: The cases of PRES occurred in twelve centers of the Italian Association of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology were reported. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-four cases of PRES in 112 pediatric patients were recorded with an incidence of 2.1% and 4.7%, respectively, in acute lymphoblastic leukemia in first complete remission and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The majority of cases occurred after a cycle of chemotherapy rather than after stem cell transplant. PRES after chemotherapy significantly differs from that after HSCT for diagnosis, time of presentation, risk factors, management, and outcome. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that PRES is a common neurological complication and occurring preferentially in course of induction treatment of some hematologic malignancies, as ALL and after HSCT. It also highlights great clinical differences in the management and outcome in patients with PRES occurring after chemotherapy or after HSCT.",['(c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

METHODS: Retrospective cohort of pediatric patients who were submitted to HSCT from 2008 to 2016. The criteria for HAI were based on those established by the National Healthcare Safety Network. Data were collected by active surveillance performed daily by professionals. This study was approved by the institutional research ethics committee. RESULTS: A total of 86 HSCTs were performed in 81 patients younger than 18 years of age (median, 10 years). Of these, 69 (85%) were males. Aplastic anemia and leukemia were the main diagnoses. A total of 140 HAIs were diagnosed with an incidence density of 28.2 infections/1000 patient-days. The most common HAI was laboratory-confirmed bloodstream infection (46), the majority of which was reported to be central venous catheter-associated (43). Gram-negative bacteria were the most prevalent microorganisms (58.5%). Almost all the infections occurred until 30 days after transplantation, and 17 deaths were observed within 180 days after the procedure.

Few patients on second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (2nd TKIs) have been reported to develop SBP. Here, we report a 45-year-old man diagnosed with CML in the chronic phase in April 2008 and immediately started on imatinib therapy. He achieved CCyR 12 months after starting imatinib therapy. Imatinib was followed by treatment with the 2nd TKIs nilotinib and dasatinib from January 2011 to yield a better response. He achieved major molecular response (MMR) during dasatinib therapy in February 2012, but did not tolerate dasatinib well; hence, he was switched to nilotinib in July 2012. In December 2015, he presented at our hospital with fever and lumbago. A complete blood count revealed a white blood cell count of 30,500/microL with 60% blasts, leading to diagnosis of SBP. After dasatinib therapy and conventional chemotherapy, he again achieved MMR. This case demonstrates that SBP may occur after achieving MMR on treatment with 2nd TKIs.

Chemorefractory disease, often characterized by deletion of chromosome 17p, has historically been associated with very poor outcomes, leading to the application of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HCT) for medically fit patients. Although the use of allo-HCT has declined since the introduction of novel targeted therapy for the treatment of CLL, there remains significant interest in understanding factors that may influence the efficacy of allo-HCT, the only known curative treatment for CLL. The potential benefit of transplantation is most likely due to the presence of alloreactive donor T cells that mediate the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect. The recognition of potentially tumor-specific antigens in the context of class I and II major histocompatibility complex on malignant B lymphocytes by donor T cells may be influenced by subtle differences in the highly polymorphic HLA locus. Given previous reports of specific HLA alleles impacting the incidence of CLL and the clinical outcomes of allo-HCT for CLL, we sought to study the overall survival and progression-free survival of a large cohort of patients with CLL who underwent allo-HCT from fully HLA-matched related and unrelated donors at Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research transplantation centers. We found no statistically significant association of allo-HCT outcomes in CLL based on previously reported HLA combinations. Additional study is needed to further define the immunologic features that portend a more favorable GVL effect after allo-HCT for CLL.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

In an initial report of RIC with fludarabine (FLU) and melphalan (MEL) with total marrow lymphoid irradiation (TMLI) in HCT for advanced hematologic malignancies in 33 patients, we found that the addition of TMLI to RIC was feasible and safe. Here we report long-term outcomes for these patients. This prospective study included 61 patients treated with TMLI to a dose of 12 Gy (1.5 Gy twice daily for 4 days), FLU (25 mg/m(2)/day for 5 days), and MEL (140 mg/m(2)/day for 1 day). Overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS), cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR), and nonrelapse mortality (NRM) were measured from the date of HCT. Survival outcomes were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Patients were categorized as low/intermediate or high/very high risk using the Disease Risk Index. The median follow-up was 7.4 years. The majority of patients had acute leukemia (72%); 49% had high/very high-risk disease. The median patient age was 55 years (range, 9-70 years). Two-year OS, EFS, CIR, and NRM were 54% (95% confidence interval [CI], 41%-66%), 49% (95% CI, 36%-61%), 21% (95% CI, 13%-35%), and 30% (95% CI, 20%-43%), respectively. Five-year OS, EFS, CIR, and NRM were 42% (95% CI, 30%-54%), 41% (95% CI, 28%-53%), 26 (95% CI, 17%-40%), and 33% (95% CI, 23%-47%, respectively). Acute (any grade) and chronic (limited or extensive) graft-versus-host disease occurred in 69% and 74% of patients, respectively. The most common toxicity was mucositis. The addition of TMLI to FLU/MEL conditioning was well tolerated, with favorable outcomes. Dosage escalation of TMLI or other modifications may be needed to improve disease control.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

We previously identified hypoalbuminemia at day +90 post-transplantation as an independent predictor of increased nonrelapse mortality (NRM) and inferior overall survival (OS) in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome who were treated with an allo-HCT. Here, we aim to confirm the prognostic significance of day +90 hypoalbuminemia in 783 patients, median age 52 years (range, 18 to 76), who received an allo-HCT for various hematologic malignancies and bone marrow failure syndromes. Multivariate analysis for NRM demonstrated a negative effect of low serum albumin levels (<3.0 versus 3.0 to 3.5 versus >3.5 g/dL) at day +90 post-transplantation (hazard ratios, 8.03 [95% CI, 3.59 to 17.97] versus 2.84 [95% CI, 1.59 to 5.08] versus reference; P < .0001). This was also the case for OS (hazard ratios, 6.86 [95% CI, 4.24 to 11.10] versus 1.52 [95% CI, 1.05 to 2.20] versus reference; P < .0001). Patients with hypoalbuminemia at day +90 post-transplantation are more likely to die from causes other than relapse, particularly infections. This large study confirms the ability of day +90 serum hypoalbuminemia to predict worse NRM and inferior OS. Presence of hypoalbuminemia at day +90 should drive a more rigorous real-time surveillance strategy considering the anticipated high-risk of NRM and poor survival in these patients. Future studies should consider incorporating day +90 serum albumin levels in prognostic models of NRM and OS.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

CARs are synthetic receptors for antigen that redirect the specificity and reprogram the function of the T cells in which they are genetically introduced. CARs targeting CD19, a cell surface molecule found in most leukemias and lymphomas, have yielded high remission rates in patients with chemorefractory, relapsed disease, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The toxicities of this treatment include B cell aplasia, cytokine release syndrome (CRS), and neurotoxicity. Although reversible in most instances, these toxicities may require specific medical interventions, including transfer to intensive care to treat severe CRS. Guidelines for managing these toxicities are emerging. The recent report of a nonhuman primate model for CRS is poised to help advance the management of this syndrome. Finally, new engineering modalities, based on the use of targeted nucleases like CRISPR, may further enhance the efficacy and safety of CAR T cells.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Schizosaccharomyces pombe contains a single homolog of EAF (SpEAF), which is not essential for survival of S. pombe in contrast to its essential higher eukaryotic homologs. The physiological role of SpEAF is not well understood. In this study, we show that S. pombe EAF is important in regulating growth of S. pombe cells during normal growth conditions. Moreover, SpEAF is also essential for survival under conditions of DNA damage, while its deletion does not affect growth under environmental stress conditions. Our in vivo structure-function studies further demonstrate that while both the amino and carboxyl terminal domains of SpEAF possess the potential to activate transcription, only the amino terminal domain of SpEAF is involved in interaction with the S. pombe ELL protein. The carboxyl-terminus of SpEAF is required for rescue of the growth defect under normal and DNA damaging conditions that is associated with the absence of SpEAF. Using bioinformatics and circular dichroism spectroscopy, we show that the carboxyl-terminus of SpEAF has a disordered conformation. Furthermore, addition of trifluoroethanol triggered its transition from a disordered to alpha-helical conformation. Taken together, the results presented here identify novel structural and functional features of SpEAF protein, providing insights into how EAF proteins may enforce transcriptional control of gene expression.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, to date, little studies investigated the role of miR-19 family in myeloid malignancies. Herein, we examined miR-19a/b expression and explored its clinical significance in de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The detection of miR-19a/b expression was performed by real-time quantitative PCR in bone marrow mononuclear cells of 113 patients and 42 healthy donors. Both miR-19a/b levels were significantly increased in AML patients in contrast to controls. Patients with miR-19a/b overexpression were more frequently occurred in female, and had an older age. Moreover, cases with miR-19a overexpression had a higher frequency of U2AF1, C-KIT and CEBPA mutations, whereas miR-19b overexpressed cases harbored U2AF1 and IDH1/2 mutations. There was no significant association of miR-19a overexpression with complete remission (CR) rate and overall survival (OS) among whole-cohort AML, non-M3 AML, and cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML). However, although miR-19b overexpression was not correlated with CR rate, patients with miR-19b overexpression presented significantly shorter OS in whole-cohort AML and a trend in non-M3 AML and CN-AML patients. Importantly, our data also showed that miR-19a/b expression level at CR phase was lower than diagnosis time, and was returned to primary level even higher when at relapse phase.

We identified 20 patients with CP-CML diagnosed between August 2013 and October 2016 who initiated 2G-TKIs and were then switched after optimal response at 3 months to IM. Second-generation TKIs initiated were DAS (n = 15), NIL (n = 3), or both sequentially due to intolerance (n = 1). One other patient initiated therapy with ponatinib on trial. Response was assessed by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) for BCR-ABL1 levels every 3 months and in patients with qRT-PCR values less than 10% at 3 months, IM was started at 400 mg/d. IM was well tolerated except in 2 patients who required dose-reduction and discontinuation due to grade 2 skin rash (1) and grade 2 anxiety (1). After initiation of IM therapy, the BCR-ABL1 qRT-PCR levels trended down as expected. At 12 months 16 (84.2%) of 19 evaluable patients showed a 3 log (major molecular remission) or better reduction in their PCR levels. In conclusion, this retrospective analysis shows that IM can be safely and effectively administered following optimal response to 2G-TKIs.

To date, 17 KIR genes have been identified including nine inhibitory genes (2DL1/L2/L3/L4/L5A/L5B, 3DL1/L2/L3), six activating genes (2DS1/S2/S3/S4/S5, 3DS1) and two pseudogenes (2DP1, 3DP1) classified into group A (KIR A) and group B (KIR B) haplotypes. The number and the nature of KIR genes vary between the individuals. In addition, these KIR genes are known to be polymorphic at allelic level (907 alleles described in July 2017). KIR genes encode for receptors which are predominantly expressed by Natural Killer (NK) cells. KIR receptors recognize HLA class I molecules and are able to kill residual recipient leukemia cells, and thus reduce the likelihood of relapse. KIR alleles of Hematopoietic Stem Cell (HSC) donor would require to be known (Alicata et al. Eur J Immunol 2016) because the KIR allele polymorphism may affect both the KIR(+) NK cell phenotype and function (Gagne et al. Eur J Immunol 2013; Bari R, et al. Sci Rep 2016) as well as HSCT outcome (Boudreau et al. JCO 2017). The introduction of the Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) has overcome current conventional DNA sequencing method limitations, known to be time consuming. Recently, a novel NGS KIR allele typing approach of all KIR genes was developed by our team in Nantes from 30 reference DNAs (Maniangou et al. Front in Immunol 2017). This NGS KIR allele typing approach is simple, fast, reliable, specific and showed a concordance rate of 95% for centromeric and telomeric KIR genes in comparison with high-resolution KIR typing obtained to those published data using exome capture (Norman PJ et al. Am J Hum Genet 2016). This NGS KIR allele typing approach may also be used in reproduction and to better study KIR(+) NK cell implication in the control of viral infections.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Although the disease can be kept under control using BCR/ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in most cases, some patients relapse or have resistant disease, so there is a need to identify new therapeutic targets in this malignancy. Recent data suggest that leukemic SCs (LSCs) in CML display the stem-cell (SC)-mobilizing cell surface enzyme dipeptidyl-peptidase IV (DPPIV = CD26) in an aberrant manner. In the present study, we analyzed the effects of the DPPIV blocker vildagliptin as single agent or in combination with the BCR/ABL1 TKI imatinib or nilotinib on growth and survival of CML LSCs in vitro and on LSC engraftment in an in vivo xenotransplantation nonobese diabetic SCID-IL-2Rgamma(-/-) (NSG) mouse model. We found that nilotinib induces apoptosis in CML LSCs and inhibits their engraftment in NSG mice. In contrast, no substantial effects were seen with imatinib or vildagliptin. Nevertheless, vildagliptin was found to reduce the ""mobilization"" of CML LSCs from a stroma cell layer consisting of mouse fibroblasts in an in vitro co-culture model, suggesting reduced disease expansion. However, although vildagliptin and nilotinib produced cooperative effects in individual experiments, overall, no significant effects of coadministered vildagliptin over nilotinib or imatinib treatment alone were seen on the engraftment of CML cells in NSG mice. Gliptins may be interesting drugs in the context of CML and nilotinib therapy, but our preclinical studies did not reveal a major cooperative effect of the drug-combination vildagliptin + nilotinib on engraftment of CML cells in NSG mice.","['Copyright (c) 2018 ISEH - Society for Hematology and Stem Cells.

Notch signaling occurs through transmembrane receptors which undergo several proteolytic cleavages that lead to the release of the Notch intracytoplasmic domain (NICD), which in turn activates the transcription of target genes. Oncogenic alterations of Notch receptors were first identified in T acute lymphoblastic leukemia and subsequently in solid tumors and other hematological malignancies. The important role of Notch signaling in cancer makes it an interesting target for drug development. Several classes of compounds targeting Notch signaling are currently in clinical development. However, the complexity of Notch signaling as well as its importance in tissue homeostasis makes the clinical development of these therapies more complex than anticipated.

METHODS: This multi-center cross-sectional study enrolled 340 pathologically confirmed adult, Chinese AL patients who were requested to complete a self-reported questionnaire, detailing demographic information, general status and physical functions, and Supportive Care Needs Survey-Short Form 34 (SCNS-SF34), revealing their unmet SCNs. The variables were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 311 (91.4%) effective questionnaires were retrieved. Among the 5 dimensions, the health information dimension scored the highest, 47.72(43.18), followed by psychological dimension, 35.00(32.50), while the sexual need scored the lowest, 0.00(24.99). As per multiple stepwise regression analysis, marital status, treatment stages and Karnofsky Performance Status index (KPS) score significantly influenced the health information dimension, while the age and ""whether the treatment was the initial one or not"" influenced sexual need dimension.

METHODS: In this study, we examined 30 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia diagnosed in our hospital from January 2015 to January 2016. The 20 control group patients had non-haematological diseases and were hospitalized for the same period. We extracted 2ml bone marrow, separated the mononuclear cells, obtained total proteins, and detected STAT3 protein levels with Western blot analyses. The THP-1 cells were treated with different concentrations of ART(0, 10, 25, 50, 100, 200muM). Then, THP-1 cell viability was detected with CCK-8 assays, apoptosis was measured with flow cytometry, and the STAT3, caspase-3 and caspase-8 protein levels were assessed using Western blot analyses. THP-1 cells in logarithmic growth phase were subcutaneously injected into the necks of 5-week-old nude mice. The control group was subcutaneously injected with 0.1ml PBS. After the nude mouse tumours grew, the mice were divided into the control group and drug intervention groups (ART 100muM group, ART 200muM group). The mice in the intervention groups were intraperitoneally injected with ART, and the control group was injected with the same amount of normal saline. Then, changes in the tumours were observed. After the drug intervention, the total protein was extracted, and STAT3 expression was detected by Western blot analysis. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the AML patients had significantly increased STAT3 protein levels (P<0.01). ART significantly inhibited the proliferation of THP-1 cells in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. ART also increased THP-1cell apoptosis. After treatment with ART, STAT3 protein was significantly down-regulated, and apoptosis of the cells was induced by the activation of caspase-3 and caspse-8. CONCLUSION: AML patients had higher expression of STAT3 than that of the controls. ART induced apoptosis in THP-1 cells and inhibited the growth of xenografts in nude mice, and we also observed that ART down-regulated the expression of STAT3 and activated the caspase-3 and caspase-8. We speculated that the effect of ART on THP-1 cells may be related to inhibition of STAT3 and activation of caspase3 and caspase-8.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The emetogenicity of high-dose methotrexate in children and adolescents with cancer is incompletely characterized. At our institution, a number of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have received aprepitant with courses of high-dose methotrexate after poor CINV control with prior courses. PROCEDURE: We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis on patients with ALL who received methotrexate 5 g/m(2) /dose with and without concomitant aprepitant at Texas. Children's Hospital between October 1, 2010 and January 31, 2016. RESULTS: We identified 16 patients who received a total of 69 courses of methotrexate. An enhanced antiemetic regimen containing aprepitant was administered with 42 methotrexate courses and resulted in a 54% reduction in the use of as-needed antiemetics (P = 0.002, 95% CI: 21-89%). There were no statistically significant differences in methotrexate area under the curve values (2,209 muMhr/l +/- 151 vs. 2,051 muMhr/l +/- 94, P = 0.355) or end-infusion methotrexate concentrations (80.5 muM +/- 5.6 vs. 74.7 muM +/- 3.2, P = 0.335) in patients receiving a standard versus an enhanced antiemetic regimen. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of aprepitant reduces both CINV and the use of rescue antiemetics. Aprepitant does not appear to affect the pharmacokinetics of methotrexate. Granisetron was prescribed more frequently than ondansetron, but selection of secondary and tertiary agents, if any, was highly variable.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Felix-Ukwu, Femi', 'Reichert, Kate', 'Bernhardt, M Brooke', 'Schafer, Eric S', 'Berger, Amanda']","['Felix-Ukwu F', 'Reichert K', 'Bernhardt MB', 'Schafer ES', 'Berger A']","[""Department of Pharmacy, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, Texas."", ""Department of Pharmacy, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, Texas."", ""Department of Pharmacy, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, Texas."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', ""Department of Pharmacy, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, Texas.""]",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",20171014,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antiemetics/*administration & dosage', 'Aprepitant', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Morpholines/*administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Vomiting/chemically induced/drug therapy']",['NOTNLM'],"['ALL', 'aprepitant', 'methotrexate', 'nausea', 'vomiting']",2017/10/17 06:00,2017/12/28 06:00,['2017/10/15 06:00'],"['2017/07/18 00:00 [received]', '2017/09/21 00:00 [revised]', '2017/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/28 06:00 [medline]', '2017/10/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.26857 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2018 Feb;65(2). doi: 10.1002/pbc.26857.

Our results indicate that the profiles of CML HSCs and HPCs were closer to that of normal progenitors, whereas normal HSCs showed the most different expression profile of all. We found that the expression profiles of HSCs and HPCs from CML marrow were closer to each other than those of HSCs and HPCs from normal marrow. The major biologic processes dysregulated in CML cells included DNA repair, cell cycle, chromosome condensation, cell adhesion, and the immune response. We also determined the genomic changes in both normal and CML progenitor cells under culture conditions, and found that several genes involved in cell cycle, steroid biosynthesis, and chromosome segregation were upregulated, whereas genes involved in transcription regulation and apoptosis were downregulated. Interestingly, these changes were the same, regardless of the addition of Imatinib (IM) to the culture.

Leukemias harbor a subpopulation of G0 cells that can be enriched by growth factor deprivation or serum starvation. Target site reporters with shortened poly(A) tails show translation activation by microRNAs, via a noncanonical mechanism, when introduced into the nucleus of G0 cells. This is because recruitment by the activation causing FXR1a-microRNA-protein complex (FXR1a-microRNP) is nuclear and requires shortened poly(A) tails to avoid repressive factors and canonical translation. When introduced into the cytoplasm, target mRNAs and microRNAs are directed toward repression rather than translation activation.

The role played by the immune system in this leukaemic sub-clonal hierarchy and maintenance remains unknown. As leukaemic sub-clone immunogenicity could not be evaluated in human AML xenograft models, we assessed the sub-clonal diversity of the murine C1498 AML cell line and the immunogenicity of its sub-clones in immune-competent syngeneic mice. METHODOLOGY: The murine C1498 cell line was cultured in vitro and sub-clonal cells were generated after limiting dilution. The genomic profiles of 6 different sub-clones were analysed by comparative genomic hybridization arrays (CGH). The sub-clones were then injected into immune-deficient and - competent syngeneic mice. The immunogenicities of the sub-clones was evaluated through 1) assessment of mouse survival, 2) determination of leukaemic cell infiltration into organs by flow cytometry and the expression of a fluorescent reporter gene, 3) assessment of the CTL response ex vivo and 4) detection of residual leukaemic cells in the organs via amplification of the genomic reporter gene by real-time PCR (qPCR). RESULTS: Genomic analyses revealed heterogeneity among the parental cell line and its derived sub-clones. When injected individually into immune-deficient mice, all sub-clones induced cases of AML with different kinetics. However, when administered into immune-competent animals, some sub-clones triggered AML in which no mice survived, whereas others elicited reduced lethality rates. The AML-surviving mice presented efficient anti-leukaemia CTL activity ex vivo and eliminated the leukaemic cells in vivo. CONCLUSION: We showed that C1498 cell sub-clones presented genomic heterogeneity and differential immunogenicity resulting either in immune escape or elimination. Such findings could have potent implications for new immunotherapeutic strategies in patients with AML.","['Copyright (c) 2017 European Federation of Immunological Societies.

The biodegradation of DBSA-NPs loaded with doxorubicin (Dox-DBSA-NPs) in the presence of trypsin enzyme was spectrophotometrically monitored directly based on doxorubicin release profile. The release profile was analyzed with different kinetic models and it was best fitted with Higuchi kinetics model.

Preclinical data have suggested synergy in vitro between cytarabine and imatinib mesylate (IM) on AML cell growth inhibition. After demonstrating the safety and feasibility in a phase I study, we conducted a phase II clinical study of CLAG (cladribine, cytarabine, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) regimen combined with IM for patients with RR-AML. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a single-institution 2-stage phase II study. The primary endpoint was the remission rate measured using the standard AML response criteria. The secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: From August 2009 to April 2011, 38 patients were treated at the Moffitt Cancer Center. Their median age was 62 years (range, 26-79 years). Of the 38 patients, 7 (18%) had refractory AML, 19 (50%) had early relapse, and 12 (32%) had late relapse. At the original diagnosis, only 2 patients had favorable risk factors, 18 had intermediate risk, and 16 had poor risk; for 2 patients, the karyotype was missing. The overall response rate for all 38 evaluable patients was 37%. The median OS was 11.1 months (95% CI, 4.8-13.4 months), the median PFS was 4.9 months (95% CI, 1.6-11.7 months). Among the responders, 8 of 14 patients subsequently underwent allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. CONCLUSION: CLAG plus IM was well tolerated, with encouraging signs of activity in patients with poor-risk AML.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Despite the majority of patients with B-ALL have fairly good response to conventional chemotherapeutic interventions followed by hematopoietic stem cell transplant for the last decades, a subpopulation of patients show chemo-resistance and a high relapse rate. Adult B-ALL exhibits similar clinical course but worse prognosis in comparison to younger individuals. Ample evidences have shown that the clinical behavior, response rate and clinical outcome of B-ALL rely largely on its genetic and molecular profiles, such as the presence of BCR-ABL1 fusion gene which is an independent negative prognostic predictor. New B-ALL subtypes have been recognized with recurrent genetic abnormalities, including B-ALL with intrachromosomal amplification of chromosome 21 (iAMP21), B-ALL with translocations involving tyrosine kinases or cytokine receptors (""BCR-ABL1-like ALL""). Genome-wide genetic profiling studies on B-ALL have extended our understanding of genomic landscape of B-ALL, and genetic mutations involved in various key pathways have been illustrated. These include CRLF2 and PAX5 alterations, TP53, CREBBP and ERG mutations, characteristic genetic aberrations in BCR-ABL1-like B-ALL and others.

However, clinical significance of RAS expressions in AML remains poorly determined. To explore the clinical significance, we analyzed KRAS and NRAS expressions in 143 de novo AML patients by real-time quantitative PCR. KRAS and NRAS expressions were significantly up-regulated in AML patients. KRAS and NRAS mutations were identified in 4% (6/143) and 8% (12/143) of these patients, respectively. However, no significant association was observed between RAS mutations and expressions. High KRAS expression was associated with older age, higher white blood cells, and a tendency of higher platelets, whereas high NRAS expression was only correlated with older age. Complete remission (CR) rate and overall survival of AML patients were adversely affected by KRAS overexpression, but not NRAS overexpression. Multivariate analysis revealed that KRAS acted as an independent prognostic predictor in cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML). Moreover, the prognostic value of KRAS expression was validated using the published data from Gene Expression Omnibus datasets. In the follow-up patients, KRAS expression rather than NRAS expression in CR time tended to decrease compared to newly diagnosis time, and both KRAS and NRAS expressions were significantly increased when in relapse time.

The erythropoietin receptor (EPOR), usually associated with erythroid progenitor cells, is highly expressed in ETV6/RUNX1 positive cases compared to other B-lineage ALL subtypes. Gene expression analysis of a microarray database and direct quantitative analysis of patient samples revealed strong correlation between EPOR and GATA2 expression in ALL, and higher expression of GATA2 in t(12;21) patients. The mechanism of EPOR regulation was mainly investigated using two B-ALL cell lines: REH, which harbor and express the ETV6/RUNX1 fusion gene; and NALM-6, which do not. Expression of EPOR was increased in REH cells compared to NALM-6 cells. Moreover, of the six GATA family members only GATA2 was differentially expressed with substantially higher levels present in REH cells. GATA2 was shown to bind to the EPOR 5'-UTR in REH, but did not bind in NALM-6 cells. Overexpression of GATA2 led to an increase in EPOR expression in REH cells only, indicating that GATA2 regulates EPOR but is dependent on the cellular context. Both EPOR and GATA2 are hypomethylated and associated with increased mRNA expression in REH compared to NALM-6 cells. Decitabine treatment effectively reduced methylation of CpG sites in the GATA2 promoter leading to increased GATA2 expression in both cell lines. Although Decitabine also reduced an already low level of methylation of the EPOR in NALM-6 cells there was no increase in EPOR expression. Furthermore, EPOR and GATA2 are regulated post-transcriptionally by miR-362 and miR-650, respectively. Overall our data show that EPOR expression in t(12;21) B-ALL cells, is regulated by GATA2 and is mediated through epigenetic, transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms, contingent upon the genetic subtype of the disease.",,"['Gaine, Marie E', 'Sharpe, Daniel J', 'Smith, James S', 'Colyer, Hilary A A', 'Hodges, Vivien M', 'Lappin, Terry R', 'Mills, Ken I']","['Gaine ME', 'Sharpe DJ', 'Smith JS', 'Colyer HAA', 'Hodges VM', 'Lappin TR', 'Mills KI']","[""Centre for Cancer Research and Cell Biology, Queen's University Belfast, Belfast BT9 7BL, United Kingdom."", 'Current/Present address: Department of Molecular Physiology and Biophysics, University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine, Iowa City, IA 52242, USA.', ""Centre for Cancer Research and Cell Biology, Queen's University Belfast, Belfast BT9 7BL, United Kingdom."", ""Centre for Cancer Research and Cell Biology, Queen's University Belfast, Belfast BT9 7BL, United Kingdom."", ""Centre for Cancer Research and Cell Biology, Queen's University Belfast, Belfast BT9 7BL, United Kingdom."", ""Centre for Cancer Research and Cell Biology, Queen's University Belfast, Belfast BT9 7BL, United Kingdom."", ""Centre for Cancer Research and Cell Biology, Queen's University Belfast, Belfast BT9 7BL, United Kingdom."", ""Centre for Cancer Research and Cell Biology, Queen's University Belfast, Belfast BT9 7BL, United Kingdom.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170802,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,,['NOTNLM'],"['EPOR', 'GATA2', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'epigenetic', 'transcriptional regulation']",2017/10/17 06:00,2017/10/17 06:01,['2017/10/15 06:00'],"['2017/04/11 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/17 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.19792 [doi]', '19792 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Aug 2;8(39):66061-66074. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.19792. eCollection 2017 Sep 12.,PMC5630392,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Ten three-month-old male SAMP8 mice (prone to aging) were randomly assigned to two experimental dietary groups: one untreated group and one RESV treatment group (n=20 eyes for each group). After 30 days of treatment, mice were exposed to intense bright light. Ten male SAMR1 mice (resistant to aging) served as control (n=20 eyes). The protective effects of RESV administration on light-induced retinal degeneration in SAMP8 strain as well as the effect of bright light damage in the retinas of SAMP8 mice were analyzed by electroretinography (ERG), retinal histology, mRNA, protein and lipid profile. RESULTS: 68%-85% of a-wave amplitude and 72%-92% of b-wave amplitude were persevered by RESV in SAMP8 mice that were exposed to light damage. Also, RESV preserved their photoreceptor nuclei. mRNA expression of neuroprotective factors leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), oncostatin M (OSM), cardiotrophin 1(CT-1) and cardiotrophin-like cytokine (CLC) were up-regulated 28, 8, 7, 5 and 9-fold in SAMP8 mice after RESV treatment. In addition, RESV could suppress the NF-kappaB pathway by down-regulating the expression of pIkappaB. Light damage led to increase of saturated FA, monoenoic FA, n6 PUFA and n6/n3 ratio and decrease of Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). There was no significant difference on DHA and the ratio of n6/n3-FA between the untreated and RESV treated SAMP8 mice.

Hence, global levels of 5-methylcytosine (5-mCyt), 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmCyt), 5-carboxylcytosine (5-CaCyt) and 5-hydroxymethyluracil were tested in purified B cells from CLL patients (n = 55) and controls (n = 17). The DNA methylation 'writers' (DNA methyltransferases [DNMT1/3A/3B]), 'readers' (methyl-CpG-binding domain [MBD2/4]), 'editors' (ten-eleven translocation [TET1/2/3]) and 'modulators' (SAT1) were also evaluated. Accordingly, patients were stratified into three subgroups. First, a subgroup with a global deficit in cytosine derivatives characterized by hyperlymphocytosis, reduced median progression free survival (PFS = 52 months) and shorter treatment free survival (TFS = 112 months) was identified. In this subgroup, major epigenetic modifications were highlighted including a reduction of 5-mCyt, 5-hmCyt, 5-CaCyt associated with DNMT3A, MBD2/4 and TET1/2 downregulation. Second, the cytosine derivative analysis revealed a subgroup with a partial deficit (PFS = 84, TFS = 120 months), mainly affecting DNA demethylation (5-hmCyt reduction, SAT1 induction).

Previously, we showed that the PHB1 and PHB2 protein complex is required for mitochondrial homeostasis and survival of normal human lymphocytes. In this study, novel evidence is provided that indicates mitochondrial prohibitins are overexpressed in hematologic tumor cells and promote cell survival under conditions of oxidative stress. Immunofluorescent confocal microscopy revealed both proteins to be primarily confined to mitochondria in primary patient lymphoid and myeloid tumor cells and tumor cell lines, including Kit225 cells. Subsequently, siRNA-mediated knockdown of PHB1 and PHB2 in Kit225 cells significantly enhanced sensitivity to H2O2-induced cell death, suggesting a protective or anti-apoptotic function in hematologic malignancies. Indeed, PHB1 and PHB2 protein levels were significantly higher in tumor cells isolated from leukemia and lymphoma patients compared to PBMCs from healthy donors.

At present, the research found that the pathogenesis of AML is related to many factors, such as recurrent somatic mutations and gene expression and epigenetic changes, however, the molecular mechanism of AML is still unclear. Long non-coding RNA MEG3 is a newly found tumor suppressor and plays a very important role in the regulation of a variety of tumor formation and progression. Studies found that the MEG3 expression was significantly decreased in AML. However, to date, it is not clear the cause of its abnormal expression. Therefore, the molecular mechanism of AML is urgently needed to study the molecular mechanism of AML. METHODS: The different expression level of MEG3, TET2, miR-22-3p, miR-22-5p in AML was detected by real-time quantification PCR. MEG3, TET2, miR-22-3p, miR-22-3p expression cell pools in K562 cells was used to interfering and TET2, MEG3 TET2, relations with miR-22-3p, miR-22-5p. The effect of AML cell on proliferation was evaluated by TET2 lower expression. RESULTS: 1. The lower expression of MEG3 and TET2 in AML cell lines was detected by RT-qPCR. 2. The stable MEG3, TET2 overexpression cell pools in K562 cells was successful established. 3. After transfection, MTT assay revealed that cell growth was significantly increased in AML cell lines transfected with TET2 compared with controls.

In this study, we investigate the mechanism of F/P in collaboration with IL-5 in CEL. The results showed that Lyn, a key effector in the IL-5-motivated eosinophil production, is extensively activated in F/P-positive CEL cells. Lyn can associate and phosphorylate IL-5 receptor alpha (IL-5RA) in F/P-positive cells. Moreover, the activation of Lyn and IL-5R kinase were strengthened when the cells were stimulated by IL-5. Lyn inhibition in F/P-positive CEL cells attenuated cellular proliferation, induced apoptosis, and blocked cell migration and major basic protein (MBP) release. We identified the FIP1L1-PDGFRA/JAK2/Lyn/Akt complex in the F/P-expressing cells which can be disrupted by dual inhibition of JAK2 and Lyn, repressing cell proliferation in both EOL-1(F/P-positive human eosinophilic cell line) and imatinib-resistance (IR) cells.

Characterization of the synthesized compounds was done by mass, NMR and IR spectroscopy as well as elemental analysis. Among the synthesized molecules, (2S)-5-oxo-2-[(nitrobenzene-4-yl sulfonyl) amino]-5-(pentylamino) pentanoic acid (Cpd 11) was found as a lead and potent inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2). Molecular modeling and enzyme inhibition studies were done to confirm the interaction or inhibitory potential of this compound. Thereafter, the biological screening was done through cytotoxicity, anti-invasion and apoptosis-related assays. Docking analysis revealed that Cpd 11 interacted with the target molecule MMP-2 and with MMP-9. However, enzyme inhibition assay showed 3-fold MMP-2 inhibition compared to MMP-9. Cytotoxicity assay showed the inhibitory potential of Cpd 11 against K562 cell line having IC50 value of 17.9 +/- 0.01 muM after 48 h of incubation. The cell death was apoptotic in nature as revealed from the annexin V and sub-G1 cell cycle arrest assay. Besides this, Cpd 11 also exhibited dose dependent anti-invasive activity into K562 cell line. On the other hand, flow cytometry and western blot data revealed Cpd 11 induced downregulation of MMP-2 in K562 cell line after 48 h of incubation that might be linked with the anti-invasive and apoptotic activity furthermore. Therefore, the overall results validated each method and make this molecule as a potent MMP-2 inhibitor that blocked the invasion and could bring apoptosis at later stages in K562 cells sparing the normal ones.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

With new promising therapies, survival may improve for severe aGVHD. OBJECTIVES: We wanted to analyze the long-term outcome in patients who survive severe aGVHD. METHODS: This study was a landmark analysis of 23 567 patients with acute Leukaemia who survived for more than 6 months after HSCT, 2002-2014. Patients alive after severe aGVHD (n = 1738) were compared to controls. RESULTS: Patients with severe aGVHD had higher non-relapse mortality (NRM) and higher rate of extensive chronic GVHD (cGVHD) than the controls (P < 10(-5) ). The probability of relapse was significantly lower in the severe aGVHD group, but Leukaemia-free survival (LFS) and overall survival were significantly lower than for the controls (P < 10(-5) ). Five-year LFS in patients with severe aGVHD was 49%, as opposed to 61% in controls with no or mild GVHD and 59% in patients with moderate GVHD. CONCLUSIONS: HSCT patients who survive severe aGVHD have higher risk of developing extensive cGVHD, a higher NRM, a lower relapse probability, and lower LFS than other HSCT patients.

We report a patient with CML who developed acute onset of DPN associated with dasatinib therapy. A 46-year-old Japanese woman was treated with dasatinib for 7 months after the diagnosis of CML and she achieved a major molecular response (MMR). However, dysphagia, hoarseness, and muscle weakness progressively developed over 2 weeks. Nerve conduction studies revealed extensive demyelinating changes. Dasatinib was discontinued and the patient received intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), resulting in resolution of the symptoms. However, 1 month after the re-initiation of dasatinib therapy, muscle weakness developed again, indicating possible involvement of dasatinib in the development of DPN. She was then treated with IVIg, followed by prednisolone and nilotinib instead of dasatinib. These treatments eventually led to improvements of the symptoms and helped her achieve an MMR. This case suggests that dasatinib may carry risks of DPN possibly through immune-mediated disorders.

Moreover, the overall cost of treatment of CML is high and the medical economic burden of patients with CML on the government is heavy. This study tested the cost effectiveness of imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib as first-line treatment in Chinese patients who were first diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia in the chronic phase (CML-CP). METHODS: A state-transition Markov model combining clinical effectiveness, utility, and cost data was used. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to determine the robustness of the model outcomes. RESULTS: The imatinib-first, dasatinib-first, and nilotinib-first strategy offered patients 9.76, 9.87, and 9.72 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) at a cost of US$303,502.42, US$381,681.03, and US$305,509.92 over 20 years, respectively. The nilotinib-first strategy exhibited the lowest utility and highest price and was thus eliminated. An incremental cost-effectiveness analysis of the imatinib-first strategy and the dasatinib-first strategy showed that the dasatinib-first strategy yielded an incremental cost-utility ratio (ICER) of 710,714.64 $/QALY compared with the imatinib-first strategy, which exceeded the threshold; hence, the dasatinib-first strategy was not cost effective and was eliminated. The results were robust for multiple sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION: From the perspective of the Chinese medical system, imatinib is likely to be more cost effective than dasatinib and nilotinib for patients who were first diagnosed with CML-CP.",,"['Li, Na', 'Zheng, Bin', 'Cai, Hong-Fu', 'Yang, Jing', 'Luo, Xiao-Feng', 'Weng, Li-Zhu', 'Zhan, Feng-Mei', 'Liu, Mao-Bai']","['Li N', 'Zheng B', 'Cai HF', 'Yang J', 'Luo XF', 'Weng LZ', 'Zhan FM', 'Liu MB']","['Department of Pharmacy, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, No. 29 Xinquan Road, Fuzhou, 350001, Fujian, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, No. 29 Xinquan Road, Fuzhou, 350001, Fujian, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, No. 29 Xinquan Road, Fuzhou, 350001, Fujian, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, No. 29 Xinquan Road, Fuzhou, 350001, Fujian, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, Fujian, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, Fujian, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, Fujian, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, No. 29 Xinquan Road, Fuzhou, 350001, Fujian, China. liumaobai@163.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,New Zealand,Clin Drug Investig,Clinical drug investigation,9504817,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/economics/therapeutic use', 'China', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Dasatinib/economics/*therapeutic use', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/economics/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/economics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/economics/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/economics/*therapeutic use', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2017/10/14 06:00,2018/06/21 06:00,['2017/10/14 06:00'],"['2017/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/21 06:00 [medline]', '2017/10/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s40261-017-0587-z [doi]', '10.1007/s40261-017-0587-z [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Drug Investig. 2018 Jan;38(1):79-86. doi: 10.1007/s40261-017-0587-z.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']","['2014-ZQN-JC-15/Fujian Provincial Health and Family Planning Commission', '2015-CX-R4/Fujian Provincial Health and Family Planning Commission', '2014C042/Fujian Provincial Planning Office of Social Sciences']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A decision analytical model was developed with inputs from a 7-year retrospective study (2009-2016) of 103 consecutive adult patients with ALL who received antifungal prophylaxis. Information on the administration of antifungal agents, clinical outcomes, and costs were collected. One-way sensitivity analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were performed. The mould-active triazoles group was associated with higher life-years (3.71 vs 3.59) and lower total costs (US$4886 vs US$5722) per patient compared with fluconazole. One-way sensitivity analyses revealed that varying all of the key variables in the model did not affect the robustness of the results. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that mould-active triazoles had a probability of 77.1 and 90.1% of providing a dominant and cost-effective option relative to fluconazole, respectively. Mould-active triazoles should be regarded as preferable to fluconazole as the first-line prophylactic for adult patients with ALL accompanied by uncommon severe vinca alkaloid-induced neurotoxicity.

RECENT FINDINGS: There is no ""one-fits-all"" approach to MRD testing in AML. Most exploited to date are methods relying on immunophenotypic aberrancies (identified via multiparameter flow cytometry) or genetic abnormalities (identified via PCR-based assays). Current methods have important shortcomings, including the lack of assay platform standardization/harmonization across laboratories. In parallel to refinements of existing technologies and data analysis/interpretation, new methodologies (e.g., next-generation sequencing-based assays) are emerging that eventually may complement or replace existing ones. This dynamic evolution of MRD testing has complicated comparisons between individual studies. Nonetheless, an ever-growing body of data demonstrates that a positive MRD test at various time points throughout chemotherapy and hematopoietic cell transplantation identifies patients at particularly high risks of disease recurrence and short survival even after adjustment for other risk factors.",,"['Buccisano, Francesco', 'Hourigan, Christopher S', 'Walter, Roland B']","['Buccisano F', 'Hourigan CS', 'Walter RB']","['Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, Hematology, University Tor Vergata, Via Montpellier 1, 00133, Rome, Italy. francesco.buccisano@uniroma2.it.', 'Myeloid Malignancies Section, Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Department of Epidemiology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",,United States,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,Current hematologic malignancy reports,101262565,IM,"['Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/mortality', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*etiology', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Flow cytometry', '*Minimal residual disease', '*Next-generation sequencing', '*Polymerase chain reaction', '*Prognostication']",2017/10/14 06:00,2018/07/10 06:00,['2017/10/14 06:00'],"['2017/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/10 06:00 [medline]', '2017/10/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11899-017-0420-z [doi]', '10.1007/s11899-017-0420-z [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Hematol Malig Rep. 2017 Dec;12(6):547-556. doi: 10.1007/s11899-017-0420-z.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, its prognostic significance at the time of diagnosis in the setting of new tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) is less well understood. Patients with CML in CP with or without ACA at diagnosis treated with frontline TKIs in prospective clinical trials were analyzed for outcomes. Among 603 patients treated, 29 (5%) had ACA. Patients with ACA included 2 of 72 (2.8%) treated with imatinib 400 mg, 9 of 207 (4.3%) with imatinib 800 mg, 10 of 148 (6.7%) with dasatinib, 6 of 126 (4.7%) with nilotinib, and 2 of 50 (4%) with ponatinib. There was a significantly higher rate of complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) at 6 months in patients without ACA (P = .02). However cumulative CCyR and major molecular response (MMR) rates were not different. Similarly, MR4.0 and MR4.5 rates were similar for both groups; two CML-ACA patients maintained MR 4.5 for at least 2 years. At 5 years, ACA at diagnosis did not significantly impact transformation-free, failure-free, event-free, or overall survival expectations. Acknowledging small sample size estimates, response rates and survival outcomes were comparable in CP with ACA irrespective of whether chromosomal abnormalities were ""major route"" or other. The presence of ACA at diagnosis does not confer worse prognosis for patients with CML treated with TKI. Thus, the presence of ACA at diagnosis should not alter treatment strategies in these patients.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Alhuraiji, Ahmad', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Boddu, Prajwal', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'DiNardo, Courtney', 'Daver, Naval', 'Kadia, Tapan', 'Pemmaraju, Naveen', 'Pierce, Sherry', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Wierda, William', 'Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Jabbour, Elias', 'Cortes, Jorge']","['Alhuraiji A', 'Kantarjian H', 'Boddu P', 'Ravandi F', 'Borthakur G', 'DiNardo C', 'Daver N', 'Kadia T', 'Pemmaraju N', 'Pierce S', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Wierda W', 'Verstovsek S', 'Jabbour E', 'Cortes J']","['Department of Hematology, Kuwait Cancer Control Center, Shuwaikh city, Kuwait.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20171109,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,2017/10/14 06:00,2017/12/19 06:00,['2017/10/14 06:00'],"['2017/10/01 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/06 00:00 [revised]', '2017/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/19 06:00 [medline]', '2017/10/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.24943 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2018 Jan;93(1):84-90. doi: 10.1002/ajh.24943.

In our study we predicted the burden of cancer in Catalonia from 2015 to 2025. METHODS: Bayesian age-period-cohort models were used to predict the burden of cancer from 2015 to 2025 using incidence data from the Girona and Tarragona cancer registries and cancer mortality data from the Catalan mortality registry. Using the Bashir-Esteve method, we divided the net change in the number of cases between 2015 and 2025 into changes due to population size (S), cancer risk (R) and age (A) distribution. RESULTS: By 2025, there will be 21,743 new cancer cases in men (40% aged > 74 years) and 17,268 in women (37% aged > 74 years). More than 40% of the new cases will be diagnosed among population aged 74 and older in prostate, colorectal, lung, bladder, pancreatic and stomach cancers in men, and in colorectal, pancreatic and bladder cancers and leukaemia in women. During 2015-2025, the number of new diagnoses will increase by 5.5% in men (A + R + S = 18.1% - 13.3% + 0.7% = 5.5%) and 11.9% in women (A + R + S = 12.4% - 1.1% + 0.6% = 11.9%). Overall cancer mortality rates will continue to decrease during 2015-2025. Lung cancer will be the most lethal cancer among men (N = 2705) and women (N = 1174). CONCLUSIONS: The increase in the number of cancer cases in Catalonia from 2015 to 2025 will mostly affect the elderly, prompting the need for increased collaboration between geriatricians and oncologists.",,"['Cleries, R', 'Ameijide, A', 'Marcos-Gragera, R', 'Pareja, L', 'Carulla, M', 'Vilardell, M-L', 'Esteban, L', 'Buxo, M', 'Espinas, J-A', 'Puigdefabregas, A', 'Ribes, J', 'Izquierdo, A', 'Galceran, J', 'Borras, J M']","['Cleries R', 'Ameijide A', 'Marcos-Gragera R', 'Pareja L', 'Carulla M', 'Vilardell ML', 'Esteban L', 'Buxo M', 'Espinas JA', 'Puigdefabregas A', 'Ribes J', 'Izquierdo A', 'Galceran J', 'Borras JM']","[""Pla Director d'Oncologia (GENCAT), IDIBELL, Hospital Duran i Reynals, Gran Via 199-203 1 feminine planta, L'Hospitalet de Llobregat, 08908, Barcelona, Spain. r.cleries@iconcologia.net."", ""Departament de Ciencies Cliniques, Universitat de Barcelona, Campus de Bellvitge, L'Hospitalet de Llobregat, Barcelona, Spain. r.cleries@iconcologia.net."", 'Registre de Cancer de Tarragona, Fundacio Lliga per a la Investigacio i Prevencio del Cancer (FUNCA)-IISPV, Reus, Tarragona, Spain.', ""Unitat d'Epidemiologia i Registre del Cancer de Girona (UERGG), Institut d'Investigacio Biomedica Girona Josep Trueta (IDIBGI), Girona, Spain."", ""Institut Catala d'Oncologia (ICO), Girona, Spain."", ""Departament d'Infermeria, Universitat de Girona (UdG), Girona, Spain."", ""Pla Director d'Oncologia (GENCAT), IDIBELL, Hospital Duran i Reynals, Gran Via 199-203 1 feminine planta, L'Hospitalet de Llobregat, 08908, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Registre de Cancer de Tarragona, Fundacio Lliga per a la Investigacio i Prevencio del Cancer (FUNCA)-IISPV, Reus, Tarragona, Spain.', ""Unitat d'Epidemiologia i Registre del Cancer de Girona (UERGG), Institut d'Investigacio Biomedica Girona Josep Trueta (IDIBGI), Girona, Spain."", ""Institut Catala d'Oncologia (ICO), Girona, Spain."", ""Pla Director d'Oncologia (GENCAT), IDIBELL, Hospital Duran i Reynals, Gran Via 199-203 1 feminine planta, L'Hospitalet de Llobregat, 08908, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Institut d'Investigacio Biomedica de Girona, IDIBGI, C/Dr.Castany s/n, Edifici M2, Parc Hospitalari Marti i Julia, 17190, Salt, Spain."", ""Pla Director d'Oncologia (GENCAT), IDIBELL, Hospital Duran i Reynals, Gran Via 199-203 1 feminine planta, L'Hospitalet de Llobregat, 08908, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Registre de Mortalitat, Direccio General de Planificacio en Salut, Departament de Salut, Generalitat de Catalunya, Travessera de les Corts, 131-159, 08028, Barcelona, Spain.', ""Pla Director d'Oncologia (GENCAT), IDIBELL, Hospital Duran i Reynals, Gran Via 199-203 1 feminine planta, L'Hospitalet de Llobregat, 08908, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Departament de Ciencies Cliniques, Universitat de Barcelona, Campus de Bellvitge, L'Hospitalet de Llobregat, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Unitat d'Epidemiologia i Registre del Cancer de Girona (UERGG), Institut d'Investigacio Biomedica Girona Josep Trueta (IDIBGI), Girona, Spain."", ""Institut Catala d'Oncologia (ICO), Girona, Spain."", ""Departament d'Oncologia Medica, Institut Catala d'Oncologia, Hospital Universitari Doctor Josep Trueta, Girona, Spain."", 'Registre de Cancer de Tarragona, Fundacio Lliga per a la Investigacio i Prevencio del Cancer (FUNCA)-IISPV, Reus, Tarragona, Spain.', 'Departament de Medicina i Cirurgia, Universitat Rovira i Virgili, Reus, Tarragona, Spain.', ""Pla Director d'Oncologia (GENCAT), IDIBELL, Hospital Duran i Reynals, Gran Via 199-203 1 feminine planta, L'Hospitalet de Llobregat, 08908, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Departament de Ciencies Cliniques, Universitat de Barcelona, Campus de Bellvitge, L'Hospitalet de Llobregat, Barcelona, Spain.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20171012,Italy,Clin Transl Oncol,Clinical & translational oncology : official publication of the Federation of Spanish Oncology Societies and of the National Cancer Institute of Mexico,101247119,IM,"['Age Distribution', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Cost of Illness', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Medical Oncology/*trends', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Sex Distribution', 'Spain/epidemiology']",['NOTNLM'],"['Ageing', 'Burden', 'Cancer', 'Incidence', 'Mortality', 'Projections']",2017/10/14 06:00,2018/09/08 06:00,['2017/10/14 06:00'],"['2017/07/17 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/08 06:00 [medline]', '2017/10/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12094-017-1764-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s12094-017-1764-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Transl Oncol. 2018 May;20(5):647-657. doi: 10.1007/s12094-017-1764-5.

To clarify the impact of genetic mutations on clinical outcomes of AYAs with AML, we analyzed data from the JPLSG AML-05 and JALSG AML201 studies. AYAs aged 15-39 years (n = 103) were included. FLT3-ITD, KIT, CEBPA, NRAS, KRAS, WT1, MLL-PTD, and NPM1 mutations were analyzed. Overall survival (OS) of the AYAs was 61% and event-free survival was 38% at 3 years. FLT3-ITD (HR 2.10; 95% CI 1.07-4.12; p = 0.031) and NPM1 (HR 0.24; 95% CI 0.06-1.00; p = 0.050) mutations were associated with risk of overall mortality in multivariate analysis. OS was significantly different according to FLT3-ITD and NPM1 mutation status (p = 0.03). Survival was 100% with NPM1 mutations in the absence of FLT3-ITD and 35% (95% CI 14-57%) with FLT3-ITD in the absence of NPM1 mutations. The OS of AYAs, children (n = 413) and older adults (n = 124) of the AML-05 and AML201 participants were significantly different (p < 0.0001).

METHODS: Baseline demographic and clinical history for all diabetes mellitus patients newly diagnosed with AML or cancer of the breast, ovary, prostate, gastrointestinal tract, lung, or kidney at Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, NY (January 2003-December 2010, n = 924) was collected. Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were assessed by Kaplan-Meier (KM) analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression (hazard ratio [HR]). FINDINGS: Baseline metformin use provided significant OS and DFS benefit in ST but not in AML (KM: PST-OS= 0.003; PST-DFS= 0.002; PAML-OS= 0.961; PAML-DFS= 0.943). AML median survival was slightly better with metformin use, but users derived no relapse benefit. In ST, metformin nonusers had shorter median survival, 57.7 versus 86 months, and poorer outcomes (HRST-OS= 1.33; PST-OS= 0.002; HRST-DFS= 1.32; PST-DFS= 0.002). These findings remained significant in age-adjusted models (HRST-OS= 1.21; PST-OS= 0.039; HRST-DFS= 1.23; PST-DFS= 0.02) but not fully adjusted models (HRST-OS= 0.96; PST-OS= 0.688; HRST-DFS= 1.0; PST-DFS= 0.94). Higher mortality was noted in AML patients taking insulin versus oral diabetes pharmacotherapy at baseline (HRAML-OS= 2.03; PAML-OS= 0.04). CONCLUSION: Lack of metformin benefit in AML could be due to advanced age at cancer diagnosis. Metformin substitution with insulin before computed tomography scans with contrast - a frequent AML assessment practice - may also explain the lack of subsequent benefit despite taking metformin at baseline. A temporary metformin substitution is recommended by the package insert due to a possible drug interaction with the contrast dye. Our data suggest that metformin substitution was permanent in many patients. Nonetheless, the observed benefit in other malignancies warrants further investigation of metformin use in AML.",,"['Ceacareanu, Alice C', 'Nimako, George K', 'Wintrob, Zachary A P']","['Ceacareanu AC', 'Nimako GK', 'Wintrob ZAP']","['Department of Pharmacy Practice, NYS Center of Excellence in Bioinformatics and Life Sciences, University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, New York, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy Practice, NYS Center of Excellence in Bioinformatics and Life Sciences, University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, New York, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy Practice, NYS Center of Excellence in Bioinformatics and Life Sciences, University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, New York, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,India,J Res Pharm Pract,Journal of research in pharmacy practice,101614023,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Metformin', 'disease-free survival', 'overall survival', 'solid tumors']",2017/10/14 06:00,2017/10/14 06:01,['2017/10/14 06:00'],"['2017/10/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/14 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/jrpp.JRPP_17_37 [doi]', 'JRPP-6-145 [pii]']",ppublish,J Res Pharm Pract. 2017 Jul-Sep;6(3):145-150. doi: 10.4103/jrpp.JRPP_17_37.,PMC5632934,,,,,,,['There are no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, drug resistance is frequently observed, mainly due to mutations within the breakpoint cluster region-Abelson leukemia virus (BCR-ABL) kinase domain. The T315I substitution confers complete resistance to TKIs. The aim of this study was to analyze the clinical characteristics of 17 patients with T315I mutation after TKI treatment and provide a basis for prognosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The clinical data of 17 TKI-resistant Ph+ leukemia patients who were found to have a ABL kinase domain mutation from September 2008 to January 2017 were collected. Karyotypes and BCR-ABL fusion gene were analyzed by R-banding and fluorescence in situ hybridization, respectively. Total RNA was extracted by TRIzol reagent, and the ABL kinase domain mutation was detected by direct sequencing. RESULTS: A total of 17 patients reached effective remission including major molecular response and complete cytogenetic response. However, all the patients subsequently developed a T315I mutation after treatment with TKIs. The rate of the BCR-ABL fusion gene in most of the patients who developed the T315I mutation was significantly higher than that before the mutation. At initial diagnosis, patients average platelet count was 149.7x10(9)/L, whereas the average platelet count was only 53.88x10(9)/L after the T315I mutation (P<0.01). The results also showed that the survival time of patients with a high proportion of blast cells or a high number of white blood cells was obviously shortened. CONCLUSION: Patients platelet count decreased when detected with the T315I mutation compared with the initial diagnosis. Combined use of different TKIs and complex chromosomal karyotypes may promote the development of the T315I mutation. When the ratio of blast cells was >50% and the number of white blood cells was >20x10(9)/L, poor survival prognosis was observed.",,"['Xu, Peipei', 'Guo, Dan', 'Shao, Xiaoyan', 'Peng, Miaoxin', 'Chen, Bing']","['Xu P', 'Guo D', 'Shao X', 'Peng M', 'Chen B']","['Department of Hematology, Drum Tower Hospital, School of Medicine, Nanjing University.', ""Department of Hematology, Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital Clinical College of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."", 'Department of Hematology, Drum Tower Hospital, School of Medicine, Nanjing University.', 'Department of Hematology, Drum Tower Hospital, School of Medicine, Nanjing University.', ""Department of Hematology, Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital Clinical College of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170925,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL positive', 'T315I mutation', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'chronic myeloid leukemia']",2017/10/14 06:00,2017/10/14 06:01,['2017/10/14 06:00'],"['2017/10/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/14 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S142482 [doi]', 'ott-10-4731 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2017 Sep 25;10:4731-4738. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S142482. eCollection 2017.,PMC5626416,,,,,,,['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most CEBPA(DM) patients have a classic biallelic mutant combination with an N-terminal mutation leading to production of p30 protein plus a C-terminal loss-of-function in-frame indel mutation (CEBPA(Classic-DM)), but approximately one-third of cases have one or more non-classic mutations, with diverse combinations reported, and there is little information on the consequences of such mutants. We evaluated outcome in a cohort of 104 CEBPA(DM) patients, 79 CEBPA(Classic-DM) and 25 with non-classic mutants, and found that the latter may have poorer survival (5-year overall survival 64% vs. 46%; P=0.05), particularly post relapse (41% vs. 0%; P=0.02). However, for this analysis, all non-classic cases were grouped together, irrespective of mutant combination. As CEBPA(DM) cases have been reported to be hypermethylated, we used methylation profiling to assess whether this could segregate the different mutants. We developed a CEBPA(Classic-DM) methylation signature from a preliminary cohort of 10 CEBPA(DM) (including 8 CEBPA(Classic-DM)) and 30 CEBPA wild-type (CEBPA(WT)) samples, and independently validated the signature in 17 CEBPA(Classic-DM) cases. Assessment of the signature in 16 CEBPA(DM) cases with different non-classic mutant combinations showed that only 31% had a methylation profile equivalent to CEBPA(Classic-DM) whereas for 69% the profile was either intermediate between CEBPA(Classic-DM) and CEBPA(WT) or equivalent to CEBPA(WT) These results suggest that CEBPA(DM) cases with non-classic mutants may be functionally different from those with CEBPA(Classic-DM) mutants, and should not automatically be included in the same prognostic group.

CCR4 is an important therapeutic target molecule because mogamulizumab, an anti-CCR4 antibody, has shown promising efficacy against various T-cell lymphomas. In this study, we examined the in vitro synergistic effects of mogamulizumab and histone deacetylase inhibitors against various T-cell lymphomas. First, we examined the expression of CCR4 mRNA and surface CCR4 in various T-cell lymphoma cell lines and found that it was downregulated upon treatment with vorinostat, a pan-histone deacetylase inhibitor. Next, we used isoform-specific histone deacetylase inhibitors and short-interfering RNA to determine the histone deacetylase isoform involved in the regulation of CCR4, and demonstrated that romidepsin, a class I selective histone deacetylase inhibitor, reduced CCR4 most efficiently. Moreover, among class I histone deacetylases, histone deacetylase 2 knockdown led to a reduction of CCR4 in lymphoma cells, suggesting that CCR4 expression is mainly regulated by histone deacetylase 2. When we examined the CCR4 expression in skin samples from primary cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, obtained from the same patients before and after vorinostat treatment, we found that CCR4 expression was greatly reduced after treatment. Finally, when we conducted an antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity assay with mogamulizumab by using various lymphoma cells, we found that the efficacy of mogamulizumab was significantly reduced by pretreatment with vorinostat. Altogether, our results suggest that the primary use of histone deacetylase inhibitors before treatment with mogamulizumab might not be suitable to obtain synergistic effects.

Recent studies demonstrate that SIRT6, a NAD(+)-dependent nuclear deacetylase, functions as genome-guardian by preserving DNA integrity in different tumor cells. Here, we demonstrate that also CD34(+) blasts from AML patients show ongoing DNA damage and SIRT6 overexpression. Indeed, we identified a poor-prognostic subset of patients, with widespread instability, which relies on SIRT6 to compensate for DNA-replication stress. As a result, SIRT6 depletion compromises the ability of leukemia cells to repair DNA double-strand breaks that, in turn, increases their sensitivity to daunorubicin and Ara-C, both in vitro and in vivo In contrast, low SIRT6 levels observed in normal CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitors explain their weaker sensitivity to genotoxic stress. Intriguingly, we have identified DNA-PKcs and CtIP deacetylation as crucial for SIRT6-mediated DNA repair. Together, our data suggest that inactivation of SIRT6 in leukemia cells leads to disruption of DNA-repair mechanisms, genomic instability and aggressive AML. This synthetic lethal approach, enhancing DNA damage while concomitantly blocking repair responses, provides the rationale for the clinical evaluation of SIRT6 modulators in the treatment of leukemia.",['Copyright(c) 2018 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],"['Cagnetta, Antonia', 'Soncini, Debora', 'Orecchioni, Stefania', 'Talarico, Giovanna', 'Minetto, Paola', 'Guolo, Fabio', 'Retali, Veronica', 'Colombo, Nicoletta', 'Carminati, Enrico', 'Clavio, Marino', 'Miglino, Maurizio', 'Bergamaschi, Micaela', 'Nahimana, Aimable', 'Duchosal, Michel', 'Todoerti, Katia', 'Neri, Antonino', 'Passalacqua, Mario', 'Bruzzone, Santina', 'Nencioni, Alessio', 'Bertolini, Francesco', 'Gobbi, Marco', 'Lemoli, Roberto M', 'Cea, Michele']","['Cagnetta A', 'Soncini D', 'Orecchioni S', 'Talarico G', 'Minetto P', 'Guolo F', 'Retali V', 'Colombo N', 'Carminati E', 'Clavio M', 'Miglino M', 'Bergamaschi M', 'Nahimana A', 'Duchosal M', 'Todoerti K', 'Neri A', 'Passalacqua M', 'Bruzzone S', 'Nencioni A', 'Bertolini F', 'Gobbi M', 'Lemoli RM', 'Cea M']","['Chair of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine (DiMI), University of Genova, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, Policlinico San Martino, Genova, Italy.', 'Chair of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine (DiMI), University of Genova, Italy.', 'European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy.', 'European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy.', 'Chair of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine (DiMI), University of Genova, Italy.', 'Chair of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine (DiMI), University of Genova, Italy.', 'Chair of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine (DiMI), University of Genova, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, Policlinico San Martino, Genova, Italy.', 'Chair of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine (DiMI), University of Genova, Italy.', 'Chair of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine (DiMI), University of Genova, Italy.', 'Chair of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine (DiMI), University of Genova, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, Policlinico San Martino, Genova, Italy.', 'Chair of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine (DiMI), University of Genova, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, Policlinico San Martino, Genova, Italy.', 'Chair of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine (DiMI), University of Genova, Italy.', 'Service and Central Laboratory of Hematology, University Hospital of Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Service and Central Laboratory of Hematology, University Hospital of Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Laboratory of Pre-Clinical and Translational Research, IRCCS-CROB, Referral Cancer Center of Basilicata, Rionero in Vulture, Potenza, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology and Hemato-Oncology, University of Milan, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, Fondazione Ca Granda, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Genova, Italy and.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Genova, Italy and.', 'Hematology Unit, Policlinico San Martino, Genova, Italy.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Genova, Italy.', 'European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy.', 'Chair of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine (DiMI), University of Genova, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, Policlinico San Martino, Genova, Italy.', 'Chair of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine (DiMI), University of Genova, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, Policlinico San Martino, Genova, Italy.', 'Chair of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine (DiMI), University of Genova, Italy michele.cea@unige.it.', 'Hematology Unit, Policlinico San Martino, Genova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171012,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins/metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Checkpoint Kinase 2/metabolism', 'DNA Damage/*drug effects', 'DNA Repair', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Gene Expression', 'Genomic Instability', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Binding', 'Sirtuins/genetics/*metabolism']",,,2017/10/14 06:00,2019/07/25 06:00,['2017/10/14 06:00'],"['2017/07/11 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/25 06:00 [medline]', '2017/10/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2017.176248 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2017.176248 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2018 Jan;103(1):80-90. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2017.176248.

We previously characterized the hepatic expression of transcription factors affecting UGT1A1 expression during development. Accordingly, in this study, we characterized the ontogenetic expression of hepatic UGT1A1 from the perspective of epigenetic regulation. We observed significant histone-3-lysine-4 dimethylation (H3K4me2) enrichment in the adult liver and histone-3-lysine-27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) enrichment in the fetal liver, indicating that dynamic alterations of histone methylation were associated with ontogenetic UGT1A1 expression. We further showed that the transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha (HNF1A) affects histone modifications around the UGT1A1 locus. In particular, we demonstrated that by recruiting HNF1A the cofactors mixed-lineage leukemia 1, the transcriptional coactivator p300, and nuclear receptor coactivator 6 aggregate at the UGT1A1 promoter, thereby regulating histone modifications and subsequent UGT1A1 expression. In this study, we proposed new ideas for the developmental regulation of metabolic enzymes via histone modifications, and our findings will potentially contribute to the development of age-specific therapies.","['Copyright (c) 2017 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental', 'Therapeutics.']","['Nie, Ya-Li', 'Meng, Xiang-Guang', 'Liu, Jing-Yang', 'Yan, Liang', 'Wang, Pei', 'Bi, Hong-Zheng', 'Kan, Quan-Cheng', 'Zhang, Li-Rong']","['Nie YL', 'Meng XG', 'Liu JY', 'Yan L', 'Wang P', 'Bi HZ', 'Kan QC', 'Zhang LR']","[""Department of Pharmacology, School of Basic Medicine, Zhengzhou University (Y.-L.N., J.-Y.L., L.Y., P.W., H.-Z.B., L.-R.Z.); Laboratory of Cardiovascular Disease and Drug Research, Seventh People's Hospital of Zhengzhou (X.-G.M.); Department of Clinical Pharmacology, First Affiliated Hospital, Zhengzhou University (Q.-C.K.), Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pharmacology, School of Basic Medicine, Zhengzhou University (Y.-L.N., J.-Y.L., L.Y., P.W., H.-Z.B., L.-R.Z.); Laboratory of Cardiovascular Disease and Drug Research, Seventh People's Hospital of Zhengzhou (X.-G.M.); Department of Clinical Pharmacology, First Affiliated Hospital, Zhengzhou University (Q.-C.K.), Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pharmacology, School of Basic Medicine, Zhengzhou University (Y.-L.N., J.-Y.L., L.Y., P.W., H.-Z.B., L.-R.Z.); Laboratory of Cardiovascular Disease and Drug Research, Seventh People's Hospital of Zhengzhou (X.-G.M.); Department of Clinical Pharmacology, First Affiliated Hospital, Zhengzhou University (Q.-C.K.), Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pharmacology, School of Basic Medicine, Zhengzhou University (Y.-L.N., J.-Y.L., L.Y., P.W., H.-Z.B., L.-R.Z.); Laboratory of Cardiovascular Disease and Drug Research, Seventh People's Hospital of Zhengzhou (X.-G.M.); Department of Clinical Pharmacology, First Affiliated Hospital, Zhengzhou University (Q.-C.K.), Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pharmacology, School of Basic Medicine, Zhengzhou University (Y.-L.N., J.-Y.L., L.Y., P.W., H.-Z.B., L.-R.Z.); Laboratory of Cardiovascular Disease and Drug Research, Seventh People's Hospital of Zhengzhou (X.-G.M.); Department of Clinical Pharmacology, First Affiliated Hospital, Zhengzhou University (Q.-C.K.), Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pharmacology, School of Basic Medicine, Zhengzhou University (Y.-L.N., J.-Y.L., L.Y., P.W., H.-Z.B., L.-R.Z.); Laboratory of Cardiovascular Disease and Drug Research, Seventh People's Hospital of Zhengzhou (X.-G.M.); Department of Clinical Pharmacology, First Affiliated Hospital, Zhengzhou University (Q.-C.K.), Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pharmacology, School of Basic Medicine, Zhengzhou University (Y.-L.N., J.-Y.L., L.Y., P.W., H.-Z.B., L.-R.Z.); Laboratory of Cardiovascular Disease and Drug Research, Seventh People's Hospital of Zhengzhou (X.-G.M.); Department of Clinical Pharmacology, First Affiliated Hospital, Zhengzhou University (Q.-C.K.), Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pharmacology, School of Basic Medicine, Zhengzhou University (Y.-L.N., J.-Y.L., L.Y., P.W., H.-Z.B., L.-R.Z.); Laboratory of Cardiovascular Disease and Drug Research, Seventh People's Hospital of Zhengzhou (X.-G.M.); Department of Clinical Pharmacology, First Affiliated Hospital, Zhengzhou University (Q.-C.K.), Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China zhanglirongzzu@126.com.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20171012,United States,Drug Metab Dispos,Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals,9421550,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bilirubin/metabolism', 'DNA Methylation/physiology', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/physiology', 'Female', 'Fetus', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/*physiology', 'Glucuronosyltransferase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1-alpha/genetics/metabolism', 'Histone Code/*physiology', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/metabolism', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Liver/enzymology/*growth & development', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/metabolism', 'Nuclear Receptor Coactivators/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'p300-CBP Transcription Factors/metabolism']",,,2017/10/14 06:00,2018/07/22 06:00,['2017/10/14 06:00'],"['2017/04/14 00:00 [received]', '2017/09/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/22 06:00 [medline]', '2017/10/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['dmd.117.076109 [pii]', '10.1124/dmd.117.076109 [doi]']",ppublish,Drug Metab Dispos. 2017 Dec;45(12):1372-1378. doi: 10.1124/dmd.117.076109.

In 133 adults treated with CD19 CAR-T cells, we found that acute lymphoblastic leukemia, high CD19(+) cells in bone marrow, high CAR-T cell dose, cytokine release syndrome, and preexisting neurologic comorbidities were associated with increased risk of neurologic AEs. Patients with severe neurotoxicity demonstrated evidence of endothelial activation, including disseminated intravascular coagulation, capillary leak, and increased blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability. The permeable BBB failed to protect the cerebrospinal fluid from high concentrations of systemic cytokines, including IFNgamma, which induced brain vascular pericyte stress and their secretion of endothelium-activating cytokines. Endothelial activation and multifocal vascular disruption were found in the brain of a patient with fatal neurotoxicity. Biomarkers of endothelial activation were higher before treatment in patients who subsequently developed grade >/=4 neurotoxicity.Significance: We provide a detailed clinical, radiologic, and pathologic characterization of neurotoxicity after CD19 CAR-T cells, and identify risk factors for neurotoxicity. We show endothelial dysfunction and increased BBB permeability in neurotoxicity and find that patients with evidence of endothelial activation before lymphodepletion may be at increased risk of neurotoxicity.

Neoplasms characterized by this fusion are pluripotent stem cell disorders that can show both myeloid and lymphoid differentiation. They typically occur in adult patients and most are characterized by eosinophilia. We describe identification of a FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion in a 13-year-old boy who presented with T-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma without eosinophilia. Detection of FIP1L1-PDGFRA driven neoplasms at diagnosis is usually critical for proper treatment, since almost all reported cases responded to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. However, our patient's leukemia was refractory to standard chemotherapy, and did not show a meaningful response to tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. Testing for a FIP1L1-PDGFRA rearrangement is at present limited to patients with idiopathic hypereosinophilia, and we hypothesize that this abnormality may be under-diagnosed in children with acute leukemias.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The patient developed on-therapy relapse at 12 months, and interestingly, the JAK2 locus acquired loss of heterozygosity during treatment resulting in 100% mutation load. Furthermore, we show that primary ALL mononuclear cells harboring the JAK2 R938Q mutation display reduced sensitivity to the JAK1/2 ATP-competitive inhibitor ruxolitinib in vitro, compared to ALL cells that carry a more common JAK2 pseudokinase domain mutation. Our findings are in line with previous reports that demonstrate that mutations within the kinase domain of JAK2 are associated with resistance to type I JAK inhibitors. Importantly, given the recent inclusion of ruxolitinib in trial protocols for children with JAK pathway alterations, we predict that inter-patient genetic variability may result in suboptimal responses to JAK inhibitor therapy in a subset of cases. The need for alternate targeted and/or combination therapies for patients who display inherent or developed resistance to JAK inhibitor therapy will be warranted, and we propose that kinase-mutants less sensitive to type I JAK inhibitors may present a currently unexplored platform for investigation of improved therapies.",['Copyright (c) 2017.

Here, we report a case of a 21-year-old female diagnosed as aCML with t(1;9)(p34;q34) who presented a CSF3R rearrangement. First, RNA sequencing identified a novel fusion transcript involving exon 17 of CSF3R and exon 50 of non-erythrocytic-1-spectrin-alpha (SPTAN1). Subsequent reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and bidirectional Sanger sequencing confirmed the in-frame fusion. The breakpoint was located at the C-terminus of CSF3R, suggesting a pattern of truncation mutation of CSF3R. Unexpectedly, the patient failed to achieve a complete hematological response following the SRC kinase inhibitor dasatinib therapy, which has been reported to effectively inhibit truncated forms of CSF3R.

A novel high throughput methodology called fluorescence in situ hybridization in suspension (FISH-IS) incorporates a flow cytometry-based imaging approach with automated analysis of thousands of cells. Here we have demonstrated that the FISH-IS technique is applicable to aneuploidy detection in CLL samples for a range of chromosomes using appropriate centromere probes.

The focus was on the peripheral blood cytopenias and myelodysplastic changes in the bone marrow microscopic evaluation. In 5 out of 155 (3,2%) CML patients, the persistent presence (up to nine years) of CCA/Ph- was found (monosomy 7 and trisomy 8 in unrelated clones in two patients treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors; trisomy 8 in two patients on imatinib; trisomy 21 in one patient on interferon alfa treatment).

In this study, we investigated the subcellular localization and the apoptotic mechanisms of BBR were elucidated. First, we confirmed the incorporation of BBR into the cell visually. BBR showed antiproliferative activity and promptly localized to the nucleus from 5[Formula: see text]min to 15[Formula: see text]min after BBR treatment in HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells. Next, we examined the antiproliferative activity of BBR (1) and its biosynthetically related compounds (2-7) in HL-60 cells. BBR exerted strongest antiproliferative activity among 1-7 and the results of structures and activity relation suggested that a methylenedioxyl group in ring A, an [Formula: see text]-alkyl group at C-9 position, and the frame of isoquinoline may be necessary for antiproliferative activity. Moreover, BBR showed the most potent antiproliferative activity in HL-60 cells among human cancer and normal cell lines tested. Next, we examined the effect of BBR on molecular events known as apoptosis induction. In HL-60 cells, BBR induced chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation, and triggered the activation of PARP, caspase-3 and caspase-8 without the activation of caspase-9. BBR-induced DNA fragmentation was abolished by pretreatment with inhibitors against caspase-3 and caspase-8, but not against caspase-9. ERK and p38 were promptly phosphorylated after 15 min of BBR treatment, and this was correlated with time of localization to the nucleus of BBR. These results demonstrated that BBR translocated into nucleus immediately after treatments and induced apoptotic cell death by activation of caspase-3 and caspase-8.",,"['Okubo, Shinya', 'Uto, Takuhiro', 'Goto, Aya', 'Tanaka, Hiroyuki', 'Nishioku, Tsuyoshi', 'Yamada, Katsushi', 'Shoyama, Yukihiro']","['Okubo S', 'Uto T', 'Goto A', 'Tanaka H', 'Nishioku T', 'Yamada K', 'Shoyama Y']","['* Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nagasaki International University, Japan.', '* Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nagasaki International University, Japan.', '* Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nagasaki International University, Japan.', 'double dagger Department of Pharmacognosy, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kyushu University, Japan.', 'dagger Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nagasaki International University, Japan.', 'dagger Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nagasaki International University, Japan.', '* Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nagasaki International University, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Singapore,Am J Chin Med,The American journal of Chinese medicine,7901431,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Berberine/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 3/*metabolism', 'Caspase 8/*metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Berberine', 'Caspase', 'Leukemia', 'Localization']",2017/10/14 06:00,2017/11/29 06:00,['2017/10/14 06:00'],"['2017/10/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1142/S0192415X17500811 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Chin Med. 2017;45(7):1497-1511. doi: 10.1142/S0192415X17500811.,,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0I8Y3P32UF (Berberine)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DATA SOURCES: A literature search was performed of PubMed and MEDLINE databases (1950 to July 2017) and of abstracts from the American Society of Hematology and the American Society of Clinical Oncology. Searches were performed utilizing the following key terms: rituximab, blinatumomab, inotuzumab, ofatumumab, obinutuzumab, Blincyto, Rituxan, Gazyva, Arzerra, CAR T-cell, and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). STUDY SELECTION/DATA EXTRACTION: Studies of pharmacology, clinical efficacy, and safety of rituximab, ofatumumab, obinutuzumab, inotuzumab, blinatumomab, and CAR T-cells in the treatment of adult patients with ALL were identified. DATA SYNTHESIS: Conventional chemotherapy has been the mainstay in the treatment of ALL, producing cure rates of approximately 90% in pediatrics, but it remains suboptimal in adult patients. As such, more effective consolidative modalities and novel therapies for relapsed/refractory disease are needed for adult patients with ALL. In recent years, anti-CD20 antibodies, blinatumomab, inotuzumab, and CD19-targeted CAR T-cells have drastically changed the treatment landscape of B-cell ALL. CONCLUSION: Outcomes of patients with relapsed disease are improving thanks to new therapies such as blinatumomab, inotuzumab, and CAR T-cells. Although the efficacy of these therapies is impressive, they are not without toxicity, both physical and financial. The optimal sequencing of these therapies still remains a question.",,"['Horvat, Troy Z', 'Seddon, Amanda N', 'Ogunniyi, Adebayo', 'King, Amber C', 'Buie, Larry W', 'Daley, Ryan J']","['Horvat TZ', 'Seddon AN', 'Ogunniyi A', 'King AC', 'Buie LW', 'Daley RJ']","['1 Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', '2 Midwestern University Chicago College of Pharmacy, Downers Grove, IL, USA.', '3 Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA.', '1 Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', '1 Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', '1 Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', '1 Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20171012,United States,Ann Pharmacother,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,9203131,IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Bispecific/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy/adverse effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Receptors, Chimeric Antigen/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*CAR T-cells', '*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*blinatumomab', '*immunotherapy', '*inotuzumab']",2017/10/14 06:00,2019/09/10 06:00,['2017/10/14 06:00'],"['2017/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/10 06:00 [medline]', '2017/10/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1060028017736539 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Pharmacother. 2018 Mar;52(3):268-276. doi: 10.1177/1060028017736539.

Cancer sites considered as causally associated are bladder, lung and stomach, and leukaemia. Recent studies did not report an increased risk of cancer. Methods: A meta-analysis was conducted on observational studies published until April 2016 on occupational exposures in the rubber manufacturing industry and risk of cancer. Case-control and cohort studies were included. Random effect models were used. Heterogeneity and publication bias were evaluated. Stratified analyses were conducted on study characteristics. Results: The literature search identified 46 cohorts and 59 case-control studies. An increased risk was found for bladder cancer [standardised incidence ratio (SRR) = 1.36; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.18, 1.57], leukaemia (SRR = 1.29; 95% CI 1.11, 1.52), lymphatic and haematopoietic system (SRR = 1.16; 95% CI 1.02, 1.31) and larynx cancer (SRR = 1.46; 95% CI 1.10, 1.94). For lung cancer, a borderline statistically significant increased risk was identified (SRR = 1.08; 95% CI 0.99, 1.17). No association was found for stomach cancer (SRR = 1.06; 95% CI 0.95, 1.17). In stratified analyses, risks of cancer were not increased for workers employed after 1960 for bladder cancer (SRR = 1.06; 95% CI 0.66, 1.71), lung cancer (SRR = 0.94; 95% CI 0.68, 1.29) or leukaemia (SRR = 0.92; 95% CI 0.62, 1.36). Conclusions: Risk of bladder cancer, lung cancer, leukaemia and larynx cancer were increased among workers in rubber industry. Evidence of elevated risks was no longer seen for bladder cancer, lung cancer or leukemia among workers first employed after 1960.","['(c) The Author 2017; all rights reserved.

Few cases of B-LBL mandibular bone involvement have been reported. OBSERVATION: We report the case of a 30-year-old female patient presenting with a single swelling of the left mandibular region, having grown for several weeks. Maxillo-facial CT and MRI showed inflammation of soft tissues and muscles without initial signs of osteitis, thus noncontributive to the diagnosis. A biopsy allowed diagnosing an intra-oral bone lymphoblastic lymphoma. The patient was referred to the hematooncology unit for treatment.

EBV nuclear antigens (EBNAs) and LMP1 are EBV transcriptional regulators that are essential for LCL establishment, proliferation, and survival. Starting with the 3D genome organization map of LCL, we constructed a comprehensive EBV regulome encompassing 1,992 viral/cellular genes and enhancers. Approximately 30% of genes essential for LCL growth were linked to EBV enhancers. Deleting EBNA2 sites significantly reduced their target gene expression. Additional EBV super-enhancer (ESE) targets included MCL1, IRF4, and EBF. MYC ESE looping to the transcriptional stat site of MYC was dependent on EBNAs. Deleting MYC ESEs greatly reduced MYC expression and LCL growth. EBNA3A/3C altered CDKN2A/B spatial organization to suppress senescence. EZH2 inhibition decreased the looping at the CDKN2A/B loci and reduced LCL growth.

However, the expression status of DNMT3A variants in acute myeloid leukemia remains obscure. This study aimed to assess the expression levels of alternative splicing of DNMT3A variants and explore their roles in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). DNMT3A variants gene expression were assessed, measuring their effects on cell proliferation. In addition, the expression of DNMT3A variants were evaluated in acute myeloid leukemia patients. Four DNMT3A variants were identified, with DNMT3A1 and DNMT3A2V found to be dominant in acute myeloid leukemia cell lines. Moreover, DNMT3A2V overexpression delayed cell proliferation; while, DNMT3A2V R882H mutation promoted cell proliferation. Further, DNMT3A1 and DNMT3A2V were detected in newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients and controls with non-malignant hematological disease, with DNMT3A2V significantly up-regulated in AML patients. The main transcript switched from DNMT3A1 to DNMT3A2V in some patients, especially the low risk group based on the NCCN 2016 guidelines. These findings suggest that DNMT3A1 and DNMT3A2V are the main variants in acute myeloid leukemia with different clinical association, and might play important roles in the pathophysiology of acute myeloid leukemia.",['Copyright (c) 2017 The Authors.

Moreover, chemiluminescence microscopy cell-imaging has not been demonstrated for natively expressed enzymes like cathepsin B. Herein, we describe the design, synthesis, and evaluation of the first chemiluminescence probe for the detection and imaging of cathepsin B. The probe activation mechanism relies on the release of a dioxetane intermediate, which undergoes chemiexcitation to emit green light with high efficiency under physiological conditions. Using the probe, we obtained clear images of cancerous leukemia and colon cells.

METHODS: We describe the clinical and laboratory findings of a 69-year-old male patient who developed plasma cell leukaemia (PCL) 8 years after an initial diagnosis of a low stage CD5+ B LPD and 3 years after treatment for LPD. RESULTS: The transition from a clinically indolent B LPD to an aggressive PCM was documented by bone marrow (BM) biopsy, while flow cytometric (FC) immunophenotyping conferred additional information by disclosing the co-existence of both disorders in BM and the presence of abnormal monotypic PCs in peripheral blood above PCL levels. Phenotypic findings suggested a discrete clonal origin of the two disorders. CONCLUSIONS: This report of PCL development in a patient with residual CD5+ B LPD, emphasizes the need for comprehensive diagnostic evaluation of such cases and scrutiny of their aetiological relationship, including FC immunophenotyping due to its high analytical sensitivity and multiparametric capacity compared to morphology or immunohistochemistry alone.

The ability to monitor and analyze these sub-clonal cell populations can be considered key to successful treatment, particularly in the modern era of targeted therapies. Although advances in sequencing technologies have significantly improved our ability to analyze the mutational landscape of tumors, this utility is reduced when considering small, but clinically significant sub-clones, that is, those representing <10% of the tumor burden. We have developed a high-throughput method that utilizes a 17-probe labeled bacterial artificial chromosome contig to quantify sub-clonal populations of cells based on deletion of a single locus. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells harboring deletion of the short arm of chromosome 17 (del17p), an important prognostic marker for CLL were used to demonstrate the technique. Sub-clones of del17p cells were quantified and isolated from heterogeneous CLL populations using fluorescence in situ hybridization in suspension (FISH-IS) and the locus specific probe set. Using the combination of FISH-IS with the locus-specific probe set enables automated analysis of tens of thousands of cells, accurately quantifying and isolating cells carrying a del17p. Based on the fluorescence intensity of 17p probes, 17p (TP53) deleted cells were identified and sorted using flow cytometric techniques, and enrichment was demonstrated using single nucleotide polymorphism analysis. The ability to separate sub-clones of cells based on genetic heterogeneity, independent of the clone size, highlights the potential application of this method not only in the diagnostic and prognostic setting, but also as an unbiased approach to enable further detailed genetic analysis of the sub-clone with deep sequencing approaches.

In this study, we aim to provide further support to the usefulness of osmotic gradient ektacytometry for the differential diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis by measuring the optimal cutoff values of the parameters provided by this technique. METHODS: A total of 65 cases of hereditary spherocytosis, 7 hereditary elliptocytosis, 3 hereditary xerocytosis, and 171 normal controls were analyzed with osmotic gradient ektacytometry in addition to the routine red blood cell laboratory techniques. The most robust osmoscan parameters for hereditary spherocytosis diagnosis were determined using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. RESULTS: The best diagnostic criteria for hereditary spherocytosis were the combination of decreased minimal elongation index up to 3% and increased minimal osmolality point up to 5.2% when compared to the mean of controls. Using this established criterion, osmotic gradient ektacytometry reported a sensitivity of 93.85% and a specificity of 98.38% for the diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis. CONCLUSION: Osmotic gradient ektacytometry is an effective diagnostic test for hereditary spherocytosis and enables its differential diagnosis with other red blood cell membrane diseases based on specific pathology profiles.",['(c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Llaudet-Planas, E', 'Vives-Corrons, J L', 'Rizzuto, V', 'Gomez-Ramirez, P', 'Sevilla Navarro, J', 'Coll Sibina, M T', 'Garcia-Bernal, M', 'Ruiz Llobet, A', 'Badell, I', 'Velasco-Puyo, P', 'Dapena, J L', 'Manu-Pereira, M M']","['Llaudet-Planas E', 'Vives-Corrons JL', 'Rizzuto V', 'Gomez-Ramirez P', 'Sevilla Navarro J', 'Coll Sibina MT', 'Garcia-Bernal M', 'Ruiz Llobet A', 'Badell I', 'Velasco-Puyo P', 'Dapena JL', 'Manu-Pereira MM']","[""Red Cell Pathology Unit, Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, [Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi I Sunyer] IDIBAPS, [Universitat de Barcelona] UB, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Red Cell Pathology Unit, [Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute] IJC, [Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona] UAB, Badalona, Spain.', ""Red Cell Pathology Unit, Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, [Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi I Sunyer] IDIBAPS, [Universitat de Barcelona] UB, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Red Cell Pathology Unit, [Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute] IJC, [Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona] UAB, Badalona, Spain.', 'Red Cell Pathology Unit, [Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute] IJC, [Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona] UAB, Badalona, Spain.', ""Red Cell Pathology Unit, Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, [Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi I Sunyer] IDIBAPS, [Universitat de Barcelona] UB, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Servicio Hematologia Pediatrica, [Hospital Infantil Universitario Nino Jesus] HIUNJ, [Fundacion por la Investigacion Biomedica] FIB, CIBERER, Madrid, Spain.', 'Pediatric Department, Hospital General de Granollers, Granollers, Spain.', 'Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Department, Hospital Universitari Mutua de Terrassa, Terrassa, Spain.', 'Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Department, Hospital Sant Joan de Deu de Barcelona, [University of Barcelona] UB, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Unidad de Hematologia, Oncologia y Trasplante Hematopoyetico, Hospital Universitari de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona [UAB], Barcelona, Spain.', ""Pediatric Oncology and Hematology Department, Hospital Universitari Vall d'Hebron, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona [UAB], Barcelona, Spain."", ""Pediatric Oncology and Hematology Department, Hospital Universitari Vall d'Hebron, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona [UAB], Barcelona, Spain."", ""Red Cell Pathology Unit, Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, [Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi I Sunyer] IDIBAPS, [Universitat de Barcelona] UB, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Red Cell Pathology Unit, [Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute] IJC, [Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona] UAB, Badalona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20171010,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chronic Disease', '*Erythrocyte Deformability', 'Erythrocyte Membrane/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/*instrumentation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Osmosis', 'Spherocytosis, Hereditary/*blood/*diagnosis']",['NOTNLM'],"['diagnosis', 'hereditary spherocytosis', 'membranopathies', 'osmotic gradient ektacytometry', 'screening']",2017/10/13 06:00,2018/07/26 06:00,['2017/10/13 06:00'],"['2017/03/24 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/26 06:00 [medline]', '2017/10/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ijlh.12746 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2018 Feb;40(1):94-102. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.12746.

Current approaches have limitations affecting reproducibility and there is no consensus on the role of new markers. The aim of this project was to identify reproducible criteria and consensus on markers recommended for the diagnosis of CLL. ERIC/ESCCA members classified 14 of 35 potential markers as ""required"" or ""recommended"" for CLL diagnosis, consensus being defined as >75% and >50% agreement, respectively. An approach to validate ""required"" markers using normal peripheral blood was developed. Responses were received from 150 participants with a diagnostic workload >20 CLL cases per week in 23/150 (15%), 5-20 in 82/150 (55%), and <5 cases per week in 45/150 (30%). The consensus for ""required"" diagnostic markers included: CD19, CD5, CD20, CD23, Kappa, and Lambda. ""Recommended"" markers potentially useful for differential diagnosis were: CD43, CD79b, CD81, CD200, CD10, and ROR1. Reproducible criteria for component reagents were assessed retrospectively in 14,643 cases from 13 different centers and showed >97% concordance with current approaches. A pilot study to validate staining quality was completed in 11 centers. Markers considered as ""required"" for the diagnosis of CLL by the participants in this study (CD19, CD5, CD20, CD23, Kappa, and Lambda) are consistent with current diagnostic criteria and practice. Importantly, a reproducible approach to validate and apply these markers in individual laboratories has been identified. Finally, a consensus ""recommended"" panel of markers to refine diagnosis in borderline cases (CD43, CD79b, CD81, CD200, CD10, and ROR1) has been defined and will be prospectively evaluated.

Accumulating evidence suggests that EVs play a role in cell-to-cell communication within the tumor microenvironment. EVs' components, such as proteins, noncoding RNAs [microRNAs (miRNAs), and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs)], messenger RNAs (mRNAs), DNA, and lipids, can mediate paracrine signaling in the tumor microenvironment. Recently, miRNAs encapsulated in secreted EVs have been identified in the extracellular space. Mature miRNAs that participate in intercellular communication are released from most cells, often within EVs, and disseminate through the extracellular fluid to reach remote target cells, including tumor cells, whose phenotypes they can influence by regulating mRNA and protein expression either as tumor suppressors or as oncogenes, depending on their targets. In this review, we discuss the roles of miRNAs in intercellular communication, the biological function of extracellular miRNAs, and their potential applications for diagnosis and therapeutics.

Clinical results have demonstrated efficacious responses in patients with the CD19 positive diseases B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and diffuse large B cell lymphoma. However, significant challenges have emerged, including worrisome immune-related toxicities, therapy resistance, and understanding how to administer CD19 CAR T cells in clinical practice.

In this large (n = 497) and informative (inclusive of molecular and cytogenetic information) chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) patient cohort, we demonstrate key biological insights and an independent prognostic impact for t-CMML. T-CMML was diagnosed in 9% of patients and occurred approximately 7 years after exposure to prior chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. In comparison to de novo CMML, t-CMML patients had higher LDH levels, higher frequency of karyotypic abnormalities and had higher risk cytogenetic stratification. There were no differences in the distribution of gene mutations and unlike t-MDS/AML, balanced chromosomal translocations, abnormalities of chromosome 11q23 (1%) and Tp53 mutations (<2%) were uncommon. Molecularly integrated CMML prognostic models were not effective in risk stratifying t-CMML patients and responses to hypomethylating agents were dismal with no complete responses. Median overall (OS) and leukemia free survival (LFS) was shorter for t-CMML in comparison to d-CMML (Median OS 10.9 vs 26 months and median LFS 50 vs 127 months) and t-CMML independently and adversely impacted OS (P = .0001 HR 2.1 95% CI 1.4-3.0). This prognostic impact was retained in the context of the Mayo Molecular Model (P = .001, HR 2.4, 95% CI 1.5-3.7) and the GFM prognostic model (P < .0001, HR 2.15, 95% CI 1.5-3.7). In summary, we highlight the unique genetics and independent prognostic impact of t-CMML, warranting its inclusion as a separate entity in the classification schema for both CMML and t-MN.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Patnaik, Mrinal M', 'Vallapureddy, Rangit', 'Yalniz, Fevzi F', 'Hanson, Curtis A', 'Ketterling, Rhett P', 'Lasho, Terra L', 'Finke, Christy', 'Al-Kali, Aref', 'Gangat, Naseema', 'Tefferi, Ayalew']","['Patnaik MM', 'Vallapureddy R', 'Yalniz FF', 'Hanson CA', 'Ketterling RP', 'Lasho TL', 'Finke C', 'Al-Kali A', 'Gangat N', 'Tefferi A']","['Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of, Hematopathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of, Cytogenetics, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171103,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cytogenetics/*methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/genetics/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Young Adult']",,,2017/10/13 06:00,2017/12/19 06:00,['2017/10/13 06:00'],"['2017/10/02 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/05 00:00 [revised]', '2017/10/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/19 06:00 [medline]', '2017/10/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.24939 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2018 Jan;93(1):65-73. doi: 10.1002/ajh.24939.

To ensure an appropriate follow-up of childhood cancer survivors and reducing late liver complications, the need for comprehensive and accurate information is presented. We evaluate the risk of liver diseases in a large childhood cancer survivor cohort. We included all 1-year survivors of childhood cancer treated in the five Nordic countries. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate hospitalisation rate (hazard) ratios (HRs) for each liver outcome according to type of cancer. We used the risk among survivors of central nervous system tumour as internal reference. With a median follow-up time of 10 years, 659 (2%) survivors had been hospitalised at least once for a liver disease. The risk for hospitalisation for any liver disease was high after hepatic tumour (HR = 6.9) and leukaemia (HR = 1.7). The Danish sub-cohort of leukaemia treated with haematopoietic stem cell transplantation had a substantially higher risk for hospitalisation for all liver diseases combined (HR = 3.8). Viral hepatitis accounted for 286 of 659 hospitalisations corresponding to 43% of all survivors hospitalised for liver disease. The 20-year cumulative risk of viral hepatitis was 1.8% for survivors diagnosed with cancer before 1990 but only 0.3% for those diagnosed after 1990. The risk of liver disease was low but significantly increased among survivors of hepatic tumours and leukaemia. Further studies with focus on the different treatment modalities are needed to further strengthen the prevention of treatment-induced late liver complications.",['(c) 2017 UICC.'],"['Bonnesen, Trine Gade', 'Winther, Jeanette F', 'Andersen, Klaus K', 'Asdahl, Peter H', 'de Fine Licht, Sofie', 'Gudmundsdottir, Thorgerdur', 'Sallfors Holmqvist, Anna', 'Madanat-Harjuoja, Laura-Maria', 'Tryggvadottir, Laufey', 'Wesenberg, Finn', 'Heilmann, Carsten', 'Olsen, Jorgen H', 'Hasle, Henrik']","['Bonnesen TG', 'Winther JF', 'Andersen KK', 'Asdahl PH', 'de Fine Licht S', 'Gudmundsdottir T', 'Sallfors Holmqvist A', 'Madanat-Harjuoja LM', 'Tryggvadottir L', 'Wesenberg F', 'Heilmann C', 'Olsen JH', 'Hasle H']","['Department of Paediatrics, Aarhus University Hospital, Palle Juul-Jensens Boulevard 99, Aarhus N, 8200, Denmark.', 'Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Strandboulevarden 49, Copenhagen, 2100, Denmark.', 'Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Strandboulevarden 49, Copenhagen, 2100, Denmark.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Aarhus University Hospital, Palle Juul-Jensens Boulevard 99, Aarhus N, 8200, Denmark.', 'Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Strandboulevarden 49, Copenhagen, 2100, Denmark.', 'Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Strandboulevarden 49, Copenhagen, 2100, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Sciences, Paediatric Oncology and Haematology, Skane University Hospital, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Finnish Cancer Registry, Pieni Roobertinkatu 9, Helsinki, 00130, Finland.', 'Department of Paediatrics, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Laeknagardur, University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland.', 'The Icelandic Cancer Registry, Skogarhlid 9, PO Box 5420, Reykjavik, 125, Iceland.', 'Cancer Registry of Norway, P.O.

Lack of cross-reacting cytokines in the microenvironment of the mice has been proposed as a potential reason. In this study we have used NOD/SCID IL2-receptor gamma deficient mice expressing human SCF, IL-3 and GM-CSF (NSGS mice), that should be superior in supporting human, and particularly, myeloid cell engraftment, to expand BCR-ABL1 expressing human cells in order to model CML. NSGS mice transplanted with BCR-ABL1 expressing cells became anemic and had to be sacrificed due to illness, however, this was not accompanied by an expansion of human myeloid cells but rather we observed a massive expansion of human T-cells and macrophages/histiocytes. Importantly, control human cells without BCR-ABL1 expression elicited a similar reaction, although with a slight delay of disease induction, suggesting that while BCR-ABL1 contributes to the inflammatory reaction, the presence of normal human hematopoietic cells is detrimental for NSGS mice.",,"['Askmyr, Maria', 'von Palffy, Sofia', 'Hansen, Nils', 'Landberg, Niklas', 'Hogberg, Carl', 'Rissler, Marianne', 'Agerstam, Helena', 'Fioretos, Thoas']","['Askmyr M', 'von Palffy S', 'Hansen N', 'Landberg N', 'Hogberg C', 'Rissler M', 'Agerstam H', 'Fioretos T']","['Department of Clinical Genetics, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, University and Regional Laboratories, Region Skane, Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20171012,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Animals', 'Cytokines/*genetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood/*cytology/transplantation', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",,,2017/10/13 06:00,2017/10/24 06:00,['2017/10/13 06:00'],"['2017/05/23 00:00 [received]', '2017/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0186035 [doi]', 'PONE-D-17-19743 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2017 Oct 12;12(10):e0186035. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0186035. eCollection 2017.,PMC5638313,"['0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (IL3 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5683-6438'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we exploit the capacity of activated NOTCH1 and NOTCH3 to induce T-ALL, despite substantial divergence in their intracellular regions, as a means to elucidate a broad, common Notch-dependent oncogenomic program through systematic comparison of the transcriptomes and Notch-bound genomic regulatory elements of NOTCH1- and NOTCH3-dependent T-ALL cells. ChIP-seq studies show a high concordance of functional NOTCH1 and NOTCH3 genomic binding sites that are enriched in binding motifs for RBPJ, the transcription factor that recruits activated Notch to DNA. The interchangeability of NOTCH1 and NOTCH3 was confirmed by rescue of NOTCH1-dependent T-ALL cells with activated NOTCH3 and vice versa. Despite remarkable overall similarity, there are nuanced differences in chromatin landscapes near critical common Notch target genes, most notably at a Notch-dependent enhancer that regulates MYC, which correlates with responsiveness to Notch pathway inhibitors. Overall, a common oncogenomic program driven by binding of either Notch is sufficient to maintain T-ALL cell growth, whereas cell-context specific differences appear to influence the response of T-ALL cells to Notch inhibition.",,"['Choi, Sung Hee', 'Severson, Eric', 'Pear, Warren S', 'Liu, Xiaole S', 'Aster, Jon C', 'Blacklow, Stephen C']","['Choi SH', 'Severson E', 'Pear WS', 'Liu XS', 'Aster JC', 'Blacklow SC']","['Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States of America.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, United States of America.', ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States of America."", 'Departments of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, and Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA, United States of America.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, United States of America.', 'Departments of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, and Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA, United States of America.', ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States of America."", 'Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States of America.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, United States of America.', ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States of America.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20171012,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin J Recombination Signal Sequence-Binding Protein/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptor, Notch3/genetics/*metabolism', 'Response Elements', '*Signal Transduction']",,,2017/10/13 06:00,2017/10/20 06:00,['2017/10/13 06:00'],"['2017/08/12 00:00 [received]', '2017/09/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0185762 [doi]', 'PONE-D-17-29826 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2017 Oct 12;12(10):e0185762. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0185762. eCollection 2017.,PMC5638296,"['0 (Immunoglobulin J Recombination Signal Sequence-Binding Protein)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (NOTCH3 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RBPJ protein, human)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Receptor, Notch3)']","['R01 CA092433/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA119170/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 CA220340/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6904-1981'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although LIP has been reported in association with lymphoproliferative diseases like Castleman disease, it has never been described in patients with leukemia. We report the first case of LIP in a patient with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) who was found to have a novel germline mutation of unknown significance in additional sex combs-like-1 (ASXL1) gene and a pathogenic somatic mutation of protein tyrosine phosphatase, nonreceptor type 11 (PTPN11) gene at diagnosis. The patient underwent a matched unrelated bone marrow transplant for JMML with complete resolution of JMML and LIP with no recurrence to date. We also emphasize the importance of considering LIP in differential diagnosis of pulmonary lesions seen in conjunction with hematologic malignancies and distinguishing it from malignant infiltration of the lung.",,"['Vatsayan, Anant', 'Talati, Ravi', 'Nagle, Kristen', 'Cabral, Linda', 'Cammock, Sloane', 'Dimarino, Amy', 'Egler, Rachel', 'Saab, Shahrazad', 'Dalal, Jignesh']","['Vatsayan A', 'Talati R', 'Nagle K', 'Cabral L', 'Cammock S', 'Dimarino A', 'Egler R', 'Saab S', 'Dalal J']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, UH Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital, Cleveland, OH.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,IM,"['Allografts', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Juvenile/diagnosis/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Lung Diseases, Interstitial/diagnosis/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics']",,,2017/10/13 06:00,2019/03/20 06:00,['2017/10/13 06:00'],"['2017/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/20 06:00 [medline]', '2017/10/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MPH.0000000000000977 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2018 Jul;40(5):e315-e318. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0000000000000977.,,"['0 (ASXL1 protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN11 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)', 'Lymphoid Interstitial Pneumonia']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results of a recent large randomized trial (Cancer and Leukemia Group B/Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology [CALGB/Alliance 70604]) showed that zoledronic acid (ZA) every 3 months was noninferior to monthly ZA in reducing the risks of SREs. We sought to determine the cost-effectiveness (CE) of monthly ZA, ZA every 3 months, and monthly denosumab in women with breast cancer and skeletal metastases. Methods Using a Markov model, costs per SRE avoided were calculated for the three treatments. Sensitivity analyses were performed where denosumab SRE probabilities were assumed to be 50%, 75%, and 90% lower than the ZA SRE probabilities. Quality-adjusted life-years were also calculated. The analysis was from the US payer perspective. Results The mean costs of the denosumab treatment strategy are nine-fold higher than generic ZA every 3 months. Quality-adjusted life-years were virtually identical in all the three treatment arms; hence, the optimal treatment would be ZA every 3 months because it was the least costly treatment. The sensitivity analyses showed that relative to ZA every 3 months, the incremental costs per mean SRE avoided for denosumab ranged from $162,918 to $347,655. Conclusion ZA every 3 months was more CE in reducing the risks of SRE than monthly denosumab. This analysis was one of the first to incorporate the costs of generic ZA and one of the first independent CE analyses not sponsored by either Novartis or Amgen, the makers of ZA and denosumab, respectively. ZA every 3 months is the more CE option and more reasonable alternative to monthly denosumab.",,"['Shapiro, Charles L', 'Moriarty, James P', 'Dusetzina, Stacie', 'Himelstein, Andrew L', 'Foster, Jared C', 'Grubbs, Stephen S', 'Novotny, Paul J', 'Borah, Bijan J']","['Shapiro CL', 'Moriarty JP', 'Dusetzina S', 'Himelstein AL', 'Foster JC', 'Grubbs SS', 'Novotny PJ', 'Borah BJ']","['Charles L.

The development of TK inhibitors (TKIs) revolutionized the treatment of CML patients. However, TKIs are not effective to those at advanced phases when amplified BCR-ABL1 levels and increased genomic instability lead to secondary oncogenic modifications. Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) is an important regulator of signaling transduction in hematopoietic cells and was shown to be an endogenous inhibitor of the c-ABL TK. Here, we show that the expression of WASP decreases with the progression of CML, inversely correlates with the expression of BCR-ABL1 and is particularly low in blast crisis. Enforced expression of BCR-ABL1 negatively regulates the expression of WASP. Decreased expression of WASP is partially due to DNA methylation of the proximal WASP promoter. Importantly, lower levels of WASP in CML advanced phase patients correlate with poorer overall survival (OS) and is associated with TKI response. Interestingly, enforced expression of WASP in BCR-ABL1-positive K562 cells increases the susceptibility to apoptosis induced by TRAIL or chemotherapeutic drugs and negatively modulates BCR-ABL1-induced tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our data reveal a novel molecular mechanism that operates in BCR-ABL1-induced tumorigenesis that can be used to develop new strategies to help TKI-resistant, CML patients in blast crisis (BC).",,"['Pereira, Welbert O', 'De Carvalho, Daniel D', 'Zenteno, Maria Emilia', 'Ribeiro, Beatriz F', 'Jacysyn, Jacqueline F', 'Sardinha, Luiz R', 'Zanichelli, Maria A', 'Hamerschlak, Nelson', 'Jones, Gareth E', 'Pagnano, Katia B', 'Castro, Fabiola A', 'Calle, Yolanda', 'Amarante-Mendes, Gustavo P']","['Pereira WO', 'De Carvalho DD', 'Zenteno ME', 'Ribeiro BF', 'Jacysyn JF', 'Sardinha LR', 'Zanichelli MA', 'Hamerschlak N', 'Jones GE', 'Pagnano KB', 'Castro FA', 'Calle Y', 'Amarante-Mendes GP']","['Departamento de Imunologia, Instituto de Ciencias Biomedicas, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Instituto Israelita de Ensino e Pesquisa, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Departamento de Imunologia, Instituto de Ciencias Biomedicas, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Centro de Hematologia e Hemoterapia, Universidade de Campinas, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Imunologia, Instituto de Ciencias Biomedicas, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Faculdade de Medicina - LIM62, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Instituto Israelita de Ensino e Pesquisa, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Instituto de Tratamento do Cancer Infantil, Instituto da Crianca, Hospital das Clinicas, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Hematologia e Hemoterapia, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', ""Randall Division of Cell and Molecular Biophysics, King's College London, London, UK."", 'Centro de Hematologia e Hemoterapia, Universidade de Campinas, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Faculdade de Ciencias Farmaceuticas de Ribeirao Preto, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil.', ""Department of Haemato-Oncology, King's College London, London, UK."", 'Departamento de Imunologia, Instituto de Ciencias Biomedicas, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Instituto de Investigacao em Imunologia, Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia (INCT), Sao Paulo, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171012,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Azacitidine/therapeutic use', 'Carcinogenesis/genetics', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality/*pathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/metabolism', 'Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism']",,,2017/10/13 06:00,2018/06/05 06:00,['2017/10/13 06:00'],"['2017/08/17 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2017458 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2017.458 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2017 Oct 12;8(10):e3114. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2017.458.,PMC5680580,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (WAS protein, human)', '0 (Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",['G1100041/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],,['ORCID: 0000-0002-5140-5310'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overexpression of c-myc causes acute erythroleukemia in vivo. However, the role of MYCN in acute erythroleukemia remains poorly understood. In this study, we found that the patients with erythroleukemia showed higher expression of MYCN than normal controls. In vitro experiments, knockdown of MYCN resulted in decreased cell proliferation, elevated autonomously cell apoptosis and increased P21-mediated cell senescence. On the contrary, overexpression of MYCN obviously promoted cell proliferation, and induced erythroid differentiation block and apoptosis resistance to cytotoxic agent. Further gene microarray and functional analysis revealed that EZH2 is a target of MYCN. Knockdown of MYCN inhibited the expression of EZH2, and then activated p21 expression through removal of H3K27me3 at the p21 promoter. Overexpression of ezh2 could antagonize the p21 activation caused by MYCN knockdown. In addition, Aurora inhibitor MLN8237 inhibited the proliferation of erythroleukemia cells through repression of MYCN/EZH2 axis, whereas it minimally affected the normal hematopoietic cells. In conclusion, MYCN contributes to the malignant characteristics of erythroleukemia through EZH2-meidated epigenetic repression of p21.

Normally, they are present in insignificant amounts in the peripheral blood of healthy individuals. On the other hand, elevated CECs and EPCs levels have been reported in the peripheral blood of patients with different types of cancers and other diseases. OBJECTIVE: This review aims to provide an overview on the characterization of CECs and EPCs, to describe isolation methods and to identify the potential role of these cells in hematological diseases and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. METHODS: We performed a detailed search of peer-reviewed literature using keywords related to CECs, EPCs, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and hematological diseases (hemoglobinopathies, hodgkin and non-hodgkin lymphoma, acute leukemia, myeloproliferative syndromes, chronic lymphocytic leukemia). RESULTS: CECs and EPCs are potential biomarkers for several clinical conditions involving endothelial turnover and remodeling, such as in hematological diseases. These cells may be involved in disease progression and in the neoplastic process. Moreover, CECs and EPCs are probably involved in endothelial damage which is a marker of several complications following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

Similarly, environmental temperature modulates many biological functions. To study the effect of environment temperature on cancer incidence, the US population was selected. Because, county-wise cancer incidence rate data of various anatomical site-specific cancers and different races/ethnicities for both males and females are available. Moreover, the differences amongst the aforementioned factors among individuals are much less, as compared to the world population. Statistical analysis showed a negative correlation between the average annual temperature and cancer incidence rate at all anatomical sites and individually for 13 types (out of 16 types) of anatomical site-specific cancer incidence rates (e.g. uterine, bladder, thyroid, breast, esophagus, ovary, melanoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, leukemia, brain, pancreas, etc.) for females. Further analysis found a similar inverse trend in all races/ethnicities of the female population but not in all male races/ethnicities or anatomical site-specific cancers. Moreover, the majority of the counties having the top-most cancer incidence rate in females are located above the latitude 36.5 degrees N.

Unfortunately, a dose-dependent side effect of this drug is common, representing a major obstacle to its use despite its therapeutic efficacy. Photodynamic therapy is an emerging non-invasive potential adjuvant for conventional cancer treatment. In an attempt to circumvent the dose-limiting effect of doxorubicin, this study aimed to investigate cellular anticancer activity of doxorubicin and sulfonated zinc phthalocyanine-mediated photodynamic therapy on MCF-7 cells alone and in combination. Furthermore, we investigated the cell death pathway resulting from the combination treatment. MCF-7 cells were incubated with 0.5 microM concentration of doxorubicin for 20 h, afterwards, various concentrations of sulfonated zinc phthalocyanine were added and incubated for 4 h. Cells were irradiated using a 681.5 nm diode laser at 4.53 mW/cm(2) for 18 min 24 s (5 J/cm(2)). Cell viability and proliferation were measured using trypan blue assay and homogeneous adenosine triphosphate quantitation assay, respectively, while qualitative changes in cellular morphology were observed under inverted light microscopy. Cellular DNA damage was assessed under fluorescent microscopy and Annexin V/propidium iodide stain was used to investigate the cell death pathway. Findings from this study shown that combined treatment with doxorubicin and photodynamic therapy was more effective in inhibiting the proliferation and growth of MCF-7 cells. Overall, the results indicate that combination of smaller dose of doxorubicin with photodynamic therapy is a promising combined treatment strategy for breast carcinoma.

Gene expression data from microarray experiments on both normal and diseased cell samples provide enormous scope to explore genetic relations of disease using computational techniques. Varied patterns of expressions of thousands of genes at different cell conditions along with inherent experimental error make the task of isolating disease related genes challenging. In this paper, we present a data mining method, common subcluster mining (CSM), to discover highly perturbed genes under diseased condition from differential expression patterns. The method builds heap through superposing near centroid clusters from gene expression data of normal samples and extracts its core part. It, thus, isolates genes exhibiting the most stable state across normal samples and constitute a reference set for each centroid. It performs the same operation on datasets from corresponding diseased samples and isolates the genes showing drastic changes in their expression patterns. The method thus finds the disease-sensitive genesets when applied to datasets of lung cancer, prostrate cancer, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, leukemia and pulmonary arterial hypertension. In majority of the cases, few new genes are found over and above some previously reported ones.

The mRNA of NudCD1 is expressed in heart and testis of normal tissues, and is overexpressed in several cancers. Previous studies have shown that the expression level of the protein correlates with tumoral phenotype, possibly interacting upstream of the Insulin Growth Factor - 1 Receptor (IGF-1R). The gene encoding the NudCD1 protein consists of 12 exons that can be alternative spliced, leading to the expression of three different isoforms. These isoforms possess a common region of 492 amino acids in their C-terminus region and have an isoform specific N-terminus. To determine the distinct function of each isoforms, we have localised the isoforms within the cells using immunofluorescence microscopy and used a quantitative proteomics approach (SILAC) to identify specific protein interaction partners for each isoforms. Localization studies showed a different subcellular distribution for the different isoforms, with the first isoform being nuclear, while the other two isoforms have distinct cytoplasmic and nuclear location.

Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a rare form of AML, which generally presents with a t(15;17) translocation causing expression of the fusion protein PML-RARA. Pharmacological doses of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) induce granulocytic differentiation of APL cells leading to cure rates of >80% if combined with conventional chemotherapy. Autophagy is a lysosomal degradation pathway for the removal of cytoplasmic content and recycling of macromolecules. ATRA induces autophagy in ATRA-sensitive AML and APL cells and autophagy inhibition attenuates ATRA-triggered differentiation. In this study, we aimed at identifying if the autophagy-linked FYVE-domain containing protein (ALFY/WDFY3) is involved in autophagic degradation of protein aggregates contributes to ATRA therapy-induced autophagy. We found that ALFY mRNA levels increase significantly during the course of ATRA-induced differentiation of APL and AML cell lines. Importantly ALFY depletion impairs ATRA-triggered granulocytic differentiation of these cells. In agreement with its function in aggrephagy, knockdown of ALFY results in reduced ATRA-induced proteolysis.

ROS are essential for activation of T cells, but how ROS influence NKT cells is unknown. In the present study, we investigated the role of ROS in NKT cell function. We found that NKT cells, but not CD4 or CD8 T cells, have dramatically high ROS in the spleen and liver of mice but not in the thymus or adipose tissues. Accordingly, ROS-high NKT cells exhibited increased susceptibility and apoptotic cell death with oxidative stress. High ROS in the peripheral NKT cells were primarily produced by NADPH oxidases and not mitochondria. We observed that sorted ROS-high NKT cells were enriched in NKT1 and NKT17 cells, whereas NKT2 cells were dominant in ROS-low cells. Furthermore, treatment of NKT cells with antioxidants led to reduced frequencies of IFN-gamma- and IL-17-expressing cells, indicating that ROS play a role in regulating the inflammatory function of NKT cells. The transcription factor promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) seemed to control the ROS levels. NKT cells from adipose tissues that do not express PLZF and those from PLZF haplodeficient mice have low ROS. Conversely, ROS were highly elevated in CD4 T cells from mice ectopically expressing PLZF. Thus, our findings demonstrate that PLZF controls ROS levels, which in turn governs the inflammatory function of NKT cells.","['Copyright (c) 2017 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.']","['Kim, Yeung-Hyen', 'Kumar, Ajay', 'Chang, Cheong-Hee', 'Pyaram, Kalyani']","['Kim YH', 'Kumar A', 'Chang CH', 'Pyaram K']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 kpyaram@umich.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20171011,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Interleukin-17/metabolism', 'Liver/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'NADPH Oxidases/metabolism', 'Natural Killer T-Cells/*immunology', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Spleen/*immunology']",,,2017/10/13 06:00,2017/11/29 06:00,['2017/10/13 06:00'],"['2017/04/21 00:00 [received]', '2017/09/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/29 06:00 [medline]', '2017/10/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['jimmunol.1700567 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1700567 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2017 Nov 15;199(10):3478-3487. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1700567.

We report two CP-CML patients achieving and maintaining major molecular responses while on very low doses of dasatinib, ultimately achieving undetectable levels of BCR-ABL fusion transcript in their peripheral blood. Observations of several CP-CML cases responding remarkably well to dasatinib despite very low dose and frequent dose interruptions challenge our current understanding and the accuracy of the data regarding the optimum dose and schedule of this drug.

Although routine in adults with leukemia, antibacterial prophylaxis is controversial in pediatrics because of insufficient evidence for its efficacy or antibiotic choice and concerns about promoting antibiotic resistance and Clostridium difficile infection. Methods: This was a single-center, observational cohort study of patients with newly diagnosed ALL, comparing prospectively collected infection-related outcomes in patients who received no prophylaxis, levofloxacin prophylaxis, or other prophylaxis during induction therapy on the total XVI study. A propensity score-weighted logistic regression model was used to adjust for confounders. Results: Of 344 included patients, 173 received no prophylaxis, 69 received levofloxacin prophylaxis, and 102 received other prophylaxis regimens. Patients receiving prophylaxis had longer duration of neutropenia. Prophylaxis reduced the odds of febrile neutropenia, likely bacterial infection, and bloodstream infection by >/=70%. Levofloxacin prophylaxis alone reduced these infections, but it also reduced cephalosporin, aminoglycoside, and vancomycin exposure and reduced the odds of C. difficile infection by >95%. No increase in breakthrough infections with antibiotic-resistant organisms was seen, but this cannot be excluded. Conclusions: This is the largest study to date of antibacterial prophylaxis during induction therapy for pediatric ALL and the first to include a broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone. Prophylaxis prevented febrile neutropenia and systemic infection. Levofloxacin prophylaxis also minimized the use of treatment antibiotics and drastically reduced C. difficile infection.

Methods: We prospectively evaluated the epidemiology of pre-engraftment GNB in 1118 allogeneic HSCTs (allo-HSCTs) and 1625 autologous HSCTs (auto-HSCTs) among 54 transplant centers during 2014 (SIGNB-GITMO-AMCLI study). Using logistic regression methods. we identified risk factors for GNB and evaluated the impact of GNB on the 4-month overall-survival after transplant. Results: The cumulative incidence of pre-engraftment GNB was 17.3% in allo-HSCT and 9% in auto-HSCT. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most common isolates. By multivariate analysis, variables associated with GNB were a diagnosis of acute leukemia, a transplant from a HLA-mismatched donor and from cord blood, older age, and duration of severe neutropenia in allo-HSCT, and a diagnosis of lymphoma, older age, and no antibacterial prophylaxis in auto-HSCT. A pretransplant infection by a resistant pathogen was significantly associated with an increased risk of posttransplant infection by the same microorganism in allo-HSCT. Colonization by resistant gram-negative bacteria was significantly associated with an increased rate of infection by the same pathogen in both transplant procedures. GNB was independently associated with increased mortality at 4 months both in allo-HSCT (hazard ratio, 2.13; 95% confidence interval, 1.45-3.13; P <.001) and auto-HSCT (2.43; 1.22-4.84; P = .01). Conclusions: Pre-engraftment GNB is an independent factor associated with increased mortality rate at 4 months after auto-HSCT and allo-HSCT. Previous infectious history and colonization monitoring represent major indicators of GNB. Clinical Trials registration: NCT02088840.","['(c) The Author 2017.

Therefore, small molecules targeting PRMTs have profound impact for both academic functional studies and clinical disease treatment. Here, we report the discovery of N(1)-(2-((2-chlorophenyl)thio)benzyl)-N(1)-methylethane-1,2-diamine (28d, DCPR049_12), a highly potent inhibitor of type I PRMTs that has good selectivity against a panel of other methyltransferases. Compound 28d effectively inhibits cell proliferation in several leukemia cell lines and reduces the cellular asymmetric arginine dimethylation levels. Serving as an effective inhibitor, 28d demonstrates the mechanism of cell killing in both cell cycle arrest and apoptotic effect as well as downregulation of the pivotal mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) fusion target genes such as HOXA9 and MEIS1, which reflects the critical roles of type I PRMTs in MLL leukemia. These studies present 28d as a valuable inhibitor to investigate the role of type I PRMTs in cancer and other diseases.",,"['Wang, Chen', 'Jiang, Hao', 'Jin, Jia', 'Xie, Yiqian', 'Chen, Zhifeng',

MATERIALS AND METHODS: EgoNet algorithm was used to identify candidate ego-network modules, mainly via constructing differential co-expression network (DCN); selecting ego genes; collecting ego-network modules; refining candidate modules. Afterwards, statistical significance was calculated for these candidate modules. Biological functions of differential ego-network modules were identified using Reactome database. To verify this proposed method can lead to truly positive findings in clinical settings, support vector machine (SVM) was utilized to compute the AUC values for each significant pathway using 3-fold cross-validation method. To predict the reliability of our findings, another established method (attract) was used to identify the differential attractor modules using the same microarray profile. RESULTS: After eliminating the modules with classification accuracy < 0.9 and node number < 15, only ego-network module 30 was eligible. After significance calculation, module 30 was significant. Module 30 was enriched in APC/C-mediated degradation of cell cycle proteins. The AUC for the significant pathway of APC/C-mediated degradation of cell cycle proteins was 0.915. Although the attract method obtained more modules, the module identified by our proposed method owned more gene nodes, and had more classification ability (AUC = 0.915). CONCLUSION: One differential ego-network module identified in childhood ALL resistance to prednisolone based on DCN and EgoNet, might be helpful to reveal the mechanisms underlying prednisolone resistance in childhood ALL.",,"['Jiang, Jian', 'Yin, Xiang-Yun', 'Song, Xue-Wen', 'Xie, Dong', 'Xu, Hui-Juan', 'Yang, Jing', 'Sun, Li-Rong']","['Jiang J', 'Yin XY', 'Song XW', 'Xie D', 'Xu HJ', 'Yang J', 'Sun LR']","[""a Department of Pediatrics , The Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University , Qingdao , Shandong , People's Republic of China."", ""a Department of Pediatrics , The Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University , Qingdao , Shandong , People's Republic of China."", ""b Out-Patient Department , Qingdao First Convalescent Hospital , Jinan Military Region, Qingdao , Shandong , People's Republic of China."", ""a Department of Pediatrics , The Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University , Qingdao , Shandong , People's Republic of China."", ""a Department of Pediatrics , The Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University , Qingdao , Shandong , People's Republic of China."", ""a Department of Pediatrics , The Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University , Qingdao , Shandong , People's Republic of China."", ""a Department of Pediatrics , The Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University , Qingdao , Shandong , People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20171011,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,IM,"['Child, Preschool', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Glucocorticoids/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Prednisolone/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",['NOTNLM'],"['Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'EgoNet', 'module', 'pathway', 'prednisolone resistance']",2017/10/12 06:00,2018/09/06 06:00,['2017/10/12 06:00'],"['2017/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/06 06:00 [medline]', '2017/10/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10245332.2017.1385211 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2018 May;23(4):221-227. doi: 10.1080/10245332.2017.1385211.

Platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha is a tyrosine kinase and a side target for imatinib, a revolutionary drug for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia that has dramatically improved the survival of chronic myeloid leukemia patients. Given the importance of platelet-derived growth factor receptor in platelet development and its inhibition by imatinib, it was intriguing to analyze the role of platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha in relation to imatinib treatment in the development of imatinib-induced thrombocytopenia in chronic myeloid leukemia patients. We hypothesized that two known functional polymorphisms, +68GA insertion/deletion and -909C/A, in the promoter region of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha gene may affect the susceptibility of chronic myeloid leukemia patients receiving imatinib treatment to the development of thrombocytopenia. A case-control study was conducted among a cohort of chronic myeloid leukemia patients admitted to the Lok Nayak Hospital, New Delhi, India. A set of 100 patients of chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase and 100 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were studied. After initiation of imatinib treatment, the hematological response of chronic myeloid leukemia patients was monitored regularly for 2 years, in which the development of thrombocytopenia was the primary end point. Platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha promoter polymorphisms +68GA ins/del and -909C/A were studied by allele-specific polymerase chain reaction. Platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha messenger RNA expression was evaluated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The messenger RNA expression results were expressed as 2(-Deltact) +/- standard deviation. The distribution of +68GA ins/del promoter polymorphism genotypes differed significantly between the thrombocytopenic and non-thrombocytopenic chronic myeloid leukemia patient groups (p < 0.0001). Moreover, +68GA del/del and ins/del genotypes in imatinib-treated chronic myeloid leukemia patients were associated with an increased risk of developing thrombocytopenia, with odds ratios 6.5 (95% confidence interval = 2.02-0.89, p = 0.001) and 6.0 (95% confidence interval = 2.26-15.91, p = 0.0002), respectively. Similarly, -909C/A promoter polymorphism genotype distribution also differed significantly between thrombocytopenic and non-thrombocytopenic chronic myeloid leukemia patient groups (p = 0.02), and a significantly increased risk of imatinib-induced thrombocytopenia was associated with -909C/A polymorphism mutant homozygous (AA) genotypes the odds ratio being 7.7 (95% confidence interval 1.50 to 39.91, p = 0.009). However, no significant risk of imatinib-induced thrombocytopenia was found to be associated with heterozygous genotype (-909C/A) with odds ratio 1.9 (95% confidence interval = 0.86-4.56, p = 1.14). Platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha messenger RNA expression was significantly higher in chronic myeloid leukemia patients compared to controls (p = 0.008). Moreover, patients with imatinib-induced thrombocytopenia had a significantly lower platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha messenger RNA expression, compared to patients without thrombocytopenia (p = 0.01). A differential expression of platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha messenger RNA was observed with respect to different +68 GA ins/del and -909C/A polymorphism genotypes. The +68GA deletion allele and -909A allele were significantly associated with lower expression of platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha messenger RNA. The platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha +68GA del/del, +68GA ins/del, and -909AA genotypes are associated with an increased risk of developing thrombocytopenia in imatinib-treated chronic myeloid leukemia patients. A significantly lower platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha messenger RNA expression accompanies the +68GA deletion allele in an allele dose-dependent manner. Platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha -909AA genotype is also associated with lower expression of platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha. The downregulation of platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha expression may play a causative role in imatinib-induced thrombocytopenia, a common side effect, in the subset of chronic myeloid leukemia patients with platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha +68 GA ins/del, +68 GA del/del, and -909C/A genotypes.",,"['Guru, Sameer Ahmad', 'Mir, Rashid', 'Bhat, Musadiq', 'Najar, Imtiyaz', 'Zuberi, Mariyam', 'Sumi, Mamta', 'Masroor, Mirza', 'Gupta, Naresh', 'Saxena, Alpana']","['Guru SA', 'Mir R', 'Bhat M', 'Najar I', 'Zuberi M', 'Sumi M', 'Masroor M', 'Gupta N', 'Saxena A']","['1 Maulana Azad Medical College, New Delhi, India.', '2 Sher-i-Kashmir Institute of Medical Science, Srinagar, India.', '1 Maulana Azad Medical College, New Delhi, India.', '1 Maulana Azad Medical College, New Delhi, India.', '1 Maulana Azad Medical College, New Delhi, India.', '1 Maulana Azad Medical College, New Delhi, India.', '1 Maulana Azad Medical College, New Delhi, India.', '1 Maulana Azad Medical College, New Delhi, India.', '1 Maulana Azad Medical College, New Delhi, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*genetics', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*adverse effects', 'India', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha/*genetics', 'Risk Factors', 'Thrombocytopenia/chemically induced/*genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'imatinib', 'imatinib-induced thrombocytopenia', 'platelet-derived growth factor receptor']",2017/10/12 06:00,2017/10/19 06:00,['2017/10/12 06:00'],"['2017/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/1010428317713857 [doi]'],ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2017 Oct;39(10):1010428317713857. doi: 10.1177/1010428317713857.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been reported that LIF acts at different stages during mesoderm development. Also, it has been shown that LIF has a cytoprotective effect on neonatal murine cardiomyocytes (CMs) in culture, but little is known about the role of LIF during human cardiogenesis. Thus, we analyzed the effects of LIF on human pluripotent stem cells (PSC) undergoing cardiac differentiation. We first showed that LIF is expressed in the human heart during early development. We found that the addition of LIF within a precise time window during the in vitro differentiation process significantly increased CMs viability. This finding was associated to a decrease in the expression of pro-apoptotic protein Bax, which coincides with a reduction of the apoptotic rate. Therefore, the addition of LIF may represent a promising strategy for increasing CMs survival derived from PSCs.",,"['Bluguermann, Carolina', 'Romorini, Leonardo', 'Evseenko, Denis', 'Garate, Ximena', 'Neiman, Gabriel', 'Sevlever, Gustavo Emilio', 'Scassa, Maria Elida', 'Miriuka, Santiago Gabriel']","['Bluguermann C', 'Romorini L', 'Evseenko D', 'Garate X', 'Neiman G', 'Sevlever GE', 'Scassa ME', 'Miriuka SG']","['LIAN-CONICET, FLENI - Ruta 9 Km 52.5, Belen de Escobar, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'LIAN-CONICET, FLENI - Ruta 9 Km 52.5, Belen de Escobar, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET), Ciudad Autonoma de Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Hoffman Medical Research Center, Universtiy of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'LIAN-CONICET, FLENI - Ruta 9 Km 52.5, Belen de Escobar, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'LIAN-CONICET, FLENI - Ruta 9 Km 52.5, Belen de Escobar, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'LIAN-CONICET, FLENI - Ruta 9 Km 52.5, Belen de Escobar, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'LIAN-CONICET, FLENI - Ruta 9 Km 52.5, Belen de Escobar, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'LIAN-CONICET, FLENI - Ruta 9 Km 52.5, Belen de Escobar, Buenos Aires, Argentina. smiriuka@fleni.org.ar.', 'Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET), Ciudad Autonoma de Buenos Aires, Argentina. smiriuka@fleni.org.ar.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171010,United States,J Cardiovasc Transl Res,Journal of cardiovascular translational research,101468585,IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Human Embryonic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Time Factors', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Apoptosis', '*Cardiac differentiation', '*Cardiac progenitor cell', '*Cardiomyocyte', '*Embryonic stem cells', '*LIF', '*Leukocyte inhibitory factor', '*Pluripotent stem cells']",2017/10/12 06:00,2019/01/29 06:00,['2017/10/12 06:00'],"['2017/06/15 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/29 06:00 [medline]', '2017/10/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12265-017-9769-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s12265-017-9769-6 [pii]']",ppublish,J Cardiovasc Transl Res. 2018 Feb;11(1):1-13. doi: 10.1007/s12265-017-9769-6.

With the institution of preemptive ganciclovir therapy early after transplant, most patients survive episodes of life-threatening CMV infection during the early months (usually the first 3 months) after transplant and hence late onset of CMV disease, such as CMV retinitis, is being recognized more frequently. Direct involvement of the macula or optic head remains the leading cause of visual loss in patients with CMV retinitis, but there are few studies investigating the management of this condition.

Previous studies showed that the interaction between CBFbeta-smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SMMHC; encoded by CBFB-MYH11) and RUNX1 plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of this leukemia. Recently, it was shown that chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein-7 (CHD7) interacts with RUNX1 and suppresses RUNX1-induced expansion of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. These results suggest that CHD7 is also critical for CBFB-MYH11-induced leukemogenesis. To test this hypothesis, we generated Chd7(f)(/f)Mx1-CreCbfb(+/56M) mice, which expressed the Cbfb-MYH11 fusion gene and deactivated Chd7 in hematopoietic cells upon inducing Cre with polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid. The Lin(-)Sca1(-)c-Kit(+) (LK) population was significantly lower in Chd7(f/f)Mx1-CreCbfb(+/56M) mice than in Mx1-CreCbfb(+/56M) mice. In addition, there were fewer 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine-positive cells in the LK population in Chd7(f/f)Mx1-CreCbfb(+/56M) mice, and genes associated with cell cycle, cell growth, and proliferation were differentially expressed between Chd7(f/f)Mx1-CreCbfb(+/56M) and Mx1-CreCbfb(+/56M) leukemic cells. In vitro studies showed that CHD7 interacted with CBFbeta-SMMHC through RUNX1 and that CHD7 enhanced transcriptional activity of RUNX1 and CBFbeta-SMMHC on Csf1r, a RUNX1 target gene. Moreover, RNA sequencing of c-Kit(+) cells showed that CHD7 functions mostly through altering the expression of RUNX1 target genes. Most importantly, Chd7 deficiency delayed Cbfb-MYH11-induced leukemia in both primary and transplanted mice. These data indicate that Chd7 is important for Cbfb-MYH11-induced leukemogenesis by facilitating RUNX1 regulation of transcription and cellular proliferation.",,"['Zhen, Tao', 'Kwon, Erika M', 'Zhao, Ling', 'Hsu, Jingmei', 'Hyde, R Katherine', 'Lu, Ying', 'Alemu, Lemlem', 'Speck, Nancy A', 'Liu, P Paul']","['Zhen T', 'Kwon EM', 'Zhao L', 'Hsu J', 'Hyde RK', 'Lu Y', 'Alemu L', 'Speck NA', 'Liu PP']","['Oncogenesis and Development Section, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Oncogenesis and Development Section, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Oncogenesis and Development Section, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE.', 'Experimental Immunology Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD; and.', 'Oncogenesis and Development Section, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute and.', 'Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Oncogenesis and Development Section, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20171010,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Gene Deletion', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics']",,,2017/10/12 06:00,2017/12/19 06:00,['2017/10/12 06:00'],"['2017/04/19 00:00 [received]', '2017/09/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/19 06:00 [medline]', '2017/10/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)32681-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2017-04-780106 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2017 Nov 30;130(22):2431-2442. doi: 10.1182/blood-2017-04-780106.

We investigated the impact of SETD2 mutations on chemotherapy sensitivity in isogenic leukemia cell lines and in murine leukemia generated from a conditional knockout of Setd2. SETD2 mutations led to resistance to DNA-damaging agents, cytarabine, 6-thioguanine, doxorubicin, and etoposide, but not to a non-DNA damaging agent, l-asparaginase. H3K36me3 localizes components of the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway and SETD2 mutation impaired DDR, blunting apoptosis induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy. Consistent with local recruitment of DDR, genomic regions with higher H3K36me3 had a lower mutation rate, which was increased with SETD2 mutation. Heterozygous conditional inactivation of Setd2 in a murine model decreased the latency of MLL-AF9-induced leukemia and caused resistance to cytarabine treatment in vivo, whereas homozygous loss delayed leukemia formation. Treatment with JIB-04, an inhibitor of the H3K9/36me3 demethylase KDM4A, restored H3K36me3 levels and sensitivity to cytarabine.

RP S19 polymer binds to the reciprocal C5aRs on erythroblast-like cells and macrophage-like cells derived from human monocytic THP-1 cells and promotes differentiation into reticulocyte-like cells through enucleation in vitro. To examine the roles of RP S19 polymer in mouse erythropoiesis, we prepared Q137E mutant RP S19 gene knock-in C57BL/6J mice. In contrast to wild-type mice, erythroblast numbers at the preliminary stage (CD71(high)/TER119(low)) in spleen based on transferrin receptor (CD71) and glycophorin A (TER119) values and erythrocyte numbers in orbital artery bloods were not largely changed in knock-in mice. Conversely, erythroblast numbers at the early stage (CD71(high)/TER119(high)) were significantly decreased in spleen by knock-in mice. The reduction of early erythroblast numbers in spleen was enhanced by the phenylhydrazine-induced pernicious anemia model knock-in mice and was rescued by a functional analogue of RP S19 dimer S-tagged C5a/RP S19. These data indicated that RP S19 polymer plays the roles in the early erythroblast differentiation of C57BL/6J mouse spleen.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier GmbH.

We determined the effect of salidroside on oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL)-induced foam cell formation and apoptosis in THP1 human acute monocytic leukemia cells and investigated the associated molecular mechanisms. METHODS: THP1-derived macrophages were incubated with salidroside for 5 h and then exposed to ox-LDL for 24 h to induce foam cell formation. Cytotoxicity, lipid deposition, apoptosis, and the expression of various proteins were tested using the CCK8 kit, Oil Red O staining, flow cytometry, and western blotting, respectively. RESULTS: Ox-LDL treatment alone promoted macrophage-derived foam cell formation, while salidroside treatment alone inhibited it (p < 0.05). The number of early/late apoptotic cells decreased with salidroside treatment in a dose-dependent manner (p < 0.05). Salidroside dramatically upregulated nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2, but had no effect on heme oxygenase-1 expression; moreover, it markedly downregulated ox-LDL receptor 1 and upregulated ATP-binding cassette transporter A1. Salidroside also obviously decreased the phosphorylation of JNK, ERK, p38 MAPK, and increased that of Akt. However, the total expression of these proteins was not affected. CONCLUSION: Based on our findings, we speculate that salidroside can suppress ox-LDL-induced THP1-derived foam cell formation and apoptosis, partly by regulating the MAPK and Akt signaling pathways.",,"['Ni, Jing', 'Li, Yuanmin', 'Li, Weiming', 'Guo, Rong']","['Ni J', 'Li Y', 'Li W', 'Guo R']","[""Department of Cardiology, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, 301 Yan Chang Zhong Road, Shanghai, 200072, China."", ""Department of Cardio-Thoracic Surgery, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, 301 Yan Chang Zhong Road, Shanghai, 200072, China."", ""Department of Cardiology, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, 301 Yan Chang Zhong Road, Shanghai, 200072, China. lwmsoncentury@126.com."", ""Department of Cardiology, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, 301 Yan Chang Zhong Road, Shanghai, 200072, China. doctorguorong@aliyun.com.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20171010,England,Lipids Health Dis,Lipids in health and disease,101147696,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Antioxidants/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Foam Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Glucosides/*pharmacology', 'Heme Oxygenase-1/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lipoproteins, LDL/*antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 4/genetics/metabolism', 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2/genetics/metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Phenols/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics/metabolism', 'Scavenger Receptors, Class E/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects/genetics', 'THP-1 Cells', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/genetics/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['Akt pathway', 'Foam cell', 'MAPK pathway', 'Salidroside', 'THP1']",2017/10/12 06:00,2018/06/02 06:00,['2017/10/12 06:00'],"['2017/08/23 00:00 [received]', '2017/09/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12944-017-0582-7 [doi]', '10.1186/s12944-017-0582-7 [pii]']",epublish,Lipids Health Dis. 2017 Oct 10;16(1):198. doi: 10.1186/s12944-017-0582-7.,PMC5635575,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 1)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Glucosides)', '0 (Lipoproteins, LDL)', '0 (NF-E2-Related Factor 2)', '0 (NFE2L2 protein, human)', '0 (Phenols)', '0 (Scavenger Receptors, Class E)', '0 (oxidized low density lipoprotein)', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (HMOX1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (Heme Oxygenase-1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 4)', 'M983H6N1S9 (rhodioloside)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To examine whether cognitive neuroscience paradigms provided additional insights into neurocognitive and behavioral late effects in ALL survivors, we assessed cognition and behavior using a selection of cognitive neuroscience tasks and standardized measures probing domains previously demonstrated to be affected by chemotherapy. 130 ALL survivors and 158 control subjects, between 8 and 18 years old at time of testing, completed the n-back (working memory) and stop-signal (response inhibition) tasks. ALL survivors also completed standardized measures of intelligence (Wechsler Intelligence Scales [WISC-IV]), motor skills (Grooved Pegboard), math abilities (WIAT-III), and executive functions (Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System). Parents completed behavioral measures of executive functions (Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function [BRIEF]) and attention (Conners-3). ALL survivors exhibited deficiencies in working memory and response inhibition compared with controls. ALL survivors also exhibited deficits on WISC-IV working memory and processing speed, Grooved Pegboard, WIAT-III addition and subtraction fluency, and numerical operations, as well as DKEFS number-letter switching. Parent reports suggested more attention deficits (Conners-3) and behavioral difficulties (BRIEF) in ALL survivors compared with referenced norms.

It has a poor long-term survival with a high relapse rate and at relapse, is commonly resistant to available therapies. The current combination of daunorubicin (DNR) for three days and cytarabine (Ara-C) as a continuous infusion for seven days, more commonly known as '3 + 7' has remained essentially unaltered over the last forty-four years and remains the standard induction regimen internationally. Areas covered: This paper will briefly review clinically important trials related to '3 + 7'. Somatic mutations in AML that are linked to chemoresistance to '3 + 7'will be discussed. Other topics covered include the novel ratiometric agent containing daunorubicin and cytarabine, CPX-351, and midostaurin in FLT3 mutated AML. Expert opinion: '3 + 7' continues to be the backbone of therapy for AML. However, genetic risk stratification should be used to determine patients who are unlikely to respond to standard intensive chemotherapy and hence, should be enrolled onto a clinical trial upfront. This will facilitate development of newer effective treatment strategies in AML. Patients with mutations that are associated with chemoresistance should be offered therapies which may circumvent or overcome these pathways.",,"['Murphy, Tracy', 'Yee, Karen W L']","['Murphy T', 'Yee KWL']","['a Division of Medical Oncology and Hematology , University Health Network - Princess Margaret Cancer Centre , Toronto , Canada.', 'a Division of Medical Oncology and Hematology , University Health Network - Princess Margaret Cancer Centre , Toronto , Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20171020,England,Expert Opin Pharmacother,Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,100897346,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'CPX-351', 'anthracycline', 'cytarabine', 'daunorubicin', 'midostaurin']",2017/10/12 06:00,2018/02/07 06:00,['2017/10/12 06:00'],"['2017/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/07 06:00 [medline]', '2017/10/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/14656566.2017.1391216 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Pharmacother. 2017 Nov;18(16):1765-1780. doi: 10.1080/14656566.2017.1391216.

As these investigations did not uncover candidate targets with a profile as favorable as CD19, we developed a generalizable combinatorial targeting strategy fulfilling stringent efficacy and safety criteria.

To inhibit Mcl-1, and initiate apoptosis, an interaction between BH3-only proteins and Mcl-1 anti-apoptotic protein is necessary. These protein-protein interactions exhibit some selectivity: Mcl-1 binds specifically to Noxa, whereas Bim and Puma bind strongly to all anti-apoptotic proteins. Even if the three-dimensional (3D) structures of several Mcl-1/BH3-only complexes have been solved, the BH3-only binding specificity to Mcl-1 is still not completely understood. In this study, molecular dynamics simulations were used to elucidate the molecular basis of the interactions with Mcl-1. Our results corroborate the importance of four conserved hydrophobic residues and a conserved aspartic acid on BH3-only as a common binding pattern. Furthermore, our results highlight the contribution of the fifth hydrophobic residue in the C-terminal part and a negatively charged patch in the N-terminal of BH3-only peptides as important for their fixation to Mcl-1.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are considered an important parameter in the immunosuppression of acute myeloid leukemia, where they suppress the cytotoxic action of immune cells such as NK cells and T cells. This study demonstrates a way to achieve effective inhibition of immunosuppression by loading the drug histamine dihydrochloride (HDC) onto graphene quantum dots (GQDs) using hyaluronic acid as a targeting moiety for K-562 cells. The prepared GQD-based nanoplatform was stable and achieved high drug loading on the surface, which resulted in a sustained drug release profile over a period of time. Additionally, the drug-loaded graphene nanoplatform proved to be non-toxic at higher concentrations to K-562 cells and could be effectively taken up into cells due to the targeting moiety.

METHODS: mRNA level was examined by qPCR. The retroviral gene expression, shRNA knockdown and chromatin-immunoprecipitation are used to observe IKAROS regulation on PHF2 transcription. RESULTS: PHF2 expression is significantly reduced in subsets of ALL patients, and PHF2 (low) expression correlates with leukemia cell proliferation and an elevation of several poor prognostic markers in B-cell ALL. IKAROS directly promotes PHF2 expression and patients with IKAROS deletion have significantly lower PHF2 expression. Casein kinase II (CK2) inhibitor significantly promotes PHF2 expression in an IKAROS-dependent manner, and casein kinase II inhibitor treatment also results in an increase of PHF2 expression and enrichment of IKAROS and H3K4me3 at PHF2 promoter in primary cells.

However, its role in self-renewal of haematopoietic stem cells is controversial and remains to be clarified. The aim of this study was to understand the role of MEK/ERK pathway in ex vivo expansion of mononuclear cells (MNCs) and purified CD34(+) cells, both derived from human umbilical cord blood (hUCB). Based on our results, culturing the cells in the presence of an inhibitor of MEK/ERK pathway-PD0325901 (PD)-significantly reduces the expansion of CD34(+) and CD34(+) CD38(-) cells, while there is no change in the expression of stemness-related genes (HOXB4, BMI1). Moreover, in vivo analysis demonstrates that PD reduces engraftment capacity of ex vivo expanded CD34(+) cells. Notably, when ERK pathway is blocked in UCB-MNCs, spontaneous erythroid differentiation is promoted, found in concomitant with increasing number of burst-forming unit-erythroid colony (BFU-E) as well as enhancement of erythroid glycophorin-A marker. These results are in total conformity with up-regulation of some erythroid enhancer genes (TAL1, GATA2, LMO2) and down-regulation of some erythroid repressor genes (JUN, PU1) as well. Taken together, our results support the idea that MEK/ERK pathway has a critical role in achieving the correct balance between self-renewal and differentiation of UCB cells. Also, we suggest that inhibition of ERK signalling could likely be a new key for erythroid induction of UCB-haematopoietic progenitor cells.","['(c) 2017 The Authors.

We previously demonstrated that upregulation of fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4) promotes AML aggressiveness through enhanced DNMT1-dependent DNA methylation. Here, we demonstrate that FABP4 upregulation in AML cells occurs through vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling, thus elucidating a crucial FABP4-DNMT1 regulatory feedback loop in AML biology. We show that FABP4 dysfunction by its selective inhibitor BMS309403 leads to downregulation of DNMT1, decrease of global DNA methylation and re-expression of p15(INK4B) tumor suppressor gene by promoter DNA hypomethylation in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo. Functionally, BMS309403 suppresses cell colony formation, induces cell differentiation, and, importantly, impairs leukemic disease progression in mouse models of leukemia. Our findings highlight AML-promoting properties of the FABP4-DNMT1 vicious loop, and identify an attractive class of therapeutic agents with a high potential for clinical use in AML patients.

We recently reported that abacavir, an anti-HIV-1 drug, potently and selectively kills ATL cells. This effect was attributed to the reduced expression of tyrosyl-DNA-phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP1), a DNA repair enzyme, in ATL cells. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the downregulation of TDP1 in ATL cells remains elusive. Here we identified the core promoter of the TDP1 gene, which contains a conserved nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF-1) binding site. Overexpression of NRF-1 increased TDP1-promoter activity, whereas the introduction of dominant-negative NRF-1 repressed such activity. Overexpression of NRF-1 also upregulated endogenous TDP-1 expression, while introduction of shNRF-1 suppressed TDP1 in Jurkat T cells, making them susceptible to abacavir. These results indicate that NRF-1 is a positive transcriptional regulator of TDP1-gene expression.

The ibrutinib target, Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), is essential for B-cell receptor signaling, and most resistant cases carry mutations in BTK or PLCG2, a downstream effector target of BTK. Recent findings show that MI-2, a small molecule inhibitor of the para-caspase MALT1, is effective in preclinical models of another type of BCR pathway-dependent lymphoma. We therefore studied the activity of MI-2 against CLL and ibrutinib-resistant CLL. Treatment of CLL cells in vitro with MI-2 inhibited MALT1 proteolytic activity reduced BCR and NF-kappaB signaling, inhibited nuclear translocation of RelB and p50, and decreased Bcl-xL levels. MI-2 selectively induced dose and time-dependent apoptosis in CLL cells, sparing normal B lymphocytes. Furthermore, MI-2 abrogated survival signals provided by stromal cells and BCR cross-linking and was effective against CLL cells harboring features associated with poor outcomes, including 17p deletion and unmutated IGHV Notably, MI-2 was effective against CLL cells collected from patients harboring mutations conferring resistance to ibrutinib. Overall, our findings provide a preclinical rationale for the clinical development of MALT1 inhibitors in CLL, in particular for ibrutinib-resistant forms of this disease.

Mutations in the human GRAF1 gene are associated with acute myeloid leukemia, but its normal role in myeloid cell development remains unclear. We show that Graf, the Drosophila ortholog of GRAF1, is expressed and specifically localizes to GEEC endocytic membranes in macrophage-like plasmatocytes. We also find that loss of Graf impairs GEEC endocytosis, enhances EGFR signaling and induces a plasmatocyte overproliferation phenotype that requires the EGFR signaling cascade. Mechanistically, Graf-dependent GEEC endocytosis serves as a major route for EGFR internalization at high, but not low, doses of the predominant Drosophila EGFR ligand Spitz (Spi), and is indispensable for efficient EGFR degradation and signal attenuation. Finally, Graf interacts directly with EGFR in a receptor ubiquitylation-dependent manner, suggesting a mechanism by which Graf promotes GEEC endocytosis of EGFR at high Spi. Based on our findings, we propose a model in which Graf functions to downregulate EGFR signaling by facilitating Spi-induced receptor internalization through GEEC endocytosis, thereby restraining plasmatocyte proliferation.",['(c) 2017.

The study included 65 patient/donor pairs who received AHSCT from HLA-matched identical siblings. KIR genotyping was done for donors using reverse sequence specific oligonucleotide probes (rSSO) coupled with luminex technology, while HLA-C genotyping was performed in patients using rSSO strip assay. In multivariate analysis, KIR2DS4 was associated with significant reduced incidence of relapse (p=.002). A trend towards reduced incidence of relapse was also observed with more than two KIR B motifs (p=.09), whereas a significant increased relapse was associated with homozygous HLA-C2 ligand compared to combined C1/C2 and C1/C1 (p=.04). Activating KIR2DS3 was associated with rapid leukocyte engraftment (p=.02). While, KIR 2DL5 was associated with decreased CMV infection (p=.03) and better platelets engraftment (p=.05).

While epigenetic aberrations play a pivotal role in acute myeloid leukemia pathophysiology, molecular signatures such as change in the DNA methylation patterns and genetic mutations in enzymes needed to the methylation process can also be helpful for classifying acute myeloid leukemia. Our study aims to unveil the relevance of DNMT3A and TET2 genes in global and specific methylation patterns in acute myeloid leukemia. Peripheral blood samples from 110 untreated patients with acute myeloid leukemia and 15 healthy control individuals were collected. Global 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in genomic DNA from peripheral blood leukocytes were measured by using the MethylFlashTM Quantification kits. DNMT3A and TET2 expression levels were evaluated by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The R882A hotspot of DNMT3A and exons 6-10 of TET2 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and sequenced using the Sanger method. Methylation patterns of 16 gene promoters were evaluated by pyrosequencing after treating DNA with sodium bisulfite, and their transcriptional products were measured by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction.Here, we demonstrate altered levels of 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine and highly variable transcript levels of DNMT3A and TET2 in peripheral blood leukocytes from acute myeloid leukemia patients. We found a mutation prevalence of 2.7% for DNMT3A and 11.8% for TET2 in the Mexican population with this disease. The average overall survival of acute myeloid leukemia patients with DNMT3A mutations was only 4 months. In addition, we showed that mutations in DNMT3A and TET2 may cause irregular DNA methylation patterns and transcriptional expression levels in 16 genes known to be involved in acute myeloid leukemia pathogenesis. Our findings suggest that alterations in DNMT3A and TET2 may be associated with acute myeloid leukemia prognosis. Furthermore, alterations in these enzymes affect normal methylation patterns in acute myeloid leukemia- specific genes, which in turn, may influence patient survival.",,"['Ponciano-Gomez, Alberto', 'Martinez-Tovar, Adolfo', 'Vela-Ojeda, Jorge', 'Olarte-Carrillo, Irma', 'Centeno-Cruz, Federico', 'Garrido, Efrain']","['Ponciano-Gomez A', 'Martinez-Tovar A', 'Vela-Ojeda J', 'Olarte-Carrillo I', 'Centeno-Cruz F', 'Garrido E']","['1 Department of Genetics and Molecular Biology, CINVESTAV-IPN, Mexico City, Mexico.', '2 Department of Molecular Biology, Hematology Service, Hospital General de Mexico, ""Dr Eduardo Liceaga,"" Mexico City, Mexico.', '3 Umbilical Cord Blood Bank, La Raza Medical Center, Mexican Institute of Social Security, Mexico City, Mexico.', '2 Department of Molecular Biology, Hematology Service, Hospital General de Mexico, ""Dr Eduardo Liceaga,"" Mexico City, Mexico.', '4 Immunogenomics and Metabolic Disease Laboratory, Instituto Nacional de Medicina Genomica, SS, Mexico City, Mexico.', '1 Department of Genetics and Molecular Biology, CINVESTAV-IPN, Mexico City, Mexico.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,IM,"['DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/*genetics', 'DNA Methylation/*genetics', 'DNA Methyltransferase 3A', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Dioxygenases', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'DNMT3A', 'TET2', 'methylation', 'mutation', 'survival', 'transcription']",2017/10/11 06:00,2017/10/19 06:00,['2017/10/11 06:00'],"['2017/10/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/1010428317732181 [doi]'],ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2017 Oct;39(10):1010428317732181. doi: 10.1177/1010428317732181.,,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DNMT3A protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Dioxygenases)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (TET2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA Methyltransferase 3A)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This mAb acts through immune-mediated mechanisms, in particular complement-dependent cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity by natural killer cells as well as antibody-dependent phagocytosis by macrophages. Apoptosis induction is another mechanism of this antibody. Computational docking is the method of predicting the conformation of an antibody-antigen from its separated elements. Validation of the designed antibodies is carried out by docking tools. Increased affinity enhances the biological action of the antibody, which in turn improves the therapeutic effects. Furthermore, the increased antibody affinity can reduce the therapeutic dose of the antibody, resulting in lower toxicity and handling cost. Methods: Considering the importance of this issue, using in silico analysis such as docking and molecular dynamics, we aimed to find the important amino acids of the Ofatumumab antibody and then replaced these amino acids with others to improve antibody-binding affinity. Finally, we examined the binding affinity of antibody variants to antigen. Results: Our findings showed that variant 3 mutations have improved the characteristics of antibody binding compared to normal Ofatumumab antibodies. Conclusion: In the present study, the designed anti-CD20 antibodies showed to have potential for improved affinity compared to commercial Ofatumumab.",,"['Payandeh, Zahra', 'Rajabibazl, Masoumeh', 'Mortazavi, Yousef', 'Rahimpour, Azam', 'Taromchi, Amir Hossein']","['Payandeh Z', 'Rajabibazl M', 'Mortazavi Y', 'Rahimpour A', 'Taromchi AH']","['Department of Medical Biotechnology and Nanotechnology, Faculty of Medicine, Zanjan University of Medical Sciences, Zanjan, Iran.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'School of Advanced Technologies in Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Biotechnology and Nanotechnology, Faculty of Medicine, Zanjan University of Medical Sciences, Zanjan, Iran.', 'Cancer Gene Therapy Research Center, Faculty of Medicine, Zanjan University of Medical Sciences, Zanjan, Iran.', 'School of Advanced Technologies in Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Biotechnology and Nanotechnology, Faculty of Medicine, Zanjan University of Medical Sciences, Zanjan, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20171010,Iran,Iran Biomed J,Iranian biomedical journal,9814853,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Monoclonal antibody', '*Ofatumumab', '*Protein engineering']",2017/10/11 06:00,2017/10/11 06:01,['2017/10/11 06:00'],"['2017/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/11 06:01 [medline]', '2017/10/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.22034/ibj.22.3.180 [doi]'],ppublish,Iran Biomed J. 2018 May 1;22(3):180-92. doi: 10.22034/ibj.22.3.180.

Combination therapy with methotrexate was successful in the treatment of canine lymphoma, mammary tumor and invasive urinary bladder cancer. Lymphoma, the most common hematopoietic cancer in dogs, and leukemia are sensitive to chemotherapy, which is why methotrexate may be an important treatment option for these diseases. Although methotrexate is already used in veterinary oncology its effects on canine cancer cells has not been tested. The aim of the study was to evaluate for the first time methotrexate concentration-dependent cytotoxicity and its capability of inducing apoptosis in selected canine lymphoma/leukemia cell lines: CLBL-1, GL-1 and CL-1 as a first step before the in vitro development of new therapeutic options with the use of methotrexate. RESULTS: Methotrexate exhibited concentration-dependent inhibitory effect on proliferation of all the examined cell lines with different degree of apoptosis induction. The most methotrexate sensitive cells belonged to CL-1 cell line derived from T cell neoplasia and previously characterized by high resistance to the majority of anticancer drugs used in the therapy of lymphoma/leukemia in dogs. Canine lymphoma and leukemia cell lines are sensitive to methotrexate, and this drug may be useful in effective treatment of canine neoplasms and especially of T-type leukemia/lymphoma.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of the present study was to determine the dose-rate effect of laser-generated ultrashort pulses of 4 MeV electron beam radiation on DNA damage and repair in human cells. The dose rate was increased via changing the pulse repetition frequency, without increasing the electron energy. The human chronic myeloid leukemia K-562 cell line was used to estimate the DNA damage and repair after irradiation, via the comet assay. A distribution analysis of the DNA damage was performed. The same mean level of initial DNA damages was observed at low (3.6 Gy/min) and high (36 Gy/min) dose-rate irradiation. In the case of low-dose-rate irradiation, the detected DNA damages were completely repairable, whereas the high-dose-rate irradiation demonstrated a lower level of reparability. The distribution analysis of initial DNA damages after high-dose-rate irradiation revealed a shift towards higher amounts of damage and a broadening in distribution. Thus, increasing the dose rate via changing the pulse frequency of ultrafast electrons leads to an increase in the complexity of DNA damages, with a consequent decrease in their reparability. Since the application of an ultrashort pulsed electron beam permits us to describe the primary radiobiological effects, it can be assumed that the observed dose-rate effect on DNA damage/repair is mainly caused by primary lesions appearing at the moment of irradiation.","['(c) The Author 2017.

We conducted a population-based study to determine the risk of cancer in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: Using a territory-wide IBD registry in Hong Kong, we identified 2621 patients with IBD and no history of cancer from 1990 to 2016. We followed them from diagnosis until either September 2016, cancer development, proctocolectomy, or death. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) of overall cancer and site-specific cancers were calculated. RESULTS: Of 2621 patients with IBD (1108 CD; 1603 UC; median age, 49 yr; 59.5% men) followed for 26,234 person-years, 88 patients developed cancer after IBD diagnosis. Patients with CD had an increased risk of anorectal cancers (SIR 4.11; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.84-9.14) and hematological cancers (SIR 3.86, 95% CI, 1.61-9.27) including leukemia (SIR 5.98; 95% CI, 1.93-18.54). Nonmelanoma skin cancer was significantly increased in both CD and UC (CD: SIR 13.88; 95% CI, 1.95-98.51; UC: SIR 9.05; 95% CI, 2.26-36.19). Patients with CD had a higher risk of renal-cell carcinoma (SIR 6.89; 95% CI, 2.22-21.37), and patients with UC had a higher risk of prostate cancer (SIR 2.47; 95% CI, 1.24-4.95).

Anteroposterior and transverse distances and cross-sectional areas were measured and calculated at the C2, C4, C6, T2, and T6 vertebral levels. In the pathological study, spinal cord autopsy specimens were compared between a HAM/TSP case and an adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma case. In both the MRI and pathological studies, HAM/TSP spinal cords demonstrated more severe atrophy in the anteroposterior direction than those of controls. The spinal cord atrophy and pathological changes in HAM/TSP occurred predominantly in the white matter, especially in the lateral columns. This is the first report indicating spinal cord atrophy in the anteroposterior direction using MRI. In pathological analysis, atrophy and pathological changes were prominent in areas of the spinal cord with slow blood flow.

The association of cancer cells with dysregulated signaling pathways linked to RTKs represents a key element in targeted cancer therapies. The tyrosine kinase mast/stem cell growth factor receptor KIT is an example of a clinically relevant RTK. KIT is targeted for cancer therapy in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML).

The histone variant macroH2A1.1 contains a macrodomain capable of binding NAD(+)-derived metabolites. Here we report that macroH2A1.1 is rapidly induced during myogenic differentiation through a switch in alternative splicing, and that myotubes that lack macroH2A1.1 have a defect in mitochondrial respiratory capacity. We found that the metabolite-binding macrodomain was essential for sustained optimal mitochondrial function but dispensable for gene regulation. Through direct binding, macroH2A1.1 inhibits basal poly-ADP ribose polymerase 1 (PARP-1) activity and thus reduces nuclear NAD(+) consumption. The resultant accumulation of the NAD(+) precursor NMN allows for maintenance of mitochondrial NAD(+) pools that are critical for respiration. Our data indicate that macroH2A1.1-containing chromatin regulates mitochondrial respiration by limiting nuclear NAD(+) consumption and establishing a buffer of NAD(+) precursors in differentiated

However, specific information regarding long-term prognosis and risk factors for late mortality after CD34+ cell-selected allo-HSCT is lacking. We conducted a single-center landmark analysis in 276 patients alive without relapse 1 year after CD34+ cell-selected allo-HSCT for AML (n=164), ALL (n=33) or myelodysplastic syndrome (n=79). At 5 years' follow-up after the 1-year landmark (range 0.03-13 years), estimated relapse-free survival (RFS) was 73% and overall survival (OS) 76%. The 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse and non-relapse mortality (NRM) were 11% and 16%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Comorbidity Index score3 correlated with marginally worse RFS (hazard ratio (HR) 1.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97-3.28, P=0.06) and significantly worse OS (HR 2.53, 95% CI 1.26-5.08, P=0.004). Despite only 24% of patients with acute GvHD within 1 year, this also significantly correlated with worse RFS and OS, with increasing grades of acute GvHD associating with increasingly poorer survival on multivariate analysis (P<0.0001). Of 63 deaths after the landmark, GvHD accounted for 27% of deaths and was the most common cause of late mortality, followed by relapse and infection.

It is unclear to what extent extramedullary sites are impacted by a graft-versus-leukemia effect. DESIGN/METHOD: Case Series and review of the literature. RESULTS: We present 2 cases of pediatric patients with Acute Myelogenous Leukemia who developed isolated testicular relapse more than a year following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation despite having had extensive cGVHD. Both patients were off immunosuppression and cGVHD medications when testicular relapse occurred. At time of relapse, these patients were negative for minimal residual disease in the marrow and the marrow contained all donor cells by engraftment studies. No evidence was found for lymphocyte infiltration into the affected testicle in either patient. CONCLUSIONS: Although a reduction of marrow relapse can be appreciated in patients with myeloid leukemias and chronic GVHD, this graft-versus-leukemia process may be less robust in extramedullary sites and careful surveillance should be maintained to allow early intervention before overt marrow involvement.",,"['Dang, Brian N', 'De Oliveira, Satiro', 'Bowles, LaVette', 'Moore, Theodore B']","['Dang BN', 'De Oliveira S', 'Bowles L', 'Moore TB']","['Department of Pediatrics, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Los Angeles, CA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Biopsy', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*diagnosis/*etiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/diagnosis/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Testicular Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*secondary', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,,2017/10/11 06:00,2017/11/04 06:00,['2017/10/10 06:00'],"['2017/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/04 06:00 [medline]', '2017/10/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MPH.0000000000000989 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2017 Nov;39(8):e423-e425. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0000000000000989.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RUNX1 is involved in embryonic development, hematopoiesis, angiogenesis, tumorigenesis and immune response. In the past few decades, studies mainly focused on the effect of RUNX1 on acute leukemia and cancer. Only few studies about the function of RUNX1 in the pathological process of pulmonary diseases have been reported. Recent studies have demonstrated that RUNX1 is highly expressed in both mesenchymal and epithelial compartments of the developing and postnatal lung and that it plays a critical role in the lipopolysaccharide induced lung inflammation by regulating the NF-kB pathway. RUNX1 participates in the regulation of the NF-kB signaling pathway through interaction with IkB kinase complex in the cytoplasm or interaction with the NF-kB subunit P50. NF-kB is well-known signaling pathway necessary for inflammatory response in the lung. This review is to highlight the RUNX1 structure, isoforms and to present the mechanism that RUNX1 regulates NF-kB. This will illustrate the great potential role of RUNX1 in the inflammation signaling pathway in pulmonary diseases.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.org.']","['Tang, Xiaoju', 'Sun, Ling', 'Wang, Gang', 'Chen, Bojiang', 'Luo, Fengming']","['Tang X', 'Sun L', 'Wang G', 'Chen B', 'Luo F']","['Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, 37 Guo Xue Xiang, Chengdu 610041, China.', 'Laboratory of Cardiovascular Diseases, Research Center of Regeneration Medicine, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, 37 Guo Xue Xiang, Chengdu 610041, China.', 'Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, 37 Guo Xue Xiang, Chengdu 610041, China.', 'Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, 37 Guo Xue Xiang, Chengdu 610041, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Protein Pept Sci,Current protein & peptide science,100960529,IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Lung/metabolism', 'Lung Diseases/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Isoforms/chemistry/metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis, Protein', 'Signal Transduction']",['NOTNLM'],"['*IKK', '*NF-kB', '*P50', '*RUNX1', '*lung', '*pulmonary inflammation']",2017/10/11 06:00,2018/10/03 06:00,['2017/10/10 06:00'],"['2017/06/30 00:00 [received]', '2017/09/27 00:00 [revised]', '2017/09/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/03 06:00 [medline]', '2017/10/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['CPPS-EPUB-86263 [pii]', '10.2174/1389203718666171009111835 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Protein Pept Sci. 2018;19(2):172-178. doi: 10.2174/1389203718666171009111835.,PMC5876917,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The development of modern chemotherapy agents, which had begun after the Second World War, was markedly accelerated by the discovery of the structure of DNA and its role in cancer biology and tumor cell division. The path travelled from the first temporary remissions observed in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated with single-agent antimetabolites until the first cures achieved by multi-agent chemotherapy regimens was incredibly short. Despite great successes, however, conventional genotoxic cytostatics suffered from an inherently narrow therapeutic index and extensive toxicity, which in many instances limited their clinical utilization. In the last decade of the 20th century, increasing knowledge on the biology of certain malignancies resulted in the conception and development of first molecularly targeted agents designed to inhibit specific druggable molecules involved in the survival of cancer cells. Advances in technology and genetic engineering enabled the production of structurally complex anticancer macromolecules called biologicals, including therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates and antibody fragments. The development of drug delivery systems (DDSs), in which conventional drugs were attached to various types of carriers including nanoparticles, liposomes or biodegradable polymers, represented an alternative approach to the development of new anticancer agents. Despite the fact that the antitumor activity of drugs attached to DDSs was not fundamentally different, the improved pharmacokinetic profiles, decreased toxic side effects and significantly increased therapeutic indexes resulted in their enhanced antitumor efficacy compared to conventional (unbound) drugs. Approval of the first immune checkpoint inhibitor for the treatment of cancer in 2011 initiated the era of cancer immunotherapy. Checkpoint inhibitors, bispecific T-cell engagers, adoptive T-cell approaches and cancer vaccines have joined the platform so far, represented mainly by recombinant cytokines, therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and immunomodulatory agents. In specific clinical indications, conventional drugs have already been supplanted by multi-agent, chemotherapy-free regimens comprising diverse immunotherapy and/or targeted agents. The very distinct mechanisms of the anticancer activity of new immunotherapy approaches not only call for novel response criteria, but might also change fundamental treatment paradigms of certain types of hematologic malignancies in the near future.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']","['Klener, Pavel Jr', 'Etrych, Tomas', 'Klener, Pavel']","['Klener P Jr', 'Etrych T', 'Klener P']","['First Medical Department- Dept. of Hematology, First Faculty of Medicine and General University Hospital, Charles University, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Pathological Physiology, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Czech Republic.', 'Department of biomedical polymers, Institute of Macromolecular Chemistry of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Heyrovskeho namesti 2, 162 06 Prague, Czech Republic.', 'First Medical Department- Dept. of Hematology, First Faculty of Medicine and General University Hospital, Charles University, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Med Chem,Current medicinal chemistry,9440157,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Cancer Vaccines/immunology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/methods']",['NOTNLM'],"['Hematologic malignancies', 'antibody- drug conjugates (ADC)', 'biodegradable polymers', 'biologicals', 'bispecific T-cell engagers (BiTE)', 'immune checkpoint inhibitors', 'immunomodulatory agents (IMiD)', 'monoclonal antibodies.']",2017/10/11 06:00,2019/06/25 06:00,['2017/10/10 06:00'],"['2017/02/28 00:00 [received]', '2017/09/07 00:00 [revised]', '2017/09/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/25 06:00 [medline]', '2017/10/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['CMC-EPUB-86243 [pii]', '10.2174/0929867324666171006144725 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Med Chem. 2019;26(6):1002-1018. doi: 10.2174/0929867324666171006144725.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the present study was to investigate the association of two microRNA (miRNA) binding site polymorphisms (rs3737966 G > A and rs35134728 DEL/TTC) in the 3'-untranslated region of MTHFR with serum MTX concentrations, in a Chinese pediatric population with ALL. METHODS: Genotyping for MTHFR rs3737966 and rs35134728 in 144 children with ALL was performed using the Sequenom MassArray system (Sequenom, San Diego, CA, USA). Serum MTX concentrations were measured by a fluorescence polarization immunoassay 24 h (C24h ) and 42 h (C42h ) after administration. The effects of the polymorphisms on concentration-to-dose (C/D) ratios of MTX were assessed. RESULTS: Complete linkage disequilibrium between rs3737966 and rs35134728 polymorphisms (r(2) = 1) was found in the study population. The minor allele frequency observed in the present study (17.4%) was significantly lower than those in European and African samples reported in the 1000 Genomes Project (42.9% and 63.9%, respectively; p < 0.01). The C/D ratios of MTX at 24 and 42 h for the TTC/TTC-A/A haplotype carriers (11.74 and 0.07 mumol/l per g/m(2) , respectively) were significantly lower than those in DEL/DEL-G/G or DEL/TTC-G/G haplotype carriers (12.49 and 0.09 mumol/l per g/m(2) , respectively; p < 0.05). Computational predictions suggested that the two polymorphisms overlapped with putative binding sites of several miRNAs. CONCLUSIONS: The rs3737966 and rs35134728 polymorphisms in MTHFR were associated with serum MTX concentrations. The findings of the present study indicate that miRNAs might be involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of MTHFR.","['Copyright (c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['Wang, Shu-Mei', 'Zeng, Wei-Xin', 'Wu, Wan-Shui', 'Sun, Lu-Lu', 'Yan, Dan']","['Wang SM', 'Zeng WX', 'Wu WS', 'Sun LL', 'Yan D']","['Department of Pharmacy, Beijing Shijitan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Beijing Shijitan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Beijing Shijitan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Beijing Shijitan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Beijing Shijitan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20171103,England,J Gene Med,The journal of gene medicine,9815764,IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions/genetics"", 'Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/blood/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Asians/genetics', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'China', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genotype', 'Haplotypes', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/blood/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)/*genetics', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/ethnology/genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'genetic polymorphism', 'methotrexate', 'methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase', 'microRNA']",2017/10/11 06:00,2018/07/17 06:00,['2017/10/10 06:00'],"['2017/06/21 00:00 [received]', '2017/09/17 00:00 [revised]', '2017/09/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/17 06:00 [medline]', '2017/10/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jgm.2990 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gene Med. 2017 Nov;19(11):353-359. doi: 10.1002/jgm.2990.

Various genetic and epigenetic factors have been found to be influential in such patients. Methylation silencing of APAF-1, a putative tumor suppressor gene (TSG), has been found in several human malignancies. In this study, we explored the association of APAF-1 methylation status with AML patients. Materials and Methods: We studied the methylation status of APAF-1 gene in 101 AML patients and 50 healthy subjects as controls. Genomic DNA was extracted from leukocytes in peripheral blood or bone marrow and the methylation status of APAF-1 gene promoter was detectedusing methylation-specific PCR (MSP) method with specific methylated and unmethylated primers. Gene expression was analyzed using real time RT-PCR. Results: The prevalence of methylated (MM) and hemi-methylated (MU) CpG dinucleotides within the APAF-1 gene promoter of AML patients was 12 (11.9%) and 45 (44.6%), respectively, while no methylation was detected in the control samples (p < 0.001). Our results showed a higher frequency of methylated APAF1 in FLT3-ITD mutated cases (p=0.04). APAF1 mRNA expression was significantly lower in methylated cases compared with normal cases. Conclusion: The present study indicated the increased frequency of hypermethylation of APAF-1 gene promoter in AML patients. APAF-1 aberrant CpG island methylation was associated with transcriptional downregulation in AML patients. Therefore, promoter methylation of APAF-1 gene could be considered as an epigenetic factor that contributes to the development of AML.",,"['Rostami, Shahrbano', 'Nadali, Fatemeh', 'Alibakhshi, Reza', 'Zaker, Farhad', 'Nasiri, Nahid', 'Payandeh, Mehrdad', 'Chahardouli, Bahram', 'Maleki, Ali']","['Rostami S', 'Nadali F', 'Alibakhshi R', 'Zaker F', 'Nasiri N', 'Payandeh M', 'Chahardouli B', 'Maleki A']","['Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran.', 'Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran.', 'Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Iran,Int J Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Res,International journal of hematology-oncology and stem cell research,101511150,,,['NOTNLM'],"['APAF-1', 'Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Epigenetics', 'MSP', 'Methylation']",2017/10/11 06:00,2017/10/11 06:01,['2017/10/10 06:00'],"['2017/10/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/11 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Int J Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Res. 2017 Jul 1;11(3):225-230.,PMC5625473,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytogenetic methods are known as sensitive and relatively new procedures to detect abnormalities in genome. Materials and Methods: In order to identify CLL-related chromosomal abnormalities, 48 CLL patients included 38 Men and 10 Women with mean age of 58.25+/-36 were enrolled in this case series study.The survey was done at Cancer Molecular Pathology Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences. Interphase fluorescent in situ hybridization (I-FISH) was done on unstimulated peripheral blood or bone marrow samples, which were cultured in whole medium culture; it was used to detect chromosomal abnormalities such as 11q- , 13q14-, 17p- , 6q- and trisomy 12 in CLL patients.

So, we examined whether the serum calcidiol (25(OH)D) levels at the time of induction therapy have any impact on response and relapse in AML patients. Materials and Methods: Blood samples were collected from 65 patients on days 0 and 28(th) of treatment to evaluate serum concentration of 25(OH)D and its effects on complete remission (CR) achievement, relapse rate and hospitalization length. Results: Of the 65 patients who were included in the study, 38 were male (58.5%) and 27 were female (41.5%). Median age at the time of treatment was 37 years (range 15-68). 6% of the participants were older than 60 years. In regard to 25(OH)D levels, 81.5% of AML patients were deficient (levels <20 ng/ml). There was a significant difference in CR between patients with sufficient and deficient level of 25(OH)D. Deficient patients had longer length of hospitalization than those with sufficient levels. Also Vitamin D deficient patients had higher serum ALP levels. The mean level of 25(OH)D on treatment day 28(th) in our study was significantly lower than the baseline value.

Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, methylation specific PCR (MSP) was used to assess the methylation status of DNMT1 promoter regions in samples collected from ALL patients (n=45) and healthy control subjects. According to this method, un-methylated cytosine nucleotides are converted to uracil by sodium bisulfite and the proliferation of methylated and un-methylated regions are performed using specific primers for target sequences. Results: None of the patients with B and T-ALL showed methylated promoter regions of the DNMT1 gene, while the methylation pattern of both pre-B ALL patients and the control group showed a relative promoter methylation. Conclusion: Analysis of promoter methylation patterns in various subgroups of ALL has revealed the importance of DNMT1 in the regulation of gene expression.

The proliferation of human leukemia HL60 and K562 cell lines was assayed by measuring cell viability with the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetr azolium method, while cell cycle distribution and the rate of apoptosis were evaluated with flow cytometry. The mRNA expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) and chemotactic and inflammatory genes in human leukemia cell lines was examined using reverse transcription quantitative-polymerase chain reaction methods. It was revealed that the proliferation of K562 and HL60 cells was significantly inhibited by the CBC-containing rat serum at 72 h. The CBC-containing serum also promoted the apoptosis of K562 and HL60 cell lines. The CBC-containing serum altered the cell cycle progression of K562 and HL60, increasing the proportion of the cells in G1 phase and decreasing the proportion of the cells in S phase.

In total, 47 miRNAs and 401 mRNAs were found to be upregulated, and 39 miRNAs and 67 mRNAs were found to be downregulated in AML. A total of 223 miRNA-target genes pairs were subjected to the construction of a regulatory network. Differentially expressed target genes were significantly enriched in the Wnt signaling pathway (hsa04310), melanogenesis (hsa04916) and pathways in cancer (hsa05200). Significantly differentially expressed miRNAs and genes, including hsa-miR-155, hsa-miR-192, annexin A2 (ANXA2), frizzled class receptor 3 (FZD3), and pleomorphic adenoma gene 1 (PLAG1), may serve essential roles in AML oncogenesis. Overall, hsa-miR-155, hsa-miR-192, ANXA2, FZD3 and PLAG1 may be associated with the development of AML via the involvement of the Wnt signaling pathway, melanogenesis and other cancer-associated signaling pathways.",,"['Zhang, Haiguo', 'Zhang, Chengfang', 'Feng, Rui', 'Zhang, Haixia', 'Gao, Min', 'Ye, Ling']","['Zhang H', 'Zhang C', 'Feng R', 'Zhang H', 'Gao M', 'Ye L']","['Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong 250012, P.R.

PROCEDURE: In this cross-sectional cohort study, Latino survivors of ALL (n = 57) and LL (n = 5) aged 6-16 years were pooled and evaluated using validated measures of cognitive, academic, and behavioral function and English language proficiency. Performance was compared with norms using single-sample t-tests. RESULTS: In this cohort (n = 62, 50% male), mean ages at diagnosis and testing were 4.5 and 10.8 years, respectively; mean time off treatment was 44.7 months. All participants spoke English and over half (57%) identified Spanish as the primary language in the home. Forty-two families (68%) placed in the two lowest Hollingshead socioeconomic status categories. Participants were below average for working memory (P < 0.001). Overall, participants were in the average range, but significantly lower than published norms on domain-specific measures of verbal comprehension (P < 0.001); perceptual reasoning (P = 0.033); processing speed (P = 0.003); visual memory (P < 0.001); visuomotor attention, scanning, and sequencing (P = 0.005); and reading comprehension (P = 0.001). Parents reported concerns with working memory (P < 0.001) and metacognition (P = 0.014). CONCLUSIONS: Similar to other childhood ALL/LL survivors, overall cognitive function in this Latino sample was relatively preserved but selected deficits were observed. Routine cognitive screening is indicated in this population.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Bava, Laura', 'Johns, Alexis', 'Kayser, Kimberly', 'Freyer, David R']","['Bava L', 'Johns A', 'Kayser K', 'Freyer DR']","[""Survivorship and Supportive Care Program, Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Diseases, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California."", 'Department of Plastic and Maxillofacial Surgery, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.', ""Survivorship and Supportive Care Program, Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Diseases, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20171008,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age of Onset', '*Cancer Survivors', 'Child', '*Cognition', '*Cognition Disorders/ethnology/etiology', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', '*Hispanic or Latino', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/ethnology/physiopathology/therapy']",['NOTNLM'],"['Latino', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'cancer', 'cognitive', 'late effects', 'sociodemographics']",2017/10/11 06:00,2017/12/28 06:00,['2017/10/09 06:00'],"['2017/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/24 00:00 [revised]', '2017/09/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/28 06:00 [medline]', '2017/10/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.26844 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2018 Feb;65(2). doi: 10.1002/pbc.26844.

This leads to constitutive activation of ABL1 kinase. CML was a difficult-to-treat illness until the advent of small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), imatinib which revolutionized therapy of CML. Since then, multiple second- and third-generation TKIs have been formulated which have proven effective and has led to marked improvement in survival. In this article, we review currently available data on possibility of holding TKI therapy in patients in deep remission [treatment-free remission (TFR)] and safety of this approach. RECENT FINDINGS: As CML treatment has become more effective, new questions have emerged, most important being whether the treatment with TKIs can ever be stopped. This is especially relevant in patient experiencing side effects from therapy or who may be subject to increased health risks due to treatment. There is now evidence that some CML patients who have achieved stable deep molecular response can safely stop TKI. Furthermore, patients can safely re-establish remission after restarting their TKI therapy in the situation of relapse. CML is highly treatable disease, but the treatment has untoward physical and socioeconomic consequences. The idea of TFR is hence attractive. There is a growing body of evidence that some CML patients who have achieved stable deep molecular response can safely stop TKI.",,"['Elsayed, Ahmed Gamal', 'Srivastava, Roma', 'Jamil, Muhammad Omer']","['Elsayed AG', 'Srivastava R', 'Jamil MO']","['Fellow, Hematology and Medical Oncology, Marshall University School of Medicine, Huntington, USA.', 'Fellow, Hematology and Medical Oncology, Marshall University School of Medicine, Huntington, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Marshall University School Of Medicine, 1400 Hal Greer Blvd, Huntington, WV, 25701, USA. omerjamil83@hotmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20171007,United States,Curr Oncol Rep,Current oncology reports,100888967,IM,"['Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/epidemiology/genetics/pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', '*Remission Induction']",['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myelogenous leukemia', 'Treatment-free remission', 'Tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",2017/10/11 06:00,2018/06/19 06:00,['2017/10/09 06:00'],"['2017/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11912-017-0642-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s11912-017-0642-1 [pii]']",epublish,Curr Oncol Rep. 2017 Oct 7;19(12):77. doi: 10.1007/s11912-017-0642-1.,,"['0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results of a decision-analytic model in patients with acute myeloid leukemia with normal karyotype.,84-90,S0145-2126(17)30517-9 [pii] 10.1016/j.leukres.2017.09.009 [doi],"BACKGROUND: During the last years, molecular genetic data are increasingly used as prognostic and predictive factors in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The molecular genetic profile permits a rapid risk categorization and beyond that a prediction of differential treatment efficacy of post-remission chemotherapy versus an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in specific subgroups. METHODS: The aim of this study was to evaluate cost-effectiveness of two different strategies of risk categorization (conventional cytogenetic diagnostics (CCD) versus molecular genetic diagnostics (MGD)) in patients with AML, using a decision-analytic state-transition model. The model is run as (Monte Carlo) microsimulation in which individuals pass through in cycles with a cycle length of one month and a time horizon of ten years. FINDINGS: Results show that on average, individuals within the MGD group generated about US$ 32,000 higher costs but survived about seven months longer than individuals within the CCD group. This leads to an Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) of about US$ 4928 per survived month. INTERPRETATION: With a GDP (Gross Domestic Product) of US$ 26,467 (euro 33,630) per capita in Germany in 2012, the base-case ICER of US$ 4928 per survived month projected to US$ 59,136 per survived year is in between the simple GDP and the three times GDP per capita.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Complete remission (CR) rate was 36.3% according to intention-to-treat. Responding patients had a longer median overall survival than non-responders (517 vs. 70days, P<0.001). The achievement of CR was not predicted by bone marrow blast count, cytogenetics, molecular markers, prior MDS, white blood cell count. Conversely, by studying the global gene expression profile, we identified a molecular signature, including 309 genes associated with clinical response (CR versus no CR). Based on the expression of a minimal set of 16 genes, we developed an algorithm to predict treatment response, that was successfully validated by showing an overall accuracy of 88%. We met the primary endpoint of the study, by beating the estimated successful CR rate (P1) fixed at 30%. Moreover, CR induced by this 2-drug combo was efficiently predicted by genetic profiling, identifying a biomarker that warrants validation in independent series.",['Copyright (c) 2017 The Authors.

This chemotherapeutics resistance is established by clonal selection of resistant variants of the cancer cells. Recently, a horizontal transfer of chemo-resistance among cancer cells via extracellular vesicles (EVs) has been suggested. The aim of this research was to investigate the role of EVs in chemo-resistance in acute myeloid leukemia. For this purpose, the sensitive strain of the promyelocytic leukemia HL60 cell line was studied along with its multi-resistant strain, HL60/AR that overexpresses the multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP-1). A chemo-resistance transfer between the two strains was established by treating HL60 cells with EVs generated by HL60/AR. This study reveals that EVs from HL60/AR can interact with HL60 cells and transfer at least partially, their chemo-resistance. EVs-treated cells begin to express MRP-1 probably due to a direct transfer of MRP-1 and nucleic acids transported by EVs. In this context, two microRNAs were highlighted for their high differential expression in EVs related to sensitive or chemo-resistant cells: miR-19b and miR-20a. Because circulating microRNAs are found in all biological fluids, these results bring out their potential clinical use as chemo-resistance biomarkers in acute myeloid leukemia.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In this work, the in vivo anti-leukemia activity of NPM was investigated using a bioluminescent mouse model. The luciferase-expressing Jurkat cells (Jurkat-Luc) were mixed with matrigel and injected subcutaneously into the nude mice. Drug treatment was commenced on day 7 after tumor implantation. The growth of xenografted tumors was significantly inhibited in the mice treated with NPM, which is comparable to the inhibitory effect of a classical anti-leukemia drug, cyclophosphamide. Combined treatment with NPM and cyclophosphamide further enhanced the growth inhibition of xenografted Jurkat-Luc cells. Immunohistochemistry staining with cleaved caspase 3 (cl-caspase 3) indicated a very heavy staining of cl-caspase 3 only in the tumor implants excised from the NPM-treated mice.

METHODS: A subcutaneous tumor xenograft model was established by injection of the acute myeloid leukemia cell line KG-1a into the axillary flfl anks of BALB/c-nude mice. Twenty-four tumor bearing mice were divided into 4 groups according to a random number table, including normal saline control group, ADM group, high-dose CZG group, and mid-dose CZG group, with 6 mice in each group. Drug administration occurred on the 14th day after cell inoculation, and normal saline control group mice were gavaged with normal saline at 0.2 mL/10 g every other day. ADM group mice were intraperitoneally injected with ADM 1 mg/kg [conversion of adults, 40 mg/(m2*d)] every other day. High- and mid-dose CZG groups mice were gavaged with CZG at the dose of 8 and 4 g/kg respectively every other day and intraperitoneally injected with ADM (1 mg/kg) every other day. The administration period lasted for 10 days. The tumor xenografts were made into mononuclear cell suspensions after dissection, and the expressions of specific surface antigens, including CD34(+)CD38(-), CD34(+)CD38(-)CD123(+), CD34(+)CD38(-)CD96(+) and CD34(+)CD38(-)CD33(+), in KG-1a cell line tumor xenografts were detected by flfl ow cytometry. RESULTS: Compared with the control and ADM groups, expression of CD34(+)CD38(-) in the two CZG groups was significantly lower (P<0.05). Compared with the control group, expression of CD34(+)CD38(-)CD123(+) in the two CZG groups decreased (P<0.05). The high-dose CZG group showed more obvious outcomes compared with the ADM group (P<0.05). Compared with the control and ADM groups, the expression of CD34(+)CD38(-)CD96(+) and CD34(+)CD38(-)CD33(+) in the two CZG groups decreased (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: CZG combined with doxorubicin could reduce the expression of CD34(+)CD38(-), CD34(+)CD38(-)CD123(+), CD34(+)CD38(-)CD96(+) and CD34(+)CD38(-)CD33(+) in KG-1a cell line tumor xenografts, which shows that CZG could target leukemia stem cells and play a role in chemosensitization.",,"['Zhang, Yu', 'Hou, Li', 'Chen, Xin-Yi']","['Zhang Y', 'Hou L', 'Chen XY']","['Department of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer Tianjing, Tianjing, 300060, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin, 300060, China.', 'Tianjin Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin, 300060, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Dongzhimen Hospital Affiliated to Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, 100700, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Dongzhimen Hospital Affiliated to Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, 100700, China. chenxinyi0729@126.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20171006,China,Chin J Integr Med,Chinese journal of integrative medicine,101181180,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Surface/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Shape/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Subcutaneous Tissue/drug effects/pathology', '*Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",['NOTNLM'],"['Chinese medicine', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'adriamycin', 'doxorubicin']",2017/10/08 06:00,2018/09/25 06:00,['2017/10/08 06:00'],"['2014/10/08 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/25 06:00 [medline]', '2017/10/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11655-017-2963-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s11655-017-2963-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Chin J Integr Med. 2018 Mar;24(3):213-217. doi: 10.1007/s11655-017-2963-1.

However, they are also found in cells of the immune system, where their role has been less studied. Here we report the pro-inflammatory effect of ImI, a well characterized conotoxin that inhibits alpha7 nAChRs, on differentiated THP-1 pre-monocyte macrophages (MDM) obtained by phorbol 12-myristate 13 acetate (PMA) treatment. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) performed on supernatant fluids of LPS challenged MDM showed ImI-mediated upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha in an ImI concentration-dependent manner from 0.5 to 5.0 micromol/L and for IL-8 up to 1.0 micromol/L. Levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine TGF-beta remained practically unaffected in ImI treated MDMs. Nicotine at 10 micromol/L significantly downregulated the release of TNF-alpha, but showed a lesser effect on IL-8 secretion and no effect on TGF-beta. Fluorescent competitive assays involving ImI, alpha-bungarotoxin and nicotine using MDM and the murine macrophage RAW 264.7 suggest a common binding site in the alpha7 receptor. This work extends the application of conotoxins as molecular probes to non-excitatory cells, such as macrophages and supports the involvement of the alpha7 nAChR in regulating the inflammatory response via the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP).",,"['Padilla, Alberto', 'Keating, Patricia', 'Hartmann, James X', 'Mari, Frank']","['Padilla A', 'Keating P', 'Hartmann JX', 'Mari F']","['Departments of Biomedical Sciences, Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton, 777 Glades Rd, Boca Raton, FL, 33431, USA.', 'Biological Sciences, Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton, 777 Glades Rd, Boca Raton, FL, 33431, USA.', 'Chemistry and Biochemistry, Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton, 777 Glades Rd, Boca Raton, FL, 33431, USA.', 'Biological Sciences, Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton, 777 Glades Rd, Boca Raton, FL, 33431, USA.', 'Biological Sciences, Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton, 777 Glades Rd, Boca Raton, FL, 33431, USA. jhartman@fau.edu.', 'Chemistry and Biochemistry, Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton, 777 Glades Rd, Boca Raton, FL, 33431, USA. frank.mari@nist.gov.', 'Marine Biochemical Sciences, Chemical Sciences Division, National Institute of Standards and Technology, 331 Fort Johnson Rd., Charleston, SC, 29412, USA. frank.mari@nist.gov.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171006,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Conotoxins/*toxicity', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-8/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Macrophages/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Monocytes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Nicotine/pharmacology', 'RAW 264.7 Cells', 'THP-1 Cells', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*metabolism']",,,2017/10/08 06:00,2019/06/30 06:00,['2017/10/08 06:00'],"['2017/03/01 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/10/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-017-11586-2 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-017-11586-2 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2017 Oct 6;7(1):12742. doi: 10.1038/s41598-017-11586-2.,PMC5630575,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Conotoxins)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '156467-85-5 (alpha-conotoxin ImI)', '6M3C89ZY6R (Nicotine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PT-Cy selectively eliminates proliferating alloreactive T cells, but whether and how it affects natural killer (NK) cells and their alloreactivity is largely unknown. Here we characterized NK cell dynamics in 17 patients who received unmanipulated haploidentical grafts, containing high numbers of mature NK cells, according to PT-Cy-based protocols in 2 independent centers. In both series, we documented robust proliferation of donor-derived NK cells immediately after HSCT. After infusion of Cy, a marked reduction of proliferating NK cells was evident, suggesting selective purging of dividing cells. Supporting this hypothesis, proliferating NK cells did not express aldehyde dehydrogenase and were killed by Cy in vitro. After ablation of mature NK cells, starting from day 15 after HSCT and favored by the high levels of interleukin-15 present in patients' sera, immature NK cells (CD62L(+)NKG2A(+)KIR(-)) became highly prevalent, possibly directly stemming from infused hematopoietic stem cells. Importantly, also putatively alloreactive single KIR(+) NK cells were eliminated by PT-Cy and were thus decreased in numbers and antileukemic potential at day 30 after HSCT. As a consequence, in an extended series of 99 haplo-HSCT with PT-Cy, we found no significant difference in progression-free survival between patients with or without predicted NK alloreactivity (42% vs 52% at 1 year, P = NS).

MicroRNA-7 (miR-7) has been considered as a tumor suppressor in most malignant tumors versus a tumor promoter in some other ones. However, its role in chronic myeloid leukemia remains unknown. Herein, we found that K562 cell proliferation was largely suppressed when it was stably transfected with miR-7. In accordance with that, apoptosis was also significantly upregulated in miR-7 stably-transfected K562 cells. Moreover, we found that miR-7-overexpressed K562 cells were far more sensitive to imatinib than controls. Further investigations showed that the ABL1 was a direct target of miR-7. Expression level of BCR-ABL and the activity of its downstream PI3K/AKT pathway were significantly reduced in miR-7-transfected cells. Taken together, our results showed that miR-7 inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis in K562 cells, and miR-7 might help to sensitize them to imatinib through BCR-ABL/PI3K/AKT signaling in chronic myeloid leukemia.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

However, existing models constructed using intravenous injection in adult or newborn NSG mice have inferior engraftment efficiency, poor peripheral blood engraftment, or are difficult to construct. METHODS: Here, we describe an improved AML xenograft model where primary human AML cells were injected into NSG newborn pups intrahepatically. RESULTS: Introduction of primary cells from AML patients resulted in high levels of engraftment in peripheral blood, spleen, and bone marrow (BM) of recipient mice. The phenotype of engrafted AML cells remained unaltered during serial transplantation. The mice developed features that are consistent with human AML including spleen enlargement and infiltration of AML cells into multiple organs. Importantly, we demonstrated that although leukemic stem cell activity is enriched and mediated by CD34(+)CD117(+) subpopulation, CD34(+)CD117(-) subpopulation can acquire CD34(+)CD117(+) phenotype through de-differentiation. Lastly, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of Sorafenib and Regorafenib in this AML model and found that periphery and spleen AML cells are sensitive to these treatments, whereas BM provides a protective environment to AML.

Here we investigated drug resistance in AML at the level of cellular metabolism in order to identify early predictors of therapeutic response. Using extracellular flux analysis, we compared metabolic drug responses in AML cell lines sensitive or resistant to cytarabine or sorafenib after 24h of drug treatment to a small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell line exposed to etoposide. Only drug-resistant AML cells maintained oxidative metabolism upon drug exposure while SCLC cells displayed an overall metabolic shift towards glycolysis, i.e. a Warburg effect to escape drug toxicity. Moreover, primary AML blasts displayed very low glycolytic activity, while oxygen consumption was readily detectable, indicating an essential role of oxidative pathways in the bioenergetics of AML blasts. In line with these observations, analysis of the mitochondrial membrane potential using tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester staining and flow cytometry allowed for clear discrimination between drug sensitive and resistant AML cell line clones and primary blasts after 24h of treatment with cytarabine or sorafenib. Our data reveal a distinct metabolic phenotype of resistant AML cells and suggest that disrupting oxidative metabolism rather than glycolysis may enhance the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy in AML.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Other reasons included: cardiac arrest (18%), septic shock (17%), hypotension (9%), and acute renal failure (9%). The most frequent interventions were mechanical ventilation in 85%, vasopressors in 62%, and hemodialysis in 30%. Following transfer 55 patients (58%) had a change in code status. Overall, 46 patients (49%) changed from Full Code (FC) to Comfort Care (CC), 7 (7%) from FC to Do Not Resuscitate (DNR), and 2 (2%) from DNR to CC.

Human hematopoietic cells bearing mutations in combinations of genes, including cohesin complex genes, observed in myeloid malignancies generated immunophenotypically defined neoplastic clones capable of long-term, multi-lineage reconstitution and serial transplantation. Employing these models to investigate therapeutic efficacy, we found that TET2 and cohesin-mutated hematopoietic cells were sensitive to azacitidine treatment.

The results of these analyses challenge the classic view of leukemia as a clonal homogeneous diffuse tumor and introduce a more complex and dynamic scenario.

We first identified a locus on chromosome 18 involved in these translocations with the chromosome 14 containing the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus. Within this region on chromosome 18, we then discovered a gene that we called BCL2, which was activated by the translocations. Since that time, many studies determined that BCL2 is one of the most important oncogenes involved in cancer by inhibiting apoptosis. In 2002, we studied 13q deletions in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and found that the microRNA cluster miR-15a/miR-16-1 (miR-15/16) is deleted by 13q deletions. In 2005, we discovered that miR-15/16 function as tumor suppressors by directly targeting BCL2. Thus the loss of two negative regulators of BCL2 expression results in overexpression of BCL2. Very recently, a specific BCL2 inhibitor ABT-199 (Venetoclax) was developed and approved by FDA for CLL treatment. Thus it took 32 years from fundamental discovery of a critical oncogene to the development of a drug capable to cure CLL.

The isolates grew as dark orange colonies at 25-37 degrees C after 5 days, sharing features in common with other closely related species. Analysis of the complete 16S rRNA gene sequence (1492 bp) of strain PB739(T) demonstrated that the isolate shared 98.8 % relatedness with Mycobacterium wolinskyi. Partial 429 bp hsp65 and 744 bp rpoB region V sequence analyses revealed that the sequences of the novel isolate shared 94.8 and 92.1 % similarity with those of Mycobacterium neoaurum and Mycobacterium aurum, respectively.

Flow cytometric immunophenotyping (FCI) on the other hand provides rapid and objective information to differentiate APL from non-APL. METHODS: FCI features, with single-tube 8-color combination using CD45, CD34, HAL-DR, CD11b, CD13, CD33, and CD117 and CD64, were compared for the 30 consecutive APL and 30 non-APL acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases which morphologically mimicked an APL. The diagnosis was confirmed by cytogenetic or molecular genetic testing in the form of t (15:17) (q22; q21)/variant translocations or PML-RARA fusion transcript analysis. RESULTS: The APL cells lacked CD34, HLA-DR, and CD11b in 90%, 90%, and 93.3% cases, respectively. Myeloid antigens such as CD33, CD13, CD117, and CD64 were expressed in 96.7%, 96.7%, 76.7%, and 70% cases, respectively. The dual negative profiles, CD34-/HLA-DR- or HLA-DR-/CD11b-, were noted in 90% and 93.3% cases. The triple-negative (CD34-/HLA-DR-/CD11b-) profile was noted in 90% of the cases. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value (PPV) of CD34-/HLA-DR- and HLA-DR-/CD11b- profiles for the diagnosis of APL were found to be 90%, 80% & 81.1% and 93.3%, 86.7%& 87.5%, respectively. Combining the above two profiles resulted in a triple-negative profile (CD34-, HLA-DR- and CD11b-), which had a better specificity (93.3%) and positive predictive value (93.1%), with similar sensitivity. CONCLUSION: FCI is a rapid and reliable modality for the diagnosis of an APL.

Apart from the French American British (FAB) method for classification, blasts were assessed for cuplike morphology as per strict definition for cuplike nuclei, >/=10% blasts with nuclear invaginations >/=25% of the nuclear area. RESULTS: FLT3 mutation in 31/126 (25%) and NPM1 mutation was found in 17/126 (13.4%) of the AML patients. 6 (5%) samples were positive for both NPM1 and FLT3/ITD mutations. Associations between the FLT3 and NPM1 gene mutations with haematological and immunophenotypic characteristics are reported. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that presence of distinct morphology and haematological and immunophenotypic characteristics together may serve as important indicators and surrogate for NPM1 and FLT3/ITD mutations. Further, comprehensive studies on the biological effects of NPM1 and FLT3/ITD mutations and their interactions with other genetic alterations are needed to gain insight into the molecular mechanism of these mutations involved in the pathogenesis of AML.",,"['Khera, Rachna', 'Ahmed, Faiq', 'Mundada, Manasi', 'Nambaru, Lavanya', 'Murthy, Sudha S', 'Devig, Sandhya', 'Rajappa, Senthil J', 'Mallavarapu, Krishna Mohan', 'Santa, A', 'Kumar, Pavan']","['Khera R', 'Ahmed F', 'Mundada M', 'Nambaru L', 'Murthy SS', 'Devig S', 'Rajappa SJ', 'Mallavarapu KM', 'Santa A', 'Kumar P']","['Department of Lab Medicine, Basavatarakam Indo American Cancer Hospital and Research Institute, HYDERABAD, INDIA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",,Turkey,Turk Patoloji Derg,Turk patoloji dergisi,9440471,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'India', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tertiary Care Centers', 'Young Adult', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",,,2017/10/07 06:00,2018/10/03 06:00,['2017/10/07 06:00'],"['2017/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/03 06:00 [medline]', '2017/10/07 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.5146/tjpath.2017.01415 [doi]'],ppublish,Turk Patoloji Derg. 2018;34(2):171-174. doi: 10.5146/tjpath.2017.01415.,,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Over a 6 year-period, of 668 mantle cell lymphoma assessed by flow cytometry, CD200 expression was detected in 25 patients (~4%). All 25 patients had bone marrow involvement; however, 11 (44%) patients had no nodal or extranodal disease and belonged to non-nodal leukemic variant mantle cell lymphoma. Morphologically, bone marrow showed an unusual interstitial infiltrative pattern in 14/25 (56%) and small round cells resembling chronic lymphocytic leukemia in 9/25 (36%). CD23 was positive in 19/25 (76%) patients; and SOX11 was only positive in 5/21(24%). All 4 patients tested showed IGHV mutations. With a median follow-up of 23 months, 12/24 (50%) patients were not treated. These clinicopathological features were significantly different from 154 randomly chosen CD200-negative mantle cell lymphoma patients, in SOX11 positivity (24% versus 74%, P<0.0001), CD23 expression (76% versus 8%, P<0.0001), a non-nodal leukemic presentation (44% versus 2%, P<0.001), and therapy requirement (50% versus 92%, P<0.0001).

As known in previous researches, Maff and Egr3 are two important genes having opposite functions on cell cycle; however, they are both highly expressed in HSCs under leukemia. Hence, exploring the molecular mechanisms of how the genes act on cell cycle will help revealing the functional alteration of HSCs. RESULTS: We herein utilize the bioinformatic resources to computationally model the acting mechanisms of Maff and Egr3 on cell cycle. Using the data of functional experiments as reference, molecular acting mechanisms are optimally enumerated through model selection. The results are consolidated by evidences from gene sequence analysis, thus having enhanced the confidence of our pilot findings, which suggest that HSCs possibly undergo a ""adaptation - suppression"" process in response to the malignant environment of leukemia. CONCLUSION: As a pilot research, our results may provide valuable insights for further experimental studies. Meanwhile, our research method combining computational modeling and data from functional experiments can be worthwhile for knowledge discovery; and it can be generalized and extended to other biological/biomedical studies.",,"['Li, Rudong', 'Wang, Yin', 'Cheng, Hui', 'Liu, Gang', 'Cheng, Tao', 'Liu, Yunlong', 'Liu, Lei']","['Li R', 'Wang Y', 'Cheng H', 'Liu G', 'Cheng T', 'Liu Y', 'Liu L']","['Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, 46202, USA.', 'Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center and Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200031, China.', 'Shanghai Center for Bioinformatics Technology, Shanghai, 201203, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, 300020, China.', 'Shanghai Center for Bioinformatics Technology, Shanghai, 201203, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, 300020, China.', 'Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, 46202, USA.', 'Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center and Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200031, China. liulei@fudan.edu.cn.', 'Shanghai Center for Bioinformatics Technology, Shanghai, 201203, China. liulei@fudan.edu.cn.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20171003,England,BMC Syst Biol,BMC systems biology,101301827,IM,"['Early Growth Response Protein 3/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'MafF Transcription Factor/*metabolism', '*Models, Biological', 'Systems Biology']",['NOTNLM'],"['Hematopoietic stem cells', 'Leukemia', 'Maff and Egr3', 'Model selection', 'System modeling']",2017/10/07 06:00,2018/05/18 06:00,['2017/10/07 06:00'],"['2017/10/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12918-017-0467-4 [doi]', '10.1186/s12918-017-0467-4 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Syst Biol. 2017 Oct 3;11(Suppl 5):91. doi: 10.1186/s12918-017-0467-4.,PMC5629552,"['0 (MafF Transcription Factor)', '144516-98-3 (Early Growth Response Protein 3)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
