However, patients who are refractory to or relapse after ibrutinib therapy have poor outcomes. Venetoclax is a selective, orally bioavailable inhibitor of BCL-2 active in previously treated patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. In this study, we assessed the activity and safety of venetoclax in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia who are refractory to or relapse during or after ibrutinib therapy. METHODS: In this interim analysis of a multicentre, open-label, non-randomised, phase 2 trial, we enrolled patients aged 18 years or older with a documented diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia according to the 2008 International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL) criteria and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score of 2 or lower. All patients had relapsed or refractory disease after previous treatment with a BCR signalling pathway inhibitor. All patients were screened for Richter's transformation and cases confirmed by biopsy were excluded. Eligible patients received oral venetoclax, starting at 20 mg per day with stepwise dose ramp-up over 5 weeks to 400 mg per day. Patients with rapidly progressing disease received an accelerated dosing schedule (to 400 mg per day by week 3). The primary endpoint was overall response, defined as the proportion of patients with an overall response per investigator's assessment according to IWCLL criteria. All patients who received at least one dose of venetoclax were included in the activity and safety analyses. This study is ongoing; data for this interim analysis were collected per regulatory agencies' request as of June 30, 2017. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02141282. FINDINGS: Between September, 2014, and November, 2016, 127 previously treated patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia were enrolled from 15 sites across the USA. 91 patients had received ibrutinib as the last BCR inhibitor therapy before enrolment, 43 of whom were enrolled in the main cohort and 48 in the expansion cohort recruited later after a protocol amendment. At the time of analysis, the median follow-up was 14 months (IQR 8-18) for all 91 patients, 19 months (9-27) for the main cohort, and 12 months (8-15) for the expansion cohort. 59 (65%, 95% CI 53-74) of 91 patients had an overall response, including 30 (70%, 54-83) of 43 patients in the main cohort and 29 (60%, 43-72) of 48 patients in the expansion cohort. The most common treatment-emergent grade 3 or 4 adverse events were neutropenia (46 [51%] of 91 patients), thrombocytopenia (26 [29%]), anaemia (26 [29%]), decreased white blood cell count (17 [19%]), and decreased lymphocyte count (14 [15%]). 17 (19%) of 91 patients died, including seven because of disease progression. No treatment-related deaths occurred. INTERPRETATION: The results of this interim analysis show that venetoclax has durable clinical activity and favourable tolerability in patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia whose disease progressed during or after discontinutation of ibrutinib therapy. The durability of response to venetoclax will be assessed in the final analysis in 2019. FUNDING: AbbVie, Genentech.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Use of several chemical inhibitors highlighted that STP-induced non-canonical programmed cell death was Ca(2+)-dependent but independent of caspases, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1, cathepsin, or calpains. Similar to thapsigargin, STP led to increased cytosolic Ca(2+) levels and computational docking confirmed binding of STP within the thapsigargin binding pocket of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA). Moreover, the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor is implicated in STP-modulated cytosolic Ca(2+) accumulation leading to ER stress and mitochondrial swelling associated with collapsed cristae as observed by electron microscopy. Confocal fluorescent microscopy allowed identifying mitochondrial Ca(2+) overload as initiator of STP-induced cell death insensitive to necrostatin-1 or cycloheximide. Finally, we observed that STP-induced necrosis is dependent of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening. Importantly, the translational immunogenic potential of STP was validated by HMGB1 release of STP-treated AML patient cells. STP reduced colony and in vivo tumor forming potential and impaired the development of AML patient-derived xenografts in zebrafish.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), when unrepaired, can potentiate chromosomal translocations. t(14;18) translocation involving BCL2 gene on chromosome 18 and IgH loci at chromosome 14, could lead to follicular lymphoma. Molecular basis for fragility of translocation breakpoint regions is an active area of investigation. Previously, formation of non-B DNA structures like G-quadruplex, triplex, B/A transition were investigated at peak I of BCL2 major breakpoint region (MBR); however, it is less understood at peak III. In vitro gel shift assays show faster mobility for MBR peak III sequences, unlike controls. CD studies of peak III sequences reveal a spectral pattern different from B-DNA. Although complementary C-rich stretches exhibit single-strandedness, corresponding guanine-rich sequences do not show DMS protection, ruling out G-quadruplex and triplex DNA. Extrachromosomal assay indicates that peak III halts transcription, unlike its mutated version. Taken together, multiple lines of evidence suggest formation of potential cruciform DNA structure at MBR peak III, which was also supported by in silico studies. Thus, our study reveals formation of non-B DNA structure which could be a basis for fragility at BCL2 breakpoint regions, eventually leading to chromosomal translocations.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Currently, sorafenib is the most effective molecular-targeted drug against hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the sorafenib resistance rate is high. The molecular mechanism of this resistance has not been fully elucidated. High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is a multifaceted protein that plays a key role in the proliferation, apoptosis, metastasis and angiogenesis of HCC cells. In addition, HMGB1 has been suggested to contribute to chemotherapy resistance in tumours, including lung cancer, osteosarcoma, neuroblastoma, leukaemia, and colorectal cancer. This study investigated the association between HMGB1 and sorafenib resistance in HCC. METHODS: HepG2 cells with HMGB1 knockdown or overexpression were generated. The efficacy of sorafenib in these cells was tested using flow cytometry and a cell counting assay. The subcellular localization of HMGB1 in HepG2 cells following sorafenib treatment was measured by western blotting and confocal microscopy. A murine subcutaneous HCC model was generated to examine the association between HMGB1 and the sensitivity of sorafenib treatment. RESULTS: The HMGB1 knockdown cells exhibited a significantly higher apoptotic level and lower cell viability than the normal HMGB1 expressing cells following the sorafenib treatment. In addition, the cell viability observed in the HMGB1 overexpressing cells was higher than that observed in the control cells following the sorafenib intervention. Sorafenib had a better tumour inhibition effect in the HMGB1 knockdown group in vivo. The amount of mitochondrial HMGB1 decreased, while the amount of cytosolic HMGB1 increased following the exposure to sorafenib. Altogether, HMGB1 translocated from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm outside the mitochondria following the exposure of HepG2 cells to sorafenib. CONCLUSIONS: A novel potential role of HMGB1 in the regulation of sorafenib therapy resistance in HCC was observed. The knockdown of HMGB1 restores sensitivity to sorafenib and enhances HepG2 cell death, while HMGB1 overexpression blunts these effects. The translocation of HMGB1 from the mitochondria to the cytosol following sorafenib treatment provides new insight into sorafenib resistance in HCC.",,"['Xiao, Yinzong', 'Sun, Lunquan', 'Fu, Yongming', 'Huang, Yan', 'Zhou, Rongrong', 'Hu, Xingwang', 'Zhou, Pengcheng', 'Quan, Jun', 'Li, Ning', 'Fan, Xue-Gong']","['Xiao Y', 'Sun L', 'Fu Y', 'Huang Y', 'Zhou R', 'Hu X', 'Zhou P', 'Quan J', 'Li N', 'Fan XG']","['Hunan Key Laboratory of Viral Hepatitis, Department of Infectious Diseases, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, 410008, China.', 'Center for Molecular Medicine, Xiangya Hospital, Key Laboratory of Molecular Radiation Oncology of Hunan Province, Central South University, Changsha, 410008, China.', 'Hunan Key Laboratory of Viral Hepatitis, Department of Infectious Diseases, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, 410008, China.', 'Hunan Key Laboratory of Viral Hepatitis, Department of Infectious Diseases, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, 410008, China.', 'Hunan Key Laboratory of Viral Hepatitis, Department of Infectious Diseases, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, 410008, China.', 'Hunan Key Laboratory of Viral Hepatitis, Department of Infectious Diseases, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, 410008, China.', 'Hunan Key Laboratory of Viral Hepatitis, Department of Infectious Diseases, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, 410008, China.', 'Hunan Key Laboratory of Viral Hepatitis, Department of Infectious Diseases, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, 410008, China.', 'Department of Blood Transfusion, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, 410008, China. nxli@hotmail.com.', 'Hunan Key Laboratory of Viral Hepatitis, Department of Infectious Diseases, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, 410008, China. xgfan@hotmail.com.']",['eng'],,"['2015DFA31490/Special National International Technology Cooperation of China', '81272253/National Natural Sciences Foundation of China', '2013CB910502/National Major Sciences research Program of China(973 Program)', '81670538/National Natural Sciences Foundation of China']",['Journal Article'],20171215,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (HMGB1 Protein)', '0 (HMGB1 protein, human)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Cytosol/drug effects/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'HMGB1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Niacinamide/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Phenylurea Compounds/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein Transport', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Sorafenib', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC5731191,,2017/12/17 06:00,2018/08/09 06:00,['2017/12/17 06:00'],"['2017/06/29 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-017-3868-2 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-017-3868-2 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2017 Dec 15;17(1):857. doi: 10.1186/s12885-017-3868-2.,,['NOTNLM'],"['HCC', 'HMGB1', 'Mitochondria', 'Sorafenib resistance']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PCLP1 increases breast tumor growth, migration and invasion; however, its role in hematologic malignancies still remains undetermined. The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression and function of PCLP1 in mature B-cell lymphoma cells. We found that overexpression of PCLP1 significantly increases proliferation, cell-to-cell interaction, clonogenicity, and migration of B-cell lymphoma cells. Furthermore, PCLP1 overexpression results in higher resistance to death induced by dexamethasone, reactive oxygen species and type II anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody obinutuzumab. Strikingly, enforced expression of PCLP1 enhances lipid droplet formation as well as pentose phosphate pathway and glutamine dependence, indicative of metabolic reprogramming necessary to support the abnormal proliferation rate of tumor cells. Flow cytometry analysis revealed augmented levels of PCLP1 in malignant cells from some patients with mature B-cell lymphoma compared to their normal B-cell counterparts. In summary, our results demonstrate that PCLP1 contributes to proliferation and survival of mature B-cell lymphoma cells, suggesting that PCLP1 may promote lymphomagenesis and represents a therapeutic target for the treatment of B-cell lymphomas.",,"['Tamayo-Orbegozo, Estibaliz', 'Amo, Laura', 'Rinon, Marta', 'Nieto, Naiara', 'Amutio, Elena', 'Maruri, Natalia', 'Solaun, Miren', 'Arrieta, Arantza', 'Larrucea, Susana']","['Tamayo-Orbegozo E', 'Amo L', 'Rinon M', 'Nieto N', 'Amutio E', 'Maruri N', 'Solaun M', 'Arrieta A', 'Larrucea S']","['Regulation of the Immune System Group, BioCruces Health Research Institute, Hospital Universitario Cruces, Barakaldo, Bizkaia, Spain.', 'Regulation of the Immune System Group, BioCruces Health Research Institute, Hospital Universitario Cruces, Barakaldo, Bizkaia, Spain.', 'Regulation of the Immune System Group, BioCruces Health Research Institute, Hospital Universitario Cruces, Barakaldo, Bizkaia, Spain.', 'Cell Culture Unit, BioCruces Health Research Institute, Hospital Universitario Cruces, Barakaldo, Bizkaia, Spain.', 'Hematology and Hemotherapy Service, BioCruces Health Research Institute, Hospital Universitario Cruces, Barakaldo, Bizkaia, Spain.', 'Regulation of the Immune System Group, BioCruces Health Research Institute, Hospital Universitario Cruces, Barakaldo, Bizkaia, Spain.', 'Flow Cytometry Unit, BioCruces Health Research Institute, Hospital Universitario Cruces, Barakaldo, Bizkaia, Spain.', 'Regulation of the Immune System Group, BioCruces Health Research Institute, Hospital Universitario Cruces, Barakaldo, Bizkaia, Spain.', 'Regulation of the Immune System Group, BioCruces Health Research Institute, Hospital Universitario Cruces, Barakaldo, Bizkaia, Spain.']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],20170927,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,,,,PMC5725127,,2017/12/17 06:00,2017/12/17 06:01,['2017/12/17 06:00'],"['2016/12/23 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/17 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.21283 [doi]', '21283 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Sep 27;8(59):99722-99739. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.21283. eCollection 2017 Nov 21.,,['NOTNLM'],"['glutaminolysis', 'lymphomagenesis', 'obinutuzumab resistance', 'pentose phosphate pathway', 'podocalyxin']",,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although different conjectures have been proposed to explain this phenomenon, none has been tested. We propose that the heart microenvironment may exert anti-cancer properties. So, our objective was to test the anti-oncogenic potential of cardiac-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs). For that EVs secreted by cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs, heart progenitor cells) were tested in vitro on fibrosarcoma HT1080. In vivo models comprised the xenograft HT1080 fibrosarcoma in athymic mice (n=35), and spontaneous acute lymphocyte leukemia in old rats (n=44). CDC-EVs were compared with two control groups: EVs secreted by bone-marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC-EVs) and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Injection of CDC-EVs led to a 2.5-fold decrease of fibrosarcoma growth in mice (p<0.01 and p<0.05 for human and rat EVs, respectively) vs PBS group. The effect was associated with 2-fold decrease of tumor cells proliferation (p<0.001) and 1.5-fold increase of apoptosis (p<0.05) in CDC-EV vs PBS mice. Salutary changes in tumor gene and protein expression were observed in CDC-EV animals. CDC-EVs reduced tumor vascularization compared with PBS (p<0.05) and MSC-EVs (p<0.01). Moreover, CDC-EVs increased leukemia-free survival (p<0.05) in old rats vs PBS. MiR-146, highly enriched in CDC-EVs, may be implicated in part of the observed effects. In conclusion, this study presents the first evidence that ties together the long-recognized enigma of the ""heart immunity to cancer"" with an antioncogenic effect of heart-derived EVs.

PATIENT CONCERNS: A 19-year-1-month-old girl presented with a history of CML. She underwent matched unrelated donor HSCT and donor lymphocyte infusion subsequently. Three months later, yellowish discoloration of the skin was found, which was accompanied by progressive itchy skin, easy fatigability, insomnia, and dark urine output. After admission, liver function disorders were observed. INTERVENTION: Methylprednisolone was administered for suspected hepatic GVHD. Although abdominal sonography revealed no evidence of biliary tract obstruction and the viral hepatitis survey disclosed unremarkable findings; silymarin and ursodeoxycholic acid were administered to preserve the liver function. In addition, rituximab was prescribed for suspected AIHA. Because hyperbilirubinemia was progressive, mycophenolate and high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin were accordingly administered. As drug-induced liver injury cannot be excluded, all potential unconfirmed causes of drug-related hepatoxicity were discontinued. DIAGNOSIS: In this case, the patient's history of shrimps and chocolate consumption led us to strongly suspect cholestatic hepatitis associated with copper toxicity syndrome. High 24-hour urine copper excretion and low serum zinc levels were also confirmed. Accordingly, D-penicillamine and zinc gluconate were administered. OUTCOMES: She succumbed to progressive hepatic failure and eventual multisystem organ failure 14 months after HSCT. No autopsy was performed.

Patients and Methods We undertook a retrospective descriptive study of all patients with AML who underwent allo-SCT from 1994 to 2013 at our center to evaluate the clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness of this therapeutic modality. Results Two hundred fifty-four consecutive patients, median age 34 years, who underwent allo-SCT at our center were included in this study. There were 161 males (63.4%). The 5-year overall survival (OS) and event-free survival for the entire cohort was 40.1 +/- 3.5% and 38.7 +/- 3.4%, respectively. The 5-year OS for patients in first (CR1), second, and third complete remission and with disease/refractory AML was 53.1 +/- 5.2%, 48.2 +/- 8.3%, 31.2 +/- 17.8%, and 16.0 +/- 4.4%, respectively ( P < .001). From 2007, reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) with fludarabine and melphalan (Flu/Mel) was used in a majority of patients in CR1 (n = 67). Clinical outcomes were compared with historical conventional myeloablative conditioning regimens (n = 38). Use of Flu/Mel was associated with lower treatment-related mortality at 1 year, higher incidence of chronic graft-versus-host-disease, and comparable relapse rates. The 5-year OS and event-free survival for Flu/Mel and myeloablative conditioning group was 67.2 +/- 6.6% versus 38.1 +/- 8.1% ( P = .003) and 63.8 +/- 6.4% versus 32.3 +/- 7.9% ( P = .002), respectively. Preliminary cost analysis suggests that in our medical cost payment system, RIC allo-SCT in CR1 was likely the most cost-effective strategy in the management of AML. Conclusion In a resource-constrained environment, Flu/Mel RIC allo-SCT for AML CR1 is likely the most efficacious and cost-effective approach in a subset of newly diagnosed young adult patients.",,"['Ganapule, Abhijeet', 'Nemani, Sandeep', 'Korula, Anu', 'Lakshmi, Kavitha M', 'Abraham, Aby', 'Srivastava, Alok', 'Balasubramanian, Poonkuzhali', 'George, Biju', 'Mathews, Vikram']","['Ganapule A', 'Nemani S', 'Korula A', 'Lakshmi KM', 'Abraham A', 'Srivastava A', 'Balasubramanian P', 'George B', 'Mathews V']","['All authors: Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.', 'All authors: Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.', 'All authors: Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.', 'All authors: Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.', 'All authors: Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.', 'All authors: Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.', 'All authors: Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.', 'All authors: Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.', 'All authors: Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.']",['eng'],,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],['Journal Article'],20170208,United States,J Glob Oncol,Journal of global oncology,101674751,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods', 'Humans', 'India', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation Conditioning/adverse effects/*methods', 'Young Adult']",PMC5735966,,2017/12/16 06:00,2018/07/20 06:00,['2017/12/16 06:00'],"['2017/12/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1200/JGO.2016.006650 [doi]'],ppublish,J Glob Oncol. 2017 Dec;3(6):773-781. doi: 10.1200/JGO.2016.006650.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: To develop the project, the capacity-building approach was adopted, with on-site training and coaching of personnel, educational meetings, lectures, on-the-job training, and the implementation of quality management planning. RESULTS: Here, we report initial results of peripheral-blood stem-cell mobilization and collection of the first 27 patients (age 12 to 61 years; 19 males and 8 females; multiple myeloma, n = 10; plasma cell leukemia, n = 1; Hodgkin lymphoma, n = 12; non-Hodgkin lymphoma, n = 3; and acute myeloid leukemia, n = 1). Only three (11.5%) of 26 patients experienced a failure of mobilization. A median of 6.1 x 10(6)/kg CD34-positive cells per patient were collected (range, 2.4 to 20.8), with two apheretic runs. Twenty-four patients underwent autologous transplantation. All but one transplantation engrafted fully and steadily, with 0.5 and 1.0 x 10(9)/L polymorphonucleates on day 10.5 (range, 8 to 12) and day 11 (range, 9 to 15), respectively, and with 20 and 50 x 10(9)/L platelets on day 13 (range, 10 to 17) and day 17 (range, 2 to 44), respectively. More than 95% of patients are projected to survive 1 year after autograft. CONCLUSION: These data are the result of an Italian effort to establish in Iraqi Kurdistan a leading center for hemopoietic stem-cell transplantation. The capacity building approach was used, with on-site training and coaching as instruments for the development of provider ability and problem solving. With future limitations for immigration, this method will be helpful, especially in the field of high-technology medicine.",,"['Majolino, Ignazio', 'Mohammed, Dereen', 'Hassan, Dastan', 'Ipsevich, Francesco', 'Abdullah, Chra', 'Mohammed, Rebar', 'Palmas, Angelo', 'Possenti, Marco', 'Noori, Diana', 'Ali, Dlir', 'Karem, Harem', 'Salih, Salah', 'Vacca, Michele', 'Del Fante, Claudia', 'Ostuni, Angelo', 'Frigato, Andrea', 'Massei, Maria Speranza', 'Manna, Annunziata', 'Vasta, Stefania', 'Gabriel, Marcela', 'Verna, Marta', 'Rovelli, Attilio', 'Conter, Valentino', 'Ali, Kosar', 'Othman, Dosti']","['Majolino I', 'Mohammed D', 'Hassan D', 'Ipsevich F', 'Abdullah C', 'Mohammed R', 'Palmas A', 'Possenti M', 'Noori D', 'Ali D', 'Karem H', 'Salih S', 'Vacca M', 'Del Fante C', 'Ostuni A', 'Frigato A', 'Massei MS', 'Manna A', 'Vasta S', 'Gabriel M', 'Verna M', 'Rovelli A', 'Conter V', 'Ali K', 'Othman D']","['Ignazio Majolino, Francesco Ipsevich, Marco Possenti, Michele Vacca, Annunziata Manna, Stefania Vasta, Marta Verna, Attilio Rovelli, and Valentino Conter, International Voluntary Service Association, Milan, Italy;

ILCs have been divided into three main subsets, ILC1, ILC2, and ILC3, that can be specifically activated by different signals coming either indirectly from pathogens or from other cell populations, including cancer cells. Following activation, ILCs are in turn able to promptly secrete a wide range of soluble mediators that modulate effector cell functions. The discovery and the study of these immune cells is now offering important opportunities for innovative therapies of allergic airway diseases, inflammatory disorders and might be crucial for the discovery of new targets for the therapy of cancer. It is therefore fundamental that the scientific community establishes harmonized guidelines to obtain a consensus in the identification and phenotypical and functional characterization of ILCs.

Interpretation of high MPO-positivity can be a diagnostic challenge in B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). While very few such cases have been reported, high MPO positive B-ALL cases without additional myeloid antigen positivity are suspect and require further investigation. METHODS: Three pediatric cases of B-ALL with strong MPO staining (clone 8E6; Invitrogen) at diagnosis and three others with negative MPO staining were studied by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. In-vitro drug cytotoxicity, oxidative stress generation, and immunophenotyping using other MPO clones were performed to further investigate MPO presence. RESULTS: Expectedly, normal myeloid cells in all six samples were positive and mature lymphocytes negative for MPO staining. However, MPO monoclonal antibody (mAb) obtained from clones other than Invitrogen and other myeloid-specific mAbs gave negative results suggesting false positivity of the initial MPO staining. Immunohistochemistry for MPO was also negative on all six cases tested. Furthermore, in-vitro vincristine cytotoxicity was greater in leukemic cells from MPO false-positive cases compared with MPO-negative B-ALL samples, demonstrating indirect lack of MPO activity. Moreover, drug treatment did not lead to generation of reactive oxidative species, also reflective of lack of significant MPO presence. CONCLUSIONS: The cause of false-positive MPO staining remains unknown in these three cases; a cross reactivity could be the culprit. Caution should be given to similar phenomena and detailed investigation may contribute to the understanding of altered protein expression in such outlier cases.

The study was funded by members of the American Petroleum Institute between 2001 and 2009 and was designed to evaluate the human health effects associated with benzene exposure. Two arms of the SHS included: an occupational-based molecular epidemiology study and several hospital-based case control studies. Consistent with historical literature, following sufficient exposure to relatively high airborne concentrations and years of exposure, the SHS concluded that exposure to benzene resulted in an increased risk of various blood and bone marrow abnormalities such as benzene poisoning, aplastic anemia (AA), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) was not significantly increased for the exposures examined in this study. Perhaps the most important contribution of the SHS was furthering our understanding of the mechanism of benzene-induced bone marrow toxicity and the importance of identifying the proper subset of MDS relevant to benzene. Investigators found that benzene-exposed workers exhibited bone marrow morphology consistent with an immune-mediated inflammatory response. Contrary to historic reports, no consistent pattern of cytogenetic abnormalities was identified in these workers. Taken together, findings from SHS provided evidence that the mechanism for benzene-induced bone marrow damage was not initiated by chromosome abnormalities. Instead, chronic inflammation, followed by an immune-mediated response, is likely to play a more significant role in benzene-induced disease initiation and progression than previously thought.",,"['Gross, Sherilyn A', 'Paustenbach, Dennis J']","['Gross SA', 'Paustenbach DJ']","['a Cardno ChemRisk , Jackson , WY , USA.', 'a Cardno ChemRisk , Jackson , WY , USA.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Video-Audio Media']",20171215,England,Crit Rev Toxicol,Critical reviews in toxicology,8914275,['J64922108F (Benzene)'],IM,,"['Benzene/*toxicity', 'Case-Control Studies', 'China/epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Occupational Diseases/*chemically induced/epidemiology/genetics', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Polymorphism, Genetic']",,,2017/12/16 06:00,2019/07/16 06:00,['2017/12/16 06:00'],"['2017/12/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/16 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10408444.2017.1401581 [doi]'],ppublish,Crit Rev Toxicol. 2018 Mar;48(3):217-251. doi: 10.1080/10408444.2017.1401581.

RESULTS: HL-60 cell proliferation could be significantly inhibited by rapamycin (80 mug/mL-640 mug/mL), which was in a dose-dependent manner. HL-60 cell apoptosis ratio and apoptosis-related protein expression were distinctly improved by rapamycin.

As well as activation of downstream signaling, receptor ligation triggers internalization, transit to acidified endosomes and degradation of ligand-receptor complexes. Herein, we investigated the relationship between these two processes in normal and leukemic B cells. We found that leukemic B cells, particularly anergic cases lacking the capacity to initiate downstream signaling, internalize and accumulate ligand in acidified endosomes more efficiently than normal B cells. Furthermore, ligation of either surface CD79B, a B-cell receptor component required for downstream signaling, or surface Immunoglobulin M (IgM) by cognate agonistic antibody, showed that the two molecules internalize independently of each other in leukemic but not normal B cells. Since association with surface CD79B is required for surface retention of IgM, this suggests that uncoupling of B-cell receptor internalization from signaling may be due to the dissociation of these two molecules in leukemic cells. A comparison of lymph node with peripheral blood cells from chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients showed that, despite recent B-cell receptor activation, lymph node B cells expressed higher levels of surface IgM. This surprising finding suggests that the B-cell receptors of lymph node- and peripheral blood-derived leukemic cells might be functionally distinct. Finally, long-term therapy with the Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors ibrutinib or acalabrutinib resulted in a switch to an anergic pattern of B-cell receptor function with reduced signaling capacity, surface IgM expression and more efficient internalization.",['Copyright(c) 2018 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],"['Coulter, Eve M', 'Pepper, Andrea', 'Mele, Silvia', ""Folarin, Najeem'deen"", 'Townsend, William', 'Cuthill, Kirsty', 'Phillips, Elizabeth H', 'Patten, Piers E M', 'Devereux, Stephen']","['Coulter EM', 'Pepper A', 'Mele S', 'Folarin N', 'Townsend W', 'Cuthill K', 'Phillips EH', 'Patten PEM', 'Devereux S']","[""School of Cancer and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King's College London eve.coulter@kcl.ac.uk."", 'Brighton and Sussex Medical School, Medical research Building, University of Sussex, Brighton.', ""St John's Institute of Dermatology, Department of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, King's College London."", 'Department of Haematological Medicine, Kings College Hospital, London, UK.', ""School of Cancer and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King's College London."", 'Department of Haematological Medicine, Kings College Hospital, London, UK.', ""School of Cancer and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King's College London."", ""School of Cancer and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King's College London."", 'Department of Haematological Medicine, Kings College Hospital, London, UK.', 'Department of Haematological Medicine, Kings College Hospital, London, UK.']",['eng'],,['Department of Health/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171214,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (CD79 Antigens)', '0 (CD79B protein, human)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (BTK protein, human)', 'I42748ELQW (acalabrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Benzamides/therapeutic use', 'CD79 Antigens/metabolism', 'Clonal Anergy', 'Endocytosis', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Piperidines', 'Pyrazines/therapeutic use', 'Pyrazoles/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction']",PMC5830387,,2017/12/16 06:00,2019/03/07 06:00,['2017/12/16 06:00'],"['2017/07/21 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/07 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2017.176164 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2017.176164 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2018 Mar;103(3):497-505. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2017.176164.

Nevertheless, most studies supporting this strategy have been performed in young patients. To address the benefit of allogeneic transplantation in the elderly, we made a selection from the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation registry of de novo intermediate-risk cytogenetic acute myeloid leukemia harboring FLT3-ITD in patients aged 60 or over and transplanted from a related or unrelated donor between January 2000 and December 2015. Two hundred and ninety-one patients were identified. Most patients received a reduced-intensity conditioning (82%), while donors consisted of an unrelated donor in 161 (55%) patients. Two hundred and twelve patients received their transplantation in first remission, 37 in second remission and 42 in a more advanced stage of the disease. The 2-year leukemia-free survival rate was 56% in patients in first remission, 22% in those in second remission and 10% in patients with active disease, respectively (P<0.005). Non-relapse mortality for the entire cohort was 20%. In multivariate analysis, disease status at transplantation was the most powerful predictor of worse leukemia-free survival, graft-versus-host disease and relapse-free survival, and overall survival. In this elderly population, age was not associated with outcome.

We set out to develop a powerful and robust predictor for therapy resistance for intensively treated adult patients. We used two large gene expression data sets (n=856) to develop a predictor of therapy resistance, which was validated in an independent cohort analyzed by RNA sequencing (n=250). In addition to gene expression markers, standard clinical and laboratory variables as well as the mutation status of 68 genes were considered during construction of the model. The final predictor (PS29MRC) consisted of 29 gene expression markers and a cytogenetic risk classification. A continuous predictor is calculated as a weighted linear sum of the individual variables. In addition, a cut off was defined to divide patients into a high-risk and a low-risk group for resistant disease. PS29MRC was highly significant in the validation set, both as a continuous score (OR=2.39, P=8.63.10(-9), AUC=0.76) and as a dichotomous classifier (OR=8.03, P=4.29.10(-9)); accuracy was 77%. In multivariable models, only TP53 mutation, age and PS29MRC (continuous: OR=1.75, P=0.0011; dichotomous: OR=4.44, P=0.00021) were left as significant variables. PS29MRC dominated all models when compared with currently used predictors, and also predicted overall survival independently of established markers. When integrated into the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) 2017 genetic risk stratification, four groups (median survival of 8, 18, 41 months, and not reached) could be defined (P=4.01.10(-10)). PS29MRC will make it possible to design trials which stratify induction treatment according to the probability of response, and refines the ELN 2017 classification.",['Copyright(c) 2018 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],"['Herold, Tobias', 'Jurinovic, Vindi', 'Batcha, Aarif M N', 'Bamopoulos, Stefanos A', 'Rothenberg-Thurley, Maja', 'Ksienzyk, Bianka', 'Hartmann, Luise', 'Greif, Philipp A', 'Phillippou-Massier, Julia', 'Krebs, Stefan', 'Blum, Helmut', 'Amler, Susanne', 'Schneider, Stephanie', 'Konstandin, Nikola', 'Sauerland, Maria Cristina', 'Gorlich, Dennis', 'Berdel, Wolfgang E', 'Wormann, Bernhard J', 'Tischer, Johanna', 'Subklewe, Marion', 'Bohlander, Stefan K', 'Braess, Jan', 'Hiddemann, Wolfgang', 'Metzeler, Klaus H', 'Mansmann, Ulrich', 'Spiekermann, Karsten']","['Herold T', 'Jurinovic V', 'Batcha AMN', 'Bamopoulos SA', 'Rothenberg-Thurley M', 'Ksienzyk B', 'Hartmann L', 'Greif PA', 'Phillippou-Massier J', 'Krebs S', 'Blum H', 'Amler S', 'Schneider S', 'Konstandin N', 'Sauerland MC', 'Gorlich D', 'Berdel WE', 'Wormann BJ', 'Tischer J', 'Subklewe M', 'Bohlander SK', 'Braess J', 'Hiddemann W', 'Metzeler KH', 'Mansmann U', 'Spiekermann K']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Munich, Germany tobias.herold@med.uni-muenchen.de.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Partner Site Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Informatics, Biometry and Epidemiology, University of Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Partner Site Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Informatics, Biometry and Epidemiology, University of Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Partner Site Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Partner Site Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Biostatistics and Clinical Research, University of Munster, Germany', 'Institute of Biostatistics and Clinical Research, University of Munster, Germany', 'Institute of Biostatistics and Clinical Research, University of Munster, Germany', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Munich, Germany.', 'Institute of Biostatistics and Clinical Research, University of Munich, Germany.', 'Institute of Biostatistics and Clinical Research, University of Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University of Munster, Germany.', 'German Society of Hematology and Oncology, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine and Pathology, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, Hospital Barmherzige Bruder, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Partner Site Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Partner Site Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Partner Site Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Informatics, Biometry and Epidemiology, University of Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Partner Site Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171214,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,['Haematologica. 2018 Mar;103(3):375-377.

To better understand causes of death in patients after a hospitalization with AKI and to determine patient and hospital factors associated with mortality, we conducted a population-based study of residents in Ontario, Canada, who survived a hospitalization with AKI from 2003 to 2013. Using linked administrative databases, we categorized cause of death in the year after hospital discharge as cardiovascular, cancer, infection-related, or other. We calculated standardized mortality ratios to compare the causes of death in survivors of AKI with those in the general adult population and used Cox proportional hazards modeling to estimate determinants of death. Of the 156,690 patients included, 43,422 (28%) died in the subsequent year. The most common causes of death were cardiovascular disease (28%) and cancer (28%), with respective standardized mortality ratios nearly six-fold (5.81; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 5.70 to 5.92) and eight-fold (7.87; 95% CI, 7.72 to 8.02) higher than those in the general population. The highest standardized mortality ratios were for bladder cancer (18.24; 95% CI, 17.10 to 19.41), gynecologic cancer (16.83; 95% CI, 15.63 to 18.07), and leukemia (14.99; 95% CI, 14.16 to 15.85). Along with older age and nursing home residence, cancer and chemotherapy strongly associated with 1-year mortality. In conclusion, cancer-related death was as common as cardiovascular death in these patients; moreover, cancer-related deaths occurred at substantially higher rates than in the general population.

In this study (ASPIRE), we aimed to assess eltrombopag, an oral thrombopoietin receptor agonist, for thrombocytopenia (grade 4) treatment in adult patients with advanced MDS or AML. METHODS: ASPIRE consisted of an open-label, double-blind phase for 8 weeks and a randomised, double-blind phase (parts 1 and 2, reported here) for 12 weeks, and an open-label extension (part 3). Eligible patients were men and women aged 18 years or older, with intermediate-2 or high-risk MDS or AML, with bone marrow blasts of 50% or less, and had either grade 4 thrombocytopenia due to bone marrow insufficiency (platelet counts <25 x 10(9) per L) or grade 4 thrombocytopenia before platelet transfusion, with 25 x 10(9) platelets per L or greater after transfusion. Additionally, eligible patients had at least one of the following within the screening period of 4 weeks: platelet transfusion, symptomatic bleeding, or platelet count of less than 10 x 10(9) per L. During part 1, patients received eltrombopag, and dose-escalation criteria for part 2 were determined. In part 2, we randomly allocated patients 2:1 using an interactive voice-response system to eltrombopag or placebo, stratified by baseline platelet count (<10 x 10(9) platelets per L vs >/=10 x 10(9) platelets per L) and disease (MDS vs AML). In parts 1 and 2, patients received supportive standard of care and initiated eltrombopag or placebo at 100 mg per day (50 mg per day for patients of east-Asian heritage) to a maximum of 300 mg per day (150 mg per day for patients of east-Asian heritage). The part 2 primary objective was assessed by a composite primary endpoint of clinically relevant thrombocytopenic events (CRTE) during weeks 5-12, defined as one of the following events, either alone or in combination: grade 3 or worse haemorrhagic adverse events; platelet counts of less than 10 x 10(9) per L; or platelet transfusions. Efficacy analyses were based on intention to treat; clinically meaningful efficacy was defined as 30% absolute difference between groups. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01440374. FINDINGS: In part 1, 17 patients received eltrombopag and 11 patients completed treatment; four experienced significantly increased platelet counts, and ten had reduced platelet transfusion requirements. In part 2 we randomly allocated 145 patients to receive supportive care plus eltrombopag (n=98) or placebo (n=47); similar proportions had MDS (50 [51%] patients to eltrombopag, 22 (47%) patients to placebo) or AML (48 [49%] patients to eltrombopag, 25 [53%] patients to placebo). Average weekly CRTE proportions from weeks 5-12 were significantly lower with eltrombopag (54% [95% CI 43-64]) than with placebo (69% [57-80], odds ratio [OR] 0.20, 95% CI 0.05-0.87; p=0.032) although the difference between treatment groups was less than 30%. The most common grade 3 and grade 4 adverse events were fatigue (six [6%] in the eltrombopag group and one [2%] in the placebo group), hypokalaemia (six [6%] and two [4%]), pneumonia (five [5%] and five [11%]), and febrile neutropenia (five [5%] and six [13%]). Serious adverse events were reported in 56 (58%) eltrombopag-treated patients and 32 (68%) placebo-treated patients. Seven eltrombopag recipients and two placebo recipients had serious adverse events that were suspected to be study drug-related (eltrombopag: acute kidney injury, arterial thrombosis, bone pain, diarrhoea, myocardial infarction, pyrexia, retinal vein occlusion, n=1 each; placebo: vomiting, white blood cell count increased, n=1 each). Two eltrombopag recipients (arterial thrombosis n=1; myocardial infarction n=1) and no placebo recipients experienced fatal serious adverse events suspected to be study drug-related. INTERPRETATION: No new safety concerns were noted with eltrombopag and the trial met the primary objective of a reduction in CRTEs; eltrombopag might be a treatment option for thrombocytopenic patients with AML or MDS who are ineligible for other treatment and who are not receiving disease-modifying treatment.

It is also highly expressed in several B cell malignancies and autoimmune diseases. G6 is an anti-idiotypic monoclonal Ab that selectively binds to IGHV1-69 heavy chain germline gene 51p1 alleles that have been implicated in these Ab responses and disease processes. Here, we determine the co-crystal structure of humanized G6 (hG6.3) in complex with anti-influenza hemagglutinin stem-directed broadly neutralizing Ab D80. The core of the hG6.3 idiotope is a continuous string of CDR-H2 residues starting with M53 and ending with N58. G6 binding studies demonstrate the remarkable breadth of binding to 51p1 IGHV1-69 Abs with diverse CDR-H3, light chain, and antigen binding specificities.

More than one-half of all older (>/=65 years) patients in the phase 3 AZA-AML-001 trial had newly diagnosed AML-MRC. METHODS: We compared clinical outcomes for patients with AML-MRC treated with azacitidine or conventional care regimens (CCR; induction chemotherapy, low-dose cytarabine, or supportive care only) overall and within patient subgroups defined by cytogenetic risk (intermediate or poor) and age (65-74 years or >/=75 years). The same analyses were used to compare azacitidine with low-dose cytarabine in patients who had been preselected to low-dose cytarabine before they were randomized to receive azacitidine or CCR (ie, low-dose cytarabine). RESULTS: Median overall survival was significantly prolonged with azacitidine (n = 129) versus CCR (n = 133): 8.9 versus 4.9 months (hazard ratio 0.74, [95%CI 0.57, 0.97]). Among patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics, median overall survival with azacitidine was 16.4 months, and with CCR was 8.9 months (hazard ratio 0.73 [95%CI 0.48, 1.10]). Median overall survival was significantly improved for patients ages 65-74 years treated with azacitidine compared with those who received CCR (14.2 versus 7.3 months, respectively; hazard ratio 0.64 [95%CI 0.42, 0.97]). Within the subgroup of patients preselected to low-dose cytarabine before randomization, median overall survival with azacitidine was 9.5 months versus 4.6 months with low-dose cytarabine (hazard ratio 0.77 [95%CI 0.55, 1.09]). Within the low-dose cytarabine preselection group, patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics who received azacitidine had a median overall survival of 14.1 months versus 6.4 months with low-dose cytarabine, and patients aged 65-74 years had median survival of 14.9 months versus 5.2 months, respectively. Overall response rates were similar with azacitidine and CCR (24.8% and 17.3%, respectively), but higher with azacitidine versus low-dose cytarabine (27.2% and 13.9%). Adverse events were generally comparable between the treatment arms. CONCLUSIONS: Azacitidine may be the preferred treatment for patients with AML-MRC who are not candidates for intensive chemotherapy, particularly patients ages 65-74 years and those with intermediate-risk cytogenetics.

Although recent drug approvals have provided an increase in the number of treatment options in AML, further optimization of standard induction therapy is still necessary. The most commonly utilized induction options have been well studied, but there is a paucity of literature comparing the combination of idarubicin with cytarabine and cladribine. OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical effectiveness of the addition of cladribine to idarubicin and cytarabine (7+3 IA) induction therapy in the treatment of AML. METHODS: This retrospective, propensity score-matched cohort study evaluated 37 patients with previously untreated AML who received either 7+3 IA or idarubicin, cytarabine, and cladribine (7+3+5 IAC) as induction therapy. The primary end point of this study was complete response (CR), with secondary end points including hospital length of stay (LOS), and adverse event rates. RESULTS: After propensity score matching, odds of reaching CR in the 7+3+5 IAC cohort were increased by 33% (95% CI = 1.09-1.55; P < 0.01) compared with the 7+3 IA cohort. Patients who received cladribine were also found to have a reduction in hospital LOS by 3.5 days (95% CI = 0.07-6.85; P = 0.045) without an increase in adverse event rates. CONCLUSION: The addition of cladribine to the 7+3 IA regimen may improve clinical outcomes when used as initial induction therapy, without increasing the incidence of adverse event rates.",,"['Seligson, Nathan D', 'Hobbs, Athena L V', 'Leonard, Joanna M', 'Mills, Elizabeth L', 'Evans, Amy G', 'Goorha, Salil']","['Seligson ND', 'Hobbs ALV', 'Leonard JM', 'Mills EL', 'Evans AG', 'Goorha S']","['1 The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', '2 The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', '3 Baptist Memorial Hospital - Memphis, Memphis, TN, USA.', '3 Baptist Memorial Hospital - Memphis, Memphis, TN, USA.', '3 Baptist Memorial Hospital - Memphis, Memphis, TN, USA.', '3 Baptist Memorial Hospital - Memphis, Memphis, TN, USA.', '4 Baptist Cancer Center, Memphis, TN, USA.']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],20171214,United States,Ann Pharmacother,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,9203131,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cladribine/*administration & dosage', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/*administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Propensity Score', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2017/12/16 06:00,2019/09/24 06:00,['2017/12/16 06:00'],"['2017/12/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/24 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1060028017749214 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Pharmacother. 2018 May;52(5):439-445. doi: 10.1177/1060028017749214.

METHODS: Effects of the CDK9 inhibitor flavopiridol (FP; alvocidib) on responses to ABT-199 were examined in MM cells. Cell death and protein expression were evaluated by western blot and immunofluorescence. Xenograft models were used to study combination effects in vivo. RESULTS: FP synergistically increased ABT-199 lethality in both ABT-199-sensitive and insensitive MM cells. FP blocked CDK9 activation/positive transcription elongation factor B phosphorylation, downregulated MCL-1, increased BCL-2/MCL-1 ratios, and upregulated BIM. MCL-1 ectopic expression or knockdown in MM cells significantly diminished or increased ABT-199 sensitivity, respectively. CDK9 knockdown triggered MCL-1 downregulation and increased ABT-199 activity, whereas BIM knockdown significantly reduced FP/ABT-199 lethality. FP also enhanced ABT-199 lethality in unfavourable prognosis primary MM cells. HS-5 cell co-culture failed to protect MM cells from the FP/ABT-199 regimen, suggesting circumvention of microenvironmental signals. Finally, FP/ABT-199 significantly increased survival in systemic xenograft and immune-competent MM models while exhibiting minimal toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: These findings argue that CDK9 inhibitors, for example, FP may increase the antimyeloma activity of ABT-199, including in unfavourable-risk MM minimally responsive to ABT-199 alone.",,"['Zhou, Liang', 'Zhang, Yu', 'Sampath, Deepak', 'Leverson, Joel', 'Dai, Yun', 'Kmieciak, Maciej', 'Nguyen, Matthew', 'Orlowski, Robert Z', 'Grant, Steven']","['Zhou L', 'Zhang Y', 'Sampath D', 'Leverson J', 'Dai Y', 'Kmieciak M', 'Nguyen M', 'Orlowski RZ', 'Grant S']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA 23298, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA 23298, USA.', 'Genentech, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA.', 'AbbVie, North Chicago, IL 60064, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA 23298, USA.', 'Massey Cancer Center, Virginia Commonwealth University Health Sciences Center, Richmond, VA 23298, USA.', 'Massey Cancer Center, Virginia Commonwealth University Health Sciences Center, Richmond, VA 23298, USA.', 'Department of Myeloma and Lymphoma, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA 23298, USA.', 'Massey Cancer Center, Richmond, VA 23298, USA.']",['eng'],,"['R01 CA205607/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UH2 TR001373/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA142509/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA100866/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA167708/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016059/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20171214,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '45AD6X575G (alvocidib)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK9 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 9)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11/genetics/metabolism', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 9/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Flavonoids/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Piperidines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sulfonamides/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",PMC5808038,,2017/12/15 06:00,2019/04/06 06:00,['2017/12/15 06:00'],"['2017/07/17 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/01 00:00 [revised]', '2017/11/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/06 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['bjc2017432 [pii]', '10.1038/bjc.2017.432 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2018 Feb 6;118(3):388-397. doi: 10.1038/bjc.2017.432.

SC1 is a small molecule modulator that effectively maintains the self-renewal of mouse ES cells in the absence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), serum and feeder cells. However, the mechanism by which SC1 maintains the undifferentiated state of mouse ES cells remains unclear. METHODS: In this study, microarray and small RNA deep-sequencing experiments were performed on mouse ES cells treated with or without SC1 to identify the key genes and microRNAs that contributed to self-renewal. RESULTS: SC1 regulates the expressions of pluripotency and differentiation factors, and antagonizes the retinoic acid (RA)-induced differentiation in the presence or absence of LIF. SC1 inhibits the MEK/ERK pathway through Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis and pathway reporting experiments. Small RNA deep-sequencing revealed that SC1 significantly modulates the expression of multiple microRNAs with crucial functions in ES cells. The expression of miR124-3p is upregulated in SC1-treated ES cells, which significantly inhibits the MEK/ERK pathway by targeting Grb2, Sos2 and Egr1. CONCLUSION: SC1 enhances the self-renewal capacity of mouse ES cells by modulating the expression of key regulatory genes and pluripotency-associated microRNAs. SC1 significantly upregulates miR124-3p expression to further inhibit the MEK/ ERK pathway by targeting Grb2, Sos2 and Egr1.","['(c) 2017 The Author(s). Published by S.

The objective of this study was to determine the effect of plasma-deposited functional organic coatings on monocyte adhesion and differentiation into macrophages. Organic coatings with varying oxygen and nitrogen concentration were prepared by low-pressure plasma co-polymerization of binary gas mixtures combining a hydrocarbon (butadiene/ethylene) and a heteroatom-containing gas (carbon dioxide/ammonia) to deposit either oxygen or nitrogen-containing coatings. The deposition parameters controlled the composition of the coatings and, consequently, the surface charge (between 26mV and -28mV) and wettability. The adhesion of myeloid leukemia cell lines U937 and NB4 as well as human monocytes to plasma polymerized coatings, was tested using cell culture medium with and without fetal bovine serum. The results showed that the concentration of [-NH2] and [-COOH] on the surface of the plasma polymers, controls the adhesion of U937 and NB4 cell lines to the coatings. Thus, above a certain composition threshold, i.e. [-NH2]=2.6-3.0% and [-COOH]=1.2-1.57nmol/cm(2), the surface facilitates adhesion of both cell lines, irrespective of the culture medium used. Based on qualitative observations the number of monocytes adhering to the coatings was proportional to the concentration of functional groups at the surface of the coatings. The surface plasmon resonance results, in line with cell culture experiments, indicated that the presence of albumin on the surfaces with [-NH2] and [-COOH] above the determined critical concentration may be an indicator of monocyte adhesion to these plasma polymers.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We show that MLL-AF9 cells critically depend on FLT3-ligand induced pathways as well as on BRD3/4 for their survival. We evaluated the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of the BRD3/4 inhibitor I-BET151 in various human MLL-AF9 (primary) models and patient samples and analyzed the transcriptome changes following treatment. To further understand the mode of action of BRD3/4 inhibition, we performed ChIP-seq experiments on the MLL-AF9 complex in THP1 cells and compared it to RNA-seq data of I-BET151 treated cells. While we could confirm a consistent and specific downregulation of key-oncogenic drivers such as MYC and BCL2, we found that the majority of I-BET151-responsive genes were not direct MLL-AF9 targets. In fact, MLL-AF9 specific targets such as the HOXA cluster, MEIS1 and other cell cycle regulators such as CDK6 were not affected by I-BET151 treatment. Furthermore, we also highlight how MLL-AF9 transformed cells are dependent on the function of non-mutated hematopoietic transcription factors and tyrosine kinases such as the FLT3-TAK1/NF-kB pathway, again impacting on BCL2 but not on the HOXA cluster. We conclude that BRD3/4 and the FLT3-TAK1/NF-kB pathways collectively control a set of targets that are critically important for the survival of human MLL-AF9 cells.",,"['Carretta, Marco', 'Brouwers-Vos, Annet Z', 'Bosman, Matthieu', 'Horton, Sarah J', 'Martens, Joost H A', 'Vellenga, Edo', 'Schuringa, Jan Jacob']","['Carretta M', 'Brouwers-Vos AZ', 'Bosman M', 'Horton SJ', 'Martens JHA', 'Vellenga E', 'Schuringa JJ']","['Department of Experimental Hematology, Cancer Research Center Groningen (CRCG), University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, Cancer Research Center Groningen (CRCG), University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, Cancer Research Center Groningen (CRCG), University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, Cancer Research Center Groningen (CRCG), University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Faculty of Science and Medicine, Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences, Radboud University Nijmegen, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, Cancer Research Center Groningen (CRCG), University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, Cancer Research Center Groningen (CRCG), University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],20171214,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (BRD3 protein, human)', '0 (BRD4 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,,"['Cell Cycle Proteins', '*Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/metabolism/*pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Transcription Factors/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*metabolism']",PMC5730124,,2017/12/15 06:00,2018/01/18 06:00,['2017/12/15 06:00'],"['2017/07/07 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0189102 [doi]', 'PONE-D-17-25192 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2017 Dec 14;12(12):e0189102. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0189102. eCollection 2017.,,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8452-8555'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A total of 2871 CSF samples from 357 adult patients with newly diagnosed ALL between the year of 2009 and 2015 were analyzed retrospectively. These patients were divided into 3 groups according to CSF results, FCM+/conventional cytology (CC)+ group, FCM+/CC- group, and FCM-/CC- group, respectively. The overall survival (OS) of the three groups was analyzed. RESULTS: Fifteen (4.2%) and 26 (7.3%) patients' CSF samples were FCM+/CC+ and FCM+/CC-, respectively. The remaining 316 (88.5%) patients' samples were FCM-/CC-. The 2-year OS for the FCM+/CC+, FCM+/CC-, and FCM-/CC- groups was 40.0%, 20.6%, and 64.2%, respectively (P < .001). There was no statistically significant difference in OS between FCM+/CC+ and FCM+/CC- patients (P = .195). In multivariate analysis, a high WBC count and LDH level were independent risk factors for central nervous system involvement in adult patients with ALL. CONCLUSIONS: FCM demonstrated a superior sensitivity over conventional cytology in the diagnosis of central nervous system involvement in adult patients with ALL.

WT1 has also been implicated in the development of tumours in several organ systems, including acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Four main WT1 isoforms come from 2 alternative splice events. One alternative splice results in the inclusion or exclusion of 3 amino acids, KTS, between zinc fingers 3 and 4 in the WT1 protein. The KTS insert has been extensively investigated due to the functional implications for DNA and RNA binding. In this review, we provide an overview of the research into the isoforms containing or lacking the KTS insert in leukaemic cells, as well as the research into the binding patterns of the WT1 -KTS and +KTS isoforms to DNA and RNA. Finally, we connect the results of the DNA binding research to the ChIP-CHIP and ChIP-Seq investigations into the global genomic binding of the WT1 protein that have recently been performed.",['(c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Our retrospective single-center study sought to investigate parameters that influence post-second allogeneic HCT survival. METHOD: We investigated 92 patients who underwent second allogeneic HCT between 1980 and 2016 for relapse or graft failure following first HCT. Median age at second HCT was 41 years (range 16-68), performed for relapse in 59 patients (64%) and for graft failure in 33 patients (36%). RESULTS: On univariate analysis, 3-year OS of the entire cohort was 35% (95% CI=25-45). Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score (3-year OS 48% for ECOG 0-1, 18% for ECOG 2-3, P=.0006), second HCT indication (3-year OS 43% for relapse, 20% for graft failure, P=.02), time from first HCT to relapse/graft failure (3-year OS for <12months 21%, for >/=12months 46%, P=.009), and conditioning intensity (3-year OS for MA 42% vs other regimens 23%, P=.08) significantly influenced OS. Multivariable analysis confirmed ECOG score (HR=2.15 for ECOG 2-3, 95% CI=1.32-3.51, P=.002) and second HCT indication (HR=1.67 for graft failure, 95% CI=1.02-2.75, P=.04) to independently influence survival. CONCLUSION: Second HCT may offer long-term survival particularly to patients with good performance status who relapse post-first HCT.",['(c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

MPN and post-MPN AML are dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation of STATs, but the role of serine STAT1 phosphorylation remains unclear. We previously demonstrated that Mediator kinase inhibitor cortistatin A (CA) reduced proliferation of JAK2-mutant AML in vitro and in vivo and also suppressed CDK8-dependent phosphorylation of STAT1 at serine 727. Here we report that phosphorylation of STAT1 S727 promotes the proliferation of AML cells with JAK-STAT pathway activation. Inhibition of serine phosphorylation by CA promotes growth arrest and differentiation, inhibits colony formation in MPN patient samples and reduces allele burden in MPN mouse models. These results reveal that STAT1 pS727 regulates growth and differentiation in JAK-STAT activated neoplasms and suggest that Mediator kinase inhibition represents a therapeutic strategy to regulate JAK-STAT signaling.",['Copyright (c) 2017.

Clinical progression in some dogs was not as rapid as previously reported. Haematologic responses to various chemotherapeutics were documented in 3 dogs, with associated survival times of 62, 103 and 121 days. Dogs treated with prednisone or a combination of chemotherapy and prednisone had improved survival compared to dogs that received symptomatic care only (P < .0001).

In addition, only a detailed, laborious phenotypic analysis allows identifying the presence and stage of specific pathologies such as leukemia. Most of the biochemical information is lost in the routine blood tests. In the present study, we tackle 2 important issues of label-free biochemical identification and classification of leukocytes using Raman spectroscopy (RS). First, we demonstrate that leukocyte subpopulations of lymphocytes (B, T and NK cells), monocytes and granulocytes can be identified by the unsupervised statistical approach of principal component analysis and classified by linear discriminant analysis with approximately 99% of accuracy. Second, we apply the same procedure to identify and discriminate normal B cells and transformed MN60 lymphocyte leukemic cell lines. In addition, we demonstrate that RS can be efficiently used for monitoring the cell response to low-dose chemotherapy treatment, experimentally eliciting the sensitivity to a dose-dependent cell response, which is of fundamental importance to determine the efficacy of any treatment. These results largely expand established Raman-based research protocols for label-free analysis of white blood cells, leukemic cells and chemotherapy treatment follow-up.","['(c) 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

A consistent seasonal trend may possibly provide etiological insights into pediatric cancers. This study aims to determine if there is a seasonal variation in cancer diagnoses in the pediatric population at the IWK Health Centre, a tertiary care center serving three Canadian provinces: Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island. All pediatric cancer patients aged 0-20 y diagnosed from 1995 to 2015 at the center were included in this study. The annual data was divided into four seasonal periods (December to February, March to May, June to August, and September to November). The cancer diagnoses were categorized as leukemia, lymphoma, sarcoma, brain tumors, and miscellaneous. Seasonal variation was assessed by a harmonic function in a Poisson regression model. The amplitude of multiplicative change in the incidence rate caused by the seasonal variation is expressed as the incidence rate ratio (IRR). For all cancer diagnoses for the entire cohort of 1200 patients, the IRR was 1.03 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96-1.13]. None of the IRRs for the cancer groups indicated a statistically significant seasonality of cancer diagnosis: Leukemia 1.11 (95% CI 0.96-1.28); Lymphoma 1.17 (95% CI 0.93-1.47); Sarcoma 1.29 (95% CI 0.99-1.69); Brain tumors 1.16 (95% CI 0.97-1.38); Miscellaneous 1.09 (95% CI 0.93-1.27).

With a 20% overall survival rate at 5 years and 50% in the 18- to 65-year-old age group, new medicines are needed. It is proposed that development of repurposed drugs may be a part of the new therapy needed. AML is subdivided into recurrent molecular entities based on molecular genetics increasingly accessible for precision medicine. Novel therapy developments form a basis for novel multimodality therapy and include liposomal daunorubicin/cytarabine, broad or FLT3-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors, Bcl-2 family inhibitors, selective inhibitors of nuclear export, metabolic inhibitors, and demethylating agents. The use of non-transplant immunotherapy is in early development in AML with the exceptional re-approval of a toxin-conjugated anti-CD33. However, the full potential of small molecule inhibitors and modalities like immunological checkpoint inhibitors, immunostimulatory small molecules, and CAR-T cell therapy is unknown. Some novel therapeutics will certainly benefit AML patient subgroups; however, due to high cost, more affordable alternatives are needed globally. Also the heterogeneity of AML will likely demand a broader repertoire of therapeutic molecules. Drug repurposing or repositioning represent a source for potential therapeutics with well-known toxicity profiles and reasonable prices. This implies that biomarkers of response need to accompany the development of antileukemic therapies for sharply defined patient subgroups.

T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL) is more rare and more rapidly progressive and aggressive than B-PLL; it is generally resistant to conventional chemotherapy, and historically the median survival has been about 7 months. Clinicians will often only see a case of T-PLL once every 5 to 10 years, which makes recognition of the disorder difficult. The prognosis is poor and there is no curative therapy. We report a 77-year-old male patient with de novo T-PLL presenting with WBC count of 1,115,000. We will discuss the clinical, morphologic, immunophenotypic and cytogenetic features of this rare entity. A distinctive hematologic aspect of T-PLL is a rapidly rising white blood cell count with a doubling time of weeks to months. The key morphologic feature in the diagnosis of T-PLL is a population of more than 55% prolymphocytes in the peripheral blood. The diagnosis can be made on peripheral blood by flow cytometry where a monoclonal lymphocyte population will show positivity for T-cell markers. T-PLL is characterized by complex chromosomal abnormalities, which suggests that chromosomal aberrations might occur progressively during the course of the disease, thus explaining the aggressive nature of this condition. The main challenge as a clinician treating T-PLL is to deliver long-term disease-free survival. The most important predictor of outcome is response to alemtuzumab therapy (Campath). Knowledge of the disrupted pathways and mechanisms underlying activation and proliferation in T-PLL has raised the possibility of developing future and promising treatment approach that targets these pathways and signals by the use of future molecule inhibitors. T-PLL is a rare disease and careful attention should be given to correctly diagnose this T-cell leukemia. Physicians should be aware of this unusual entity. With the advent of alemtuzumab, although much progress has been made in the treatment of this disease, autologous or allogeneic hematologic stem cell transplant (HSCT) still remains the only hope for cure.",,"['Figueroa-Jimenez, Luis A', 'Cabrera-Marquez, Amy Lee', 'Baez-Diaz, Luis', 'Caceres-Perkins, William']","['Figueroa-Jimenez LA', 'Cabrera-Marquez AL', 'Baez-Diaz L', 'Caceres-Perkins W']","['Hematology-Medical Oncology Section, VA Caribbean Healthcare System and San Juan City, Hospital, San Juan, Puerto Rico.', 'Hematology-Medical Oncology Section, VA Caribbean Healthcare System and San Juan City, Hospital, San Juan, Puerto Rico.', 'Hematology-Medical Oncology Section, VA Caribbean Healthcare System and San Juan City, Hospital, San Juan, Puerto Rico.', 'Hematology-Medical Oncology Section, VA Caribbean Healthcare System and San Juan City, Hospital, San Juan, Puerto Rico.']",['eng'],,['U54 CA163068/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],,Puerto Rico,Bisturi (S Juan),El Bisturi,101701003,,,,,PMC5726281,['NIHMS843281'],2016/03/01 00:00,2016/03/01 00:01,['2017/12/15 06:00'],"['2017/12/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/01 00:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Bisturi (S Juan). 2016 Mar-Jun;2016:12-16.,,['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell Prolymphocytic leukemias (B-PLL)', 'T-cell Prolymphocytic leukemias (T-PLL)']",,['Conflict of Interest: The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we compared AMLprofiler to routine AML diagnostic methodologies employed in South Africa, focusing on consistency of the results, cost, and time to result. RNA was isolated from bone marrow and peripheral blood samples from patients with de novo AML and was processed using Affymetrix Gene Profiling Reagent kits. The results from AMLprofiler and standard methodologies were highly comparable. In addition, many samples were determined to be positive for biomarkers not routinely investigated in South Africa, namely, CEBPA double mutants, NPM1 variants, and altered expression levels of BAALC and EVI1. 38% of samples presented with no positive biomarker; AMLprofiler nonetheless enabled 26% of AML patients to be classified into either favorable or poor prognostic categories.

However, this association has not been examined in depth. We aimed to determine if maternal diabetes is associated with risk of childhood brain tumor (CBT), leukemia (all types combined and acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL] separately), and lymphoma. Methods: All children born in Sweden between 1973 and 2014 (n=4,239,965) were followed from birth until first cancer diagnosis, age 15 years, or December 31, 2015. Data on maternal diabetes, childhood cancer, and covariates were obtained from nationwide health registers. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using Cox regression adjusted for potential confounders/mediators. Additionally, we performed an exploratory analysis using results from published genome-wide association studies and functional annotation. Results: Maternal diabetes was associated with lower risk of CBT (adjusted IRR [95% CI]: 0.56 [0.35-0.91]) and higher risk of leukemia (adjusted IRR: 1.47 [1.13-1.92] for all leukemia combined and 1.64 [1.23-2.18] for ALL). These associations were similar for both maternal type 1 diabetes and gestational diabetes. Associations of five previously identified genetic loci were compatible with a causal effect of diabetes traits on neuroblastoma and common Hodgkin's lymphoma. Conclusion: Children whose mother had diabetes had lower risk of CBT and higher risk of leukemia, compared with children whose mother did not have diabetes.

A pilot study was done in which 16 consecutive cases of ALL were analyzed and followed-up for a period of 1 year. Diagnosis of ALL was established after subjecting blood/bone marrow aspirate samples to morphological examination, immunophenotyping, and detection of fusion transcripts by multiplex reverse transcription (RT)-PCR using HemaVision kit. Results were analyzed by correlating with morphology, immunophenotype, and response to therapy. Epi-Info statistical software was used. 43% (seven cases) showed balanced translocations, with all seven cases being B-ALL and t(9;22) being the most common. There was a consistent association of CD25 cases with t(9;22). Analyses of relation to other parameters were as expected by their respective WHO 2008 subtype. No significant correlation in terms of survival benefit was seen between cases with and without balanced translocations (P = 0.7472). The study demonstrated the utility of multiplex RT-PCR in the initial evaluation, subtyping, and monitoring minimal residual disease in ALL cases with balanced translocations, thereby guiding both therapy and prognosis.

They can arise de-novo or in association with hematological malignancies, most commonly acute myeloid leukemia. Clinically, it can masquerade as an abscess, cutaneous ulcer, or mass lesion. Morphologically, MS can mimic a variety of small round cell tumors including lymphomas and rhabdomyosarcoma. AIMS: (1) To study the clinical presentations and laboratory findings in patients with MS; (2) to revisit the histomorphological findings and the differential diagnosis of MS; (3) to evaluate the diagnostic role of immunohistochemistry (IHC) and determine the useful markers for accurate diagnosis of MS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed cases of MS reported in our institution over a 10-year period from January 2004 to December 2013. The clinical presentations, laboratory data, and histopathological and immunohistochemical findings were studied. RESULTS: There were nine cases in our database, none of which were clinically suspected to be MS. Age ranged from 3 to 55 years, with a slight female preponderance. Cervical lymph nodes were the most common site involved. Histologically, the common finding was the presence of medium- to large-sized cells with fine granular chromatin, small nucleolus, and scant cytoplasm along with scattered eosinophil precursors. Myeloperoxidase was the most useful IHC marker. All cases were also positive for leukocyte common antigen contributing to the diagnostic confusion with lymphoma.

RESULTS: On univariate analysis, cyclophosphamide with total-body irradiation (TBI) based conditioning regimen and lower body mass index (BMI) were associated with lower CsA-1, while use of fludarabine and higher BMI were associated with higher CsA-1. On multivariate analysis, only fludarabine use and BMI affected CsA-1. Incidence of acute and chronic GVHD (aGVHD and cGVHD), transplant-related mortality, relapse incidence, and relapse-free and overall survival (OS) were similar in the three groups. CONCLUSION: While fludarabine use in conditioning regimen and higher BMI leads to higher CsA-1, transplant outcomes are not affected by CsA-1.",,"['Gupta, Alok', 'Punatar, Sachin', 'Gawande, Jayant', 'Mathew, Libin', 'Kannan, Sadhana', 'Khattry, Navin']","['Gupta A', 'Punatar S', 'Gawande J', 'Mathew L', 'Kannan S', 'Khattry N']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Advanced Centre for Treatment Research and Education in Cancer, Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],,India,J Cancer Res Ther,Journal of cancer research and therapeutics,101249598,"['83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'HU9DX48N0T (Mycophenolic Acid)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Body Mass Index', 'Child', 'Cyclosporine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*blood', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/blood/etiology/pathology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/*drug therapy/pathology/radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycophenolic Acid/administration & dosage', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Young Adult']",,,2017/12/15 06:00,2018/07/19 06:00,['2017/12/15 06:00'],"['2017/12/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/19 06:00 [medline]']","['JCanResTher_2017_13_6_981_157338 [pii]', '10.4103/0973-1482.157338 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cancer Res Ther. 2017 Oct-Dec;13(6):981-988. doi: 10.4103/0973-1482.157338.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TRK fusions are actionable targets as evidenced by recent clinical trial results in solid tumors. Entrectinib (RXDX-101) is an investigational, orally available, CNS-active, highly potent, and selective kinase inhibitor against TRKA/B/C, ROS1, and ALK kinase activities. Here, we demonstrate that TRK kinase inhibition by entrectinib selectively targets preclinical models of TRK fusion-driven hematologic malignancies. In acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cell lines with endogenous expression of the ETV6-NTRK3 fusion gene, entrectinib treatment blocked cell proliferation and induced apoptotic cell death in vitro with subnanomolar IC50 values. Phosphorylation of the ETV6-TRKC fusion protein and its downstream signaling effectors was inhibited by entrectinib treatment in a dose-dependent manner. In animal models, entrectinib treatment at clinically relevant doses resulted in tumor regression that was accompanied by elimination of residual cancer cells from the bone marrow. Our preclinical data demonstrate the potential of entrectinib as an effective treatment for patients with TRK fusion-driven AML and other hematologic malignancies. Mol Cancer Ther; 17(2); 455-63.

METHODS: The clinical data of 108 ALL children (115 case-times) with post-chemotherapy pulmonary infection were retrospectively reviewed. The risk factors for pulmonary infection and the relationship between pathogens and chest CT findings were evaluated. RESULTS: The highest incidence (77.4% ) of pulmonary infection occurred during remission induction, peaking at 31-60 days after chemotherapy. Patients with neutropenia had the highest incidence rate of pulmonary infection (67.0%). Bacteria (36%) and fungi (41%) were the two most common pathogens in the 41 patients who were etiologically suspected of or diagnosed with pulmonary infection. There was no significant difference in chest CT findings between patients with bacterial and fungal infections. CONCLUSIONS: The children with ALL are most susceptible to pulmonary infection during remission induction, especially when they are neutropenic.

Multiple classifier models, such as sparse representation (SR)-based method, have been developed to classify microarray gene expression data. These methods allocate the gene data points to different clusters. In this paper, we propose a novel collaborative representation (CR)-based classification with regularized least square to classify gene data. First, the CR codes a testing sample as a sparse linear combination of all training samples and then classifies the testing sample by evaluating which class leads to the minimum representation error. This CR-based classification approach is remarkably less complex than traditional classification methods but leads to very competitive classification results. In addition, compressive sensing approach is adopted to project the high-dimensional gene expression dataset to a lower-dimensional space which nearly contains the whole information. This compression without loss is beneficial to reduce the computational load. Experiments to detect subtypes of diseases, such as leukemia and autism spectrum disorders, are performed by analyzing the gene expression. The results show that the proposed CR-based algorithm exhibits significantly higher stability and accuracy than the traditional classifiers, such as support vector machine algorithm.",,"['Shen, Lizhen', 'Jiang, Hua', 'He, Mingfang', 'Liu, Guoqing']","['Shen L', 'Jiang H', 'He M', 'Liu G']","['School of Biotechnology and Pharmaceutical Engineering, Nanjing Tech University, Nanjing, 211800, China.', 'School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Nanjing Tech University, Nanjing, 211800, China.', 'School of Biotechnology and Pharmaceutical Engineering, Nanjing Tech University, Nanjing, 211800, China.', 'School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Nanjing Tech University, Nanjing, 211800, China.']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],20171213,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,,"['*Gene Expression', '*Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis']",PMC5728509,,2017/12/14 06:00,2018/01/05 06:00,['2017/12/14 06:00'],"['2017/07/23 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0189533 [doi]', 'PONE-D-17-26341 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2017 Dec 13;12(12):e0189533. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0189533. eCollection 2017.,,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6965-2179'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, prognosis of the cases refractory to primary therapy is still poor. Recent phase 2 study on the efficacy of combination chemotherapy with bortezomib (BTZ), a proteasome inhibitor, for refractory childhood ALL demonstrated favorable clinical outcomes. However, septic death was observed in over 10% of patients, indicating the necessity of biomarkers that could predict BTZ sensitivity. We investigated in vitro BTZ sensitivity in a large panel of ALL cell lines that acted as a model system for refractory ALL, and found that Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) ALL, IKZF1 deletion, and biallelic loss of CDKN2A were associated with favorable response. Even in Ph-negative ALL cell lines, IKZF1 deletion and bilallelic loss of CDKN2A were independently associated with higher BTZ sensitivity. BTZ showed only marginal cross-resistance to four representative chemotherapeutic agents (vincristine, dexamethasone, l-asparaginase, and daunorubicin) in B-cell precursor-ALL cell lines. To improve the efficacy and safety of proteasome inhibitor combination chemotherapy, we also analyzed the anti-leukemic activity of carfilzomib (CFZ), a second-generation proteasome inhibitor, as a substitute for BTZ. CFZ showed significantly higher activity than BTZ in the majority of ALL cell lines except for the P-glycoprotein-positive t(17;19) ALL cell lines, and IKZF1 deletion was also associated with a favorable response to CFZ treatment.

AIMS: To provide insights into the incidence, associated cancers, latency and survival outcomes of patients with tAML/tMDS in Victoria, Australia, based on a state-wide cancer registry and to assess if these features are different in tAML/tMDS compared with de novo AML/MDS. METHODS: We analysed adults aged >/=20 years at diagnosis of AML/MDS reported to the Victorian Cancer Registry (VCR) between 2003 and 2014. RESULTS: In total, 73 of 3120 (2.3%) AML cases were classified tAML. tAML patients were younger than non-tAML patients at diagnosis (median age 66 vs 71 years, P = 0.000). Median overall survival was similar (6 months). Median latency to tAML was 82 months, with two incidence peaks at 1-4 and 7-8 years. In total, 59 of 73 patients had recorded cancers, the most frequent being non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL, 32.2%) and breast cancer (16.9%). In total, 532 of 3120 (14.1%) additional AML cases had >/=1 prior cancer (confirmation of chemoradiotherapy unavailable). tAML incidence increased (0.0/100 000 persons in 2003, 0.5/100 000 persons in 2014), as did the incidence of non-tAML with previous cancer (0.8/100 000 persons in 2003, 1.1/100 000 persons in 2014). In total, 101 of 4435 (2.3%) MDS cases were classified tMDS. Although tMDS incidence fluctuated (range 0-0.4/100 000 persons/year), the incidence of non-tMDS with prior cancer rose (1.4/100 000 persons in 2003, 1.9/100 000 persons in 2014). Compared to tAML, the tMDS cohort was older (median age 70 vs 66 years, P = 0.007). Median latency to tMDS was 42.5 months. NHL was also the most common cancer preceding tMDS, but the second most common cancer was myeloma (17.8%). In total, 1287 of 5061 (20.3%) non-tMDS patients had a prior cancer. CONCLUSIONS: The burden of tAML/tMDS in Victoria is likely to be underestimated.

However, little is known about the transactivation mechanism of AML1/ETO. Through large cohort of patient's expression level data analysis and a series of experimental validation, we report here that AML1/ETO transactivates c-KIT expression through directly binding to and mediating the long-range interaction between the promoter and intronic enhancer regions of c-KIT. Gene expression analyses verify that c-KIT expression is significantly high in t(8;21) AML. Further ChIP-seq analysis and motif scanning identify two regulatory regions located in the promoter and intronic enhancer region of c-KIT, respectively. Both regions are enriched by co-factors of AML1/ETO, such as AML1, CEBPe, c-Jun, and c-Fos. Further luciferase reporter assays show that AML1/ETO trans-activates c-KIT promoter activity through directly recognizing the AML1 motif and the co-existence of co-factors. The induction of c-KIT promoter activity is reinforced with the existence of intronic enhancer region. Furthermore, ChIP-3C-qPCR assays verify that AML1/ETO mediates the formation of DNA-looping between the c-KIT promoter and intronic enhancer region through the long-range interaction. Collectively, our data uncover a novel transcriptional activity mechanism of AML1/ETO and enrich our knowledge of the onco-fusion protein mediated transcription regulation.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Tian, Ying', 'Wang, Genjie', 'Hu, Qingzhu', 'Xiao, Xichun', 'Chen, Shuxia']","['Tian Y', 'Wang G', 'Hu Q', 'Xiao X', 'Chen S']","[""Department of hematology, The First People's Hospital of Shangqiu, Shangqiu, Henan, China."", ""Department of hematology, The First People's Hospital of Shangqiu, Shangqiu, Henan, China."", ""Department of hematology, The First People's Hospital of Shangqiu, Shangqiu, Henan, China."", ""Department of hematology, The First People's Hospital of Shangqiu, Shangqiu, Henan, China."", ""Department of hematology, The First People's Hospital of Shangqiu, Shangqiu, Henan, China.""]",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],20180105,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (CCCTC-Binding Factor)', '0 (CTCF protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '142805-41-2 (CEBPE protein, human)']",IM,,"['CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'CCCTC-Binding Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'RNA Interference', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,,2017/12/14 06:00,2018/10/17 06:00,['2017/12/14 06:00'],"['2017/09/16 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/17 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.26587 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2018 Apr;119(4):3706-3715. doi: 10.1002/jcb.26587.

The aim of this study was to determine the risk of developing AML or MDS after modern adjuvant chemotherapy in older breast cancer patients and to further define the risk of individual chemotherapy regimens. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with stage I to III breast cancer from 2003 to 2009 were identified in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare and Texas Cancer Registry-Medicare linked databases. The development of AML/MDS, chemotherapy use, and comorbidities were identified with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision and Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System codes. Analyses included descriptive statistics, cumulative incidences, and Cox proportional hazards models to estimate the hazard of AML/MDS after adjustments for clinically relevant covariates. RESULTS: In all, 92,110 patients were included; after a median follow-up of 85 months, the overall rates per 1000 person-years were 0.65 for AML and 1.56 for MDS. Patients who received an anthracycline (A) or anthracycline and taxane (A+T) regimen were more likely to develop AML (hazard ratio [HR] for A, 1.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.16-2.50; HR for A+T, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.22-2.30) or MDS (HR for A, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.70-2.80; HR for A+T, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.29-2.03) than patients who did not receive chemotherapy. Patients using docetaxel and cyclophosphamide (TC) were not at increased risk for AML or MDS. CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant chemotherapy is associated with a small but significant increase in the risk of AML and MDS, especially with regimens that include A. Longer follow-up is needed to confirm that risk is not increased with the recently adopted TC regimen. Cancer 2018;124:899-906.

METHODOLOGY: Aurones 7a-f, 8a-f and furoaurones 13a-f, 16a-c were synthesized. Some compounds were selected by the National Cancer Institute, USA, for cytotoxicity screening. RESULTS & DISCUSSION: The furoaurone derivative, 13a was the most active one exhibiting promising growth inhibition against leukemia, K562 and melanoma, MDA-MB-435 cells at concentration of 10 muM. It induced apoptosis in both cell lines by activation of CASP3 and inhibition of CDK2. Additionally, 13a showed good selectivity over normal kidney and liver cells. Simulation docking study was undertaken to gain insight into the possible binding mode of 13a in the CDK2 enzyme. CONCLUSION: The furoaurone 13a can be considered as a scaffold for further optimization to obtain more active hits.

Twenty-one of 94 animals that were sampled at least 6 times had PL. At the initial sampling 27% of the animals had lymphocytosis. Culling of haematologically positive animals in the first 18 months of the investigation reduced this to 5.3%, but cessation of the culling programme resulted in a gradual increase in the percentage of animals with lymphocytosis. Four deaths from lymphosarcoma occurred in adult animals, but only in the first 18 months of the investigation. Two of these animals had lymphocytosis and two lymphoblastic leukaemia. The Calf of one of the latter cows developed lymphoblastic leukaemia and lymphosarcoma by the time it was 6 months of age.

DNA methylcytosine dioxygenase Ten-eleven translocation 1 (TET1) is a critical oncoprotein in AML. Through a series of data analysis and drug screening, we identified two compounds (i.e., NSC-311068 and NSC-370284) that selectively suppress TET1 transcription and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) modification, and effectively inhibit cell viability in AML with high expression of TET1 (i.e., TET1-high AML), including AML carrying t(11q23)/MLL-rearrangements and t(8;21) AML. NSC-311068 and especially NSC-370284 significantly repressed TET1-high AML progression in vivo. UC-514321, a structural analog of NSC-370284, exhibited a more potent therapeutic effect and prolonged the median survival of TET1-high AML mice over three fold. NSC-370284 and UC-514321 both directly target STAT3/5, transcriptional activators of TET1, and thus repress TET1 expression. They also exhibit strong synergistic effects with standard chemotherapy. Our results highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting the STAT/TET1 axis by selective inhibitors in AML treatment.",,"['Jiang, Xi', 'Hu, Chao', 'Ferchen, Kyle', 'Nie, Ji', 'Cui, Xiaolong',

To provide a molecular rationale for these observations, we study the Dbl-homology (DH) and Pleckstrin-homology (PH) domains of Bcr-Abl p210, which constitute the only structural differences to p190. Here we report high-resolution structures of the DH and PH domains and characterize conformations of the DH-PH unit in solution. Our structural and functional analyses show no evidence that the DH domain acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, whereas the PH domain binds to various phosphatidylinositol-phosphates. PH-domain mutants alter subcellular localization and result in decreased interactions with p210-selective interaction partners.

We aimed to determine the clinical impact of fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in combination with computed tomography (CT) in children with malignancy or following haematopoietic stem cell transplantation with prolonged or recurrent fever. METHODS: Immunocompromised children who underwent FDG-PET/CT for investigation of prolonged or recurrent fever were identified from hospital databases. The clinical impact of the FDG-PET/CT was considered 'high' if it contributed to any of the following: diagnosis of a new site infection/inflammation, change to antimicrobials or chemotherapy, or additional investigations or specialist consult contributing to final diagnosis. RESULTS: Fourteen patients underwent an FDG-PET/CT for prolonged or recurrent fever. Median age was 11 years and 46% had diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. The median absolute neutrophil count on the day of FDG-PET/CT was 0.47 cells/muL. The clinical impact of FDG-PET/CT was 'high' in 11 (79%) patients, contributing to rationalisation of antimicrobials in three, and cessation of antimicrobials in five. Compared to conventional imaging, FDG PET/CT identified seven additional sites of clinically significant infection/inflammation in seven patients. Of the 10 patients who had a cause of fever identified, FDG-PET/CT contributed to the final diagnosis in six (60%). CONCLUSION: This study has identified potential utility for FDG-PET/CT in immunocompromised children with prolonged or recurrent fever. Further prospective studies are needed to compare FDG-PET/CT versus conventional imaging, to identify the optimal timing of FDG-PET/CT and to study the role of subsequent scans to monitor response to therapy.","['(c) 2017 Paediatrics and Child Health Division (The Royal Australasian College of', 'Physicians).']","['Wang, Shiqi Stacie', 'Mechinaud, Francoise', 'Thursky, Karin', 'Cain, Timothy', 'Lau, Eddie', 'Haeusler, Gabrielle M']","['Wang SS', 'Mechinaud F', 'Thursky K', 'Cain T', 'Lau E', 'Haeusler GM']","[""Children's Cancer Centre, Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Centre, Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia."", 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'NHMRC National Centre for Antimicrobial Stewardship, Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', ""Department of Radiology, Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia."", 'Cancer Imaging, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Sir Peter MacCallum Department of Oncology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Sir Peter MacCallum Department of Oncology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', ""Paediatric Integrated Cancer Service, Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.""]",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],20171213,Australia,J Paediatr Child Health,Journal of paediatrics and child health,9005421,"['0 (Anti-Infective Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Radiopharmaceuticals)', '0Z5B2CJX4D (Fluorodeoxyglucose F18)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Anti-Infective Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fever of Unknown Origin/*etiology', '*Fluorodeoxyglucose F18', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Infant', 'Infections/*complications/diagnostic imaging/drug therapy/immunology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/complications/drug therapy/immunology', 'Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography/*methods', '*Radiopharmaceuticals', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,2017/12/14 06:00,2019/10/23 06:00,['2017/12/14 06:00'],"['2017/05/01 00:00 [received]', '2017/09/25 00:00 [revised]', '2017/10/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/23 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jpc.13809 [doi]'],ppublish,J Paediatr Child Health. 2018 May;54(5):487-492. doi: 10.1111/jpc.13809.

If left untreated, AK may progress to invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), although the rate of progression is low. A practical treatment algorithm for the treatment of AK in standard situations has been published by the AKTeam() expert panel. However, management of particular situations of AK with increasing/higher carcinoma risk or AK progressing into carcinomas with increased aggressiveness due to their anatomical location (risky areas), or in patients with an increased risk of SCC requires further discussion. These include AK on the dorsal hands, forearms, legs, periorbital region, eyelids, ears, or lips, and organ transplant recipients, patients undergoing treatment with carcinogenic agents and patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. The main objective was to propose therapeutic strategies for the treatment of AK located in risky areas and in patients with more invasive/aggressive lesions and a higher risk of progression to SCC. A systematic review of the literature was initially performed, and results were discussed by the experts to propose best management practices in specific situations. Finally, adapted management strategies for AK occurring in risky areas and in high-risk patients are presented, taking into account the experts' own clinical experience and current guidelines. In most of these 'at-risk' situations, patients can be treated according to the AKTeam() treatment algorithm. Difficult-to-treat lesions should be treated more aggressively due to their higher risk of transformation. For patients with skin that is highly susceptible to actinic damage, monitoring and sun protection strategies are mandatory, and patients should undergo more regular follow-up. Further assessment of newer therapies in clinical trials is necessary to determine optimal treatment conditions. This expert consensus provides guidance for the management of AK in risky body sites and in patients with an increasing/higher risk for SCCs.",['(c) 2017 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology.'],"['Richard, M A', 'Amici, J M', 'Basset-Seguin, N', 'Claudel, J P', 'Cribier, B', 'Dreno, B']","['Richard MA', 'Amici JM', 'Basset-Seguin N', 'Claudel JP', 'Cribier B', 'Dreno B']","['Dermatology Department, UMR 911, INSERM CRO2, ""Center for Research in Biological Oncology and Oncophamacology"", Timone Hospital, Public Hospitals of Marseille, Aix-Marseille University, Marseille, France.', 'Private Office of dermatology Rive Droite, Cenon, France.', 'Dermatology Department, Hopital Saint-Andre, Bordeaux, France.', 'Dermatology Department, Hopital Saint-Louis, AP-HP, Paris, France.', 'Private Office of Dermatology, Tours, France.', 'Dermatology Department, CHU Clocheville, Tours, France.', 'Dermatology Department, Hopitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France.', 'Department of Dermato cancerology, University Hospital Hotel Dieu, Nantes, France.']",['eng'],,,"['Consensus Development Conference', 'Journal Article', 'Practice Guideline', 'Systematic Review']",20180115,England,J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol,Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology : JEADV,9216037,,IM,,"['Algorithms', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*pathology', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Keratosis, Actinic/*pathology/*therapy', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Risk Factors', 'Skin Neoplasms/*pathology']",,,2017/12/14 06:00,2018/10/12 06:00,['2017/12/14 06:00'],"['2017/08/30 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/12 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jdv.14753 [doi]'],ppublish,J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol. 2018 Mar;32(3):339-346. doi: 10.1111/jdv.14753.

Besides malignant and stromal cells, local immune cells shape VEGF signalling in the tumour microenvironment. Aminobisphosphonates such as zoledronic acid (Zol) are drugs known to inhibit osteoclast activity and bone resorption, but also have immunomodulatory and anti-tumour effects. These properties have been linked previously to the down-regulation of VEGF and interference with tumour neo-angiogenesis. It was therefore surprising to find that treatment with Zol in combination with low-dose interleukin (IL)-2 increased serum VEGF levels in cancer patients. In this study we aimed to characterize the effect of Zol and IL-2 on VEGF signalling of blood-derived immune cells in vitro. Upon stimulation with IL-2, T cells and natural killer (NK) cells increase production of VEGF consecutively to the release of proinflammatory interferon (IFN)-gamma, and Zol accelerates this response specifically in gammadelta T cells. VEGF can, in turn, be antagonized by soluble VEGF receptor (sVEGFR)-1, which is released depending on stimulatory conditions and the presence of monocytes. Additionally, malignant cells represented by leukaemia and lymphoma cell lines produce VEGF and some release sVEGFR-1 simultaneously. Our findings indicate a mechanism by which the VEGF and the sVEGFR-1 production by immune cells regulates local VEGF signalling. Therefore, immunotherapeutic interventions may enable both pro- as well as anti-tumour effects via immune cell-mediated alterations of VEGF homeostasis.",['(c) 2017 British Society for Immunology.'],"['Hoeres, T', 'Wilhelm, M', 'Smetak, M', 'Holzmann, E', 'Schulze-Tanzil, G', 'Birkmann, J']","['Hoeres T', 'Wilhelm M', 'Smetak M', 'Holzmann E', 'Schulze-Tanzil G', 'Birkmann J']","['Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Paracelsus Medical University, Nuremberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Paracelsus Medical University, Nuremberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Paracelsus Medical University, Nuremberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Paracelsus Medical University, Nuremberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Anatomy, Paracelsus Medical University, Nuremberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Paracelsus Medical University, Nuremberg, Germany.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180104,England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (VEGFA protein, human)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '6XC1PAD3KF (Zoledronic Acid)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic', 'Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor/blood/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/*metabolism', 'Young Adult', 'Zoledronic Acid/*pharmacology']",PMC5842402,,2017/12/14 06:00,2019/03/28 06:00,['2017/12/14 06:00'],"['2017/07/20 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/03 00:00 [revised]', '2017/11/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/28 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cei.13090 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 2018 Apr;192(1):54-67. doi: 10.1111/cei.13090.

It may be caused by long-term hospitalization, unfavorable physical conditions, and restricted activities. Although the concept of sarcopenia is becoming widely recognized, especially in geriatric medicine, there have been few reports about sarcopenia in pediatric patients with hematological malignancies. A total of 47 consecutive first-onset acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients who underwent induction therapy between January 2011 and September 2016 were investigated. The cross-sectional psoas muscle area (PMA) was measured on computed tomography (CT) images. PMA changes were expressed as the Muscle Loss Index (MLI), which was calculated by dividing the post-treatment PMA by the pre-treatment PMA. In this study, patients with values less than the lowest quartile of MLI were classified into the sarcopenia group, and their basic and clinical factors were compared with those in the non-sarcopenia group. Muscle loss was observed in all patients after induction therapy, and severe adverse events during induction therapy were significantly more common in patients in the sarcopenia group. Furthermore, sarcopenia was found to be an independent prognostic factor for invasive fungal infection (IFI) that occurs after induction therapy.

However, toxicity with flat dosing limits its usage. Speculatively, pharmacokinetically-targeted dosing could improve tolerability. Therefore, we studied serum-trough dosing with rituximab as maintenance after high-dose cyclophosphamide (HDC) consolidation in lymphoma patients. PATIENTS/METHODS: After HDC, everolimus was dosed to serum trough levels (goal 3-15 ng/mL), with quarterly rituximab infusions for 1 year while maintaining < grade II non-hematologic and < grade III hematologic toxicities. Adult patients in first PR/CR with: mantle cell, transformed, double-hit, or high risk chronic lymphocytic leukemia or in second PR for any relapsed B cell lymphoma were eligible. Prophylaxis was given for encapsulated organisms, HSV and PCP. Serum IgG levels were maintained > 500 mg/dL. RESULTS: 49 patients, median age: 59.0 years enrolled; MCL (26), CLL (10), transformed lymphoma (7), and other histologies (6). During the life of the study, the most frequent everolimus dosing has been 2.5 mg daily or 2.5 mg every other day; at these doses, serum levels are within the therapeutic range and non-hematologic toxicity is rare. At a median follow-up of 27.1 months, three patients remain on active therapy. Two patients withdrew secondary to potentially-attributable adverse events including a bacterial pneumonia and a viral pneumonia; this low rate of discontinuation compares well to other long-term everolimus trials. While a 58 and 76% EFS at 30 months for the entire cohort and MCL cohort, respectively, compares similarly to previously published HDC/rituximab data, longer follow-up is required. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacokinetically-targeted dosing appears to increase everolimus tolerability.

Methods: Based on the DNA methylation microarray data GSE36002 that were downloaded from GEO database, the differentially methylated genes in promoter regions were identified between OS and normal samples. Pathway and function enrichment analyses of differentially methylated genes was performed. Subsequently, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed, followed by identification of cancer-associated differentially methylated genes and significant differentially methylated TFs. Results: A total of 1379 hyper-methylation regions and 169 hypo-methylation regions in promoter regions were identified in OS samples compared to normal samples. The differentially hyper-methylated genes were significantly enriched in Neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway, and Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway. The differentially hypo-methylated genes were significantly enriched in Toll-like receptor signaling pathway. In PPI network, signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT3) had high degree (degree=21). MAX interactor 1, dimerization protein (MXI1), STAT3 and T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia 1 (TAL1) were significant TFs enriched with target genes in OS samples.

Different hypotheses include the production of free radicals, an interaction between ADR and nuclear components, and a disruption in cardiac-specific gene expression. Apoptosis has also been proposed as being involved in cardiac dysfunction. The purpose of this study was to determine if apoptosis might play a role in ADR-induced cardiomyopathy. Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were separated into 2 groups: the control group (C group) and the experimental group (ADR 5 mg/wk for 3 weeks through intraperitoneal injections; A group). Echocardiographic images were obtained at week 3. Changes in caspase-3, B-cell leukemia/lymphoma (Bcl)-2, Bcl-2-associated X (Bax), interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), troponin I, collagen 1, and collagen 3 protein expression from the left ventricle tissues of C and A group rats were determined by Western blot. Results: Ascites and heart failure as well as left ventricular hypertrophy were noted in the A group. Ejection fraction and shortening fraction were significantly lower in the A group by echocardiography. The expression of caspase-3, Bax, IL-6, BNP, collagen 1, and collagen 3 were significantly higher in the A group as compared with the C group. Protein expression of Bcl-2 decreased significantly in the A group compared with the C group. Conclusion: ADR induced an upregulation of caspase-3, Bax, IL-6, and collagen, as well as a depression in Bcl-2. Thus, apoptosis and fibrosis may play an important role in ADR-induced cardiomyopathy.",,"['Hong, Young Mi', 'Lee, Hyeryon', 'Cho, Min-Sun', 'Kim, Kwan Chang']","['Hong YM', 'Lee H', 'Cho MS', 'Kim KC']","['Department of Pediatrics, Ewha Womans University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Ewha Womans University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pathology, Ewha Womans University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, Ewha Womans University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],20171127,Korea (South),Korean J Pediatr,Korean journal of pediatrics,101215374,,,,,PMC5725342,,2017/12/14 06:00,2017/12/14 06:01,['2017/12/14 06:00'],"['2017/08/11 00:00 [received]', '2017/09/20 00:00 [revised]', '2017/09/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/14 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3345/kjp.2017.60.11.365 [doi]'],ppublish,Korean J Pediatr. 2017 Nov;60(11):365-372. doi: 10.3345/kjp.2017.60.11.365.

Indirubins could inhibit various kinases, and might be used to treat chronic myelocytic leukemia, cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. 7-bromoindirubin-3-oxime (7Bio), an indirubin derivative derived from indirubin-3-oxime, possesses inhibitory effects against cyclin-dependent kinase-5 (CDK5) and glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK3beta), two pharmacological targets of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we have discovered that 2.3-23.3 mug/kg 7Bio effectively prevented beta-amyloid (Abeta) oligomer-induced impairments of spatial cognition and recognition without affecting bodyweight and motor functions in mice. Moreover, 7Bio potently inhibited Abeta oligomer-induced expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Furthermore, 7Bio significantly prevented the decreased expression of synapsin-1 and PSD-95, biomarkers of pre-synaptic and post-synaptic proteins in Abeta oligomer-treated mice. The mean optical density (OD) with hyper-phosphorylated tau (pTau), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and CD45 positive staining in the hippocampus of 7Bio-treated mice were significantly decreased compared to those of Abeta oligomer-treated mice. In addition, Western blotting analysis showed that 7Bio attenuated Abeta oligomer-decreased expression of pSer9-GSK3beta. Those results suggested that 7Bio could potently inhibit Abeta oligomer-induced neuroinflammation, synaptic impairments, tau hyper-phosphorylation, and activation of astrocytes and microglia, which may contribute to the neuroprotective effects of 7Bio.

It metabolizes NAD(+) to adenosine diphosphate ribose (ADPR) and cyclic ADPR, regulating several processes including calcium signalling. CD38 is both a positive and negative prognostic indicator in leukaemia. In all-trans retinoic acid (RA)-induced differentiation of acute promyelocytic leukaemia and HL-60 cells, CD38 is one of the earliest and most prominently upregulated proteins known. CD38 overexpression enhances differentiation, while morpholino- and siRNA-induced knockdown diminishes it. CD38, via Src family kinases and adapters, interacts with a MAPK signalling axis that propels differentiation. Motivated by evidence suggesting the importance of CD38, we sought to determine whether it functions via dimerization. We created a linker based on the suicide substrate arabinosyl-2'-fluoro-2'-deoxy NAD(+) (F-araNAD(+)), dimeric F-araNAD(+), to induce homodimerization. CD38 homodimerization did not affect RA-induced differentiation. Probing the importance of CD38 further, we created HL-60 cell lines with CRISPR/Cas9-mediated CD38 truncations. Deletion of its enzymatic domain did not affect differentiation. Apart from increased RA-induced CD11b expression, ablation of all but the first six amino acids of CD38 affected neither RA-induced differentiation nor associated signalling. Although we cannot discount the importance of this peptide, our study indicates that CD38 is not necessary for RA-induced differentiation.",,"['MacDonald, Robert J', 'Shrimp, Jonathan H', 'Jiang, Hong', 'Zhang, Lu', 'Lin, Hening', 'Yen, Andrew']","['MacDonald RJ', 'Shrimp JH', 'Jiang H', 'Zhang L', 'Lin H', 'Yen A']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, 14853, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, 14853, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, 14853, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, 14853, USA.', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, 14853, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, 14853, USA. ay13@cornell.edu.']",['eng'],,['R01 CA152870/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171212,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD11b Antigen)', '0 (ITGAM protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",,,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'CD11b Antigen/metabolism', 'CRISPR-Cas Systems', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects/*physiology', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Multimerization', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'src-Family Kinases/metabolism']",PMC5727258,,2017/12/14 06:00,2019/08/07 06:00,['2017/12/14 06:00'],"['2017/07/07 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-017-17720-4 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-017-17720-4 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2017 Dec 12;7(1):17406. doi: 10.1038/s41598-017-17720-4.,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-1887-7025', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0255-2701']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, most patients develop resistance to TKI through BCR-ABL1-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Newly developed TKI can target Ph(+) ALL cells with BCR-ABL1-dependent resistance; however, overcoming BCR-ABL1-independent mechanisms of resistance remains challenging because transcription factors, which are difficult to inhibit, are often involved. We show here that (i) the growth of Ph(+) ALL cell lines and primary cells is highly dependent on MYB-mediated transcriptional upregulation of CDK6, cyclin D3, and BCL2, and (ii) restoring their expression in MYB-silenced Ph(+) ALL cells rescues their impaired proliferation and survival. Levels of MYB and CDK6 were highly correlated in adult Ph(+) ALL (P = 0.00008). Moreover, Ph(+) ALL cells exhibited a specific requirement for CDK6 but not CDK4 expression, most likely because, in these cells, CDK6 was predominantly localized in the nucleus, whereas CDK4 was almost exclusively cytoplasmic. Consistent with their essential role in Ph(+) ALL, pharmacologic inhibition of CDK6 and BCL2 markedly suppressed proliferation, colony formation, and survival of Ph(+) ALL cells ex vivo and in mice. In summary, these findings provide a proof-of-principle, rational strategy to target the MYB ""addiction"" of Ph(+) ALL.Significance: MYB blockade can suppress Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemia in mice, suggesting that this therapeutic strategy may be useful in patients who develop resistance to imatinib and other TKIs used to treat this disease.

In this study, we examined the role of XRCC4 in apoptosis. Cell lines, derived from XRCC4-deficient M10 mouse lymphoma cells and stably expressing wild-type XRCC4 or caspase-resistant XRCC4, were established and treated with staurosporine (STS) to induce apoptosis. In STS-induced apoptosis, expression of wild-type, but not caspase-resistant, XRCC4 in XRCC4-deficient cells enhanced oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation and the appearance of TUNEL-positive cells by promoting nuclear translocation of caspase-activated DNase (CAD), a major nuclease for oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation. CAD activity is reportedly regulated by the ratio of two inhibitor of CAD (ICAD) splice variants, ICAD-L and ICAD-S mRNA, which, respectively, produce proteins with and without the ability to transport CAD into the nucleus. The XRCC4-dependent promotion of nuclear import of CAD in STS-treated cells was associated with reduction of ICAD-S mRNA and protein, and enhancement of phosphorylation and nuclear import of serine/arginine-rich splicing factor (SRSF) 1. These XRCC4-dependent, apoptosis-enhancing effects were canceled by depletion of SRSF1 or SR protein kinase (SRPK) 1. In addition, overexpression of SRSF1 in XRCC4-deficient cells restored the normal level of apoptosis, suggesting that SRSF1 functions downstream of XRCC4 in activating CAD.

CALGB 49907, which utilized ABW-based adjuvant chemotherapy dosing, was a phase 3 trial in women age>/=65years with early stage breast cancer, providing the opportunity to examine impact of such dosing on toxicities and outcome in older patients with breast cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adverse event data were available for 615 of 633 enrolled patients. Objectives were to assess grade>/=3 hematologic/non-hematologic toxicities by treatment arm, age, study entry BSA/BMI, and relapse-free (RFS) and overall survival (OS) by BSA/BMI. RESULTS: The 615 patients were sub-grouped by BSA (quartiles) and standard BMI categories, with BMI underweight/normal weight categories combined. Overall, grade>/=3 non-hematologic and hematologic toxicities occurred in 39.8% and 28.3% of patients, respectively. There were no significant differences in grade>/=3 toxicities among BSA quartiles. However, more grade>/=3 hematologic toxicities occurred in the underweight/normal weight BMI subgroup compared to overweight/obese subgroups (p=0.048). Type of chemotherapy and age had no impact on toxicity occurrence by BSA/BMI categories. RFS was superior in the 25th-50th BSA percentile patients in univariate analysis (p=0.042), as was OS in both univariate and multivariate analyses (p=0.007, p=0.009, respectively). No differences in RFS or OS were found by BMI categories. CONCLUSION: Obesity was not correlated with adverse relapse or survival outcome, and grade>/=3 toxicities were not greater with ABW-based dosing. This supports safety and efficacy of ABW-based dosing as per the 2012 ASCO clinical practice guideline. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00024102 (49907).",['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Through this tethering function LEDGF/p75 is implicated in a diverse set of human diseases including HIV infection and mixed lineage leukemia, an aggressive form of cancer with poor prognosis. Here we provide an overview of recent progress in resolving protein-protein and protein-chromatin interaction mechanisms of LEDGF/p75. This review will focus on two well-characterized domains, the PWWP domain and the integrase binding domain (IBD). The PWWP domain interacts with methylated lysine 36 in histone H3, a marker of actively transcribed genes. The IBD interacts with the IBD binding motif, available in cellular binding partners of LEDGF/p75. Each domain forms an interesting new target for drug discovery.",['Copyright (c) 2017.

We propose an urn-based adaptive randomization design to incorporate both of these two outcomes. While short-term response can update the randomization probability quickly to benefit the trial participants, long-term survival outcome can also change the randomization to favor the treatment arm with definitive therapeutic benefit. Using generalized Friedman's urn, we derive an explicit formula for the limiting distribution of the number of subjects assigned to each arm. With prior or hypothetical knowledge on treatment effects, this formula can be used to guide the selection of parameters for the proposed design to achieve desirable patient number ratios between different treatment arms, and thus optimize the operating characteristics of the trial design.

METHODS: A total of 279 H/VH risk MDS patients registered in the Korean MDS Working Party database were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: HMA therapy was administered to 205 patients (73.5%), including 31 patients (11.1%) who then received allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT), while 74 patients (26.5%) received BSC or allo-HCT without HMA. The 3-year overall survival (OS) rates were 53.1% +/- 10.7% for allo-HCT with HMA, 75% +/- 21.7% for allo-HCT without HMA, 17.3% +/- 3.6% for HMA, and 20.8% +/- 6.9% for BSC groups (p < 0.001). In the multivariate analysis, only allo-HCT was related with favorable OS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.356; p = 0.002), while very poor cytogenetic risk (HR, 5.696; p = 0.042), age >/= 65 years (HR, 1.578; p = 0.022), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) 2 to 4 (HR, 2.837; p < 0.001), and transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (HR, 1.901; p = 0.001) all had an adverse effect on OS. CONCLUSION: For the H/VH risk group, very poor cytogenetic risk, age >/= 65 years, ECOG PS 2 to 4, and AML transformation were poor prognostic factors. HMA showed no benefit in terms of OS when compared to BSC. Allo-HCT was the only factor predicting a favorable long-term outcome.

We investigated the graft-versus-leukemia effect (GVL) in patients with cutaneous acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) treated with photochemotherapy (psoralen and ultraviolet light type A). METHOD: Forty-seven patients with acute leukemia were followed 5,000 days after transplantation to assess survival and GVL by multivariate analysis. The primary predictor was time to treatment of cutaneous acute GVHD by photochemotherapy separated into treatment start during the first week of acute GVHD versus after the first week of acute GVHD. RESULTS: Photochemotherapy started after the first week of acute GVHD predicted GVL with a hazard ratio (HR) of 3.94 (95% confidence interval, CI, 1.67-9.33, p = 0.0018) and survival with preserved GVL with an HR of 2.63 (95% CI 1.30-5.32, p = 0.007). The effects on GVL and survival with preserved GVL were present regardless of whether the patients were transplanted in remission or relapse (p < 0.05). Chronic GVHD came earlier in the group that started photochemotherapy after 1 week of acute GHVD, but chronic GVHD did not increase the GVL. CONCLUSION: The timing of photochemotherapy after cutaneous acute GVHD may direct the GVL and predict long-term leukemia-free survival.","['(c) 2017 S.

Mitoxantrone was added to all the patients at a dose of 1.4mg/m(2) per day for 5-7 days. D-dimer levels, prothrombin time (PT), fibrinogen (Fbg) levels and the platelet count were comparably analyzed among 83 newly diagnosed APL patients treated with RIF (n=45) or with ATO (n=38). Since induction therapy with RIF and ATRA, the median levels of Fbg, PT and platelets were recovered to the normal range within 4days, 10days and 28days, respectively. The last day of platelet and plasma transfusion was day 12 (range: 0-24 days) and day 3 (range: 0-27 days), respectively. Among the 42 patients with a disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) score=4, the consumption of transfused platelets was less in the RIF group than that in the ATO group (P=0.037). In the 17 patients with a DIC score <4, prompt recovery of Fbg levels (P=0.028) was observed in the RIF group compared with that in the ATO group (P=0.401). RIF and ATO showed similar effects on the recovery of coagulopathy in APL patients.

Bcl-2 and p53 represent two important nodes in apoptosis signaling pathways. We find that concomitant p53 activation and Bcl-2 inhibition overcome apoptosis resistance and markedly prolong survival in three mouse models of resistant acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Mechanistically, p53 activation negatively regulates the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway and activates GSK3 to modulate Mcl-1 phosphorylation and promote its degradation, thus overcoming AML resistance to Bcl-2 inhibition. Moreover, Bcl-2 inhibition reciprocally overcomes apoptosis resistance to p53 activation by switching cellular response from G1 arrest to apoptosis. The efficacy, together with the mechanistic findings, reveals the potential of simultaneously targeting these two apoptosis regulators and provides a rational basis for clinical testing of this therapeutic approach.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Less attention has been focused on the loss of skeletal muscle mass (SMM) and the combined morbidity of sarcopenic obesity. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of body composition was undertaken via dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry in 75 long-term survivors of ALL (more than 10 years after the diagnosis). Measures were obtained of the fat mass (FM), fat-free mass (equivalent to the lean body mass [LBM]), and whole-body bone mineral content. Health-related quality of life (HRQL) was measured with the Health Utilities Index. RESULTS: The sum of the FM, LBM, and whole-body bone mineral content matched the total body weight measured directly (r = 0.998). The appendicular lean mass (ALM) was derived from the LBM in all 4 limbs and accounted for approximately 75% of the SMM. According to the fat mass index (FMI; ie, FM/height(2) ), 12% of females and 18% of males were frankly obese by World Health Organization criteria. The median FMI z score was + 0.40, whereas the median z score for the appendicular lean mass index (ALMI; ie, ALM/height(2) ) was -0.40. Sarcopenic obesity, defined as a positive FMI z score with a negative ALMI z score, was present in 32 subjects (43%). There were statistically significant and clinically important differences in overall HRQL between subjects with and without sarcopenic obesity. CONCLUSIONS: Sarcopenic obesity is prevalent in long-term survivors of ALL, and this places them in double jeopardy from excess body fat and inadequate SMM (eg, a combination of metabolic and frailty syndromes). It is associated with an adverse impact on overall HRQL. Cancer 2018;124:1225-31.

DATA SOURCE: A literature search of PubMed and MEDLINE (September 2017) was performed using the terms midostaurin, PKC412, FLT3 gene, and acute myeloid leukemia. STUDY SELECTION/DATA EXTRACTION: Clinical trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of midostaurin in combination with standard cytarabine and daunorubicin induction and cytarabine consolidation were reviewed for the treatment of newly diagnosed FLT3-mutated AML. All peer-reviewed articles with clinically relevant information were evaluated for inclusion. DATA SYNTHESIS: Midostaurin is a multikinase inhibitor also targeting FLT3 indicated for the treatment of newly diagnosed FLT3-mutated AML. A phase III trial illustrated that midostaurin in combination with standard chemotherapy improved event-free survival, disease-free survival, and overall survival in patients with newly diagnosed FLT3-mutation-positive AML compared with standard chemotherapy alone. However, midostaurin did not show a difference in the rate of patients who proceeded to receive an allogeneic stem cell transplant compared with placebo. There was no significant difference in toxicity between the midostaurin and placebo groups, except that more patients experienced grade 3 to 5 anemia and rash with midostaurin.

To improve results, it is important to understand how treatment-related toxicity impacts survival. PROCEDURE: In this retrospective population-based study, we described the causes of death and estimated the risk for treatment-related mortality in patients with first relapse of childhood ALL in the Nordic Society of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology ALL-92 and ALL-2000 trials. RESULTS: Among the 483 patients who received relapse treatment with curative intent, we identified 52 patients (10.8%) who died of treatment-related causes. Twelve of these died before achieving second remission and 40 died in second remission. Infections were the cause of death in 38 patients (73.1%), predominantly bacterial infections during the chemotherapy phases of the relapse treatment. Viral infections were more common following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in second remission. Independent risk factors for treatment-related mortality were as follows: high-risk stratification at relapse (hazard ratio [HR] 2.2; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3-3.9; P < 0.01), unfavorable cytogenetic aberrations (HR 3.4; 95% CI 1.3-9.2; P = 0.01), and HSCT (HR 4.64; 95% CI 2.17-9.92; P < 0.001). In contrast to previous findings, we did not observe any statistically significant sex or age differences. Interestingly, none of the 17 patients with Down syndrome died of treatment-related causes. CONCLUSIONS: Fatal treatment complications contribute significantly to the poor overall survival after relapse. Implementation of novel therapies with reduced toxicity and aggressive supportive care management are important to improve survival in relapsed childhood ALL.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Oskarsson, Trausti', 'Soderhall, Stefan', 'Arvidson, Johan', 'Forestier, Erik', 'Frandsen, Thomas Leth', 'Hellebostad, Marit', 'Lahteenmaki, Paivi', 'Jonsson, Olafur G', 'Myrberg, Ida Hed', 'Heyman, Mats']","['Oskarsson T', 'Soderhall S', 'Arvidson J', 'Forestier E', 'Frandsen TL', 'Hellebostad M', 'Lahteenmaki P', 'Jonsson OG', 'Myrberg IH', 'Heyman M']","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden."", ""Childhood Cancer Research Unit, Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden."", ""Childhood Cancer Research Unit, Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden."", 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Uppsala University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Biosciences, Umea University, Umea, Sweden.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Drammen Hospital, Drammen, Norway.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Turku University Hospital and Turku University, Turku, Finland.', ""Children's Hospital, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."", ""Childhood Cancer Research Unit, Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden."", ""Childhood Cancer Research Unit, Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.""]",['eng'],,,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20171212,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*mortality/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Virus Diseases/etiology/*mortality']",,,2017/12/13 06:00,2019/04/25 06:00,['2017/12/13 06:00'],"['2017/09/10 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/28 00:00 [revised]', '2017/11/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/25 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.26909 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2018 Apr;65(4). doi: 10.1002/pbc.26909.

A case report and review of the literature.,456-460,10.1111/trf.14448 [doi],"BACKGROUND: Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a common hematologic malignancy; however, its occurrence during pregnancy is unusual due to its low prevalence in females of childbearing age. There are conflicting reports of how to best manage CML in pregnancy, particularly in the setting of leukocytosis. HEMAPHERESIS: A 30-year-old female was diagnosed with CML at 18 weeks' estimated gestational age. On initial presentation she reported fatigue, night sweats, and early satiety, and was found to have a white blood cell (WBC) count of 69.3 x 10(9) /L and platelet count of 366 x 10(9) /L. Her disease was managed during pregnancy using interferon-alpha alone despite persistent leukocytosis. CONCLUSION: CML may be effectively managed during pregnancy, even in the setting of leukocytosis, without the application of leukocytapheresis. Management relies not only upon the coordination of drug therapy and fetal monitoring, but requires close communication between multiple medical disciplines. Leukocytapheresis has been safely performed during pregnancy and may be a suitable adjunct management strategy in pregnant patients diagnosed with CML with specific clinical presentations, such as hyperleukocytosis (WBC count > 150 x 10(9) /L) and/or symptomatic leukostasis.",['(c) 2017 AABB.'],"['Staley, Elizabeth M', 'Simmons, Sierra C', 'Feldman, Alexander Z', 'Lorenz, Robin G', 'Marques, Marisa B', 'Williams, Lance A 3rd', 'Zheng, X Long', 'Pham, Huy P']","['Staley EM', 'Simmons SC', 'Feldman AZ', 'Lorenz RG', 'Marques MB', 'Williams LA 3rd', 'Zheng XL', 'Pham HP']","['Division of Laboratory Medicine, Department of Pathology, The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama.', 'Division of Laboratory Medicine, Department of Pathology, The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama.', 'Division of Laboratory Medicine, Department of Pathology, The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama.', 'Division of Laboratory Medicine, Department of Pathology, The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama.', 'Division of Laboratory Medicine, Department of Pathology, The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama.', 'Division of Laboratory Medicine, Department of Pathology, The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama.', 'Division of Laboratory Medicine, Department of Pathology, The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama.', 'Division of Laboratory Medicine, Department of Pathology, The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama.', 'Department of Pathology, Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.']",['eng'],,['R01 HL126724/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20171211,United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,,IM,,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Leukapheresis', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/diagnosis/*therapy', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Neoplastic/blood/diagnosis/*therapy']",PMC6230432,['NIHMS995239'],2017/12/13 06:00,2018/09/05 06:00,['2017/12/13 06:00'],"['2017/07/26 00:00 [received]', '2017/09/15 00:00 [revised]', '2017/09/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/05 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/trf.14448 [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 2018 Feb;58(2):456-460. doi: 10.1111/trf.14448.

We assessed the incidence of bleeding and thrombotic complications, use of blood products and risk factors for bleeding in an adult population of ICU patients with haematological malignancies. METHODS: We screened all patients with acute leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndrome admitted to a university hospital ICU during 2008-2012. Bleeding in ICU was scored according to the WHO grading system, and risk factors were evaluated using unadjusted and adjusted analyses. RESULTS: In total, 116 of 129 ICU patients were included; their median length of stay was 7 (IQR 2-16) days. Of these, 66 patients (57%) had at least one bleeding episode in ICU; they bled for 3 (2-6) days and most often from lower and upper airways and upper GI tract. Thirty-nine (59%) of the 66 patients had severe or debilitating (WHO grade 3 or 4) bleeding. The median platelet count on the day of grade 3 or 4 bleeding was 23 x 10(9) per litre (IQR 13-39). Nine patients (8%) died in ICU following a bleeding episode; five of these had intra-cerebral haemorrhage. Platelet count on admission was associated with subsequent bleeding (adjusted odds ratio 1.18 (95% CI 1.03-1.35) for every 10 x 10(9) per litre drop in platelet count, p = 0.016). Eleven of the 116 patients (9%) developed a clinically significant thrombosis in ICU, which was the cause of death in four patients. The median platelet count was 20 x 10(9) per litre (15-48) at the time of thrombosis. The patients received a median of 6 units of red blood cells, 1 unit of fresh frozen plasma and 8 units of platelet concentrates in ICU. CONCLUSIONS: Severe and debilitating bleeding complications were frequent in our ICU patients with haematological malignancies, but thrombosis also occurred in spite of low platelet counts.

Dermatological side effects include superficial oedema, pustular eruption, lichenoid reactions, erythroderma, and skin rash. Depigmentation of the skin and/or mucosa is uncommon, and hyperpigmentation is rare. Case presentation: We present the case of a 63-year-old Caucasian male with widespread hyperpigmentation of the hard palate associated with a 9-year history of imatinib therapy to treat CML. He did not complain of any symptoms. Clinical examination did not reveal any abnormal pigmentation of the skin or other region of the oral mucosa. He did not smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol. His medication regimen was a proton pump inhibitor, a beta-blocker, cardioaspirin, atorvastatin, and imatinib 400 mg/day. Histopathologically, melanin and haemosiderin deposits were evident in the lamina propria. The lesion persisted, with no clinical change, through several follow-ups. We reviewed the literature to explore the possible relationship between oral hyperpigmentation and long-term imatinib mesylate treatment. Conclusions: We diagnosed oral pigmentation associated with imatinib intake based on the medical history and clinical features of the pigmented macules. Oral pigmentation may have a variety of causes, and differential diagnosis requires nodal analysis. Clinicians should be aware of possible oral mucosal hyperpigmentation in patients taking imatinib mesylate. Such pigmentation is benign and no treatment is needed, but surveillance is advisable.",,"['Bombeccari, Gian Paolo', 'Garagiola, Umberto', 'Pallotti, Francesco', 'Rossi, Margherita', 'Porrini, Massimo', 'Gianni, Aldo Bruno', 'Spadari, Francesco']","['Bombeccari GP', 'Garagiola U', 'Pallotti F', 'Rossi M', 'Porrini M', 'Gianni AB', 'Spadari F']","[""Maxillo-Facial and Dental Unit, Fondazione Ca' Granda IRCCS Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, University of Milan, Via Commenda 10, 20122 Milan, Italy.0000 0004 1757 2822grid.4708.b"", 'Department of Biomedical, Surgical and Dental Sciences, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.0000 0004 1757 2822grid.4708.b', ""Maxillo-Facial and Dental Unit, Fondazione Ca' Granda IRCCS Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, University of Milan, Via Commenda 10, 20122 Milan, Italy.0000 0004 1757 2822grid.4708.b"", 'Department of Biomedical, Surgical and Dental Sciences, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.0000 0004 1757 2822grid.4708.b', 'Department of Biomedical, Surgical and Dental Sciences, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.0000 0004 1757 2822grid.4708.b', ""Unit of Anatomical Pathology, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, University of Milan, Via Commenda 10, 20122 Milan, Italy.0000 0004 1757 2822grid.4708.b"", ""Maxillo-Facial and Dental Unit, Fondazione Ca' Granda IRCCS Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, University of Milan, Via Commenda 10, 20122 Milan, Italy.0000 0004 1757 2822grid.4708.b"", ""Maxillo-Facial and Dental Unit, Fondazione Ca' Granda IRCCS Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, University of Milan, Via Commenda 10, 20122 Milan, Italy.0000 0004 1757 2822grid.4708.b"", ""Maxillo-Facial and Dental Unit, Fondazione Ca' Granda IRCCS Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, University of Milan, Via Commenda 10, 20122 Milan, Italy.0000 0004 1757 2822grid.4708.b"", 'Department of Biomedical, Surgical and Dental Sciences, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.0000 0004 1757 2822grid.4708.b', ""Maxillo-Facial and Dental Unit, Fondazione Ca' Granda IRCCS Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, University of Milan, Via Commenda 10, 20122 Milan, Italy.0000 0004 1757 2822grid.4708.b"", 'Department of Biomedical, Surgical and Dental Sciences, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.0000 0004 1757 2822grid.4708.b']",['eng'],,,['Case Reports'],20171205,England,Maxillofac Plast Reconstr Surg,Maxillofacial plastic and reconstructive surgery,101633100,,,,,PMC5714941,,2017/12/13 06:00,2017/12/13 06:01,['2017/12/13 06:00'],"['2017/10/25 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/13 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40902-017-0136-y [doi]', '136 [pii]']",epublish,Maxillofac Plast Reconstr Surg. 2017 Dec 5;39(1):37. doi: 10.1186/s40902-017-0136-y. eCollection 2017 Dec.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloid leukaemia', 'Drug-induced oral reactions', 'Mucosal pigmentation', 'Oral melanosis', 'Oral pigmentation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It commonly occurs in hematological malignant patients particularly non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and acute leukemia due to chemotherapy or spontaneously. It is characterized by a biochemical abnormality such as hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia and its clinical outcome is directly related to these biochemical abnormalities. Prevention and treatment of tumor lysis syndrome depend on immediate recognition of patients at risk. Therefore, identifying patients at risk and prophylactic measures are important to minimize the clinical consequences of tumor lysis syndrome.

Methods: We reviewed the current literature regarding patient assessment tools, treatment options, and current therapies in clinical trial for patients with AML who are >/=60 years. Results: Our approach to the older patient with AML is evolving with better understanding of the unique disease epidemiology in this population and the development of tools to assess individual patient functional status, including grading systems for comorbidities, geriatric assessment tools, and measurements of frailty. Almost all older patients will benefit from therapy, whether intensive curative therapy, such as allogeneic stem cell transplant that should be considered whenever possible, or low-intensity therapy that should be offered with concurrent palliative care at diagnosis to improve patient survival and quality of life. To achieve the improved survival demonstrated in younger adults, older patients should also be considered for clinical trial enrollment as more studies are being designed to specifically target this unique patient population. Conclusion: Older patients with AML are candidates for and benefit from the entire spectrum of AML therapy, including intense chemotherapy, allogeneic stem cell transplant, and clinical trial participation after thorough patient assessment.

Primary antibacterial prophylaxis with vancomycin-based regimens reduces this risk but might increase the risks of renal or liver toxicity or Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). A retrospective review of data for patients treated for newly diagnosed AML at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital between 2002 and 2008 was conducted. Nephrotoxicity was classified according to pediatric risk, injury, failure, loss, and end-stage renal disease (pRIFLE) criteria and hepatotoxicity according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) criteria. The risks of nephrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, and CDI were compared between patients receiving vancomycin-based prophylaxis, no intravenous prophylaxis, or other prophylaxis. Generalized linear mixed models were used to address potential confounding. A total of 392 chemotherapy courses (108 with no intravenous prophylaxis, 218 with vancomycin-based prophylaxis, and 66 with other prophylaxis) for 111 patients were included. Development of pRIFLE risk, injury, and failure occurred in 190, 44, and 2 courses, respectively. Increases of at least one, two, and three grades for hepatotoxicity occurred in 189, 52, and 19 courses, respectively. After adjustment for confounders, vancomycin-based prophylaxis was not associated with nephrotoxicity or hepatotoxicity and reduced the risk of CDI, compared to no intravenous prophylaxis (0.9% versus 6.5%; P = 0.007) or other prophylactic regimens (0.9% versus 3.0%; P = 0.23). Despite concerns about vancomycin toxicity, vancomycin-based prophylaxis in pediatric patients with AML did not increase the risk of nephrotoxicity or hepatotoxicity and reduced the risk of CDI.

We established a mouse xenograft model of human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that enabled chemotherapy-induced regressions of established disease followed by lethal regrowth of more aggressive tumor cells. Human AML cells from terminally ill mice treated with chemotherapy (chemoAML) had higher lipid content, increased lactate production and ATP levels, reduced expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha (PGC-1alpha), and fewer mitochondria than controls from untreated AML animals. These changes were linked to increased VEGFR2 signaling that counteracted chemotherapy-driven cell death; blocking of VEGFR2 sensitized chemoAML to chemotherapy (re-)treatment and induced a mitochondrial biogenesis program with increased mitochondrial mass and oxidative stress. Accordingly, depletion of PGC-1alpha in chemoAML cells abolished such induction of mitochondrial metabolism and chemosensitization in response to VEGFR2 inhibition. Collectively, this reveals a mitochondrial metabolic vulnerability with potential therapeutic applications against chemotherapy-resistant AML.Significance: These findings reveal a mitochondrial metabolic vulnerability that might be exploited to kill chemotherapy-resistant acute myeloid leukemia cells.

While advancements in treating ALL have led to a remission rate of more than 90%, many survivors experience adverse neurocognitive and/or neurobehavioral effects as a result of intrathecal chemotherapy. Methotrexate (MTX) is commonly administered with cytosine arabinoside (AraC, cytarabine) during intrathecal chemotherapy for ALL. To date, few studies exist that test the cognitive effects of intrathecal injections of MTX/AraC on juvenile populations. The purpose of our study was to investigate the combined effects of MTX/AraC on cognition and dendritic structure in the hippocampus in juvenile male mice. Twenty, 21-day-old male C57BL/6 mice were used in this study; 10 mice received intrathecal MTX/AraC treatment, and 10 were given intrathecal saline injections. Five weeks after injections, we tested the animals' hippocampus-dependent cognitive performance in the Morris water maze. After the first day of hidden-platform training, we observed that the mice that received MTX/AraC treatment showed signs of significant impairment in spatial memory retention. MTX/AraC treatment significantly compromised the dendritic architecture and reduced mushroom spine density in the dorsal ganglion (DG), CA1, and CA3 areas of the hippocampus. The present data provided evidence that MTX/AraC compromised the dendritic architecture and impaired hippocampal dependent cognition. This could provide insight into chemotherapy-induced cognitive decline in juvenile patients treated for ALL.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Activation of NLRP3 inflammasome leads to interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) upregulation and pyroptosis, a proinflammatory cell death characterized by increased cell size. Of note, calcium signaling is crucial for NLRP3 inflammasome activation. This study elucidated the effects of magnesium sulfate (MgSO4), a potent calcium antagonist, on modulating NLRP3 inflammasome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THP-1 cells, the human monocytic leukemia cell line, were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 1 mug/ml) plus nigericin (5 muM) (the LPS + Nig group) and LPS plus nigericin plus MgSO4 (20 mM) [the LPS + Nig + M(20)] to facilitate investigations. Levels of IL-1beta, pyroptosis, and NLRP3 inflammasome induction as well as intracellular calcium were assayed. RESULTS: IL-1beta concentration of the LPS + Nig + M(20) group was significantly lower than the LPS + Nig group (P = 0.001). Cell size of the LPS + Nig + M(20) group was significantly smaller than the LPS + Nig group (P < 0.001). Level of pyroptotic cell death of the LPS + Nig + M(20) group was significantly lower than the LPS + Nig group (P = 0.004). NLRP3 mRNA and protein concentrations of the LPS + Nig + M(20) group were also significantly lower than the LPS + Nig group (P = 0.021 and P < 0.001). Similarly, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain speck formation ratio and caspase-1 concentration of the LPS + Nig + M(20) group were significantly lower than the LPS + Nig group (both P < 0.001). The change in intracellular calcium level of the LPS + Nig + M(20) group was significantly smaller than the LPS + Nig group (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: MgSO4 inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome, IL-1beta upregulation, and pyroptosis. The mechanism is consistent with decreased intracellular calcium levels.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Overwhelming evidences have confirmed that interim PET can predict survival outcomes and guide subsequent treatments in Hodgkin lymphoma. However, whether interim PET-CT can predict survival outcomes or not in T-ALL/LBL patients remains unclear. 47 adult patients of T-ALL/LBL were retrospectively reviewed. Interim PET-CT was done after induction therapy and evaluated according to the International Harmonization Project criteria. After induction therapy, interim PET-CT was positive in 19 patients (40.4%). After a median follow up time of 34 months, the 2-year and 3-year progression free survival (PFS) rate were 39% and 30%, respectively, and the 2-year and 3-year overall survival (OS) rate were 54% and 45%, respectively. Using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, it was found that interim PET-CT positivity correlated with significantly inferior PFS and OS (2-year PFS rate for patients with positive or negative interim PET were 21.1% or 56.0%, respectively, p = 0.002; 2-year OS rate for patients with positive or negative interim PET were 31.6% or 63.7%, respectively, p = 0.010). However, there was no significant relationship between PFS, OS and bone marrow infiltration, lactate dehydrogenase level, and stages (p > 0.05).

Our previous studies have suggested that overexpression of SETBP1 can drive this progression by conferring unlimited self-renewal capability to granulocyte macrophage progenitors (GMPs). Here we show that overexpression of Hoxa9 or Hoxa10, both transcriptional targets of Setbp1, is also sufficient to induce self-renewal of primary myeloid progenitors, causing their immortalization in culture. More importantly, both are able to cooperate with BCR/ABL to consistently induce transformation of mouse GMPs and development of aggressive leukemias resembling CML myeloid blast crisis, suggesting that either gene can drive CML progression by promoting the self-renewal of GMPs. We further identify Myb as a common critical target for Hoxa9 and Hoxa10 in inducing self-renewal of myeloid progenitors as Myb knockdown significantly reduced colony-forming potential of myeloid progenitors immortalized by the expression of either gene. Interestingly, Myb is also capable of immortalizing primary myeloid progenitors in culture and cooperating with BCR/ABL to induce leukemic transformation of mouse GMPs. Significantly increased levels of MYB transcript also were detected in all human CML blast crisis samples examined over chronic phase samples, further suggesting the possibility that MYB overexpression may play a prevalent role in driving human CML myeloid blast crisis development. In summary, our results identify overexpression of HOXA9, HOXA10, and MYB as critical drivers of CML progression, and suggest MYB as a key therapeutic target for inhibiting the self-renewal of leukemia-initiating cells in CML myeloid blast crisis patients.",,"['Negi, Vijay', 'Vishwakarma, Bandana A', 'Chu, Su', 'Oakley, Kevin', 'Han, Yufen', 'Bhatia, Ravi', 'Du, Yang']","['Negi V', 'Vishwakarma BA', 'Chu S', 'Oakley K', 'Han Y', 'Bhatia R', 'Du Y']","['Department of Pediatrics, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, MD, USA.']",['eng'],,"['P30 CA013148/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA095684/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20171024,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,,,,PMC5716772,,2017/12/13 06:00,2017/12/13 06:01,['2017/12/13 06:00'],"['2017/07/07 00:00 [received]', '2017/09/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/13 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.22008 [doi]', '22008 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Oct 24;8(58):98853-98864. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.22008. eCollection 2017 Nov 17.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Hoxa10', 'Hoxa9', 'Myb', 'blast crisis', 'chronic myeloid leukemia']",,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors disclose no potential conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent genetic analyses have revealed gain-of-function STAT3 mutations in lymphoid cancers leading to hyperactivation of STAT3, which may represent a potential therapeutic target. Using a functional reporter assay, we screened 306 compounds with selective activity against various target molecules to identify drugs capable of inhibiting the cellular activity of STAT3. Top hits were further validated with additional models including STAT3-mutated natural killer (NK)-cell leukemia/lymphoma cell lines and primary large granular lymphocytic (LGL) leukemia cells to assess their ability to inhibit STAT3 phosphorylation and STAT3 dependent cell viability. We identified JAK, mTOR, Hsp90 and CDK inhibitors as potent inhibitors of both WT and mutant STAT3 activity. The Hsp90 inhibitor luminespib was highly effective at reducing the viability of mutant STAT3 NK cell lines and LGL leukemia patient samples. Luminespib decreased the phosphorylation of mutant STAT3 at Y705, whereas JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib had reduced efficacy on mutant STAT3 phosphorylation. Additionally, combinations involving Hsp90, JAK and mTOR inhibitors were more effective at reducing cell viability than single agents.

The present study assessed whether the Sal B protective effect was related to maintenance of Ca(2+) homeostasis and inhibition of ER stress. Male BALB/c mice were injected with ATO or ATO+Sal B once a day via the tail vein for 2 weeks. We then detected the effects of Sal B in real time using adult rat ventricular cardiomyocytes in vitro using an IonOptix MyoCam system. Sal B treatment alleviated ATO-induced abnormal cardiac contractions and Ca(2+) homeostasis imbalance. Sal B increased sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) activity, regulated Ca(2+) handling protein expression, and decreased expression of ERS proteins.

To elucidate if autophagy is important for stem cell survival and/or proliferation, we used culture in low oxygen concentration (0.1% O2 for 7 days) followed back by non-restricted O2 supply (normoxic culture) to mimic stem cell proliferation and commitment. Knockdown of Atg7 expression, a key player in autophagy, in K562 cell line inhibited autophagy compared to control cells. Upon 7 days at 0.1% O2 both K562 and K562 shATG7 cells stopped to proliferate and a similar amount of viable cells remained. Back to non-restricted O2 supply K562 cells proliferate whereas K562 shATG7 cells exhibited strong apoptosis. Using immunomagnetic sorted normal and CML CD34(+) cells, we inhibited the autophagic process by lentiviral infection expressing shATG7 or using a Vps34 inhibitor. Both, normal and CML CD34(+) cells either competent or deficient for autophagy stopped to proliferate in hypoxia. Surprisingly, while normal CD34(+) cells proliferate back to non restricted O2 supply, the CML CD34(+) cells deficient for autophagy failed to proliferate.

Thus, approaches to overcome such resistance are needed. We developed the setting of adaptive resistance to anti-VEGF therapy, and performed a series of in vivo experiments in both immune competent and nude mouse models. Given the pro-angiogenic properties of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and the dominant role of CSF1R in macrophage function, we added CSF1R inhibitors following emergence of adaptive resistance to anti-VEGF antibody. Mice treated with a CSF1R inhibitor (AC708) after anti-VEGF antibody resistance had little to no measurable tumor burden upon completion of the experiment while those that did not receive a CSF1R inhibitor still had abundant tumor. To mimic clinically used regimens, mice were also treated with anti-VEGF antibody and paclitaxel until resistance emerged, and then a CSF1R inhibitor was added. The addition of a CSF1R inhibitor restored response to anti-angiogenesis therapy, resulting in 83% lower tumor burden compared to treatment with anti-VEGF antibody and paclitaxel alone.

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 23 such cases. Results: The ages ranged from 2 to 76 years, with a median of 59 years at the diagnosis. The median interval between the transplant and diagnosis was 56 months (range, 8-384 months). The transplanted organs included liver in five, kidney in six, lung in five, heart in six, and heart/lung in one case(s). The types of MN included acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in 12, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in five, chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in four, and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) in two cases. Cytogenetics demonstrated clonal abnormalities in 18 (78.3%) cases, including unbalanced changes in 10 (55.6%), Philadelphia chromosome in four (22.2%), and other balanced aberrations in four (22.2%) cases. Thirteen (56.5%) patients died, with an estimated median survival of 9 months. With disease stratification, AML and MDS have short median survivals (3.5 and 7 months, respectively), with an initial precipitous decline of the survival curve. Conclusions: Posttransplant MNs have a latency period between that seen in AML/MDS related to alkylators and that associated with topoisomerase II inhibitors. The cytogenetic profile suggests a mutagenic effect on leukemogenesis. The clinical outcome for AML/MDS is dismal, with death occurring at an early phase of treatment.","['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2017. All rights reserved.

However, the genetic basis remains poorly understood. We recently reported that macrophages from mice deficient in tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 (Tet2), a model of MDS/CMML, are hyperinflammatory and have increased expression of arginase 1 (Arg1). In macrophages and myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) expression of Arg1 contributes to T-cell suppression and immune evasion by L-arginine depletion, in the setting of chronic inflammation and cancer. Since human MDS and CMML are driven by TET2 mutations and associated with chronic inflammation, we hypothesized that arginase enzymatic activity and ARG1 expression would be increased in human MDS/CMML bone marrow. Elevated arginase activity was observed in bone marrow mononuclear cells of MDS and CMML patients with lower-grade features. Immunohistochemical studies confirmed that myelomonocytic cells overexpress ARG1. Additionally, mutations in the epigenetic regulators TET2 and DNMT3A corresponded to high ARG1 expression and activity. These findings suggest ARG1 is a biomarker of immune dysregulation in early MDS and CMML. Recent murine findings have implicated Tet2 and Dnmt3a in regulation of innate immunity. Our study suggests similar changes may be driven by human TET2 and DNMT3A mutations.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We demonstrated herein that recombinant human arginase, an arginine degrading enzyme, abrogated growth and significantly increased Cav cytotoxicity toward cultured L1210 murine leukemic cells. Cav co-treatment further reduced cells viability in a time-dependent manner and significantly promoted apoptosis induction. In the pilot study we also evaluated for the first time the potential toxicity of the combined arginine deprivation and Cav treatment in healthy mice. Administration of Cav alone or in combination with pegylated cobalt-containing human arginase (Co-hARG) did not evoke any apparent toxic effects in these animals, with no significant behavioural and survival changes after several weeks of the treatment. The therapeutic effects of the combination of Co-hARG and Cav were provisionally evaluated on the highly aggressive murine L1210 leukemia, which is semi-sensitive to arginine deprivation as a monotreatment. Combination of two drugs did not result in significant prolongation of the survival of leukemia-bearing mice. Thus, we have shown that the proposed combinational treatment is rather non-toxic for the animals.

Firstly, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were taken pairwise among the four sample sets of Normal, Asymptomatic Carriers (ACs), ATLL, and HAM/TSP. Afterwards, the protein-protein interaction networks were reconstructed utilizing the hub genes. In conclusion, the pathways of cells proliferation and transformation were identified in the ACs state. In addition to immune pathways in ATLL, the inflammation and cancer pathways were discened in both diseases of ATLL and HAM/TSP.

Here, we measured ex vivo sensitivity of 246 blood cancers to 63 drugs alongside genome, transcriptome, and DNA methylome analysis to understand determinants of drug response. We assembled a primary blood cancer cell encyclopedia data set that revealed disease-specific sensitivities for each cancer. Within chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), responses to 62% of drugs were associated with 2 or more mutations, and linked the B cell receptor (BCR) pathway to trisomy 12, an important driver of CLL. Based on drug responses, the disease could be organized into phenotypic subgroups characterized by exploitable dependencies on BCR, mTOR, or MEK signaling and associated with mutations, gene expression, and DNA methylation. Fourteen percent of CLLs were driven by mTOR signaling in a non-BCR-dependent manner. Multivariate modeling revealed immunoglobulin heavy chain variable gene (IGHV) mutation status and trisomy 12 as the most important modulators of response to kinase inhibitors in CLL. Ex vivo drug responses were associated with outcome. This study overcomes the perception that most mutations do not influence drug response of cancer, and points to an updated approach to understanding tumor biology, with implications for biomarker discovery and cancer care.",,"['Dietrich, Sascha', 'Oles, Malgorzata', 'Lu, Junyan', 'Sellner, Leopold', 'Anders, Simon', 'Velten, Britta', 'Wu, Bian', 'Hullein, Jennifer', 'da Silva Liberio,

While FLT3 inhibitors like sorafenib show initial therapeutic efficacy, resistance rapidly develops through mechanisms that are incompletely understood. Here, we used RNA-Seq-based analysis of patient leukemic cells and found that upregulation of the Tec family kinase BMX occurs during sorafenib resistance. This upregulation was recapitulated in an in vivo murine FLT3-ITD-positive (FLT3-ITD+) model of sorafenib resistance. Mechanistically, the antiangiogenic effects of sorafenib led to increased bone marrow hypoxia, which contributed to HIF-dependent BMX upregulation. In in vitro experiments, hypoxia-dependent BMX upregulation was observed in both AML and non-AML cell lines. Functional studies in human FLT3-ITD+ cell lines showed that BMX is part of a compensatory signaling mechanism that promotes AML cell survival during FLT3 inhibition. Taken together, our results demonstrate that hypoxia-dependent upregulation of BMX contributes to therapeutic resistance through a compensatory prosurvival signaling mechanism. These results also reveal the role of off-target drug effects on tumor microenvironment and development of acquired drug resistance.

Here, we showed that myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (Mcl-1) acts as a functional switch in selecting between HR and NHEJ pathways. Mcl-1 was cell cycle-regulated during HR, with its expression peaking in S/G2 phase. While endogenous Mcl-1 depletion reduced HR and enhanced NHEJ, Mcl-1 overexpression resulted in a net increase in HR over NHEJ. Mcl-1 directly interacted with the dimeric Ku protein complex via its Bcl-2 homology 1 and 3 (BH1 and BH3) domains, which are required for Mcl-1 to inhibit Ku-mediated NHEJ. Mcl-1 also promoted DNA resection mediated by the Mre11 complex and HR-dependent DSB repair. Using the Mcl-1 BH1 domain as a docking site, we identified a small molecule, MI-223, that directly bound to BH1 and blocked Mcl-1-stimulated HR DNA repair, leading to sensitization of cancer cells to hydroxyurea- or olaparib-induced DNA replication stress. Combined treatment with MI-223 and hydroxyurea or olaparib exhibited a strong synergy against lung cancer in vivo.

Since flow cytometry allows investigation of resting and activated platelets on the single cell level by requiring only minimal amounts of blood, this method has become an important assay within the diagnostic algorithm, especially in pediatrics. We therefore developed a standardized and modular flow cytometric approach that contributes to clarify impaired platelet function in a rational step-by-step manner. Due to simultaneous analysis of four fluorophores in a basic panel design, we are able to readily detect the most common and clinically significant platelet disorders: Glanzmann thrombasthenia or Glanzmann-like diseases (fibrinogen receptor GPIIb-IIIa), Bernard-Soulier syndrome (von Willebrand-factor receptor complex GPIb-IX-V) and less well characterized beta1-integrins that serve as the collagen, laminin or fibronectin receptor (CD29-CD49b, e and f, respectively). Platelet reactivity was investigated in response to the agonists adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and thrombin receptor activator peptide 6 (TRAP6) in suboptimal and optimal concentrations by quantifying surface expression of activation markers CD62P and CD63 as well as binding of PAC-1 antibody to the high affinity conformation of the fibrinogen receptor. For advanced diagnostic questions, several further modules were implemented: (i) calcium mobilization for evaluation of early signal transduction, (ii) a kinetically resolved mepacrine assay for estimation of delta-granule content and release, and (iii) a module to determine platelet reactivity upon additional agonists like the thromboxane A2-analogue U46619 or collagen. Blood withdrawn from a healthy control cohort allowed generating preliminary standard values for all parameters. The modules were validated by analysis of patients with known or suspected platelet defects (leukocyte-adhesion deficiency type III, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, acute myeloid leukemia, sickle cell disease and chronic immune thrombocytopenia).",,"['Andres, Oliver', 'Henning, Katja', 'Strauss, Gabriele', 'Pflug, Annerose', 'Manukjan, Georgi', 'Schulze, Harald']","['Andres O', 'Henning K', 'Strauss G', 'Pflug A', 'Manukjan G', 'Schulze H']","[""a University Children's Hospital , Wurzburg , Germany."", 'b Laboratory for Paediatric Molecular Biology , Charite - University Medicine Berlin , Berlin , Germany.', 'c Clinic for Paediatric Oncology and Haematology , Charite - University Medicine Berlin , Berlin , Germany.', 'd Department for Paediatric Oncology and Haematology , HELIOS Klinikum Berlin-Buch , Berlin , Germany.', 'e Institute of Experimental Biomedicine , University Hospital Wurzburg , Wurzburg , Germany.', 'e Institute of Experimental Biomedicine , University Hospital Wurzburg , Wurzburg , Germany.', 'e Institute of Experimental Biomedicine , University Hospital Wurzburg , Wurzburg , Germany.']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],20171211,England,Platelets,Platelets,9208117,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Blood Platelet Disorders/*blood', 'Blood Platelets/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/*methods', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Young Adult']",,,2017/12/12 06:00,2018/09/13 06:00,['2017/12/12 06:00'],"['2017/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/13 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/09537104.2017.1386297 [doi]'],ppublish,Platelets. 2018 Jun;29(4):347-356. doi: 10.1080/09537104.2017.1386297.

However, its clinical significance in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains largely undefined. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the diagnostic and prognostic relevance of miR-195 in this malignancy. METHODS: Expression levels of miR-195 in peripheral blood and bone marrow samples of patients with pediatric AML and normal controls were detected by real-time quantitative PCR. Then, receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, Kaplan-Meier method, and Cox regression analysis were performed to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic relevance of serum miR-195 in pediatric AML. RESULTS: Compared to normal controls, the expression levels of miR-195 in both bone marrow and patients' sera were significantly decreased (both P< 0.001). In addition, serum miR-195 had an optimal diagnostic cut-off point (2.09) for pediatric AML with sensitivity of 68.87% and specificity of 96.23%. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) based on serum miR-195 was 0.910. Moreover, patients with low serum miR-195 level more often had French-American-British classification subtype M7 (P= 0.02), unfavorable karyotypes (P= 0.01), and shorter relapse-free and overall survivals (both P= 0.001) than those with high serum miR-195 level. Furthermore, the multivariate analysis identified serum miR-195 level as an independent prognostic factor for both relapse-free and overall survivals. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study suggest that the aberrant expression of miR-195 may play crucial roles in the development and progression of pediatric AML patients. Serum miR-195 may serve as a promising marker for monitoring the occurrence of this disease and predicting the clinical outcome of patients.",,"['Hong, Ze', 'Zhang, Rongrong', 'Qi, Haixiao']","['Hong Z', 'Zhang R', 'Qi H']",,['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Cancer Biomark,Cancer biomarkers : section A of Disease markers,101256509,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (MIRN195 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/genetics', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*biosynthesis', 'Prognosis']",,,2017/12/12 06:00,2018/08/23 06:00,['2017/12/12 06:00'],"['2017/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/23 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['CBM170327 [pii]', '10.3233/CBM-170327 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biomark. 2018 Feb 6;21(2):269-275. doi: 10.3233/CBM-170327.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Pediatric acute myeloid leukemia', 'microRNA-195', 'prognosis', 'real-time quantitative PCR', 'serum']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: In this multicenter, phase 2 trial, we enrolled 111 patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, or transformed follicular lymphoma who had refractory disease despite undergoing recommended prior therapy. Patients received a target dose of 2x10(6) anti-CD19 CAR T cells per kilogram of body weight after receiving a conditioning regimen of low-dose cyclophosphamide and fludarabine. The primary end point was the rate of objective response (calculated as the combined rates of complete response and partial response). Secondary end points included overall survival, safety, and biomarker assessments. RESULTS: Among the 111 patients who were enrolled, axi-cel was successfully manufactured for 110 (99%) and administered to 101 (91%). The objective response rate was 82%, and the complete response rate was 54%.With a median follow-up of 15.4 months, 42% of the patients continued to have a response, with 40% continuing to have a complete response. The overall rate of survival at 18 months was 52%. The most common adverse events of grade 3 or higher during treatment were neutropenia (in 78% of the patients), anemia (in 43%), and thrombocytopenia (in 38%). Grade 3 or higher cytokine release syndrome and neurologic events occurred in 13% and 28% of the patients, respectively. Three of the patients died during treatment. Higher CAR T-cell levels in blood were associated with response. CONCLUSIONS: In this multicenter study, patients with refractory large B-cell lymphoma who received CAR T-cell therapy with axi-cel had high levels of durable response, with a safety profile that included myelosuppression, the cytokine release syndrome, and neurologic events.

Single-use bioreactors offer an attractive platform for stem cell expansion owing to their scalability for large-scale production and feasibility of meeting clinical-grade standards. The current work evaluated the capacity of a single-use bioreactor system (1 L working volume) for expanding Meg01 cells, a megakaryocytic (MK) progenitor cell line. Oxygen supply was provided by surface aeration to minimize foaming and orbital shaking was used to promote oxygen transfer. Oxygen transfer rates (kL a) of shaking speeds 50, 100, and 125 rpm were estimated to be 0.39, 1.12, and 10.45 h(-1) , respectively. Shaking speed was a critical factor for optimizing cell growth. At 50 rpm, Meg01 cells exhibited restricted growth due to insufficient mixing. A negative effect occurred when the shaking speed was increased to 125 rpm, likely caused by high hydrodynamic shear stress. The bioreactor culture achieved the highest growth profile when shaken at 100 rpm, achieving a total expansion rate up to 5.7-fold with a total cell number of 1.2 +/- 0.2 x 10(9) cells L(-1) . In addition, cells expanded using the bioreactor system could maintain their potency to differentiate following the MK lineage, as analyzed from specific surface protein and morphological similarity with the cells grown in the conventional culturing system. Our study reports the impact of operational variables such as shaking speed for growth profile and MK differentiation potential of a progenitor cell line in a single-use bioreactor.

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the only curative option. In these patients, we aimed to compare the results of a myeloablative transplant versus a sequential approach consisting in a cytoreductive chemotherapy followed by a reduced intensity conditioning regimen and prophylactic donor lymphocytes infusions. We retrospectively analyzed 99 patients aged 18-50 years, transplanted for a refractory (52%) or a relapsed AML not in remission (48%). Fifty-eight patients received a sequential approach and 41 patients a myeloablative conditioning regimen. Only 6 patients received prophylactic donor lymphocytes infusions. With a median follow-up of 48 months, 2-year overall survival was 39%, 95% confidence interval (CI) (24-53) in the myeloablative group versus 33%, 95% CI (21-45) in the sequential groups (P = .39), and 2-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) was 57% versus 50% respectively (P = .99). Nonrelapse mortality was not higher in the myeloablative group (17% versus 15%, P = .44). In multivariate analysis, overall survival, CIR and nonrelapse mortality remained similar between the two groups. However, in multivariate analysis, sequential conditioning led to fewer acute grade II-IV graft versus host disease (GVHD) (HR for sequential approach = 0.37; 95% CI: 0.21-0.65; P < .001) without a significant impact on chronic GVHD (all grades and extensive). In young patients with refractory or relapsed AML, myeloablative transplant and sequential approach offer similar outcomes except for a lower incidence of acute GvHD after a sequential transplant.","['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Decroocq, Justine', 'Itzykson, Raphael', 'Vigouroux, Stephane', 'Michallet, Mauricette', 'Yakoub-Agha, Ibrahim', 'Huynh, Anne', 'Beckerich, Florence', 'Suarez, Felipe', 'Chevallier, Patrice', 'Nguyen-Quoc, Stephanie', 'Ledoux, Marie-Pierre', 'Clement, Laurence', 'Hicheri, Yosr', 'Guillerm, Gaelle', 'Cornillon, Jerome', 'Contentin, Nathalie', 'Carre, Martin', 'Maillard, Natacha', 'Mercier, Melanie', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Beguin, Yves', 'Bourhis, Jean-Henri', 'Charbonnier, Amandine', 'Dauriac, Charles', 'Bay, Jacques-Olivier', 'Blaise, Didier', 'Deconinck, Eric', 'Jubert, Charlotte', 'Raus, Nicole', 'Peffault de Latour, Regis', 'Dhedin, Nathalie']","['Decroocq J', 'Itzykson R', 'Vigouroux S', 'Michallet M', 'Yakoub-Agha I', 'Huynh A', 'Beckerich F', 'Suarez F', 'Chevallier P', 'Nguyen-Quoc S', 'Ledoux MP', 'Clement L', 'Hicheri Y', 'Guillerm G', 'Cornillon J', 'Contentin N', 'Carre M', 'Maillard N', 'Mercier M', 'Mohty M', 'Beguin Y', 'Bourhis JH', 'Charbonnier A', 'Dauriac C', 'Bay JO', 'Blaise D', 'Deconinck E', 'Jubert C', 'Raus N', 'Peffault de Latour R', 'Dhedin N']","['Hematology department, Hopital Saint Louis, Paris, France.', 'Hematology department, Hopital Saint Louis, Paris, France.', 'Hematology department, CHU Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.', 'Hematology department, CHU Lyon Sud, Lyon, France.', 'Hematology department, CHU de Lille, LIRIC INSERM U995, Universite Lille 2, Lille, France.', 'Hematology department, IUCT Oncopole, Toulouse, France.', 'Hematology department, CHU Henri Mondor, Creteil, France.', 'Hematology department, Hopital Necker Enfants malades, Paris, France.', 'Hematology department, CHU Nantes, Nantes, France.', 'Hematology department, La Pitie Salpetriere Hospital, Paris, France.', 'Hematology department, CHU Hautepierre, Strasbourg, France.', 'Hematology department, Hopital Brabois, Nancy, France.', 'Hematology department, CHU Lapeyronie, Montpellier, France.', 'Hematology department, CH Augustin Morvan, Brest, France.', 'Hematology department, CHU Saint Etienne, Saint Etienne, France.', 'Hematology department, CHU Becquerel, Rouen, France.', 'Hematology department, CHU Grenoble, Grenoble, France.', 'Hematology department, Hopital La Mileterie, Poitiers, France.', 'Hematology department, CHU Angers, Angers, France.', 'Hematology department, Hopital Saint Antoine, Paris, France.', 'Hematology department, CHU Liege, Liege, Belgium.', 'Hematology department, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.', 'Hematology department, CHU Amiens, Amiens, France.', 'Hematology department, CHU Rennes, Rennes, France.', 'Hematology department, CHU Clermont Ferrand, Clermont-Ferrand, France.', 'Hematology department, Institut Paoli Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Hematology department, CHU Besancon, Besancon, France.', 'Hematology department, Hopital des Enfants, Bordeaux, France.', 'SFGM-TC, Lyon, France.', 'Hematology department, Hopital Saint Louis, Paris, France.', 'Hematology department, Hopital Saint Louis, Paris, France.']",['eng'],,,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20180108,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Myeloablative Agonists)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Allografts', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloablative Agonists/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Salvage Therapy', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Whole-Body Irradiation', 'Young Adult']",,,2017/12/12 06:00,2019/04/26 06:00,['2017/12/12 06:00'],"['2017/08/12 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/05 00:00 [revised]', '2017/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/26 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.25004 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2018 Mar;93(3):416-423. doi: 10.1002/ajh.25004.

METHODS: A partitioned survival Markov model for a lifetime horizon (30 years) was developed to estimate costs (euro, 2016) and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) with IR and R. Initial cohort included patients with CLL receiving a second or subsequent line (2L) of treatment with IR or R. Survival data were based on CLL clinical trial. Drug, administration, monitoring, adverse events and clinical management of CLL costs were included in the model. Costs and outcomes were discounted using a 3% annually. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were performed. RESULTS: Compared to R, 2L IR treatment resulted in QALY gain of 3.147 (4.965 versus 1.818). Total costs were euro118 254 for IR versus euro23 874 for R. ICUR was euro29 990/QALY gained with IR versus R. In the PSA, IR was cost-effective in 78% of iterations using a threshold of euro45 000/QALY. CONCLUSION: IR can be considered a cost-effective treatment compared to R, in the treatment of R/R CLL patients for the Spanish NHS.","['(c) 2017 The Authors.

This death programme is fundamentally different from conventional cell death pathways. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This work is essentially based on the re-analysis of relevant, old experimental data. Elemental analysis of a highly purified, long-stored inhibitor sample was performed. Genomic sequence searches were performed using the basic local alignment search tool (BLAST). RESULTS: This death programme is initiated by an endogenous inhibitor secreted by CHL cells. The inhibitor is almost certainly identical to the pentapeptide pyroGlu-Glu-Asp-Cys-Lys, shown to be a cell line-specific inhibitor of normal granulocytic cells. The inhibitor is derived from a highly conserved short open reading frame in mammalian genomes.

Depending on the disease, MTX can be administered at low dose (LDMTX) in some autoimmune diseases, like rheumatoid arthritis, or at high dose (HDMTX) in some cancers, such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia. After absorption, MTX is metabolized in the liver to 7-hydroxymethotrexate and in the intestine to 2,4-diamino-N10-methylpteroic acid (DAMPA). Moreover, inside red blood cells, MTX is converted to active metabolites, MTX polyglutamates (MTXPGs), contributing to its pharmacodynamics. Owing to its narrow therapeutic range, and inter- and intra-patient variability, either noneffectiveness and/or toxicity may occur. Because of the existence of a relationship between drug therapeutic outcome and its systemic concentration, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) may ensure the effectiveness and safety of MTX use. In order to monitor the optimization of patient clinical response profile, several analytical methods have been described for TDM in biological samples. These include liquid chromatography (LC) coupled with ultraviolet detection, fluorescence detection or mass spectrometry, each one presenting advantages and drawbacks. This paper reviews the most commonly used techniques for sample preparation and critically discusses the current LC methods applied for the TDM of MTX in biological samples, at LDMTX and HDMTX.","['Copyright (c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['Silva, Monica Francisco', 'Ribeiro, Claudia', 'Goncalves, Virginia M F', 'Tiritan, Maria Elizabeth', 'Lima, Aurea']","['Silva MF', 'Ribeiro C', 'Goncalves VMF', 'Tiritan ME', 'Lima A']","['CESPU, Instituto de Investigacao e Formacao Avancada em Ciencias e Tecnologias da Saude, Rua Central de Gandra, Gandra, PRD, Portugal.', 'Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Coimbra, R.

Since its invention, x-ray CT has become indispensable in the clinic for diagnostic and prognostic purposes due to its quantitative absorption-based imaging in true 3D that allows objects of interest to be viewed and measured from any orientation. However, x-ray CT has not been useful at the level of single cells because there is insufficient contrast to form an image. Recently, optical CT has been developed successfully for fixed cells, but this technology called Cell-CT is incompatible with live-cell imaging due to the use of stains, such as hematoxylin, that are not compatible with cell viability. We present a novel development of optical CT for quantitative, multispectral functional 4D (three spatial + one spectral dimension) imaging of living single cells. The method applied to immune system cells offers truly isotropic 3D spatial resolution and enables time-resolved imaging studies of cells suspended in aqueous medium. Using live-cell optical CT, we found a heterogeneous response to mitochondrial fission inhibition in mouse macrophages and differential basal remodeling of small (0.1 to 1 fl) and large (1 to 20 fl) nuclear and mitochondrial structures on a 20- to 30-s time scale in human myelogenous leukemia cells.

The aim of this paper is to describe outcomes of pregnancy in women with myeloproliferative neoplasms seen at a single academic institution. Methods: Data were collected retrospectively from 2002 to 2015. Descriptive analyses were performed. Results: Eighteen pregnancies in 13 patients and 17 births were identified. One patient had recurrent miscarriages. There were two intrauterine fetal deaths, three small for gestational age linked to vascular placenta pathology and one preeclampsia. All of these mothers harbored JAK2V617F mutation. Two out of three patients with small for gestational age developed a venous thrombosis in the two years following delivery.

The purpose of this study was to explore the expression characteristics, clinicopathological significance, and molecular biological function of PBX3 in CC. The expression levels of PBX3 were analyzed in CC cell lines and tumor specimens by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Western blotting, and immunohistochemical staining. The clinicopathological characteristics associated with PBX3 expression were evaluated. An RNA interference approach was employed to suppress PBX3 expression in CC in vitro and in vivo, determine its role in cell proliferation and analyze its molecular function. We found that PBX3 expression was significantly upregulated in CC cell lines and clinical specimens compared with normal cells and adjacent nontumorous cervical tissues. PBX3 was an independent predictive factor of poor prognosis, and its expression was correlated with tumor diameter, pathological grading, lymph node metastasis, invasion depth, vascular invasion, and clinical stage of CC. Multivariate analysis suggested that PBX3 expression may represent an independent prognostic indicator of the survival of CC patients. CC patients with high PBX3 expression exhibited reduced overall survival compared with those with low PBX3 expression. Additionally, stable downregulation of PBX3 expression in CC cell lines suppressed cell proliferation and decreased p-AKT protein expression levels in vitro. Similarly, in vivo assays demonstrated that PBX3 downregulation in CC cells markedly inhibited tumor size and weight. Overall, we demonstrated that PBX3 can promote CC cell proliferation via the AKT signaling pathway and that it may serve as a prognostic marker.

In 2014, the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation published conditioning chemotherapy dosing guidelines for obese patients and recommended dosing of melphalan using actual body weight (ABW) in the body surface area calculation. The practice at Barnes-Jewish Hospital has consistently been to dose melphalan using adjusted body weight (AdBW), with a 20% correction when a patient weighs >/=120% of his or her ideal body weight (IBW). The purpose of this study was to compare outcomes of melphalan ASCT in patients with multiple myeloma between obese (>/=120% IBW) and nonobese (<120% IBW) populations. This retrospective, single-center study included adult patients with multiple myeloma undergoing first ASCT with melphalan conditioning between January 2009 and December 2012. Patient demographic data, transplantation characteristics, and clinical outcomes were collected. The primary outcome was 3-year event-free survival (EFS). Secondary outcomes included response at 100 days post-transplantation, 3-year overall survival, treatment-related mortality (TRM), time to neutrophil engraftment, and hospital length of stay (LOS). To ensure that melphalan dosage adjustment in the obese population did not impact efficacy, the primary outcome was assessed using a noninferiority design, with a predetermined noninferiority margin of 7%. Assuming a 70% 3-year EFS in the nonobese population, a noninferiority margin of 7%, a power of 80%, and an alpha value of .05, an analysis of 280 patients was required. A total of 270 patients, including 171 (63%) obese patients and 99 (37%) nonobese patients, met our inclusion criteria. Baseline characteristics were well matched between the 2 cohorts, including high-risk cytogenetics, disease severity at diagnosis, and use of maintenance therapy, with the only detectable differences related to weight itself. The 3-year EFS was 41% for the total cohort, with fewer events occurring in the obese cohort compared with the nonobese cohort (51% versus 40%; P = .0025). The 95% lower confidence limit established noninferiority. High-risk cytogenetics, disease severity at diagnosis, and therapy response pre- and post-ASCT were all associated with significantly shorter EFS. No between-group differences in TRM, time to engraftment, or hospital LOS were noted. This retrospective, single-center study found that using AdBW to dose melphalan in obese patients was not inferior to the nonobese population in terms of 3-year EFS. This study adds to the limited evidence on melphalan dosing and suggests that transplantation efficacy is not affected by AdBW dosing in obese patients. Further studies are needed to provide additional insight into the pharmacokinetic differences and best dosing practices for obese patients.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Previously our research group has synthesized and studied the anti-proliferative effects of N-Decyl-N-(2-Methyl-4-Quinazolinyl) Amine (DMQA). The current study evaluated the cytotoxic and apoptotic properties of DMQA in THP-1 cells. The cytotoxic potential of DMQA was assessed using MTT assay on a panel of cancer cell lines which include HeLa, Mia PaCa-2, A 375, B16-F10, A 549,A 431, U937, THP-1, HL-60 and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC's). Preliminary data revealed that the highest cytotoxic activity was against THP-1 leukemia cell line (IC50=0.66 mug/ml). The apoptotic properties of DMQA on THP-1 cells were characterized by change in nuclear morphology, DNA fragmentation, reduction of pro-caspases-3, 9, Bax/Bcl-2 levels, cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase and cytosolic release of cytochrome c. Further investigation revealed a sub-G1 peak, phosphatidyl serine exposure and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in THP-1 cells. The role of caspases was crucial and was demonstrated by the inhibitors Z-VAD-FMK and Z-DEVD-FMK. Moreover DMQA was markedly less effective in inhibiting the growth of normal cells (PBMC's, IC50 =62.17 mug/ml). Based on the results we suggest that DMQA induced apoptosis via intrinsic pathway and could be a promising anticancer agent.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

DNA-alkylating PI polyamide conjugates are attractive candidates as anticancer drugs acting through DNA damage and its subsequent inhibition of cell proliferation. One example is a chlorambucil-PI polyamide conjugate targeting the runt-related transcription factor (RUNX) family. RUNX1 has pro-oncogenic properties in acute myeloid leukemia, and recently the chlorambucil-PI polyamide conjugate was demonstrated to have anticancer effects. Herein, we apply another DNA-alkylating agent, seco-CBI, to target the consensus sequence of the RUNX family. Two types of CBI conjugates were prepared and their binding properties were characterized by Bind-n-Seq analysis using a high-throughput sequencer. The sequencing data were analyzed by two methods, MERMADE and our new MR (motif identification with a reference sequence), and the resultant binding motif logos were as predicted from the pairing rules proposed by Dervan et al. This is the first report to employ the MR method on alkylating PI polyamide conjugates. Moreover, cytotoxicity of conjugates 3 and 4 against a human non-small cell lung cancer, A549, were examined to show promising IC50s of 120nm and 63nm, respectively.

Vincristine-based regimen is among the most commonly used regimens for the treatment of adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Peripheral neuropathy caused by vincristine provides a limitation in dose administration and can influence the treatment outcome and patient's quality of life. CASE PRESENTATION: Ileus and constipation occurred as a result of autonomic neuropathy in a 58-year-old man who underwent vincristine-based regimen for acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatment. Despite the administration of several laxative agents for constipation, the complication did not improve. So metoclopramide as a prokinetic agent was administered intravenously, and patient bowel movement and defecation started after 24 h. CONCLUSIONS: There is no approved protocol for vincristine-induced autonomic neuropathy treatment; thus, prokinetic agents such as metoclopramide can be considered as an option for ileus treatment after ruling out the possibility of bowel obstruction.

Previous studies have shown that aberrant HOX gene expression accompanies leukemogenesis and affects disease progression and leukemia patient survival. Patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) bearing PML-RARalpha fusion gene have distinct HOX gene signature in comparison to other subtypes of AML patients, although the mechanism of transcription regulation is not completely understood. We previously found an association between the mRNA levels of HOX genes and those of the histone demethylases JMJD3 and UTX in PML-RARalpha- positive leukemia patients. Here, we demonstrate that the release of the PML-RARalpha-mediated block in PML-RARalpha-positive myeloid leukemia cells increased both JMJD3 and HOX gene expression, while inhibition of JMJD3 using the specific inhibitor GSK-J4 reversed the effect. This effect was driven specifically through PML-RARalpha fusion protein since expression changes did not occur in cells with mutated RARalpha and was independent of differentiation. We confirmed that gene expression levels were inversely correlated with alterations in H3K27me3 histone marks localized at HOX gene promoters. Furthermore, data from chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing broaden a list of clustered HOX genes regulated by JMJD3 in PML-RARalpha-positive leukemic cells. Interestingly, the combination of GSK-J4 and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) significantly increased PML-RARalpha-positive cell apoptosis compared with ATRA treatment alone. This effect was also observed in ATRA-resistant NB4 clones, which may provide a new therapeutic opportunity for patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) resistant to current treatment.

Methods: Human AML cell line U937 and HL-60 cells were transfected with NPM1 plasmid to establish stable clones, and the high NPM1 protein expression (NPM1(hi)) clones were screened by Western blot. The cell proliferation was assayed by methylthiazolyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) , cell cycle and cell apoptosis by flow cytometric, cell colony formation by microscope count, the molecular pathways related to cell cycle by Western blot. The expression of NPM1 gene in primary AML bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMC) was investigated by RQ-PCR. Results: 1 in circleThe proliferation of NPM1(hi) U937 and HL-60 cells was similar with that of control cells (4.68+/-1.28 vs 3.89+/-0.81, 3.34+/-0.37 vs 2.68+/-0.29, P>0.05) . 2 in circleThe percentage of S phase in NPM1(hi) U937 and HL-60 cells was higher than that in control cells[ (50.22+/-3.42) % vs (39.78+/-3.80) %, (59.01+/-3.27) % vs (43.94+/-2.08) %, P<0.05]. 3 in circleThe anti-apoptosis capacity and colony formation abilities of NPM1(hi) U937 cells increased than that of control cells[ (68.8+/-10.2) % vs (48.7+/-3.22) %, and (772.7+/-24.0) vs (652.3+/-16.5) , P<0.05], but the above abilities of NPM1(hi) HL60 cells were similar with that of control cells. 4 in circle The expressions of CDK4, Cyclin D1, Cyclin D2 and Cyclin E in NPM1(hi) leukemia cells were higher than that of control cells, but the expression of Cyclin D3 was lower. The NPM1 expression levels in AML patients with favorable cytogenetic prognosis were lower than that of patients with intermediate prognosis.

In yaks (Bos grunniens), the distribution, strains and genetic characteristics of BLV have rarely been studied. The aim of our study was to investigate BLV infections in domestic yaks and determine the genetic variability of BLV circulating in a region of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau, China. Blood samples were collected from 798 yaks, which were from different farms from Gansu, Qinghai and Sichuan provinces surrounding the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Nested PCR targeting BLV long terminal repeats was used to detect the BLV provirus. The highest prevalence of BLV infection was in Gansu province, where it was 18.93% (39/206) in white yaks from Tianzhu City and 19.14% (31/162) in black yaks from Gannan City. In Qinghai and Sichuan provinces, the prevalence of BLV in black yaks was 14.83% (35/236) and 14.94% (29/194), respectively. The prevalence of BLV was not significantly different in yaks up to one year old than in older animals. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using 16 different env-gp51 (497-bp) gene sequences from the three provinces and 71 known BLV strains, which revealed that in both Gansu and Qinghai provinces, genotypes 6 and 10 of the BLV strains were at high levels, whereas only genotype 10 was prevalent in Sichuan Province. Phylogenetic analysis and sequence comparisons revealed 95.7-99.8% sequence identity among the full-length env genes of 16 strains, nearly full-length genome sequences of six BLV strains, and those of the known genotypes 6 and 10 of BLV. This study provides comprehensive information is regarding the widespread infection of domestic yaks with BLV on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau of China, and shows that at least two BLV genotypes (genotypes 6 and 10) are circulating in this population.",,"['Wang, Meng', 'Wang, Yun', 'Baloch, Abdul Rasheed', 'Pan, Yangyang', 'Xu, Fang', 'Tian, Lili', 'Zeng, Qiaoying']","['Wang M', 'Wang Y', 'Baloch AR', 'Pan Y', 'Xu F', 'Tian L', 'Zeng Q']","['College of Veterinary Medicine, Gansu Agricultural University, Lanzhou, China.', 'Anning Branch Lanzhou General Hospital, Lanzhou, China.', 'Faculty of Fisheries and Protection of Waters, South Bohemian Research Center of Aquaculture and Biodiversity of Hydrocenoses, Research Institute of Fish Culture and Hydrobiology, University of South Bohemia in Ceske Budejovice, Zatisi 728/II, 389 25, Vodnany, Czech Republic.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Gansu Agricultural University, Lanzhou, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Gansu Agricultural University, Lanzhou, China.', 'China Animal Health and Epidemiology Center, Qingdao, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Gansu Agricultural University, Lanzhou, China. zengqy@gsau.edu.cn.']",['eng'],,"['31260616/National Natural Science Foundation of China', 'GSAU-RCZX201702/Scientific research foundation for the new Scholars, Gansu', 'Agricultural university', 'JYCX-KX017/Innovation foundation of the College of Veterinary Medicine, Gansu', 'Agriculture University']",['Journal Article'],20171209,Austria,Arch Virol,Archives of virology,7506870,,IM,,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cattle', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*epidemiology/transmission/virology', 'Gene Expression', '*Genes, env', '*Genotype', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*classification/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Molecular Epidemiology', '*Phylogeny', 'Prevalence', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Tibet/epidemiology']",,,2017/12/11 06:00,2018/02/21 06:00,['2017/12/11 06:00'],"['2017/08/13 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/21 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00705-017-3658-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s00705-017-3658-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Arch Virol. 2018 Mar;163(3):659-670. doi: 10.1007/s00705-017-3658-9.

Studies have shown that exercise training could give beneficial effects on skeletal muscle growth. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is a key regulator of muscle growth and regeneration. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of interval exercise training (IET) on the expression of LIF and the MI-induced skeletal muscle atrophy. MAIN METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were used to establish the MI model by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Infarcted Rats were divided into two groups: sedentary MI group (MI) and MI with interval exercise group (ME), and compared to sham-operated group (Sham). Exercise-trained animals were subjected to eight weeks of IET. Cardiac function, collagen volume fraction, expression of LIF and its receptor LIFR, myofiber size, apoptosis and proliferation in gastrocnemius muscle were analyzed. KEY FINDINGS: IET increased heart functional performance and was accompanied with reversing cardiac pathological remodeling. Moreover, IET increased the expression of LIF and LIFR, activated signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT3), reduced apoptosis and promoted proliferation in gastrocnemius muscle compared with the MI group. In addition, there was a significant negative correlation between skeletal muscle atrophy and LIF expression which was stimulated by IET in infarcted rats. SIGNIFICANCE: IET reverses MI-induced cardiac dysfunction and skeletal muscle atrophy. In addition, IET up-regulates the expression of muscle LIF/LIFR and activates the STAT3.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Majority of patients can be effectively treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as imatinib, but a portion of patients will develop drug resistance. Accumulated evidences have identified exosomes in cancer as promoters of tumor progression. Herein, we found that exosomes derived from imatinib resistant CML cells can be internalized into sensitive CML cells and confer drug-resistance traits. We also demonstrated a significant higher level of miR-365 in exosomes derived from drug-resistant CML cells compared with those from sensitive ones using microarray and qRT-PCR. The imatinib sensitive CML cells transfected with pre-miR-365 displayed lower chemosensitivity and apoptosis rate compared with controls. We further confirmed that exosomal transfer of miR-365 induced drug resistance by inhibiting expression of pro-apoptosis protein in sensitive CML cells.

We performed a population-based, observational analysis of AML cases reported to the Cantonal Cancer Registries in Switzerland. Data was aggregated by the National Institute for Epidemiology and Cancer Registration and stratified for the two time periods 2001-2007 and 2008-2013. Overall, 2351 new AML cases were registered with a stable age-standardised incidence rate (3.0 [95 CI: 2.8-3.2] per 100,000 person-years). This indicates that our observed raise of annual AML cases (+10.9%) is mainly related to demographic ageing and not to an increase of age-specific risks. The fraction of non-classifiable AML cases decreased over time (54.6% to 41.8%) but remained high in elderly patients (65-74yrs: 44%; 75-84yrs: 54.2%, 85+yrs: 59.1%), suggesting less accurate diagnostics and reporting with increasing age. 5yrs relative survival (RS) correlated with AML risk class (favorable: 61.7%-68.4%; adverse risk: 11.4%-21.9%) and age (<65yrs: 42.6-43.3%; 75-84yrs: 2.0-3.0%), but improved only modestly overall (19.2% to 23.3%). Interestingly, we identified a significant improvement of RS in patients aged 65-74yrs (5yrs: 5.2% to 13.5%; p<0.001). As surrogate for changes in management, we found an increase of allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantations (1.4 to 7%) and clinical trial activities (25 to 29%) for elderly AML patients during the observation period. Our analysis indicates that recent progress made in management of elderly AML patients results in an improvement of survival on a population-based level in Switzerland and that therapeutic nihilism is not justifiable.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: We included 127 paediatric patients who were diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and undergoing remission- induction chemotherapy in the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University. Children from two paediatric wards who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled. One ward was randomly chosen as the intervention group and the other ward as the control group. Children in the two groups were matched for age and sex. The ONS group was administered Peptamen(R) (n=60) and the control group was administered a low-fat diet (n=67). RESULTS: The baseline information before treatment was not significantly different between groups (p>0.05). In the control group, weight loss at the end of chemotherapy was significantly higher than that of ONS group (p<0.05). The hemoglobin level and the concentrations of total protein, albumin, and pre-albumin were significantly higher in the ONS group than in the control group (p<0.05 and p<0.01, respectively). The incidences of hypoalbuminaemia, gastrointestinal complications, and infection were lower in the ONS group than in the control group (p<0.05). The ONS group also used lower amount of albumin infusion, fewer blood-product infusion, and had lower hospital costs than the control group.

As part of the Single Technology Appraisal (STA) ID944, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invited AbbVie, the manufacturer, to submit evidence on the use of venetoclax, within its licensed indication. The Evidence Review Group (ERG), Warwick Evidence, was asked to provide an independent and critical review of the submitted evidence. Evidence came from three single-arm trials in CLL patients with or without 17p deletion [del(17p])/TP53 chromosomal abnormalities. The anticipated licensed indication specified that venetoclax-eligible del(17p)/TP53 patients should have not responded to, or be deemed unsuitable for, B-cell receptor inhibitor (BCRi) therapy, and that non-del(17p)/TP53 patients should have not responded to both chemoimmunotherapy and BCRi therapy. The three trials were heterogeneous in terms of both del(17p)/TP53 status and previous exposure to BCRi therapy. The M13-982 study investigated 158 R/R CLL patients with the 17p deletion, but only a small number had received previous BCRi therapy; the M12-175 study investigated 67 patients with CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma, some with the 17p deletion, but very few previously treated with BCRi therapy; and the M14-032 study included 105 patients previously treated with BCRi therapy (either idelalisib or ibrutinib), some of whom had unknown mutation status. The ERG concluded that the study populations did not directly conform to those specified in the licensed indication or in the NICE scope. Outcomes reported included overall response rate (ORR), duration of response, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS); adverse events were reported for the pooled population of all three studies, as well as separately for each study. The median PFS was 41.4 and 27.2 months among patients in the M12-175 and M13-982 trials, respectively, whereas the median PFS was not reached in the M14-032 trial. Some results were designated academic in confidence and cannot be reported here. The submission provided a de novo partitioned survival cost-effectiveness model with three health states: pre-progression, post-progression and dead. Transition probabilities between health states were estimated using Weibull models for PFS and OS. The ERG judged the model structure to be appropriate. Venetoclax was compared with best supportive care (BSC) in patients with or without del(17p)/TP53 mutation status, and with palliative care (PC). To populate the del(17p)/TP53 venetoclax arm, the submission pooled del(17p)/TP53 patients from all three studies and fitted Weibull models for PFS and OS. PFS and OS models for non-del(17p)/TP53 venetoclax patients were obtained by applying hazard ratios (HRs) to the del(17p)/TP53 OS and PFS models, derived using Cox's regression analysis comparing del(17p)/TP53 and non-del(17p)/TP53 patients pooled from the M14-032 and M12-175 studies. The ERG expressed reservations about the company's pooling procedure, but acknowledged its expedience given the small evidence base. For the BSC comparator arm, the submission used the rituximab + placebo arm from a randomised controlled trial comparing idelalisib + rituximab versus placebo + rituximab ('study 116'). Weibull regression data for OS and PFS were taken from the idelalisib STA (ID764) submitted by Gilead to NICE. The ERG considered the use of the study 116 rituximab arm to be inconsistent with the licensed indication for venetoclax because these patients had neither not responded to nor were inappropriate for BCRi therapy, being eligible to be randomised to idelalisib. Another difficulty was the requirement for a technical correction in survival analysis because of considerable switching from rituximab to idelalisib. The ERG considered that post-progression survival of patients from the idelalisib arm of study 116 provided a more appropriate representation of BSC since these patients had not responded to BCRi therapy, consistent with venetoclax's licensed indication. For PC, the company submission used data from the UK CLL Forum. The company's base-case analysis indicated that venetoclax was clinically effective, but the resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for del(17p)/TP53 ( pound39,940/quality-adjusted life-year [QALY] gained) and non-del(17p)/TP53 ( pound47,370/QALY gained) patients were well above the NICE threshold of pound20,000-30,000/QALY. The ERG identified two errors in the implementation of the company's parametric models-one related to the implementation of HRs, and the other to the derivation of the Weibull shape parameters obtained from the Gilead idelalisib submission. The ERG made plausible adjustments to the company's base-case and corrected errors, resulting in a reduced estimate of the cost effectiveness of venetoclax in non-del(17p)/TP53 and del(17p)/TP53 indications; in the ERG's preferred base case, using post-progression survival of patients in the idelalisib arm of study 116 as the BSC comparator, deterministic ICERs were higher than the company's base-case for both indications: pound57,476/QALY gained for del(17p)/TP53 and pound77,779/QALY gained for non-del(17p)/TP53. The NICE Appraisal Committee's preliminary recommendation was that venetoclax used within its licensed indication should not be recommended for use in the National Health Service (NHS). In response to the preliminary recommendation, the company submitted new analyses; however, at a subsequent appraisal committee meeting, the original recommendation was upheld and the committee concluded there were large uncertainties around the clinical effectiveness of venetoclax and BSC, and that under the committee's preferred assumptions, the ICERs were higher than those generally considered cost effective, even when end-of-life criteria were taken into account. The company submitted further evidence, and the final guidance recommended venetoclax for use with the Cancer Drugs Fund for the two populations in this technology appraisal.",,"['Mistry, Hema', 'Nduka, Chidozie', 'Connock, Martin', 'Colquitt, Jill', 'Mantopoulos, Theodoros', 'Loveman, Emma', 'Walewska, Renata', 'Mason, James']","['Mistry H', 'Nduka C', 'Connock M', 'Colquitt J', 'Mantopoulos T', 'Loveman E', 'Walewska R', 'Mason J']","['Warwick Evidence, Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick, Gibbet Hill Road, Coventry, CV4 7AL, UK.

During acute viral infection, macrophages must invade the inflamed tissue toward low oxygen concentrations, where genetic cellular responses depend on hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF). In the study reported here we investigated the role of HIF-1alpha in macrophage function during acute retroviral infection. Wild-type and myeloid cell-specific HIF-1alpha knockout mice were infected with Friend retrovirus (FV), and immune response was analysed 7 and 10 days after infection. FV infection led to increased spleen weight in wild-type and knockout mice, whereas a profound proliferation of erythroblasts was seen only in wild-type mice. The number of spleen-infiltrating macrophages was also significantly lower in knockout animals. Macrophage invasion after FV infection in wild-type mice led to elevated amounts of activated macrophage-stimulating 1 protein that resulted in massive proliferation of erythrocyte precursor cells.

Human natural killer (NK) cells, purified from the peripheral blood (hu-PB-NK) of normal healthy donors, proliferated when transferred into NOG-IL-15 Tg mice. In addition, the cell number increased, and the hu-PB-NK cells persisted for 3 months without signs of xenogeneic graft versus host diseases (xGVHD). These in vivo-expanded hu-PB-NK cells maintained the original expression patterns of various surface antigens, including NK receptors and killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) molecules. They also contained significant amounts of granzyme A and perforin. Inoculation of K562 leukemia cells into hu-PB-NK-transplanted NOG-IL-15 Tg mice resulted in significant suppression of tumor growth compared with non-transplanted mice. Furthermore, NOG-IL-15 Tg mice allowed for engraftment of in vitro-expanded NK cells prepared for clinical cell therapy. These cells exerted antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) on Her2-positive gastric cancer cells in the presence of therapeutic anti-Her2 antibody, and subsequently suppressed tumor growth.

The availability of these agents is both an important advance for patients but also a challenge for practicing hematologist/oncologists to learn how best to sequence NAs, both with respect to chemoimmunotherapy (CIT) and to other NAs. The sequencing of NAs in clinical practice should be guided both by an individual patient's prognostic markers, such as FISH and immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (IGHV)-mutation status, as well as the patient's medical comorbidities and goals of care. For older, frailer patients with lower-risk CLL prognostic markers, NA monotherapy may remain a mainstay of CLL treatment for years to come. For younger, fitter patients and those with higher-risk CLL, such as del(17p) or unmutated IGHV, combination approaches may prove to be more valuable than NA monotherapy. Trials are currently evaluating the efficacy of several such combination approaches, including NA plus anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, NA plus NA (with or without anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody), and NA plus CIT. Given the tremendous efficacy of the already approved NAs, as well as the promising data for next generation NAs, the development of well-tolerated, highly effective combination strategies with curative potential for patients with CLL has become a realistic goal.",['(c) 2016 by The American Society of Hematology.

Some markers also allow selecting more specific therapies with improved activity in the presence of certain genetic or clinical features of CLL.

Few mutations recur across patients at a frequency >5%, whereas a large number of biologically and clinically uncharacterized genes are mutated at lower frequency. Approximately 80% of CLL patients carry at least 1 of 4 common chromosomal alterations, namely deletion 13q14, deletion 11q22-23, deletion 17p12, and trisomy 12. Knowledge of the CLL genome has translated into the availability of molecular biomarkers for prognosis and treatment prediction. Prognostic biomarkers do not affect treatment choice, and can be integrated into prognostic scores that are based on both clinical and biological variables. Molecular predictive biomarkers affect treatment choice, and currently include TP53 disruption by mutation and/or deletion and IGHV mutation status.

Leukemia susceptibility syndromes occur as a result of autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked recessive inheritance, or de novo occurrence, of germline pathogenic variants in DNA repair, ribosome biogenesis, telomere biology, hematopoietic transcription factors, tumor suppressors, and other critical cellular processes. Children and adults with cytopenias, MDS, dysmorphic features, notable infectious histories, immunodeficiency, certain dermatologic findings, lymphedema, unusual sensitivity to radiation or chemotherapy, or acute leukemia with a family history of early-onset cancer, pulmonary fibrosis, or alveolar proteinosis should be thoroughly evaluated for a leukemia susceptibility syndrome. Genetic testing and other diagnostic modalities have improved our ability to identify these patients and to counsel them and their family members for subsequent disease risk, cancer surveillance, and therapeutic interventions. Herein, the leukemia susceptibility syndromes are divided into 3 groups: (1) those associated with an underlying inherited bone marrow failure syndrome, (2) disorders in which MDS precedes leukemia development, and (3) those with a risk primarily of leukemia.

This accounts for the clinical observation that TKI discontinuation leads to rapid leukemia relapse. Most patients require continued treatment to prevent relapse, with associated risk of relapse, toxicity, teratogenic effects, financial burden, and noncompliance. Understanding LSC resistance to TKI and development of strategies to increase the proportion of CML patients achieving treatment-free remissions is a critical area of investigation in CML. In addition, LSCs are the source of TKI resistance, relapse, or disease progression, which is another major area of need in CML treatment. It is now understood that BCR-ABL kinase-independent mechanisms are responsible for retention of LSC subpopulations. It is likely that both cell-intrinsic and microenvironmental mechanisms contribute to LSC maintenance. Here, we review the current understanding of mechanisms underlying persistence of CML LSCs during TKI treatment, recently described approaches to target these cells and emerging clinical trials, and the challenges impeding more rapid progress in achieving cures for a greater number of CML patients.",['(c) 2016 by The American Society of Hematology.

Indeed, the success of BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has increased the focus on survivorship and late toxicity in oncological care. Survivorship issues in this population include CV disease prevention, given its prevalence in the general population. The introduction of BCR-ABL1 TKIs represented a unique concept of indefinite cancer therapy, only recently evolving to include ""treatment-free remission."" Importantly, later-generation BCR-ABL1 TKIs have been associated with CV complications. Dasatinib has been associated with pleural/pericardial effusions and pulmonary hypertension, whereas nilotinib and ponatinib have been linked to the development of vascular occlusive events. There is currently a dearth of data with respect to the mechanisms of drug toxicities, the subsets of patients at risk, and prevention and treatment strategies to mitigate CV complications in patients with CML. Nevertheless, optimal patient CV risk assessment needs to become a more central tenet of patient care in CML.

Clinical trials have shown that some patients with CML in the chronic phase who achieve sustained deep molecular responses on TKI therapy can safely suspend therapy with no evidence of relapse. The long follow-up studies and the number of eligible patients have now validated the concept of treatment-free remission (ie, the ability to maintain a molecular response after stopping therapy). It should be considered as the future criterion to evaluate the success of clinical trials, especially if we want to take into account the quality of life of patients in addition to the economic aspect.

Given the well-defined differences in clinical management needs and outcomes for aplastic anemia, acute myeloid leukemia, and MDS in patients with an IBMFS vs those occurring sporadically, as well as nonhematologic comorbidities in patients with IBMFSs, it is critical for hematologists to understand how to approach screening for the currently known IBMFSs. This review presents a practical approach for the clinical hematologist that outlines when to suspect an IBMFS and how to use various diagnostic tools, from physical examination to screening laboratory tests and genomics, for the diagnosis of the most frequent IBMFSs: Fanconi anemia, telomere biology disorders, Diamond-Blackfan anemia, GATA2 deficiency syndrome, Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, and severe congenital neutropenia.",['(c) 2016 by The American Society of Hematology.

Given the recent descriptions of clonal hematopoiesis in aged populations, the increased risk of developing hematologic malignancies in individuals with clonal hematopoiesis, and the many similarities in hematopoietic aging and acquired bone marrow failure (BMF) syndromes, such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), this raises significant questions regarding the relationship between aging hematopoiesis and MDS, including the factors that regulate HSC aging, whether clonal hematopoiesis is required for the development of MDS, and even whether BMF is an inevitable consequence of aging.

Over the past several years, a host of novel therapies (eg, immunotherapy and targeted therapies) with better tolerability than traditional chemotherapy are now being introduced into the relapsed/refractory population with very encouraging results. Additionally, insights into how to choose effective therapies for patients while minimizing drug toxicity through pharmacogenomics and the use of minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring to escalate/de-escalate therapy have enhanced our ability to reduce treatment-related toxicity. This has led to the design of a number of clinical trials which incorporate both novel therapeutics as well as MRD-directed treatment pathways into the frontline setting.

The introduction of BCR-ABL1 targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has significantly improved the outcomes not only by allowing more patients to undergo allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) but also by decreasing our reliance on this potentially toxic strategy, particularly in the less fit population. Long-term data using chemotherapy and TKI combinations demonstrate that a proportion of patients treated can achieve durable relapse-free survival without undergoing alloHCT. Furthermore, the availability of sensitive minimal residual disease monitoring assays may allow early detection of the patients who are more likely to relapse and who are likely candidates for early alloHCT. The emergence of more potent TKIs with significant activity against resistant mutations has allowed deintensification of chemotherapy regimens. Available data indicate that complete reliance on TKIs, alone or with minimal additional therapy, and elimination of more intensive chemotherapy or alloHCT is unlikely to achieve long term cure in most patients. However, introduction of other highly effective agents that can be combined with TKIs may allow further minimization of chemotherapy and alloHCT in the future, as we have witnessed in acute promyelocytic leukemia.",['(c) 2016 by The American Society of Hematology.

It can be detected by molecular methods that use leukemia-specific or patient-specific molecular markers (fusion gene transcripts, or immunoglobulin/T-cell receptor [IG/TR] gene rearrangements), and by multi-parametric flow cytometry. The sensitivity and specificity of these methods can vary across treatment time points and therapeutic settings. Thus, knowledge of the principles and limitations of each technology is of the utmost importance for correct interpretation of MRD results. Time will tell whether new molecular and flow cytometric high-throughput technologies can overcome the limitations of current standard methods and eventually bring additional benefits. MRD during standard ALL chemotherapy is the strongest overall prognostic indicator and has therefore been used for refining initial treatment stratification. Moreover, MRD positivity after the maintenance phase of treatment may point to an impending relapse and thus enable salvage treatment to be initiated earlier, which could possibly improve treatment results. The prognostic relevance of pretransplantation MRD was shown by several studies, and MRD high-risk patients were shown to benefit from stem cell transplantation (SCT). Also, MRD positivity after SCT correlates with worse outcomes. In addition, MRD information is very instructive in current clinical trials that test novel agents to evaluate their treatment efficacy. Although conventional clinical risk factors lose their independent prognostic significance when combined with MRD information, recently identified genetic markers may further improve the treatment stratification in ALL.",['(c) 2016 by The American Society of Hematology.

In addition, cancer cells can rapidly respond to conventional and targeted therapies by accumulating novel and often specific genetic lesions leading to acquired drug resistance and relapsing disease. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), however, diverse chromosomal aberrations often occur. In many cases, improper repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) is a major source for genomic abnormalities. Therefore, this study examined the repair of DNA DSBs by nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) in CLL by performing plasmid-based repair assays in primary CLL cells and normal B cells, isolated from patients, as well as TALEN/Cas9-induced chromosomal deletions in the CLL cell line Mec1. It is demonstrated that DNA repair is aberrant in CLL cells, featuring perturbed DNA break structure preference with efficient joining of noncohesive ends and more deletions at repair junctions. In addition, increased microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) of DNA substrates was observed in CLL together with increased expression of MMEJ-specific repair factors.

Treatment with VTN (but not fibrinogen, fibronectin, laminin-111 or collagen-I) substantially increased LIF and IL-6 within 4 h in C6-astroglioma cells, while VTN(-/-) mouse plasma was less effective than that from wild-type mice. LIF and IL-6 were induced by intracerebral injection of recombinant human (rh)VTN in mice, but induction seen upon intracerebral hemorrhage was less in VTN(-/-) mice than in wild-type littermates. In vitro, VTN effects were inhibited by RGD, alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5 integrin-blocking peptides and antibodies. VTN activated focal adhesion kinase (FAK; also known as PTK2), whereas pharmacological- or siRNA-mediated inhibition of FAK, but not PYK2, reduced the expression of LIF and IL-6 in C6 and endothelial cells and after traumatic cell injury. Dominant-negative FAK (Y397F) reduced the amount of injury-induced LIF and IL-6. Pharmacological inhibition or knockdown of uPAR (also known as PLAUR), which binds VTN, also reduced cytokine expression, possibly through a common target of uPAR and integrins. We propose that VTN leakage into tissues promotes inflammation. Integrin-FAK signaling is therefore a novel IL-6 and LIF regulation mechanism relevant to the inflammation and stem cell fields.",['(c) 2018.

The fish were fed one powdery sodium butyrate (PSB) diet (1000.0 mg kg(-1) diet) and five graded levels of microencapsulated sodium butyrate (MSB) diets: 0.0 (control), 500.0, 1000.0, 1500.0 and 2000.0 mg kg(-1) diet for 60 days. Subsequently, a challenge test was conducted by injection of Aeromonas hydrophila to explore the effect of SB supplementation on intestinal physical barrier function and the potential mechanisms in fish. The results showed that optimal SB supplementation: (1) down-regulated the cysteine-aspartic protease-2 (caspase-2), caspase-3 (rather than PI), caspase-7, caspase-8 (rather than PI), caspase-9, fatty acid synthetase ligand (FasL), apoptotic protease activating factor-1 (Apaf-1), B-cell lymphoma 2 associated X protein (Bax) and c-Jun Nterminal protein kinase (JNK) mRNA levels, up-regulated the B-cell lymphoma protein-2 (Bcl-2) (rather than PI), inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAP) and myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) mRNA levels in the intestine (P < 0.05), inhibited the intestinal cell apoptosis, maintained the intestine cell structure integrity; (2) increased NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) mRNA levels and nucleus protein levels, and down-regulated kelch-like-ECH-associated protein (Keap1b) (rather than Keap1a) mRNA levels in the intestine, up-regulated copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD), manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase 1a (GPx1a), GPx1b, GPx4a, GPx4b, glutathione S-transferases R (GSTR), GSTP1, GSTP2, GSTO1, GSTO2 and glutathione reductase (GR) mRNA levels in the intestine, increased the corresponding antioxidant enzymes activity (P < 0.05), thus enhancing the ability of scavenging free radicals and decreasing the reactive oxygen species (ROS) content, decreasing the lipid and protein peroxidation, as well as alleviating oxidative damage; (3) down-regulated the molecule myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK) mRNA levels in the intestine, and up-regulated the occludin, zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), ZO-2, claudin-b, claudin-c, claudin-f, claudin-3c (rather than PI), claudin-7a, claudin-7b and claudin-11 mRNA levels, down-regulated claudin-12, claudin-15a and claudin-15b mRNA levels (P < 0.05), thus maintaining the structural integrity between cells. This study suggests that SB supplementation could improve fish intestinal physical barrier function. Furthermore, according to the positive effect, MSB was superior to PSB on improving intestinal physical barrier function of fish.

STUDY DESIGN: We retrospectively studied the treatment of 204 consecutive patients with MRONJ, seen between January 2010 and May 2016, to identify those associated with TT. RESULTS: We detected 7 cases of MRONJ associated with TT (3.4%). Four patients received TT only, whereas 3 were concomitantly treated with bisphosphonates (n = 3) and/or denosumab (n = 3). The TT regimens included sunitinib (Sutent) (n = 1), everolimus (Afinitor) (n = 1), erlotinib (Tarceva) (n = 1), bevacizumab (Avastin) (n = 3), dasatinib (Sprycel) (n = 1) and imatinib (Glivec) (n = 1). The MRONJ stage included stages 1 and 2, and mean score on the visual analogue scale for pain in the jaw was 4.0. CONCLUSIONS: Health care providers should be aware of the possibility of MRONJ associated with the TT agents sunitinib, everolimus, and dasatinib and uncommon cancer types, including renal cell carcinoma, non-small-cell lung cancer, glioblastoma, and leukemia, where MRONJ may also occur.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

PUR genes with a single copy of this domain have been detected so far in spirochetes and bacteroides. Lower eukaryotes possess one copy of the PUR gene, whereas chordates possess 1 to 4 PUR family members. Human PUR genes encode Pur-alpha (Pura), Pur-beta (Purb) and two forms of Pur-gamma (Purg). Pur-alpha is a protein that binds specific DNA and RNA sequence elements. Human PURA, located at chromosome band 5q31, is under complex control of three promoters. The entire protein coding sequence of PURA is contiguous within a single exon. Several studies have found that overexpression or microinjection of Pura inhibits anchorage-independent growth of oncogenically transformed cells and blocks proliferation at either G1-S or G2-M checkpoints. Effects on the cell cycle may be mediated by interaction of Pura with cellular proteins including Cyclin/Cdk complexes and the Rb tumor suppressor protein. PURA knockout mice die shortly after birth with effects on brain and hematopoietic development. In humans environmentally induced heterozygous deletions of PURA have been implicated in forms of myelodysplastic syndrome and progression to acute myelogenous leukemia. Pura plays a role in AIDS through association with the HIV-1 protein, Tat. In the brain Tat and Pura association in glial cells activates transcription and replication of JC polyomavirus, the agent causing the demyelination disease, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Tat and Pura also act to stimulate replication of the HIV-1 RNA genome. In neurons Pura accompanies mRNA transcripts to sites of translation in dendrites. Microdeletions in the PURA locus have been implicated in several neurological disorders. De novo PURA mutations have been related to a spectrum of phenotypes indicating a potential PURA syndrome. The nucleic acid, G-rich Pura binding element is amplified as expanded polynucleotide repeats in several brain diseases including fragile X syndrome and a familial form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/fronto-temporal dementia. Throughout evolution the Pura protein plays a critical role in survival, based on conservation of its nucleic acid binding properties. These Pura properties have been adapted in higher organisms to the as yet unfathomable development of the human brain.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We report a case of a chronic and refractory HSV infection revealing chronic lymphoid leukaemia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: An 85-year-old woman with an 8-month history of chronic perineal ulcerations was referred to our dermatology department. She had no previous medical history of herpes infection. Skin biopsies ruled out carcinoma but were consistent with HSV infection. A local swab was positive for HSV2. Treatment with valaciclovir and intravenous acyclovir (ACV) at the recommended doses was ineffective. Laboratory tests revealed type-B chronic lymphoid leukaemia. Molecular biology studies confirmed the presence of ACV-resistant HSV via decreased thymidine kinase activity (stop codon: M183stop). Foscarnet was administered for a period of 3 weeks with almost complete healing of the ulcerations. Treatment was stopped prematurely due to acute renal insufficiency and the remaining lesions were treated using imiquimod cream. Valaciclovir was prescribed to prevent further episodes. The condition recurred a mere 11 months later. DISCUSSION: The prevalence of ACV-resistant HSV is 0.32 % in immunocompetent patients and 3.5 % in immunocompromised patients. Insufficient dosing regimens or prolonged treatment with TK inhibitors result in the local selection of pre-existing mutant HSV viruses. Foscarnet, a DNA polymerase inhibitor, is the treatment of choice in HSV-resistant infections. ACV-resistant HSV is less virulent and replicates less, with reactivations being mainly due to wild-type HSV latent in the neural ganglia. Valaciclovir can be used as a preventive treatment. To our knowledge, this is the first case of ACV-resistant HSV infection revealing chronic lymphoid leukaemia. CONCLUSION: Chronic perineal ulcerations can be the first manifestation of immunodeficiency seen for example with haematological diseases. In the event of clinical resistance of an HSV infection to recommended thymidine kinase inhibitor regimens, the use of foscarnet should be considered.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

OBJECTIVES: To describe urban-rural disparity in UGIC and to emphasize prevention by socioeconomic development and urbanization in China. METHODS: Age-standardized incidence rates (ASRs) of cancers in 2012 were compared between urban Shijiazhuang city and rural Shexian County, and trends from 2000-2015 in Shexian County were analyzed. FINDINGS: Compared with urban Shijiazhuang city, the ASR of gastroesophageal cancers in rural Shexian County was 5.3 times higher in men (234.1 vs 44.2/100,000, P < .01) and 9.1 times higher in women (107.7 vs 11.8/100,000, P < .01). This rural-urban disparity in UGIC is associated with differences in socioeconomic development in annual gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of US$2700 vs US$6965, in urbanization rate of 48% vs 100%, and in adult Helicobacter pylori infection prevalence of 75% vs 50%. From 2000-2015, the GDP per capita in Shexian County increased from US$860 to US$3000, urbanization rate increased from 22.4% to 54.8%, and prevalence of H pylori infection among 3- to 10-year-old children decreased from 60% to 46.1% (P < .01). Meanwhile, the biennial ASR of esophagogastric cancer decreased 42% in men, from 313.5 to 182.1 per 100,000 (P < .01), and 57% in women, from 188.6 to 80.4 per 100,000 (P = .00). However, lung, colorectal, and gallbladder cancers and leukemia in both sexes and breast, ovary, thyroid, and kidney cancer in women increased significantly. Despite this offset, ASR of all cancers combined decreased 25% in men (from 378.2 to 283.0/100,000, P = .00) and 19% in women (from 238.5 to 193.6/100,000, P = .00). CONCLUSIONS: Urban-rural disparity in UGIC is related to inequity in socioeconomic development. Economic growth and urbanization is effective for prevention in endemic regions in China and should be a policy priority.","['Copyright (c) 2017 Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.

For many years the role of HTLV-1 in the pathogenesis of MF/SS has been hotly debated. In this study we analyzed CTCL vs. HTLV-1(+) leukemic cells. We performed G-banding/spectral karyotyping, extensive gene expression analysis, TP53 sequencing in the 11 patient-derived HTLV-1(+) (MJ and Hut102) vs. HTLV-1(-) (Myla, Mac2a, PB2B, HH, H9, Hut78, SZ4, Sez4 and SeAx) CTCL cell lines. We further tested drug sensitivities to commonly used CTCL therapies and studied the ability of these cells to produce subcutaneous xenograft tumors in NOD.Cg-Prkdc(scid) Il2rg(tm1Wjl)/SzJ mice. Our work demonstrates that unlike classic advanced MF/SS cells that acquire many ongoing balanced and unbalanced chromosomal translocations, HTLV-1(+) CTCL leukemia cells are diploid and exhibit only a minimal number of non-specific chromosomal alterations. Our results indicate that HTLV-1 virus is likely not involved in the pathogenesis of classic MF/SS since it drives a very different pathway of lymphomagenesis based on our findings in these cells. This study also provides for the first time a comprehensive characterization of the CTCL cells with respect to gene expression profiling, TP53 mutation status, ability to produce tumors in mice and response to commonly used therapies.",,"['Netchiporouk, Elena', 'Gantchev, Jennifer', 'Tsang, Matthew', 'Thibault, Philippe', 'Watters, Andrew K', 'Hughes, John-Douglas Matthew', 'Ghazawi, Feras M', 'Woetmann, Anders', 'Odum, Niels', 'Sasseville, Denis', 'Litvinov, Ivan V']","['Netchiporouk E', 'Gantchev J', 'Tsang M', 'Thibault P', 'Watters AK', 'Hughes JM', 'Ghazawi FM', 'Woetmann A', 'Odum N', 'Sasseville D', 'Litvinov IV']","['Division of Dermatology, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Division of Dermatology, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Division of Dermatology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.', 'Universite de Sherbrooke Rnomics Platform, Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Division of Dermatology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.', 'Division of Dermatology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of International Health, Immunology, and Microbiology, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of International Health, Immunology, and Microbiology, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Division of Dermatology, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Division of Dermatology, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Division of Dermatology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],20171007,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,,,,PMC5707075,,2017/12/10 06:00,2017/12/10 06:01,['2017/12/10 06:00'],"['2017/07/20 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/10 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.21619 [doi]', '21619 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Oct 7;8(56):95981-95998. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.21619. eCollection 2017 Nov 10.,,['NOTNLM'],"['cutaneous T-cell lymphomas', 'gene expression analysis', 'human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1', 'spectral karyotyping', 'xenograft tumors']",,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare no competing financial interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The functional analysis of these mutations is often carried out through in silico predictions, with further downstream experimental validation rarely performed. Here, we examine the potential of using mass spectrometry-based proteomics data to further annotate the function of SNVs in cancer samples. RNA-seq and whole genome sequencing (WGS) data from Jurkat cells were used to construct a custom database of single amino acid variant (SAAV) containing peptides and identified over 1,000 such peptides in two Jurkat proteomics datasets. The analysis enabled the detection of a truncated form of splicing regulator YTHDC1 at the protein level. To extend the functional annotation further, a Jurkat phosphoproteomics dataset was analysed, identifying 463 SAAV containing phosphopeptides. Of these phosphopeptides, 24 SAAVs were found to directly impact the phosphorylation event through the creation of either a phosphorylation site or a kinase recognition motif. We identified a novel phosphorylation site created by a SAAV in splicing factor SF3B1, a protein that is frequently mutated in leukaemia. To our knowledge, this is the first study to use phosphoproteomics data to directly identify novel phosphorylation events arising from the creation of phosphorylation sites by SAAVs. Our study reveals multiple functional mutations impacting the splicing pathway in Jurkat cells and demonstrates potential benefits of an integrative proteogenomics analysis for high-throughput functional annotation of SNVs in cancer.",,"['Ma, Shiyong', 'Menon, Ranjeeta', 'Poulos, Rebecca C', 'Wong, Jason W H']","['Ma S', 'Menon R', 'Poulos RC', 'Wong JWH']","['Prince of Wales Clinical School, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, Australia.', 'Prince of Wales Clinical School, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, Australia.', 'Present address: Centre for Research Excellence in Tuberculosis and the Marie Bashir Institute for Infectious Diseases and Biosecurity, The University of Sydney and Centre for Infectious Diseases and Microbiology - Public Health, Westmead Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Prince of Wales Clinical School, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, Australia.', 'Prince of Wales Clinical School, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, Australia.']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],20170927,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,,,,PMC5707065,,2017/12/10 06:00,2017/12/10 06:01,['2017/12/10 06:00'],"['2017/03/03 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/10 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.21339 [doi]', '21339 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Sep 27;8(56):95841-95852. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.21339. eCollection 2017 Nov 10.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Jurkat', 'Proteogenomics', 'RNA-seq', 'phosphoproteomics', 'splicing factor mutation']",,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare no competing financial interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hydroquinone (HQ), as one of the metabolites of benzene, was closely relevant to occupational benzene poisoning and occupational leukemia. Using high-throughput sequencing technology, we investigated differences in lncRNA and mRNA expression profiles between experimental group (HQ 20 mumol/L) and control group (PBS). Compared to control group, a total of 65 lncRNAs and 186 mRNAs were previously identified to be aberrantly expressed more than two fold change in experimental group. To validate the sequencing results, we selected 10 lncRNAs and 10 mRNAs for quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Through GO annotation and KEGG pathway analysis, we obtained 3 mainly signaling pathways, including P53 signaling pathway, which plays an important role in tumorigenesis and progression.

NPM1 encodes three main alternatively spliced isoforms R1(B23.1), R2(B23.2), and R3(B23.3). The expression of splice variants R1, R2 and R3 were higher in AML patients compared to normal cells of healthy volunteers (HVs), although RNA-seq analysis revealed enhanced R2 expression also in less differentiated cells of HVs as well as in AML cells. The variant R2, which lacks exons 11 and 12 coding for the nucleolar localization domain, might behave similar to the mutant form of NPM1 (NPM1mut). In accordance, in CN-AML high R2 expression was associated with favorable impact on outcome. Moreover, functional studies showed nucleolar localization of the eGFP-NPM1 wildtype and cytoplasmic localization of the eGFP-NPM1 mut protein. While the eGFP-NPM1 R2 splice variant localized predominantly in the nucleoplasm, we also could detect cytoplasmic expression for the R2 variant.

Among eight protein-coding genes, this microdeletion affects the protein phosphatase 4 regulatory subunit 2 (PPP4R2), which plays an important role in DNA damage response (DDR). Investigation of mRNA expression during murine myelopoiesis determined that Ppp4r2 is higher expressed in more primitive hematopoietic cells. PPP4R2 expression in primary AML samples compared to healthy bone marrow was significantly lower, particularly in patients with 3p microdeletion or complex karyotype. To identify a functional role of PPP4R2 in hematopoiesis and leukemia, we genetically inactivated Ppp4r2 by RNAi in murine hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and murine myeloid leukemia. Furthermore, we ectopically expressed PPP4R2 in a deficient human myeloid leukemic cell line. While PPP4R2 is involved in DDR of both hematopoietic and leukemic cells, our findings indicate that PPP4R2 deficiency impairs de-phosphorylation of phosphorylated key DDR proteins KRAB-domain associated protein 1 (pKAP1), histone variant H2AX (gammaH2AX), tumor protein P53 (pP53), and replication protein A2 (pRPA2). Potential impact of affected DNA repair processes in primary AML cases with regard to differential PPP4R2 expression or 3p microdeletion is also supported by our results obtained by gene expression profiling and whole exome sequencing. Impaired DDR and increased DNA damage by PPP4R2 suppression is one possible mechanism by which the 3p microdeletion may contribute to the pathogenesis of AML.

The study aim was to assess the diagnostic value of the quantitative assessment of a panel of 18 markers and to identify the most informative ones. METHODS: The immunophenotype of the neoplastic population was determined in diagnostic specimens from 188 patients. BD FACSCanto II flow cytometer and FACSDiva software were used to analyze the positivity/negativity and mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of the surface expression of 18 markers. Advanced data mining methods were used to define the key differential diagnostic features of CLL/SLL (chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma), MCL (mantle cell lymphoma), and CD5+ MZL (marginal zone lymphoma). RESULTS: The most informative markers for the distinction of CLL/SLL, MCL, CD5+ MZL, including atypical cases, were the MFI values of CD79b, CD20, CD23, CD43, CD38, CD11c, FMC7, CD200, kappa light chain, and their combinations. CD23 and CD200 were the most discriminant between CLL/SLL and MCL and CD23 plus CD79b between CLL/SLL and CD5+ MZL. The quantitative analysis of the most informative markers failed to accurately distinguish MCL and CD5+ MZL. The study highlights the data mining methods for the analysis and selection of the most informative immunophenotypic markers and for the design of a predictive model (diagnostic classifier), minimizing the subjectivity of expert-based assessment. CONCLUSIONS: Our data confirmed that the quantification of the expression of informative markers increases the diagnostic value of immunophenotyping in mature CD5+ B-cell neoplasms.

Cytostatic resistance and metastasis formation are significant risk factors in BC therapy; therefore, there is great interest in overcoming drug resistance and in initiating research for novel chemotherapeutic approaches. Here, we suggest that desethylamiodarone (DEA)-a metabolite of amiodarone-may have cytostatic potential. DEA activates the collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential (detected by JC-1 fluorescence), and induces cell death in T24 human transitional-cell bladder carcinoma cell line at physiologically achievable concentrations. DEA induces cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase, which may contribute to the inhibition of cell proliferation, and shifts the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio to initiate apoptosis, induce AIF nuclear translocation, and activate PARP-1 cleavage and caspase-3 activation. The major cytoprotective kinases-ERK and Akt-are inhibited by DEA, which may contribute to its cell death-inducing effects. DEA also inhibits the expression of B-cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus integration site 1 (BMI1) and reduces colony formation of T24 bladder carcinoma cells, indicating its possible inhibitory effect on metastatic potential. These data show that DEA is a novel anti-cancer candidate of multiple cell death-inducing effects and metastatic potential.

To determine whether lncRNAs are involved in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we analyzed the expression profile of lncRNAs and mRNAs in AML. Five pairs of AML patients and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) controls were screened by microarray. Through coexpression analysis, differently expressed transcripts were divided into modules, and lncRNAs were functionally annotated. We further analyzed the clinical significance of crucial lncRNAs from modules in public data. Finally, the expression of three lncRNAs, RP11-222K16.2, AC092580.4, and RP11-305O.6, were validated in newly diagnosed AML, AML relapse, and IDA patient groups by quantitative RT-PCR, which may be associated with AML patients' overall survival. Further analysis showed that RP11-222K16.2 might affect the differentiation of natural killer cells, and promote the immunized evasion of AML by regulating Eomesodermin expression. Analysis of this study revealed that dysregulated lncRNAs and mRNAs in AML vs IDA controls could affect the immune system and hematopoietic cell differentiation. The biological functions of those lncRNAs need to be further validated.","['(c) 2017 The Authors.

In this study we investigated the relationship between C1206-induced inhibition of Hsp90 and its anti-leukemic effects. The fluorescence quenching experiments showed that C1206 seemed to bind the middle dimerization domain of Hsp90. The interaction between C1206 and Hsp90 was driven mainly by electrostatic interaction. In in vitro enzyme activity assay, C1206 dose-dependently inhibited Hsp90 ATPase activity with an IC50 value of 4.17 mumol/L. In both imatinib-sensitive K562 chronic myeloid leukemia cells and imatinib-resistant K562/G01 chronic myeloid leukemia cells, C1206 (0.4-3.2 mumol/L) dose-dependently caused the degradation of Hsp90 client proteins and downstream proteins (AKT, MEK, ERK, C-RAF, P-AKT, P-MEK and P-ERK). Furthermore, C1206 (0.4-3.2 mumol/L) dose-dependently induced apoptosis of K562 and K562/G01 cells through triggering mitochondrial pathway. Consistent with this result, C1206 inhibited the proliferation of K562 and K562/G01 cells with IC50 values of 1.10 and 0.60 mumol/L, respectively.

IAP and SUM-IAP hydrolyze spontaneously to the corresponding I-aldophosphamide derivatives. They differ in the chemical structure of the alkylating moiety, whereas IAP has two chlorethyl groups in the SUM-IAP molecule, one chlorethyl group is substituted by a mesylethyl group. With both substances, cytotoxicity studies on P388 tumor cells in vitro and therapy experiments in mice bearing advanced growing P388 tumors were carried out. IAP was significantly more cytotoxic in-vitro than SUM-IAP, but the antitumor activity of SUM-IAP was by order of magnitude higher than the antitumor activity of IAP. The reason for these findings is discussed with respect to the enzymatic cleavage of the various I-aldophosphamide derivatives to the corresponding isophosphoramide mustards and 3-hydroxypropanal.

Two of these patients represented with germ cell malignancies. One patient had Wilms' tumor. To our knowledge, these are the first reports of coincidence of these two cancers with CD in children. From the remaining two patients, one was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and the other with astrocytoma. The diagnosis of malignancy preceded CD diagnosis in all the patients (mean ages of cancer and CD diagnosis of 1.8 and 5.4 years old, respectively). Whether malignancy can promote immune deregulation and predispose to CD is uncertain. On the other hand, undiagnosed celiac may be a risk factor for cancer.

Although TET2 mutation has been disclosed in a variety of hematopoietic malignancies, the prognostic implication of TET2 expression in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains largely elusive. In this study, real-time quantitative PCR was carried out to detect the level of TET2 transcript in 134 de novo AML patients and 35 healthy donors. TET2 mRNA level was significantly down-regulated in AML patients compared with controls (p = 0.010). Among the French-American-British (FAB) subtypes, the incidence of TET2 under-expression in M0/M1 subtypes was significantly higher than in the other subtypes M2/M3/M4/M5/M6 (p = 0.017), and also markedly higher than in the other granulocyte subtypes M2/M3 (p = 0.005). TET2 low-expressed patients showed a significantly higher frequency of NPM1 mutations than TET2 high-expressed patients. Although there was no significant difference in complete remission rate between two groups (low and high TET2 expression), patients with low TET2 expression had markedly shorter overall survival (OS) in both non-M3 and cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML) (p = 0.016 and 0.044, respectively). Furthermore, multivariate analysis confirmed the prognostic value of TET2 expression on OS among CN-AML patients (p = 0.049). Importantly, TET2 expression in complete remission (CR) time was significantly higher than newly diagnosis time (p = 0.001), and was returned to lower level when in relapse time (p < 0.001). These findings indicated that down-regulation of TET2 expression was a common event and acted as a prognostic and predictive biomarker in CN-AML patients.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Zhang, Ting-Juan', 'Zhou, Jing-Dong', 'Yang, Dong-Qin', 'Wang, Yu-Xin', 'Wen, Xiang-Mei', 'Guo, Hong', 'Yang, Lei', 'Lian, Xin-Yue', 'Lin, Jiang', 'Qian, Jun']","['Zhang TJ', 'Zhou JD', 'Yang DQ', 'Wang YX', 'Wen XM', 'Guo H', 'Yang L', 'Lian XY', 'Lin J', 'Qian J']","[""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""School of Medicine, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""School of Medicine, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""School of Medicine, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""School of Medicine, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""School of Medicine, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180227,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Dioxygenases)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (TET2 protein, human)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Child', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Dioxygenases', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Young Adult']",,,2017/12/09 06:00,2019/09/27 06:00,['2017/12/09 06:00'],"['2017/09/19 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/27 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.26373 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2018 Aug;233(8):5838-5846. doi: 10.1002/jcp.26373.

VEN treatment combinations in R/R AML have not been previously reported. METHODS: All R/R myeloid patients (including AML, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN)) treated with VEN combinations in the salvage setting were reviewed. RESULTS: Forty-three patients with median age 68 (range, 25-83) were treated for AML (91%), MDS (5%), or BPDCN (5%). Most (n = 36, 84%) were >/= salvage-2 treatment status, including prior hypomethylating agent (HMA) in 77%. In combination with VEN, most patients received HMA therapy (n = 31, 72%); eight (19%) received low-dose cytarabine (LDAC). Patients received a median of 2 treatment cycles (range, 1-4). Objective response was observed in 9 (21%) patients, including 2 complete responses (CR), 3 CRi, and 4 morphologic leukemia-free state (MLFS). Median survival was 3.0 months (range, 0.5-8.0), and estimated 6-month survival was 24%. Responses were observed in five (24%) of 21 patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics, 3 (27%) of 11 IDH1/2-mutant, and 4 (50%) of 8 RUNX1-mutated patients. Two (20%) of 10 TP53-mutated patients responded; both had concurrent RUNX1 mutations. Of the 3 (15%) responding patients with adverse cytogenetics, all had concurrent RUNX1 mutations. CONCLUSION: Low-intensity chemotherapy, including HMAs or LDAC, in combination with VEN is a viable salvage option, even in multiply relapsed/refractory patients with AML, MDS, and BPDCN.

Limited detailed data from Children's Oncology Group (COG) regimens has been previously reported to enable identification of patient and treatment risk factors for these toxicities and their impact on outcomes. PROCEDURE: We analyzed a retrospective pediatric ALL cohort treated at a single institution according to COG regimens from 2008 to 2015. The primary endpoint was cumulative incidence of study-defined ""severe"" hepatotoxicity (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] Grade >/= 4 transaminitis or Grade >/= 3 hyperbilirubinemia) and clinically significant pancreatitis (any grade). Pancreatitis was additionally classified using the Ponte di Legno (PdL) toxicity criteria. Secondary endpoints were chemotherapy interruptions, early disease response (end of induction [EOI] minimal residual disease [MRD]), and event-free survival (EFS). RESULTS: We identified 262 patients, of whom 71 (27%) and 28 (11%) developed hepatotoxicity and pancreatitis, respectively. Three cases of pancreatitis did not fulfill PdL criteria despite otherwise consistent presentations. Both TRTs occurred throughout therapy, but approximately 25% of hepatotoxicity (18/71) and pancreatitis (8/28) occurred during induction alone. Both obesity and age (>/=10 years) were identified as predictors of hepatotoxicity (subdistribution hazard ratio [SHR] obesity = 1.75, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.04-2.96; SHR age >/=10 = 1.9, 95% CI 1.19-3.10) and pancreatitis (SHR obesity = 2.18, 95% CI 1.01-4.67; SHR age >/= 10 = 2.76, 95% CI 1.19-6.39, P = 0.018). Dose interruptions were common but neither toxicity influenced EOI MRD nor EFS. CONCLUSIONS: Obese and/or older children are particularly at risk for hepatotoxicity and pancreatitis, and may benefit from toxicity surveillance and chemoprotective strategies to prevent or mitigate associated morbidity.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Denton, Christopher C', 'Rawlins, Yasmin A', 'Oberley, Matthew J', 'Bhojwani, Deepa', 'Orgel, Etan']","['Denton CC', 'Rawlins YA', 'Oberley MJ', 'Bhojwani D', 'Orgel E']","[""Division of Hematology, Oncology, & BMT, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California."", 'College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York.', ""Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California."", 'Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.', ""Division of Hematology, Oncology, & BMT, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California."", 'Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.', ""Division of Hematology, Oncology, & BMT, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California."", 'Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.']",['eng'],,['P30 CA014089/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],20171208,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Obesity/epidemiology', 'Pancreatitis/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Young Adult']",PMC7522002,['NIHMS1621027'],2017/12/09 06:00,2019/03/26 06:00,['2017/12/09 06:00'],"['2017/08/11 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/12 00:00 [revised]', '2017/10/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/26 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.26891 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2018 Mar;65(3). doi: 10.1002/pbc.26891.

In this article, we investigate healthcare professionals' (HCP) views of teenagers' involvement in decisions about their care and treatment for leukaemia. METHODS: We conducted participant observation at 98 multi-disciplinary meetings and 95 open-ended, semi-structured interviews and informal conversations with clinical teenage cancer teams at one UK tertiary referral centre. Data were collected over a 9-month period, audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using principles of grounded theory. RESULTS: HCP revealed principles relating to the involvement of teenagers with leukaemia in decision making: (1) do the 'right thing', (2) act on the care and treatment preferences of the teenager and (3) openly disclose information about the teenagers' condition. These principles were prioritised and utilised uniquely in each situation, reliant on three mediating factors: (1) family communication styles, (2) stage of illness and (3) nature of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: Specialist haematology teams are aware of the individual, and shifting and situational preferences of teenagers. They follow the lead which teenagers give them with regard to these preferences. If actual practice with regard to the involvement of teenagers is found to be wanting, this study refutes that this should be ascribed to insensitivity on the part of HCP about teenagers informational and decisional role preferences.","['(c) 2017 The Authors.

In this study, we found that therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) decreased the percentage of granulocytic MDSC, but only patients treated with dasatinib showed a significant reduction in the monocytic subset (M-MDSC). Moreover, a positive correlation was observed between number of persistent M-MDSC and the value of major molecular response in dasatinib-treated patients. Serum and exosomes from patients with CML induced conversion of monocytes from healthy volunteers into immunosuppressive M-MDSC, suggesting a bidirectional crosstalk between CML cells and MDSC. Overall, we identified M-MDSC as prognostic factors in patients treated with dasatinib. It might be of interest to understand whether MDSC may be a candidate predictive markers of relapse risk following TKI discontinuation, suggesting their potential significance as practice of precision medicine.","['(c) 2017 The Authors.

Multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC), tracking leukemia-associated immunophenotypic patterns, has been shown in several studies to be a useful tool to investigate MRD. Here, we report a multicenter prospective study which allowed to define a harmonized analysis strategy, as well as the efficacy of MFC MRD to predict outcome. This study included 276 patients, in 10 different MFC centers, of whom 268 had at least 1 MRD check point. The combination of a CD45, CD34, and CD33 backbone, with the addition of CD117, CD13, CD7, and CD15 in 2 five-color tubes allowed to define each patient's multiparameter immunophenotypic characteristics at diagnosis, according to a Boolean combination of gates. The same individual diagnosis gating strategy was then applied at each MRD time point for each patient. MRD levels were stratified according to log by log thresholds, from 5 x 10(-2) (the classical morphological threshold to define remission) down to <5 x 10(-5) . MRD was found to be constantly negative (<5 x 10(-5) ) for 148 patients. Survival analyses significantly associated MRD negativity with a good prognosis and any positive value with poorer outcome. All P values were <0.0001 both for disease-free and overall survival at the earliest time point (post-induction, MRD1) as well as when considering all time points together. Finally, MRD levels were independent of cytogenetics and allowed in fact to further stratify all cytogenetics risk groups. In summary, this multicenter study demonstrates that a simple combination of immunophenotypic markers successfully allows for the detection of MRD in acute myeloblastic leukemia patients, with a strong correlation to outcome.","['Copyright (c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['Lacombe, Francis', 'Campos, Lydia', 'Allou, Kaoutar', 'Arnoulet, Christine', 'Delabarthe, Adrienne', 'Dumezy, Florent', 'Feuillard, Jean', 'Genevieve, Franck', 'Guerin, Estelle', 'Guy, Julien', 'Jouault, Helene', 'Lepelley, Pascale', 'Maynadie, Marc', 'Solly, Francoise', 'Ballon, Orianne Wagner', 'Preudhomme, Claude', 'Baruchel, Andre', 'Dombret, Herve', 'Ifrah, Norbert', 'Bene, Marie C']","['Lacombe F', 'Campos L', 'Allou K', 'Arnoulet C', 'Delabarthe A', 'Dumezy F', 'Feuillard J', 'Genevieve F', 'Guerin E', 'Guy J', 'Jouault H', 'Lepelley P', 'Maynadie M', 'Solly F', 'Ballon OW', 'Preudhomme C', 'Baruchel A', 'Dombret H', 'Ifrah N', 'Bene MC']","['Hematology Biology, University Hospital, Bordeaux, France.', 'Hematology Biology, University Hospital, Saint Etienne, France.', 'Hematology Biology, University Hospital, Bordeaux, France.', 'Hematology Biology, Institut Paoli Calmettes, Marseilles, France.', 'Hematology Biology, Hopital Saint Louis, Paris, France.', 'Hematology Biology, University Hospital, Lille, France.', 'Hematology Biology, University Hospital, Limoges, France.', 'Hematology Biology, University Hospital, Angers, France.', 'Hematology Biology, University Hospital, Limoges, France.', 'Hematology Biology, University Hospital, Dijon, France.', 'Hematology Biology, University Hospital, Creteil, France.', 'Hematology Biology, University Hospital, Lille, France.', 'Hematology Biology, University Hospital, Dijon, France.', 'Hematology Biology, University Hospital, Saint Etienne, France.', 'Hematology Biology, University Hospital, Creteil, France.', 'Hematology Biology, University Hospital, Lille, France.', 'Hematology Department, Hopital Robert Debre, Paris, France.', 'Hematology Department, Hopital Saint Louis, Paris, France.', 'Hematology Department, University Hospital, Angers, France.', 'Hematology Biology, University Hospital, Nantes, France.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20171207,England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",,,2017/12/09 06:00,2018/05/01 06:00,['2017/12/09 06:00'],"['2017/08/21 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/13 00:00 [revised]', '2017/11/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/01 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.2488 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2018 Apr;36(2):422-428. doi: 10.1002/hon.2488.

Despite the development of new treatment options in the past decades, IFI remains a concern due to substantial morbidity and mortality in these patient populations. In addition, the increasing use of new immune modulating drugs in cancer therapy has opened an entirely new spectrum of at risk periods. Since the last edition of antifungal prophylaxis recommendations of the German Society for Haematology and Medical Oncology in 2014, seven clinical trials regarding antifungal prophylaxis in patients with haematological malignancies have been published, comprising 1227 patients. This update assesses the impact of this additional evidence and effective revisions. Our key recommendations are the following: prophylaxis should be performed with posaconazole delayed release tablets during remission induction chemotherapy for AML and MDS (AI). Posaconazole iv can be used when the oral route is contraindicated or not feasible. Intravenous liposomal amphotericin B did not significantly decrease IFI rates in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) patients during induction chemotherapy, and there is poor evidence to recommend it for prophylaxis in these patients (CI). Despite substantial risk of IFI, we cannot provide a stronger recommendation for these patients. There is poor evidence regarding voriconazole prophylaxis in patients with neutropenia (CII). Therapeutic drug monitoring TDM should be performed within 2 to 5 days of initiating voriconazole prophylaxis and should be repeated in case of suspicious adverse events or of dose changes of interacting drugs (BIItu). General TDM during posaconazole prophylaxis is not recommended (CIItu), but may be helpful in cases of clinical failure such as breakthrough IFI for verification of compliance or

Recently, a GRO, AS1411 has reached phase II clinical trials for acute myeloid leukemia and renal cell carcinoma. The antiproliferative activity of GROs has been associated with various protein targets; however the real mechanisms of action remain unclear. In this study, we showed evidence that antiproliferative activity of GROs (including AS1411) is mainly contributed by the cytotoxicity of their guanine-based degradation products, such as monophosphate deoxyguanosine (dGMP), deoxyguanosine (dG) and guanine. The GROs with lower nuclease resistance exhibited higher antiproliferative activity. Among nucleotides, nucleosides and nucleobases, only guanine-based compounds showed highly concentration-dependent cytotoxicity. Our results suggest that it is necessary to reconsider the cancer-selective antiproliferative activity of GROs. Since guanine-based compounds are endogenous substances in living organisms, systematic studies of the cytotoxicity of these compounds will provide new information for the understanding of certain diseases and offer useful information for drug design.",,"['Zhang, Nan', 'Bing, Tao', 'Liu, Xiangjun', 'Qi, Cui', 'Shen, Luyao', 'Wang, Linlin', 'Shangguan, Dihua']","['Zhang N', 'Bing T', 'Liu X', 'Qi C', 'Shen L', 'Wang L', 'Shangguan D']","['Beijing National Laboratory for Molecular Sciences , Key Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry for Living Biosystems , Institute of Chemistry , Chinese Academy of Sciences , Beijing , 100190 , China .

Sometimes the differential diagnosis between Felty syndrome and large granular lymphocyte leukemia is problematic. Recently, somatic STAT3 and STAT5B mutations were discovered in 30-40% of patients with large granular lymphocyte leukemia. Herein, we aimed to study whether these mutations can also be detected in Felty syndrome, which would imply the existence of a common pathogenic mechanism between these two disease entities. We collected samples and clinical information from 14 Felty syndrome patients who were monitored at the rheumatology outpatient clinic for Felty syndrome. Somatic STAT3 mutations were discovered in 43% (6/14) of Felty syndrome patients with deep amplicon sequencing targeting all STAT3 exons. Mutations were located in the SH2 domain of STAT3, which is a known mutational hotspot. No STAT5B mutations were found. In blood smears, overrepresentation of large granular lymphocytes was observed, and in the majority of cases the CD8(+) T-cell receptor repertoire was skewed when analyzed by flow cytometry. In bone marrow biopsies, an increased amount of phospho-STAT3 positive cells was discovered. Plasma cytokine profiling showed that ten of the 92 assayed cytokines were elevated both in Felty syndrome and large granular lymphocyte leukemia, and three of these cytokines were also increased in patients with uncomplicated rheumatoid arthritis. In conclusion, somatic STAT3 mutations and STAT3 activation are as frequent in Felty syndrome as they are in large granular lymphocyte leukemia.

Most cases are idiopathic; a subset is antibody-mediated. There is overlap between idiopathic cases and those with T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia, hypogammaglobulinemia, and low-grade lymphomas. In each of the aforementioned, the pathogenetic mechanisms may involve autoreactive cytotoxic responses. We selected 62 uniformly diagnosed pure red cell aplasia patients and analyzed their pathophysiologic features and responsiveness to rationally applied first-line and salvage therapies in order to propose diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms that may be helpful in guiding the management of prospective patients, 52% of whom were idiopathic, while the others involved large granular lymphocytic leukemia, thymoma, and B-cell dyscrasia. T-cell-mediated responses ranged between a continuum from polyclonal to monoclonal (as seen in large granular lymphocytic leukemia). During a median observation period of 40 months, patients received a median of two different therapies to achieve remission. Frequently used therapy included calcineurin-inhibitors with a steroid taper yielding a first-line overall response rate of 76% (53/70). Oral cyclophosphamide showed activity, albeit lower than that produced by cyclosporine. Intravenous immunoglobulins were effective both in parvovirus patients and in hypogammaglobulinemia cases. In salvage settings, alemtuzumab is active, particularly in large granular lymphocytic leukemia-associated cases. Other potentially useful salvage options include rituximab, anti-thymocyte globulin and bortezomib. The workup of acquired pure red cell aplasia should include investigations of common pathological associations. Most effective therapies are directed against T-cell-mediated immunity, and therapeutic choices need to account for associated conditions that may help in choosing alternative salvage agents, such as intravenous immunoglobulin, alemtuzumab and bortezomib.",['Copyright(c) 2018 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],"['Balasubramanian, Suresh Kumar', 'Sadaps, Meena', 'Thota, Swapna', 'Aly, Mai', 'Przychodzen, Bartlomiej P', 'Hirsch, Cassandra M', 'Visconte, Valeria', 'Radivoyevitch, Tomas', 'Maciejewski, Jaroslaw P']","['Balasubramanian SK', 'Sadaps M', 'Thota S', 'Aly M', 'Przychodzen BP', 'Hirsch CM', 'Visconte V', 'Radivoyevitch T', 'Maciejewski JP']","['Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, OH, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, OH, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, OH, USA.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, OH, USA.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, OH, USA.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, OH, USA.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, OH, USA.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, OH, USA.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, OH, USA maciejj@ccf.org.']",['eng'],,"['R01 HL128425/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL118281/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL123904/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'KL2 TR001413/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 HL135795/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171207,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunoglobulins, Intravenous)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alemtuzumab/therapeutic use', '*Algorithms', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bortezomib/therapeutic use', '*Disease Management', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins, Intravenous/therapeutic use', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Red-Cell Aplasia, Pure/*therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Salvage Therapy/*methods']",PMC5792266,,2017/12/09 06:00,2019/03/21 06:00,['2017/12/09 06:00'],"['2017/07/03 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/21 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2017.175810 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2017.175810 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2018 Feb;103(2):221-230. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2017.175810.

In this study, we report their long-term outcomes and correlations with mutational patterns of driver and non-driver mutations analyzed by targeted next generation sequencing. The median age at diagnosis was 66 years old, the median follow-up since starting pegylated interferon was 58 months. At the time of analysis, 30 (48.4%) patients were alive including 16 still being treated with pegylated interferon. The median survival of patients with intermediate and high-risk prognostic Lille and dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System scores treated with pegylated interferon was increased in comparison to that of historical cohorts. In addition, overall survival was significantly correlated with the duration of pegylated interferon therapy (70 versus 30 months after 2 years of treatment, P<10(-12)). JAK2(V617F) allele burden was decreased by more than 50% in 58.8% of patients and two patients even achieved complete molecular response. Next-generation sequencing analyses performed in 49 patients showed that 28 (57.1%) of them carried non-driver mutations. The presence of at least one additional mutation was associated with a reduction of both overall and leukemia-free survival. These findings in a large series of patients with myelofibrosis suggest that pegylated interferon therapy may provide a survival benefit for patients with intermediate- or high-risk Lille and dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System scores.

Here we describe a familial syndrome in seven patients from four unrelated pedigrees presenting with myelodysplastic syndrome and loss of chromosome 7/7q. Their median age at diagnosis was 2.1 years (range, 1-42). All patients presented with thrombocytopenia with or without additional cytopenias and a hypocellular marrow without an increase of blasts. Genomic studies identified constitutional mutations (p.H880Q, p.R986H, p.R986C and p.V1512M) in the SAMD9L gene on 7q21, with decreased allele frequency in hematopoiesis. The non-random loss of mutated SAMD9L alleles was attained via monosomy 7, deletion 7q, UPD7q, or acquired truncating SAMD9L variants p.R1188X and p.S1317RfsX21. Incomplete penetrance was noted in 30% (3/10) of mutation carriers. Long-term observation revealed divergent outcomes with either progression to leukemia and/or accumulation of driver mutations (n=2), persistent monosomy 7 (n=4), and transient monosomy 7 followed by spontaneous recovery with SAMD9L-wildtype UPD7q (n=2). Dysmorphic features or neurological symptoms were absent in our patients, pointing to the notion that myelodysplasia with monosomy 7 can be a sole manifestation of SAMD9L disease. Collectively, our results define a new subtype of familial myelodysplastic syndrome and provide an explanation for the phenomenon of transient monosomy 7.

Although multiple direct targets of miR-155 have been identified, it is not clear how it contributes to the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia. We found miR-155 to be a direct target of Meis1 in murine Hoxa9/Meis1 induced acute myeloid leukemia. The additional overexpression of miR-155 accelerated the formation of acute myeloid leukemia in Hoxa9 as well as in Hoxa9/Meis1 cells in vivo However, in the absence or following the removal of miR-155, leukemia onset and progression were unaffected. Although miR-155 accelerated growth and homing in addition to impairing differentiation, our data underscore the pathophysiological relevance of miR-155 as an accelerator rather than a driver of leukemogenesis. This further highlights the complexity of the oncogenic program of Meis1 to compensate for the loss of a potent oncogene such as miR-155.

It is fused to mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) in leukemia, and missense mutations have been identified in Wilms tumor and acute myeloid leukemia. Here we demonstrate that ENL overcomes polycomb silencing through recruitment of PAF1 via the conserved YEATS domain, which recognizes acetylated histone H3. PAF1 was responsible for antirepressive activities of ENL in vitro, and it determined the transforming potential of MLL-ENL.

Sorghum is a drought-resistant cereal with health promoting properties associated with its biologically active substances such as kafirin. Kafirin is an alcohol soluble protein and accounts for as much as 70% of the total proteins in sorghum. The objective was to determine the effect of kafirin on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation in THP-1 human macrophages. THP-1 human monocytic leukemia cells were differentiated into macrophages by phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate followed by treatment of LPS with or without 50 mug/mL or 100 mug/mL concentrations of kafirin. Kafirin at 100 mug/mL reduced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha by 28.3%, 74.0%, and 81.4%, respectively. Kafirin reduced production of intracellular reactive oxygen species is associated with reduced phosphorylation of extracellular regulated kinase1/2 and c-JUN N-terminal kinase and nuclear translocation of p65 and c-JUN transcription factors.

Gallic acid (GA), a polyhydroxyphenolic compound has biological functions including anti-proliferative properties. The aim of the present study was to investigate the growth inhibition effects of GA in combination with asparaginase (ASP), as a component of combination chemotherapy, in a lymphoblastic leukemia cell line. METHODS: Jurkat cells were incubated with different concentrations of GA with or without ASP. Proliferation inhibition was investigated using MTS test. The level of apoptosis alterations were evaluated using flow cytometry. The expression of Fas gene level and surface expression were investigated by quantitative real time PCR and flow cytometry respectively. RESULTS: GA at 50muM concentration and ASP at 0.5 IU/ml inhibited 50% cell proliferation in 48 hours. GA also increased the inhibitory effect of ASP and some combinations had synergistic results. The increase of cell apoptosis and Fas expression were observed in GA-treated cells compared to control. GA increased the effect of ASP on proliferation inhibition, induction of apoptosis and Fas expression. CONCLUSION: GA is an effective component in proliferation inhibition, apoptosis induction and enhancement of Fas expression level in Jurkat cell line. GA in some combination with ASP increases the effect of the latter on the cells. The study of the mechanism of these effects could be a further step towards target therapy. This study is a preliminary phase to the use of GA and should be carried out by more comprehensive study and animal models.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Moreover, aberrations in the apoptotic pathways are the main factor of leukemic cells drug resistance. METHODS: To assess the presence of potential abnormalities that might promote dysfunction of leukemic cells growth, HPLC system was used to determine sphingosine (SFO), sphinganine (SFA), sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and ceramide (CER) concentration in the blood collected from patients diagnose with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML; n = 49) and compare to values of control (healthily) group (n = 51). Additionally, in AML group concentration of SFO, SFA, S1P and CER was determined in bone marrow plasma and compared to respective values in blood plasma. The concentration of S1P and CER binding protein - plasma gelsolin (GSN) was also assessed in collected samples using immunoblotting assay. RESULTS: We observed that in AML patients the average SFO, SFA and CER concentration in blood plasma was significantly higher (p < 0.001) compare to control group, when blood plasma S1P concentration was significantly lower (p < 0.001). At the same time the CER/S1P ratio in AML patient (44.5 +/- 19.4) was about 54% higher compare to control group (20.9 +/- 13.1). Interestingly the average concentration of S1P in blood plasma (196 +/- 13 pmol/ml) was higher compare to its concentration in plasma collected from bone marrow (154 +/- 21 pmol/ml). CONCLUSIONS: We hypothesize that changes in profile of sphingolipids concentration and some of their binding protein partners such as GSN in extracellular environment of blood and bone marrow cells in leukemic patients can be targeted to develop new AML treatment method(s).",,"['Watek, Marzena', 'Durnas, Bonita', 'Wollny, Tomasz', 'Pasiarski, Marcin', 'Gozdz, Stanislaw', 'Marzec, Michal', 'Chabowska, Anna', 'Wolak, Przemyslaw', 'Zendzian-Piotrowska, Malgorzata', 'Bucki, Robert']","['Watek M', 'Durnas B', 'Wollny T', 'Pasiarski M', 'Gozdz S', 'Marzec M', 'Chabowska A', 'Wolak P', 'Zendzian-Piotrowska M', 'Bucki R']","['Department of Hematology, Holy Cross Oncology Center of Kielce, Artwinskiego 3, 25-734, Kielce, Poland.', 'Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences of the Jan Kochanowski University in Kielce, Kielce, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Holy Cross Oncology Center of Kielce, Artwinskiego 3, 25-734, Kielce, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Holy Cross Oncology Center of Kielce, Artwinskiego 3, 25-734, Kielce, Poland.', 'Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences of the Jan Kochanowski University in Kielce, Kielce, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Holy Cross Oncology Center of Kielce, Artwinskiego 3, 25-734, Kielce, Poland.', 'Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences of the Jan Kochanowski University in Kielce, Kielce, Poland.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Regional Blood Transfusion Center in Bialystok, 15-950, Bialystok, Poland.', 'Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences of the Jan Kochanowski University in Kielce, Kielce, Poland.', 'Department of Hygiene, Epidemiology and Ergonomics Department Medical University of Bialystok, 15-222, Bialystok, Poland.', 'Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences of the Jan Kochanowski University in Kielce, Kielce, Poland. buckirobert@gmail.com.', 'Department of Microbiological and Nanobiomedical Engineering, Medical University of Bialystok, 15-222, Bialystok, Poland. buckirobert@gmail.com.']",['eng'],,"['UMO-2015/17/B/NZ6/03473/NCN Poland', 'N/ST/ZB/16/003/1118/Uniwersytet Medyczny w Bialymstoku']",['Journal Article'],20171208,England,Lipids Health Dis,Lipids in health and disease,101147696,"['0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Gelsolin)', '0 (Lysophospholipids)', '26993-30-6 (sphingosine 1-phosphate)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)', 'OWA98U788S (safingol)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Ceramides/*blood', 'Female', 'Gelsolin/*blood', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/pathology', 'Lysophospholipids/*blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Sphingosine/*analogs & derivatives/*blood']",PMC5721620,,2017/12/09 06:00,2018/07/24 06:00,['2017/12/09 06:00'],"['2017/10/28 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12944-017-0624-1 [doi]', '10.1186/s12944-017-0624-1 [pii]']",epublish,Lipids Health Dis. 2017 Dec 8;16(1):235. doi: 10.1186/s12944-017-0624-1.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Ceramide', 'Hematological malignancies', 'Plasma gelsolin', 'S1P', 'Sphingolipids']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7664-9226'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using the zebrafish model, we tested the effects of one of the most common DNA methyltransferase (dnmt) inhibitor, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC), which is approved for the treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia and is under active investigation for the treatment of solid tumours. Several dose-response experiments were carried out during two periods, including not only the very first days of development (0-6 days post-fertilization, dpf), as done in previous studies, but also, and as a novelty, the period of gonadal development (10-30 dpf). RESULTS: Early treatment with 5-aza-dC altered embryonic development, delayed hatching and increased teratology and mortality, as expected. The most striking result, however, was an increase in the number of females, suggesting that alterations induced by 5-aza-dC treatment can affect sexual development as well. Results were confirmed when treatment coincided with gonadal development. In addition, we also found that the adult gonadal transcriptome of 5-aza-dC-exposed females included significant changes in the expression of key reproduction-related genes (e.g. cyp11a1, esr2b and figla), and that several pro-female-related pathways such as the Fanconi anaemia or the Wnt signalling pathways were downregulated. Furthermore, an overall inhibition of genes implicated in epigenetic regulatory mechanisms (e.g. dnmt1, dicer, cbx4) was also observed. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results indicate that treatment with a DNA methylation inhibitor can also alter the sexual development in zebrafish, with permanent alterations of the adult gonadal transcriptome, at least in females. Our results show the importance of DNA methylation for proper control of sexual development, open new avenues for the potential control of sex ratios in fish (aquaculture, population control) and call attention to possibly hidden long-term effects of dnmt therapy when used, for example, in the treatment of prepuberal children affected by some types of cancer.",,"['Ribas, Laia', 'Vanezis, Konstantinos', 'Imues, Marco Antonio', 'Piferrer, Francesc']","['Ribas L', 'Vanezis K', 'Imues MA', 'Piferrer F']","['Institut de Ciencies del Mar, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC), Passeig Maritim, 37-45, 08003, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Imperial Centre for Translational and Experimental Medicine, Hammersmith Hospital, Du Cane Road, London, W12 0NN, UK.', 'Departamento de Recursos Hidrobiologicos, Universidad de Narino, Torobajo, Pasto, Colombia.', 'Institut de Ciencies del Mar, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC), Passeig Maritim, 37-45, 08003, Barcelona, Spain. piferrer@icm.csic.es.']",['eng'],,"['AGL2013-41047-R/Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas/International', 'CDS2007-0002/Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas/International']",['Journal Article'],20171208,England,Epigenetics Chromatin,Epigenetics & chromatin,101471619,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DNA Modification Methylases)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Azacitidine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'DNA Modification Methylases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Decitabine', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Feminization/*chemically induced', 'Male', 'Ovary/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Sex Ratio', 'Transcriptome', 'Zebrafish/*embryology']",PMC5721477,,2017/12/09 06:00,2018/03/10 06:00,['2017/12/09 06:00'],"['2017/09/13 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13072-017-0168-7 [doi]', '10.1186/s13072-017-0168-7 [pii]']",epublish,Epigenetics Chromatin. 2017 Dec 8;10(1):59. doi: 10.1186/s13072-017-0168-7.,,['NOTNLM'],"['*5-Aza-dC', '*Epigenetic', '*Methylation', '*Reproduction', '*Sex ratio', '*Zebrafish', '*dnmt']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-5538-6236'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, with a finite culture expansion capacity, MSCs are inherently limited in their lifespan and use. We examined here the potential utility of an alternative, mesenchymal-like cell source, derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, termed induced mesenchymal progenitor cells (MiMPCs). We found that several genes were upregulated and proteins were produced in MiMPCs that matched those previously reported for MSCs. Like MSCs, the MiMPCs secreted various neurotrophic and neuroprotective factors, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), interleukin-6 (IL-6), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), osteopontin, and osteonectin, and promoted neurite outgrowth in chick embryonic dorsal root ganglia (DRG) cultures compared with control cultures. Cotreatment with a pharmacological Trk-receptor inhibitor did not result in significant decrease in MiMPC-induced neurite outgrowth, which was however inhibited upon Jak/STAT3 blockade. These findings suggest that the MiMPC induction of DRG neurite outgrowth is unlikely to be solely dependent on BDNF, but instead Jak/STAT3 activation by IL-6 and/or LIF is likely to be critical neurotrophic signaling pathways of the MiMPC secretome. Taken together, these findings suggest MiMPCs as a renewable, candidate source of therapeutic cells and a potential alternative to MSCs for peripheral nerve repair, in view of their ability to promote nerve growth by producing many of the same growth factors and cytokines as Schwann cells and signaling through critical neurotrophic pathways.

MDS occurs more frequently in older males and in individuals with prior exposure to cytotoxic therapy. DIAGNOSIS: Diagnosis of MDS is based on morphological evidence of dysplasia upon visual examination of a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy. Information obtained from additional studies such as karyotype, flow cytometry or molecular genetics is usually complementary and may help refine diagnosis. RISK-STRATIFICATION: Prognosis of patients with MDS can be calculated using a number of scoring systems. In general, all these scoring systems include analysis of peripheral cytopenias, percentage of blasts in the bone marrow and cytogenetic characteristics. The most commonly used system is probably the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS). IPSS is now replaced by the revised IPSS-R score. Although not systematically incorporated into new validated prognostic systems, somatic mutations can help define prognosis and should be considered as new prognostic factors. RISK-ADAPTED THERAPY: Therapy is selected based on risk, transfusion needs, percent of bone marrow blasts and cytogenetic and mutational profiles. Goals of therapy are different in lower risk patients than in higher risk. In lower risk, the goal is to decrease transfusion needs and transformation to higher risk disease or AML, as well as to improve survival. In higher risk, the goal is to prolong survival. Current available therapies include growth factor support, lenalidomide, hypomethylating agents, intensive chemotherapy and allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The use of lenalidomide has significant clinical activity in patients with lower risk disease, anemia and a chromosome 5 alteration. 5-azacitidine and decitabine have activity in both lower and higher-risk MDS. 5-azacitidine has been shown to improve survival in higher risk MDS. A number of new molecular lesions have been described in MDS that may serve as new therapeutic targets or aid in the selection of currently available agents. Additional supportive care measures may include the use of prophylactic antibiotics and iron chelation. MANAGEMENT OF PROGRESSIVE OR REFRACTORY DISEASE: At the present time there are no approved interventions for patients with progressive or refractory disease particularly after hypomethylating based therapy. Options include participation in a clinical trial or cytarabine based therapy and stem cell transplantation.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Montalban-Bravo, Guillermo', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo']","['Montalban-Bravo G', 'Garcia-Manero G']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],,,"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,IM,,"['History, 21st Century', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/pathology/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Risk']",,,2017/12/08 06:00,2017/12/19 06:00,['2017/12/08 06:00'],"['2017/10/02 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.24930 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2018 Jan;93(1):129-147. doi: 10.1002/ajh.24930.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We have therefore examined, using a series of sequential landmark analyses, relapse kinetics in a cohort of 2028 patients who received an allo-SCT for AML in CR1 and separately 570 patients treated with IC alone. RESULTS: In the first 3 months after allo-SCT, the factors associated with an increased risk of relapse included the presence of the FLT3-ITD (P < 0.001), patient age (P = 0.012), time interval from CR1 to transplant (P < 0.001) and donor type (P = 0.03). Relapse from 3 to 6 months was associated with a higher white cell count at diagnosis (P = 0.001), adverse-risk cytogenetics (P < 0.001), presence of FLT3-ITD mutation (P < 0.001) and time interval to achieve first complete remission (P = 0.013). Later relapse was associated with adverse cytogenetics, mutated NPM1, absence of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and the use of in vivo T-cell depletion. In patients treated with IC alone, the factors associated with relapse in the first 3 months were adverse-risk cytogenetics (P < 0.001) and FLT3-ITD status (P = 0.001). The factors predicting later relapse were the time interval from diagnosis to CR1 (P = 0.22) and time interval from CR1 to IC (P = 0.012). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Taken together, these data provide novel insights into the biology of disease recurrence after both allo-SCT and IC and have the potential to inform the design of novel maintenance strategies in both clinical settings.","['(c) 2017 The Authors.

Arsenic trioxide (ATO) has been shown to be a potent anticancer agent in various carcinomas, proving particularly effective in the clinical treatment of relapsed and refractory acute promyelocytic leukemia. However, its bioactivity and molecular mechanisms against HCC has not been fully studied. Using human HCC (HepG2) cells as a test model, we studied the effects of ATO and examined the role of oxidative stress (OS) and apoptosis in cytotoxicity. OS biomarkers showed a significant increase (p< 0.05) of malondialdehyde concentrations, and a gradual decrease of antioxidant enzymes (GPx & CAT) activities with increasing ATO doses. Flow cytometry data showed a dose dependent increase in annex in V positive cells and caspase 3 activities. These results were confirmed by data of the DNA laddering assay showing a clear evidence of nucleosomal DNA fragmentation, as well as data from Western blotting showing a significant modulation of specific apoptotic related proteins, including the activation of p53 and p21 expression and the down-regulation of Bcl-2 expression in ATO-treated cells. Taken together, our research demonstrates that ATO has a potential therapeutic effect against HCC, and its cytotoxicity may be mediated via oxidative stress and activation of the mitochondrial or intrinsic pathway of apoptosis.",,"['Dugo, Erika B', 'Yedjou, Clement G', 'Stevens, Jacqueline J', 'Tchounwou, Paul B']","['Dugo EB', 'Yedjou CG', 'Stevens JJ', 'Tchounwou PB']","['National Institutes of Health RCMI-Center for Environmental Health, Jackson State University, USA.', 'National Institutes of Health RCMI-Center for Environmental Health, Jackson State University, USA.', 'Department of Biology, College of Science, Engineering and Technology, Jackson State University, USA.', 'National Institutes of Health RCMI-Center for Environmental Health, Jackson State University, USA.', 'Department of Biology, College of Science, Engineering and Technology, Jackson State University, USA.', 'National Institutes of Health RCMI-Center for Environmental Health, Jackson State University, USA.']",['eng'],,['G12 MD007581/MD/NIMHD NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],20170104,United States,Ann Clin Pathol,Annals of clinical pathology,101700179,,,,,PMC5713642,['NIHMS849629'],2017/12/08 06:00,2017/12/08 06:01,['2017/12/08 06:00'],"['2017/12/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/08 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Ann Clin Pathol. 2017;5(1).

Then, consolidation therapy was initiated with azacitidine (AZA) administration, and treatment was carried out for vertebral osteomyelitis with several antibiotics in parallel, which together led to the successful treatment of vertebral osteomyelitis while maintaining a remission state of AML.

Lineage switches in leukemic cells are relatively rare events, which have been occasionally reported in congenital leukemia.

This lack of documentation may be attributable to extremely poor prognosis of these patients. We describe a case of a newborn female with initial diagnosis of MLL-AF4 positive B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia, who developed lineage switch to acute monocytic leukemia following the induction therapy. Although morphological remission was temporary, she received an HLA-haploidentical bone marrow transplant from her father with non-remission status because of an early relapse at the age of 4 months. Despite many difficulties such as graft-versus-host disease, growth impairment, and psychomotor retardation, she remained in remission for 3 years and 7 months after the transplant.

This study aimed to develop a simple method for determining plasma ponatinib concentration. The analysis required extraction of a 400-microL sample of plasma and precipitation of proteins using an Oasis HLB cartridge. Ponatinib and bosutinib, which is used as an internal standard, were separated by HPLC using a mobile phase of acetonitrile : 0.037 mol/L KH2PO4 (pH 4.5) (39 : 61, v/v) on a Capcell Pack C18 MG II (25x4.6 mm) monitored at 250 nm, with a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. This assay method was then used for determining plasma ponatinib concentration in a 42-year-old man treated with ponatinib at 15 mg/d. The calibration curve was found to be linear for the plasma concentration range of 5-250 ng/mL with a regression coefficient (r(2)) of 0.9999.

Despite encouraging results, some patients do not respond to current therapies. In part, this phenomenon has been associated with infusion of reduced numbers of early memory T cells. Herein, we report that AKT signaling inhibition is compatible with CAR and TCR retroviral transduction of human T cells while promoting a CD62L-expressing central memory phenotype. Critically, this intervention did not compromise cell yield. Mechanistically, disruption of AKT signaling preserved MAPK activation and promoted the intranuclear localization of FOXO1, a transcriptional regulator of T cell memory. Consequently, AKT signaling inhibition synchronized the transcriptional profile for FOXO1-dependent target genes across multiple donors. Expression of an AKT-resistant FOXO1 mutant phenocopied the influence of AKT signaling inhibition, while addition of AKT signaling inhibition to T cells expressing mutant FOXO1 failed to further augment the frequency of CD62L-expressing cells. Finally, treatment of established B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia was superior using anti-CD19 CAR-modified T cells transduced and expanded in the presence of an AKT inhibitor compared with conventionally grown T cells. Thus, inhibition of signaling along the PI3K/AKT axis represents a generalizable strategy to generate large numbers of receptor-modified T cells with an early memory phenotype and superior antitumor

To prevent the development of ATL among carriers, it is important to control HTLV-1-infected cells in infected individuals. Therefore, the establishment of novel therapies with drugs specifically targeting infected cells is urgently required. This study aimed to develop a potential therapy by generating recombinant vesicular stomatitis viruses (rVSVs) that lack an envelope glycoprotein G and instead encode an HTLV-1 receptor with human glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), neuropilin 1 (NRP1), or heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), including syndecan 1 (SDC1), designated VSVDeltaG-GL, VSVDeltaG-NP, or VSVDeltaG-SD, respectively. In an attempt to enhance the infectivity of rVSV against HTLV-1-infected cells, we also constructed rVSVs with a combination of two or three receptor genes, designated VSVDeltaG-GLN and VSVDeltaG-GLNS, respectively. The present study demonstrates VSVDeltaG-GL, VSVDeltaG-NP, VSVDeltaG-GLN, and VSVDeltaG-GLNS have tropism for HTLV-1 envelope (Env)-expressing cells. Notably, the inoculation of VSVDeltaG-GL or VSVDeltaG-NP significantly eliminated HTLV-1-infected cells under the culture conditions. Furthermore, in an HTLV-1-infected humanized mouse model, VSVDeltaG-NP was capable of efficiently preventing HTLV-1-induced leukocytosis in the periphery and eliminating HTLV-1-infected Env-expressing cells in the lymphoid tissues. In summary, an rVSV engineered to express HTLV-1 primary receptor, especially human NRP1, may represent a drug candidate that has potential for the development of unique virotherapy against HTLV-1 de novo infection.IMPORTANCE Although several anti-ATL therapies are currently available, ATL is still frequently resistant to therapeutic approaches, and its prognosis remains poor. Control of HTLV-1 de novo infection or expansion of HTLV-1-infected cells in the carrier holds considerable promise for the prevention of ATL development. In this study, we developed rVSVs that specifically target and kill HTLV-1 Env-expressing cells (not ATL cells, which generally do not express Env in vivo) through replacement of the G gene with HTLV-1 receptor gene(s) in the VSV genome. Notably, an rVSV engineered to express human NRP1 controlled the number of HTLV-1-infected Env-expressing cells in vitro and in vivo, suggesting the present approach may be a promising candidate for novel anti-HTLV-1 virotherapy in HTLV-1 carriers, including as a prophylactic treatment against the development of ATL.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Tezuka et al.'],"['Tezuka, Kenta', 'Okuma, Kazu', 'Kuramitsu, Madoka', 'Matsuoka, Sahoko', 'Tanaka, Reiko', 'Tanaka, Yuetsu', 'Hamaguchi, Isao']","['Tezuka K', 'Okuma K', 'Kuramitsu M', 'Matsuoka S', 'Tanaka R', 'Tanaka Y', 'Hamaguchi I']","['Department of Safety Research on Blood and Biological Products, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Safety Research on Blood and Biological Products, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan kokuma@niid.go.jp 130hama@niid.go.jp.', 'Department of Safety Research on Blood and Biological Products, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Safety Research on Blood and Biological Products, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Okinawa, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Okinawa, Japan.', 'Department of Safety Research on Blood and Biological Products, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan kokuma@niid.go.jp 130hama@niid.go.jp.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180130,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (G protein, vesicular stomatitis virus)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Female', 'Gene Products, env/*genetics', 'HTLV-I Infections/*therapy', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', '*Oncolytic Virotherapy', 'Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*genetics']",PMC5790936,,2017/12/08 06:00,2018/04/20 06:00,['2017/12/08 06:00'],"['2017/10/31 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/20 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.01885-17 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01885-17 [doi]']",epublish,J Virol. 2018 Jan 30;92(4). pii: JVI.01885-17. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01885-17.

Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-activated Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Jak/Stat3) is the master regulator for naive-state pluripotency achievement and maintenance. The estrogen-related receptor beta (Esrrb) serves as a naive-state marker gene regulating self-renewal of embryonic stem cells (ESCs). However, the interconnection between Esrrb and LIF signaling for pluripotency establishment in reprogramming is unclear. We screened the marker genes critical for complete reprogramming during mouse iPSC generation, and identified genes including Esrrb that are responsive to LIF/Jak pathway signaling. Overexpression of Esrrb resumes the reprogramming halted by inhibition of Jak activity in partially reprogrammed cells (pre-iPSCs), and leads to the generation of pluripotent iPSCs. We further show that neither overexpression of Nanog nor stimulation of Wnt signaling, two upstream regulators of Esrrb in ESCs, stimulates the expression of Esrrb in reprogramming when LIF or Jak activity is blocked. Our study demonstrates that Esrrb is a specific reprogramming factor regulated downstream of the LIF/Jak signaling pathway. These results shed new light on the regulatory role of LIF pathway on complete pluripotency establishment during iPSC generation.",['(c) 2018.

In the front-line treatment of CLL, the current standard-of-care includes chemotherapy in combination with an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (e.g., rituximab, ofatumumab, or obinutuzumab) or ibrutinib as single agent. Despite the evolving treatment paradigm toward targeted therapy, it is likely that rituximab (plus chemotherapy), with or without targeted agents, will retain a significant role in CLL treatment. However, patents for many biologics, including rituximab, have expired or will expire in the near future. Furthermore, access to rituximab has remained challenging, particularly in countries with restricted resources. Together, these concerns have prompted the development of safe and effective rituximab biosimilars. The term ""biosimilar"" refers to a biologic that is highly similar to an approved reference (originator) product, notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components, and for which there are no clinically meaningful differences in purity, potency, or safety. Biosimilars are developed to treat the same condition(s) using the same treatment regimens as an approved reference biologic and have the potential to increase access to more affordable treatments. We review the importance of rituximab in the current treatment of CLL, the scientific basis of its future role in combination with chemotherapy, and the role of new and emerging agents in the treatment of CLL, which could potentially be used in combination with rituximab biosimilars. We also discuss rituximab biosimilars currently in development.

The clinical feasibility and acceptability were examined via patient and intervention nurse interviews, which were audiotaped, transcribed, and deductively content analyzed. RESULTS: The intervention comprised 2 synergistically operating elements: (1) daily medication reminders and routine assessment of side effects with evidence-based self-care advice delivered in real time and (2) question prompt list (QPL) questions and routinely collected individual patient adherence and side effect profile data used to shape nurses' consultations, which employed motivational interviewing to support adoption of self-management behaviors. A total of 4 consultations and daily alerts and advice were delivered over 10 weeks. In total, 58% (10/17) of patients and 2 nurses participated in the pilot study. Patients reported several benefits of the intervention: help in establishing medication routines, resolution of symptom uncertainty, increased awareness of self-care, and informed decision making. Nurses also endorsed the intervention: it assisted in establishing pill-taking routines and patients developing effective solutions to adherence challenges. CONCLUSIONS: The REMIND system with nurse support was usable and acceptable to both patients and nurses. It has the potential to improve adherence and side-effect management and should be further evaluated.","['(c)Amanda Pereira-Salgado, Jennifer A Westwood, Lahiru Russell, Anna Ugalde,', 'Bronwen Ortlepp, John F Seymour, Phyllis Butow, Lawrence Cavedon, Kevin Ong,', 'Sanchia Aranda, Sibilah Breen, Suzanne Kirsa, Andrew Dunlevie, Penelope', 'Schofield.

Patients belonging to the denomination of Jehovah's Witnesses (JW), however, are bound by their religious convictions not to accept blood products and are therefore at higher risk for life-threatening events. Reports how to handle this challenge are mainly anecdotal. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We here report in much more detail about our experience with nine patients belonging to the denomination of JW who were treated for AML in our department from 1998 to 2007 and who explicitly wished to receive chemotherapy without blood transfusions. RESULTS: Reduced dose induction chemotherapy administered by several treatment cycles to prevent sustained myelosuppression still led to complete remissions in three out of nine of JW patients but was associated with a high rate of relapse. No durable remission was achieved. The overall hazard ratio for death was 12.1 compared to a matched control group treated with full transfusion support. The predominant cause of non-AML mortality was severe anemia (four out of five early deaths) and uncontrollable bleeding (n = 1). CONCLUSION: Reduced dose chemotherapy without transfusion support in JW suffering from AML is associated with a lower rate of remission, high mortality by severe anemia and very low chances for long-term remissions. Less hematotoxic treatment options including hypomethylating agents or molecular targeted therapies with intensive consolidation after improvement of bone marrow function are promising for these patients but need further investigation.",,"['Wilop, Stefan', 'Osieka, Rainhardt']","['Wilop S', 'Osieka R']","['a Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Medical Faculty , RWTH Aachen University , Aachen , Germany.', 'a Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Medical Faculty , RWTH Aachen University , Aachen , Germany.']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],20171207,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,,IM,,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Cause of Death', 'Female', 'Humans', ""*Jehovah's Witnesses"", 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Matched-Pair Analysis', 'Middle Aged', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Treatment Refusal', 'Young Adult']",,,2017/12/08 06:00,2018/09/27 06:00,['2017/12/08 06:00'],"['2017/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/27 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10245332.2017.1411548 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2018 Jul;23(6):324-329. doi: 10.1080/10245332.2017.1411548.

Survival rates exceed 80% in developed countries. Successful treatments rely on all-trans retinoic acid with anthracycline-based chemotherapy. Availability of modern care and public knowledge play important roles in pediatric APL survival. METHOD: A cytogenetic diagnosis of APL was confirmed in 30 (14.5%) out of 207 children consecutively diagnosed with de novo AML between January 2005 and December 2012 at nine cancer care centers in Saudi Arabia. Patients were treated based on the standard protocol used by the center following the PETHEMA or the C9710 treatment protocols. We modeled 5-year overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS) and cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) vs. treatment and potential covariates of age at diagnosis, involvement of central nervous system (CNS), and white blood cell (WBC) levels. RESULTS: The median age was 10.4 years with a male:female ratio of 1.9. WBC was 10 x 10(9)/l or greater in 57% and CNS involvement was confirmed in 13%. OS, EFS, and CIR were 74 +/- 12%, 55 +/- 19%, and, 36 +/- 17% respectively. No significant difference was found by treatment protocol. WBC levels were significantly prognostic for all negative events, but treatment with C9710 significantly ameliorated negative WBC effects. Overall outcomes were comparable to those reported in developed countries. CONCLUSIONS: Access to modern care is likely to be a critical factor in successful and comparable outcomes of childhood APL across the globe.

Most patients respond well to standard therapy, while a majority relapse, and development of an effective therapy for AML patients is still urgently needed. In this study, we demonstrated that betulinic acid (BA) significantly increased Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) expression through demethylation on the AHR promoter in AML cells, and the increased AHR expression interacts with and sequesters ARNT, subsequently suppressing hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF1alpha) pathway. We also found that histone deacetylase inhibitor chidamide (CDM) treatment significantly increased p300 over-acetylation in AML cells with dissociation of p300 with HIF1alpha, and subsequently suppressed the HIF1alpha pathway. Further investigation showed that BA/CDM combination additively increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) with DNA damage, apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction. Also, BA/CDM combination additively suppressed the HIF1alpha pathway with decreased VEGF expression. in vivo mice study showed that BA/CDM combination significantly suppressed AML tumor growth, and overexpression of SOD2 and a constitutive HIF1alpha (HIF1C) completely diminished this effect. We conclude that a BA/CDM combination inhibits AML tumors through ROS over-generation and HIF1alpha pathway suppression.

To determine the protective cell type(s), AML cells were treated with Ara-C, and AML cell survival in the presence or absence of osteoblast lineage cells was assessed. Cultured AML cells and patient bone marrow isolates were each significantly protected from Ara-C-induced apoptosis by co-culture with differentiating osteoblasts. Moreover, pretreating differentiating osteoblasts with the histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) vorinostat and panobinostat abrogated the ability of the differentiating osteoblasts to protect AML cells. Together, our results indicate that differentiating osteoblasts have the potential to promote residual AML in the bone marrow following standard chemotherapy and act via a mechanism requiring HDACi-sensitive gene expression.

Treatments include glucocorticoids (GCs) such as dexamethasone (Dex) and prednisolone, which may be of value when used alongside cytotoxic anti-cancer drugs. To predict therapeutic efficacy of GCs, their activity against ALL cells is usually examined prior to chemotherapy; however, few studies have examined their effects when used in combination with other drugs. The paradox is that cytotoxic anti-cancer drugs that are effective against proliferating cancer cells show synergistic effects when used with GCs that prevent cell proliferation. To address this point, we investigated intracellular energy metabolism in ALL CCRF-CEM cell clones classified according to their sensitivity to Dex and cytotoxic anti-cancer drugs in bulk cultures of mixed cells. We found that Dex suppressed glycolysis, the most important metabolic system in cancer cells, in cells that were damaged by etoposide (a cytotoxic anti-cancer drug), and the cells showed a concomitant increase in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Furthermore, autophagy, an intracellular bulk degradation system, regulated mitochondrial viability. We also found that mitochondria, whose function is enhanced by Dex, were susceptible to anti-cancer drugs that inhibit respiratory complexes (e.g., etoposide and daunorubicin), resulting in increased production of reactive oxygen species and subsequent cytotoxicity. Taken together, the present study points the way toward a more accurate prediction of the sensitivity of ALL cells to the combined action of anti-cancer drugs and GCs, by taking into consideration the shift in intracellular energy metabolism caused by GCs: namely, from glycolysis to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation mediated by autophagy.",,"['Aoki, Shigeki', 'Morita, Michie', 'Hirao, Takuya', 'Yamaguchi, Masashi', 'Shiratori, Reika', 'Kikuya, Megumi', 'Chibana, Hiroji', 'Ito, Kousei']","['Aoki S', 'Morita M', 'Hirao T', 'Yamaguchi M', 'Shiratori R', 'Kikuya M', 'Chibana H', 'Ito K']","['Laboratory of Biopharmaceutics, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chiba University, Chiba-city, Chiba 260-8675, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Biopharmaceutics, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chiba University, Chiba-city, Chiba 260-8675, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Biopharmaceutics, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chiba University, Chiba-city, Chiba 260-8675, Japan.', 'Medical Mycology Research Center, Chiba University, Chiba-city, Chiba 260-8673, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Biopharmaceutics, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chiba University, Chiba-city, Chiba 260-8675, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Biopharmaceutics, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chiba University, Chiba-city, Chiba 260-8675, Japan.', 'Medical Mycology Research Center, Chiba University, Chiba-city, Chiba 260-8673, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Biopharmaceutics, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chiba University, Chiba-city, Chiba 260-8675, Japan.']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],20171009,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,,,,PMC5706873,,2017/12/08 06:00,2017/12/08 06:01,['2017/12/08 06:00'],"['2017/06/16 00:00 [received]', '2017/09/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/08 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.21689 [doi]', '21689 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Oct 9;8(55):94271-94285. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.21689. eCollection 2017 Nov 7.,,['NOTNLM'],"['ALL', 'autophagy', 'glucocorticoids', 'glycolysis', 'oxidative phosphorylation']",,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our previous investigations have led to the identification of megakaryocytic leukemia 1 (MKL1) as a key co-factor of NF-kappaB/p65 participating in TNF-alpha induced pro-inflammatory transcription in macrophages. How post-translational modifications contribute to the modulation of MKL1 activity remains an underexplored subject matter. Here we report that the lysine deacetylase HDAC5 interacts with and deacetylates MKL1 in cells. TNF-alpha treatment down-regulates HDAC5 expression and expels HDAC5 from the promoters of pro-inflammatory genes in macrophages. In contrast, over-expression of HDAC5 attenuates TNF-alpha induced pro-inflammatory transcription. Mechanistically, HDAC5-mediated MKL1 deacetylation disrupts the interaction between MKL1 and p65. In addition, deacetylation of MKL1 by HDAC5 blocks its nuclear translocation in response to TNF-alpha treatment.

Quizartinib (AC220), a potent class III receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), was synthesized to selectively inhibit FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3), a target in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Quizartinib is currently under clinical trials for FLT3 ITD and wild-type AML and is tested in combination with chemotherapy. While non-toxic to cell lines, quizartinib at 3 muM showed significant reversal effect on wild-type and mutant ABCG2 (R482T)-mediated MDR, and only a moderate reversal effect on mutant ABCG2 (R482G)-mediated MDR. Results also showed that quizartinib reversed MDR not by reducing the expression of ABCG2 protein, but by antagonizing the drug efflux function and increasing the intracellular accumulation of substrate anticancer drugs in ABCG2-overexpressing cells. Importantly, quizartinib at 30 mg/kg strongly enhanced the effect of topotecan (3 mg/kg) in ABCG2-overexpressing (H460/MX20) xenografts in athymic nude mice. These results demonstrated that quizartinib potentiates the antineoplastic activity of wild-type and R482T mutant ABCG2 substrates.

Marrow adipocytes arise from the mesenchymal stem cell and share their origin with the osteoblast. Shifts in the lineage allocation of the mesenchymal stromal cell could potentially explain the association between increased MAT and increased fracture risk in diseases such as postmenopausal osteoporosis, anorexia nervosa and diabetes. Functionally, marrow adipocytes secrete adipokines, such as adiponectin, and cytokines, such as RANK ligand and stem cell factor. These mediators can influence both bone remodelling and haematopoiesis by promoting bone resorption and haematopoietic recovery following chemotherapy. In addition, marrow adipocytes can secrete free fatty acids, acting as a energy supply for bone and haematopoietic cells. However, this induced lipolysis is also used by neoplastic cells to promote survival and proliferation.

Guadecitabine, a next-generation hypomethylating agent, could be useful in treating such patients. METHODS: In this multicenter, open-label, phase 2 dose-expansion study, AML patients from 10 North American medical centers were first randomized (1:1) to receive subcutaneous guadecitabine at 60 or 90 mg/m(2) on 5 consecutive days in each 28-day cycle (5-day regimen). Subsequently, another cohort was treated for 10 days with 60 mg/m(2) (10-day regimen). RESULTS: Between June 15, 2012, and August 19, 2013, 108 patients with previously treated AML consented to enroll in the study, and 103 of these patients were treated; 5 patients did not receive the study treatment. A total of 103 patients were included in the safety and efficacy analyses (24 and 26 patients who were randomly assigned to 60 and 90 mg/m(2) /d, respectively [5-day regimen] and 53 patients who were assigned to 60 mg/m(2) /d [10-day regimen]). The 90 mg/m(2) dose showed no benefit in clinical outcomes in comparison with 60 mg/m(2) in the randomized cohort. Composite complete response (CRc) and complete response (CR) rates were higher with the 10-day regimen versus the 5-day regimen (CRc, 30.2% vs 16.0%; P = .1061; CR, 18.9% vs 8%; P = .15). Adverse events (grade >/= 3) were mainly hematologic, with a higher incidence on the 10-day regimen. Early all-cause mortality was low and similar between regimens. Twenty patients (8 on the 5-day regimen and 12 on the 10-day regimen) were bridged to hematopoietic cell transplantation.

Among cutaneous side effects, bullous reactions are rare. The authors describe the case of a 66-year-old woman developing blistering and skin fragility on her hands, foot, lower legs, and back after intake of imatinib for treatment of GIST. Biopsy showed vacuolar alteration at the dermoepidermal junction (DEJ) associated with a few lymphocytes and a subepidermal blister. The upper papillary dermis below the vacuolar alteration and below the blister showed hyalinization and loss of elastic microfibrils. Direct immunofluorescence was negative for deposits of immunoglobulins. Immunofluorescence on cryosections revealed loss of laminin and collagen IV in vacuoles at the DEJ. Electron microscopy showed dissolution of lamina lucida and lamina densa of the basement membrane below as well as next to the vacuoles and blister. In conclusion, the authors present the first patient with GIST with blistering and skin fragility due to imatinib therapy. As a pathophysiological explanation the authors propose loss of laminin and collagen IV at the DEJ leading to basement membrane instability and blistering. This case also suggests additional features reminiscent of lichen sclerosus induced by imatinib, a drug which is actually known for its antifibrotic effects.",,"['Muhl, Sebastian', 'Ehrchen, Jan', 'Metze, Dieter']","['Muhl S', 'Ehrchen J', 'Metze D']","['Department of Dermatology, University Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany.']",['eng'],,,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Am J Dermatopathol,The American Journal of dermatopathology,7911005,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Collagen Type IV)', '0 (Laminin)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Basement Membrane/drug effects/*pathology', 'Blister/*chemically induced', 'Collagen Type IV/drug effects', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*adverse effects', 'Laminin/drug effects', 'Skin/drug effects/pathology']",,,2017/12/07 06:00,2018/09/25 06:00,['2017/12/07 06:00'],"['2017/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/25 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/07 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/DAD.0000000000001063 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Dermatopathol. 2018 May;40(5):371-374. doi: 10.1097/DAD.0000000000001063.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expression of ERalpha and ERbeta, two dominant estrogen receptors, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in certain B-cell malignancies and the existence of estrogens receptors on mitochondria is open to question that estrogen likely has an impact on the cancerous lymphocytes life span. Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) is the frequent pediatric malignity which is recurrent and hardly curable in many cases. The malignant cells are generally resistant to apoptosis caused the severe lymphocytes accumulation in the peripheral blood. METHODS: By focusing on mitochondria as a life/death center of the cell; in the current research we compared cytotoxicity effects of a new ferrocenyl derivative with raloxifene as well-known SERMs considering the apoptotic process and survival of cancerous lymphocytes. RESULTS: We demonstrated that both ferrocenyl derivative and raloxifene could cause mitochondrial lesion and initiate the apoptosis process by caspase activation and cytochrome c release. CONCLUSION: In brief, the ferrocenyl derivative could induce estrogen-related selective apoptosis on cancerous lymphocytes by affecting mitochondrial receptors.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.org.']","['Aghvami, Marjan', 'Pourahmad, Jalal', 'Zarghi, Afshin', 'Eshghi, Peyman', 'Zarei, Mohammad H', 'Farzaneh, Shabnam', 'Sattari, Fatemeh']","['Aghvami M', 'Pourahmad J', 'Zarghi A', 'Eshghi P', 'Zarei MH', 'Farzaneh S', 'Sattari F']","['Faculty of Pharmacy, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Pediatric Congenital Hematologic Disorders Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Pediatric Congenital Hematologic Disorders Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Anticancer Agents Med Chem,Anti-cancer agents in medicinal chemistry,101265649,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Ferrous Compounds)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Female', 'Ferrous Compounds/chemical synthesis/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Receptors, Estrogen/metabolism']",,,2017/12/07 06:00,2019/06/27 06:00,['2017/12/07 06:00'],"['2017/06/21 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/29 00:00 [revised]', '2017/11/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/27 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['ACAMC-EPUB-87278 [pii]', '10.2174/1871520618666171206112446 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Agents Med Chem. 2018;18(7):1032-1043. doi: 10.2174/1871520618666171206112446.,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Estrogen', '*acute lymphocytic leukemia', '*apoptosis', '*ferrocenyl derivative', '*mitochondrial receptors', '*pediatric malignity.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Genotypes for six tag polymorphisms and resulting haplotypes were analyzed for an association with ALL outcome. RESULTS: The association was found with the polymorphisms A-680C, A-317G and C-35T in high-risk group patients. Carriers of haplotype *1 had a remarkably higher risk of events compared with noncarriers and a lower probability of event-free survival (21.4 vs 81.3%).

Their structures were elucidated using MS and NMR analysis and compared with reported data. They are three anthraquinones, a carotenoid, two triterpenes, four iridoid glycosides and three flavonoid glycosides. Among them, 2-methyl-1,4,6-trihydroxy-anthraquinone is a new one, and three compounds were found for the first time in this genus. MTT assay resulted that the n-butanol extract and four isolated compounds inhibited the proliferation of chronic myelogenous leukaemia cells. The results from Hoechst 33343 staining and caspase 3-inducing exhibited that those four tested compounds induced apoptosis and activated caspase 3 (p < 0.05).

Clinical outcomes for children with AML treated with maximally intensive multi-agent chemotherapy lag far behind those of children with the more common acute lymphoblastic leukemia, demonstrating continued need for new therapeutic approaches to decrease relapse risk and improve long-term survival. Mutations in the FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 receptor gene (FLT3) occur in approximately 25% of children and adults with AML and are associated with particularly poor prognoses. Identification and development of targeted FLT3 inhibitors represents a major precision medicine paradigm shift in the treatment of patients with AML. While further development of many first-generation FLT3 inhibitors was hampered by limited potency and significant toxicity due to effects upon other kinases, the more selective second- and third-generation FLT3 inhibitors have demonstrated excellent tolerability and remarkable efficacy in the relapsed/refractory and now de novo FLT3-mutated AML settings. While these newest and most promising inhibitors have largely been studied in the adult population, pediatric investigation of FLT3 inhibitors with chemotherapy is relatively recently ongoing or planned.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the prognostic significance of NKp46 expression in an independent cohort of patients with AML, and to investigate the impact of NKp46 on clinical outcome after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). NKp46 expression was assessed at diagnosis on NK cells by flow cytometry (N = 180 patients). Clinical outcome was evaluated with regard to NKp46 expression. Patients with NKp46(high) phenotype at diagnosis had better progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) than patients with NKp46(low) phenotype (74.3% vs. 46.6%, p = 0.014; 82.6% vs. 57.1%, p = 0.010, respectively). In multivariate analysis, high NKp46 was an independent factor for improved OS (HR = 0.409, p = 0.010) and PFS (HR = 0.335, p = 0.011). Subgroup analysis revealed that allo-SCT had a favorable impact on PFS in patients with NKp46(high) phenotype (p = 0.025). By contrast, allo-SCT did not impact PFS in patients with low NKp46 expression (p = 0.303). In conclusion, we validate the prognostic value of NKp46 expression at diagnosis in AML. However, the prognostic value of NKp46 expression is limited to patients treated with allo-SCT, thus suggesting that NKp46 status may be predictive for allo-SCT responsiveness.",,"['Chretien, Anne-Sophie', 'Devillier, Raynier', 'Fauriat, Cyril', 'Orlanducci, Florence', 'Harbi, Samia', 'Le Roy, Aude', 'Rey, Jerome', 'Bouvier Borg, Gaelle', 'Gautherot, Emmanuel', 'Hamel, Jean-Francois', 'Ifrah, Norbert', 'Lacombe, Catherine', 'Cornillet-Lefebvre, Pascale', 'Delaunay, Jacques', 'Toubert, Antoine', 'Arnoulet, Christine', 'Vey, Norbert', 'Blaise, Didier', 'Olive, Daniel']","['Chretien AS', 'Devillier R', 'Fauriat C', 'Orlanducci F', 'Harbi S', 'Le Roy A', 'Rey J', 'Bouvier Borg G', 'Gautherot E', 'Hamel JF', 'Ifrah N', 'Lacombe C', 'Cornillet-Lefebvre P', 'Delaunay J', 'Toubert A', 'Arnoulet C', 'Vey N', 'Blaise D', 'Olive D']","['Team Immunity and Cancer, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille (CRCM), Inserm, U1068; CNRS, UMR7258, Institut Paoli-Calmettes; Aix-Marseille University, UM 105, Marseille, France.', 'Immunomonitoring platform, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Team Immunity and Cancer, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille (CRCM), Inserm, U1068; CNRS, UMR7258, Institut Paoli-Calmettes; Aix-Marseille University, UM 105, Marseille, France.', 'Hematology Department, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Team Immunity and Cancer, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille (CRCM), Inserm, U1068; CNRS, UMR7258, Institut Paoli-Calmettes; Aix-Marseille University, UM 105, Marseille, France.', 'Immunomonitoring platform, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Immunomonitoring platform, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Hematology Department, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Team Immunity and Cancer, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille (CRCM), Inserm, U1068; CNRS, UMR7258, Institut Paoli-Calmettes; Aix-Marseille University, UM 105, Marseille, France.', 'Immunomonitoring platform, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Hematology Department, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Beckman Coulter Immunotech, Biostatistics and methodology department, CHU Angers, Angers, France.', 'Beckman Coulter Immunotech, Biostatistics and methodology department, CHU Angers, Angers, France.', 'Beckman Coulter Immunotech, Biostatistics and methodology department, CHU Angers, Angers, France.', 'Hematology department, CHU Angers, Angers, France.', 'GOELAMStheque, FILO (French Innovative Leukemia Organization), Cochin Hospital, APHP, Paris, FRANCE.', ""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Reims, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie, Centre Catherine de Sienne, Nantes, France."", ""INSERM UMRS-1160, Univ Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie, Immunology and Histocompatibility department, Hopital Saint-Louis, APHP, Paris, France."", 'Team Immunity and Cancer, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille (CRCM), Inserm, U1068; CNRS, UMR7258, Institut Paoli-Calmettes; Aix-Marseille University, UM 105, Marseille, France.', 'Biopathology Department, Institut Paoli Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Team Immunity and Cancer, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille (CRCM), Inserm, U1068; CNRS, UMR7258, Institut Paoli-Calmettes; Aix-Marseille University, UM 105, Marseille, France.', 'Hematology Department, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Team Immunity and Cancer, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille (CRCM), Inserm, U1068; CNRS, UMR7258, Institut Paoli-Calmettes; Aix-Marseille University, UM 105, Marseille, France.', 'Hematology Department, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Team Immunity and Cancer, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille (CRCM), Inserm, U1068; CNRS, UMR7258, Institut Paoli-Calmettes; Aix-Marseille University, UM 105, Marseille, France.', 'Immunomonitoring platform, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170324,United States,Oncoimmunology,Oncoimmunology,101570526,,,,,PMC5706596,,2017/12/07 06:00,2017/12/07 06:01,['2017/12/07 06:00'],"['2017/01/09 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/20 00:00 [revised]', '2017/03/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/07 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1080/2162402X.2017.1307491 [doi]', '1307491 [pii]']",epublish,Oncoimmunology. 2017 Mar 24;6(12):e1307491. doi: 10.1080/2162402X.2017.1307491. eCollection 2017.,,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*Allo-SCT', '*NCR', '*NK', '*NKp46']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, associations between 5-cytosine epigenetic markers and the most frequent chromosomal abnormalities detected in CLL remain to be established. Methods: CLL patients were retrospectively classified into a cytogenetic low-risk group (isolated 13q deletion), an intermediate-risk group (normal karyotype or trisomy 12), and a high-risk group (11q deletion, 17p deletion, or complex karyotype [>/= 3 breakpoints]). The two 5-cytosine derivatives, 5-methylcytosine (5-mCyt) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmCyt), were tested by ELISA (n = 60), while real-time quantitative PCR was used for determining transcriptional expression levels of DNMT and TET (n = 24). Results: By using global DNA methylation/demethylation levels, in the low-risk disease group, two subgroups with significantly different clinical outcomes have been identified (median treatment-free survival [TFS] 45 versus > 120 months for 5-mCyt, p = 0.0008, and 63 versus > 120 months for 5-hmCyt, p = 0.04). A defective 5-mCyt status was further associated with a higher percentage of 13q deleted nuclei (> 80%), thus suggesting an acquired process. When considering the cytogenetic intermediate/high-risk disease groups, an association of 5-mCyt status with lymphocytosis (p = 0.0008) and the lymphocyte doubling time (p = 0.04) but not with TFS was observed, as well as a reduction of DNMT3A, TET1, and TET2 transcripts. Conclusions: Combining cytogenetic studies with 5-mCyt assessment adds accuracy to CLL patients' prognoses and particularly for those with 13q deletion as a sole cytogenetic abnormality.",,"['Bagacean, Cristina', 'Le Dantec, Christelle', 'Berthou, Christian', 'Tempescul, Adrian', 'Saad, Hussam', 'Bordron, Anne', 'Zdrenghea, Mihnea', 'Cristea, Victor', 'Douet-Guilbert, Nathalie', 'Renaudineau, Yves']","['Bagacean C', 'Le Dantec C', 'Berthou C', 'Tempescul A', 'Saad H', 'Bordron A', 'Zdrenghea M', 'Cristea V', 'Douet-Guilbert N', 'Renaudineau Y']","['U1227 B lymphocytes and autoimmunity, University of Brest, INSERM, IBSAM, Labex IGO, networks IC-CGO and REpiCGO from ""Canceropole Grand Ouest"", Brest, France.', 'Laboratory of Immunology and Immunotherapy, Brest University Medical School Hospital, BP 824, 29609 Brest, France.', '""Iuliu Hatieganu"" University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'U1227 B lymphocytes and autoimmunity, University of Brest, INSERM, IBSAM, Labex IGO, networks IC-CGO and REpiCGO from ""Canceropole Grand Ouest"", Brest, France.', 'U1227 B lymphocytes and autoimmunity, University of Brest, INSERM, IBSAM, Labex IGO, networks IC-CGO and REpiCGO from ""Canceropole Grand Ouest"", Brest, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Brest University Medical School Hospital, Brest, France.', 'U1227 B lymphocytes and autoimmunity, University of Brest, INSERM, IBSAM, Labex IGO, networks IC-CGO and REpiCGO from ""Canceropole Grand Ouest"", Brest, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Brest University Medical School Hospital, Brest, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Brest University Medical School Hospital, Brest, France.', 'U1227 B lymphocytes and autoimmunity, University of Brest, INSERM, IBSAM, Labex IGO, networks IC-CGO and REpiCGO from ""Canceropole Grand Ouest"", Brest, France.', '""Iuliu Hatieganu"" University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, ""Ion Chiricuta"" Oncology Institute, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', '""Iuliu Hatieganu"" University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Laboratory of Cytogenetics, Brest University Medical School Hospital, Brest, France.', 'U1227 B lymphocytes and autoimmunity, University of Brest, INSERM, IBSAM, Labex IGO, networks IC-CGO and REpiCGO from ""Canceropole Grand Ouest"", Brest, France.', 'Laboratory of Immunology and Immunotherapy, Brest University Medical School Hospital, BP 824, 29609 Brest, France.']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],20171128,Germany,Clin Epigenetics,Clinical epigenetics,101516977,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DNMT3A protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '1123-95-1 (5-hydroxymethylcytosine)', '6R795CQT4H (5-Methylcytosine)', 'EC 1.- (Mixed Function Oxygenases)', 'EC 1.- (TET1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Dioxygenases)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (TET2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA Methyltransferase 3A)']",IM,,"['5-Methylcytosine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13/*genetics', 'Cytogenetic Analysis/*methods', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/genetics', 'DNA Methyltransferase 3A', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Dioxygenases', 'Disease Progression', 'Epigenomics/*methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mixed Function Oxygenases/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Retrospective Studies']",PMC5704505,,2017/12/07 06:00,2018/07/14 06:00,['2017/12/07 06:00'],"['2017/07/04 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13148-017-0422-7 [doi]', '422 [pii]']",epublish,Clin Epigenetics. 2017 Nov 28;9:122. doi: 10.1186/s13148-017-0422-7. eCollection 2017.,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Active DNA demethylation', '*Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*Cytogenetics', '*DNA methylation', '*DNMT', '*TET']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-5098-5002'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dimethyl fumarate (DMF), an activator of Nrf2, has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties without significant immunosuppression. We therefore hypothesized that DMF could be potentially harnessed for the treatment of aGVHD with retention of graft-versus-tumor effect. In this study, we showed that DMF significantly inhibited alloreactive T cell responses in vitro in mixed lymphocyte reaction assay. Administration of DMF significantly alleviated the severity, histological damage, and the overall mortality of aGVHD in an MHC-mismatched aGVHD model. DMF administration reduced the activation and effector function of donor T cells in vitro and in vivo. In addition, DMF treatment upregulated antioxidant enzymes heme oxygenase-1 and glutathione S-transferase-alpha1 expressions. Furthermore, DMF treatment markedly increased the frequencies of Treg cells. Depletion of CD25(+) cells in DMF recipients aggravated aGVHD mortality compared with IgG control recipients. DMF could promote Treg cell differentiation in a dose dependent manner by upregulating TGF-beta expression in vitro. Most importantly, DMF administration preserved graft-versus-leukemia effect after bone marrow transplantation. In conclusion, our findings demonstrated DMF as a promising agent for the prevention of aGVHD after allo-HSCT.",,"['Han, Jingjing', 'Ma, Shoubao', 'Gong, Huanle', 'Liu, Shuangzhu', 'Lei, Lei', 'Hu, Bo', 'Xu, Yang', 'Liu, Haiyan', 'Wu, Depei']","['Han J', 'Ma S', 'Gong H', 'Liu S', 'Lei L', 'Hu B', 'Xu Y', 'Liu H', 'Wu D']","['Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Immunology Programme, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Life Sciences Institute, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],20171120,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,,,,,PMC5702003,,2017/12/07 06:00,2017/12/07 06:01,['2017/12/07 06:00'],"['2017/07/25 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/07 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2017.01605 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2017 Nov 20;8:1605. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2017.01605. eCollection 2017.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Nrf2', 'Treg cells', 'acute graft-versus-host disease', 'dimethyl fumarate', 'graft-versus-leukemia']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The role of WW domain-containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1 (WWP1) in haematological neoplasms remains unknown. Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is characterized by the expansion of malignant myeloid cells blocked at different stages of differentiation. Here we report that the expression of WWP1 is significantly augmented in a large cohort of primary AML patients and in AML cell lines, compared with haematopoietic cells from healthy donors. We show that WWP1 inactivation severely impairs the growth of primary AML blasts and cell lines in vitro. In vivo, we observed a reduced leukaemogenic potential of WWP1-depleted AML cells upon transplantation into immunocompromised mice. Mechanistically, WWP1 inactivation induces the accumulation of its protein substrate p27(Kip1), which ultimately contributes to G0/G1 cell cycle arrest of AML blasts. In addition, WWP1 depletion triggers the autophagy signalling and reduces survival of leukaemic cells.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia initially present with hyperleukocytosis (WBC count more than 50,000/mm(3)) in twenty percent cases. These children are particularly at risk of development of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). Tumor lysis syndrome is a metabolic disorder consists of hyperuricaemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphataemia, hypocalcaemia with or without renal insufficiency. It is the most common disease related emergency encountered by physicians caring for cancer of children and adult. This cross sectional observational study was conducted in Department of Paediatric Haemato-oncology, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University, Dhaka, Bangladesh from November 2011 to April 2012 and was designed to assess early biochemical changes associated with hyperleukocytosis which may follow tumor lysis syndrome. Children with Acute lymphoblastic leukemia with hyperleukocytosis who are potential to develop tumor lysis syndrome were selected for the study in their initial presentation. Thirty patients with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia with initial high WBC count; more than 50,000/mm(3) were selected for the study. The objectives of the study were to observe the development of tumor lysis syndrome with hyperleukocytosis, detection of early signs of electrolyte changes and early detection of tumor lysis syndrome which can help further in the management of such patients. Majority of the cases were in age group 7 years to 15 years with male predominance (83%). Hyperphosphataemia (80%) followed by hyperuricaemia (53%) were the most common biochemical findings. Hyperkalemia and hypocalcaemia were present in 33% and 26% patients. Laboratory tumor lysis syndrome was developed in 40% of patients and clinical tumor lysis syndrome was developed in 20% patients with hyperleucocytosis meeting the criteria for definition of tumor lysis syndrome by Cairo Bishop in 2004. It was observed that TLS increased with higher WBC. Tumor lysis syndrome developed in 26% patients with WBC count below one lac, 50% with WBC count 1 lac to 2 lacs and increasing upto 100% with WBC count more than 3 lacs.

The PI3K/mTOR pathway is involved in cell survival and has been shown to be constitutively active in 50-80% of AML patients. However, targeting the PI3K/mTOR pathway results in activation of the ERK pathway, which also plays an important role in cell survival. In addition, AML cells often overexpress antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins (e.g., Bcl-2), preventing cell death. Thus, our strategy here is to target the PI3K, mTOR (by VS-5584, a PI3K and mTOR dual inhibitor), ERK (by SCH772984, an ERK-selective inhibitor), and Bcl-2 (by ABT-199, a Bcl-2-selective inhibitor) signaling network to kill AML cells. In this study, we show that while inhibition of PI3K, mTOR, and ERK showed superior induction of cell death compared to inhibition of PI3K and mTOR, the levels of cell death were modest in some AML cell lines and primary patient samples tested. Although simultaneous inhibition of PI3K, mTOR, and ERK caused downregulation of Mcl-1 and upregulation of Bim, immunoprecipitation of Bcl-2 revealed increased binding of Bim to Bcl-2, which was abolished by the addition of ABT-199, suggesting that Bim was bound to Bcl-2 which prevented cell death. Treatment with combined VS-5584, SCH772984, and ABT-199 showed significant increase in cell death in AML cell lines and primary patient samples and significant reduction in AML colony formation in primary patient samples, while there was no significant effect on colony formation of normal human CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells. Taken together, our findings show that inhibition of PI3K, mTOR, and ERK synergistically induces cell death in AML cells, and addition of ABT-199 enhances cell death further. Thus, our data support targeting the PI3K, mTOR, ERK, and Bcl-2 signaling network for the treatment of AML.",['Copyright (c) 2017.

A total of 20% of patients with SS have malignancy-associated disease that can present with bullous or atypical skin lesions that mimic pyoderma gangrenosum, another neutrophilic dermatosis. Both entities exist on a spectrum, and in the context of underlying malignancy, these neutrophilic diseases become less clinically distinct. The literature also describes life-threatening cases of neutrophilic dermatoses that mimic severe sepsis. We present a fatal case of a patient with chronic eosinophilic leukemia with recurrent episodes of malignancy-associated atypical neutrophilic dermatosis characterized by necrotic skin lesions, pulmonary infiltrates and noninfectious shock and we also summarize the clinical presentations of an additional 10 patients reported in the literature. We conducted a PubMed search of articles published up to and in 2015, focusing on the English and Spanish literature with SS cross-referenced with the following search terms: neutrophilic dermatosis, pyoderma gangrenosum, shock, multiorgan failure and systemic inflammatory response syndrome. The articles were reviewed and the patients clinical and laboratory findings were summarized. Cases of atypical neutrophilic dermatosis presenting with noninfectious shock syndrome are likely underrecognized clinically and underreported in the literature.

In this article, we carried out experiments on the P19 cell line to elucidate the effects of TUC40- overexpression on cardiomyocyte development relevant to VSD pathogenesis. METHODS: We established the overexpression cell model by plasmid transfection, and explored the expression profile of Pbx1, the sense gene of TUC40-, and the marker genes of cardiomyocyte linage commitment (Nkx2.5 and GATA4) and maturation (cardiac troponin T). In addition, we combined cell cycle and Cell Counting Kit-8 analysis to detect cell proliferation and used flow cytometry and caspase-3 assays to test apoptosis. At last, bioinformatics analysis was performed to show the possible role of TUC40-. RESULTS: In the control group, Pbx1 elevated steadily during cardiomyocyte induction; whereas in the overexpression group, it showed significantly lower expression at day 6, 8 and 10 of induction. Cells in the overexpression group failed to induce cardiomyocytes indicated by GATA4 and cardiac troponin T. Proliferation was inhibited possibly owing to G2/M cell cycle arrest and the induced apoptosis rate was higher in the overexpression group. CONCLUSIONS: TUC40- overexpression reduced Pbx1 expression, cardiomyocyte induction and differentiation, inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis. Combining the results and previous studies, we propose TUC40- as a potential pathologic factor for VSD.","['Copyright (c) 2017 Southern Society for Clinical Investigation.

The comparative rarity, the difficulty of early diagnosis, and the extremely high mortality of SMAE give us the sufficient reasons to report our successful experience in curing a patient with acute SMAE. In the present case, the patient was diagnosed early without evidence of intestinal necrosis. The diagnosis of SMAE was verified by computed tomography angiography (CTA). A comprehensive treatment was immediately employed including a combination of intra-arterial thrombolysis and embolectomy operation with emergent laparotomy. We summarize that the successful treatment of superior mesenteric artery embolism depends on early diagnosis and timely reestablishment of arterial flow under the support of general treatments such as prevention of sepsis and control of organic insufficiencies.

In this situation, a bispecific CAR with binding domains for CD19 and CD20 is aimed at recognizing leukemic cells with only one cognate antigen. The anti-CD20-CD19 bispecific CAR induced a full T-cell response upon engagement of CD19 or CD20 on target cells showing a true ""OR"" gate recognition in redirecting T-cell activation. T cells with the anti-CD20-CD19 CAR efficiently killed patients' chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells in vitro. The bispecific CAR T cells cleared pediatric acute lymphocytic leukemia with a mixed CD19(+)CD20(+)/CD20(-) phenotype from the blood and bone marrow of transplanted mice, while anti-CD20 CAR T cells left CD20(-) leukemic cells behind without curing the disease.

Thalassaemia trait is asymptomatic and is usually an incidental diagnosis. Both thalassaemia and Gaucher disease can have similar haematologic manifestations and hence, their coexistence causes diagnostic dilemma. Our patient presented at one-and-a-half years with weakness, pallor, failure to thrive and massive hepatosplenomegaly. Clinical examination and history pointed to a lipid storage disease. Peripheral smear revealed microcytic hypochromic cells and nucleated red cells with haemolytic blood picture. Thalassaemia trait was indicated on haemoglobin variant analysis using High Performance Liquid Chromatography. Liver biopsy, bone marrow aspirate and therapeutic splenectomy revealed Gaucher-like cells. Type 1 Gaucher disease can be clinically asymptomatic as well as present with massive liver and spleen enlargement and involvement of bone marrow. Anaemia, splenomegaly and thrombocytopenia are the usual presentations at diagnosis, similar to the haemoglobinopathies. Gaucher-like cells with normal beta-glucocerebrosidase (pseudo-Gaucher cells) are seen in thalassaemia, leukaemia, mycobacterial infections and myeloma. Gaucher disease coexisting with thalassaemia trait is uncommon.

However, the anti-tumor effect of asparaginase is always restricted due to complicated mechanisms. Herein, we investigated the mechanisms of how glioblastoma resisted asparaginase treatment and reported a novel approach to enhance the anti-glioblastoma effect of asparaginase. We found that asparaginase could induce growth inhibition and caspase-dependent apoptosis in U87MG/U251MG glioblastoma cells. Meanwhile, autophagy was activated as indicated by autophagosomes formation and upregulated expression of LC3-II. Importantly, abolishing autophagy using chloroquine (CQ) and LY294002 enhanced the cytotoxicity and apoptosis induced by asparaginase in U87MG/U251MG cells. Further study proved that Akt/mTOR and Erk signaling pathways participated in autophagy induction, while reactive oxygen species (ROS) served as an intracellular regulator for both cytotoxicity and autophagy in asparaginase-treated U87MG/U251MG cells. Moreover, combination treatment with autophagy inhibitor CQ significantly enhanced anti-glioblastoma efficacy of asparaginase in U87MG cell xenograft model.

An important source of prolactin-like hormones, known as lactogens, is the placenta, and lactogens bind to the PRL receptor (PRLR) with high affinity and thereby mimic the actions of PRL. Recently, it has been demonstrated that pituitary SexHs were involved in metastatic lung cancer, certain sarcomas, and leukemia. In the present study we aimed to investigate whether FSH, LH, and PRL were able to stimulate stem cells involved in early development. To address this issue we employed a murine embryonic stem cell line (ES-D3) as well as two teratocarcinoma cell lines, P19 (murine) and NTera2 (human). We determined that all these cells expressed SexH receptors at the mRNA and protein levels and that stimulation of these receptors induced phosphorylation of p42/44 MAPK, p38 MAPK, and AKT. Moreover, ES-D3, P19, and NTera2 cells responded with increased migration and adhesion to physiological concentrations of pituitary SexHs.

The aim of the present study was to characterize the effects of BMI-1 on cell viability, radiosensitivity and its mechanisms of action in oesophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC). Western blotting and immunohistochemistry were employed to evaluate the protein expression of BMI-1 in ESCC cells and specimens, respectively. Additionally, the protein expression levels of BMI-1, H2AK119ub and gammaH2AX in ESCC cells were detected following different doses of IR and at different times after IR. The protein expression levels of MDC1 and 53BP1 were also measured. Flow cytometry and MTT assays were used to determine cell cycle progression, apoptosis and cell viability. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 and the agonist IGF-1 were employed to suppress or induce the phosphorylation of Akt to determine whether BMI-1 induces radioresistance in ESCC cells via activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway. The expression of BMI-1 was higher in ESCC tissues and cells compared with that in normal oesophageal tissues and cells. In addition, BMI-1 was positively related to tumour size and lymph node metastases and negatively to the overall survival of ESCC patients. IR induced the expression of BMI-1, H2AK119ub and gammaH2AX in a dose- and time-dependent manner. BMI-1 knockdown lowered the expression of gammaH2AX, MDC1 and 53BP1, suppressed cell viability and increased radiosensitivity. G2/M phase arrest was eliminated; this was followed by an increased proportion of cells entering the G0/G1 phase after IR and BMI-1 knockdown via the upregulation of P16 and downregulation of cyclin D2 and cyclin-dependent kinase-4. Moreover, BMI-1 knockdown increased cell apoptosis, downregulated MCL-1 and p-Akt and upregulated Bax. Additionally, the inhibitory effect of the downregulation of p-Akt by LY294002 on tumour cell viability was identical to that of BMI-1 knockdown, while the kinase agonist IGF-1 reversed the effects of BMI-1 knockdown on cell viability and radiosensitivity. Taken together, BMI-1 knockdown induces radiosensitivity in ESCC and significantly inhibits cell viability, which may contribute to an increased proportion of cells in the G0/G1 phase and cell apoptosis via suppression of the PI3K/Akt signalling pathway.",,"['Yang, Xing-Xiao', 'Ma, Ming', 'Sang, Mei-Xiang', 'Zhang, Xue-Yuan', 'Liu, Zhi-Kun', 'Song, Heng', 'Zhu, Shu-Chai']","['Yang XX', 'Ma M', 'Sang MX', 'Zhang XY', 'Liu ZK', 'Song H', 'Zhu SC']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, The Fourth Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, Hebei 050011, P.R.

Immunotherapy for treating tumors has received much attention in recent years due to its marked effect. There are two approaches which currently lead this field: Chimeric antigen receptormodified Tcell immunotherapy (CART) and programmed cell death protein-1 blockade (PD1 blockade). CART has emerged as a promising regimen for the treatment of a range of types of cancer, including chronic lymphoid leukemia and neuroblastoma, with studies of long term remission in certain patients. PD1 blockade has been reported to exert marked clinical responses in patients against a range of types of solid cancer, including advanced melanoma, nonsmallcell lung cancer and renal cell carcinoma, in addition to hematological malignancies. While increasing the power of the immune system to fight cancer has been a longstanding goal in oncology, a number of studies have demonstrated the synergistic antitumor effects of combination therapies under the umbrella of immunotherapy. The present review focused on a novel combination approach involving CART and PD1 blockade.

Microarray dataset GSE79695 was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Differentially methylated sites and differentially methylated CpG islands were identified in BMMSC samples from patients with AML compared with controls. MicroRNAs (miRs) encoding genes covering differentially methylated sites were found and the regulation network was constructed. Pathway enrichment analysis of hypermethylated genes and hypomethylated genes was performed, followed by proteinprotein interaction (PPI) network construction. Moreover, the identified differentially methylated genes were compared with the leukemiarelated marker/therapeutic genes from the literature. Overall, 228 hypermethylated CpG site probes covering 183 gene symbols and 523 hypomethylated CpG sites probes covering 362 gene symbols were identified in the BMMSCs from AML patients. Furthermore, 4 genes with CpG island hypermethylation were identified, including peptidase M20 domain containing 1 (PM20D1). The hsamiR596encoding gene MIR596 was found to be hypermethylated and the regulation network based on hsamiR596 and its targets (such as cytochrome P450 family 1 subfamily B member 1) was constructed. Hypermethylated and hypomethylated genes were enriched in different Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways, including 'hsa05221: Acute myeloid leukemia' and 'hsa05220: Chronic myeloid leukemia', which the hypomethylated gene mitogenactivated protein kinase 3 (MAPK3) was involved in. In addition, MAPK3, lysine demethylase 2B and RAP1A, member of RAS oncogene family were hubs in the PPI network of methylated genes. In conclusion, PM20D1 with hypermethylation of CpG islands may be associated with the energy expenditure of patients with AML. Furthermore, the aberrantly hypermethylated miR159encoding gene MIR159 may be a potential biomarker of AML.",,"['Huang, Jing', 'Liu, Zhi', 'Sun, Yufan', 'Zhong, Qi', 'Xu, Li', 'Ou, Ruimin', 'Li, Cheng', 'Chen, Rui', 'Yao, Mengdong', 'Zhang, Qing', 'Liu, Shuang']","['Huang J', 'Liu Z', 'Sun Y', 'Zhong Q', 'Xu L', 'Ou R', 'Li C', 'Chen R', 'Yao M', 'Zhang Q', 'Liu S']","['Department of Hematology, Guangdong Second Provincial General Hospital, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510317, P.R.

RECENT FINDINGS: The stellar success of immune therapies that harness the power of T cells in solid tumors and an improved understanding of the immune system in patients with hematologic malignancies have resulted in major efforts to develop immune therapies for the treatment of patients with AML. Monoclonal antibodies in AML therapy include naked antibodies against AML surface antigens such as CD33 (e.g. lintuzumab) or CD38 (e.g. daratumumab), antibodies conjugated to toxins in various anti-CD33 (gemtuzumab ozogamicin, SGN33A, IMGN779) and anti-CD123 (SL-401, SGN-CD123A) formulations, and antibodies conjugated to radioactive particles such as I or Ac-labeled anti-CD33 or anti-CD45 antibodies. Additional antigenic targets of interest in AML include CLL1, CD38, CD25, TIM3, FLT3, and others. Approaches to harness the body's own T cells against AML include antibodies that recruit and induce cytotoxicity of tumor cells by T cells (bispecific T-cell engager [BiTE] such as CD33 x CD3 (e.g. AMG 330) or CD123 x CD3 (e.g. flotetuzumab, JNJ-63709178) or antibodies that block immune checkpoint receptors CTLA4 (e.g. ipilimumab) or PD1/PD-L1 (e.g. nivolumab, pembrolizumab, avelumab) on T cells, unleashing the patients' T cells against leukemic cells. SUMMARY: The ongoing trials and well designed correlative interrogation of the immune system in patients treated on such trials will further enhance our understanding and clinical application of immune therapies as single-agent and combination approaches for the treatment of AML.",,"['Assi, Rita', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Daver, Naval']","['Assi R', 'Kantarjian H', 'Ravandi F', 'Daver N']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],,['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', '0 (CTLA-4 Antigen)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (PDCD1 protein, human)', '0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/*therapeutic use', 'CTLA-4 Antigen/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Immunotoxins/*therapeutic use', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology']",,,2017/12/06 06:00,2019/01/12 06:00,['2017/12/06 06:00'],"['2017/12/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/12 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000401 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2018 Mar;25(2):136-145. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000401.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Arsenic is also a carcinogen, yet arsenic trioxide is used as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of acute promyelotic leukemia (APL). The therapeutic use of arsenic is limited due to its severe cardiovascular side effects. Many of the toxic effects of arsenic are mediated by mitochondrial dysfunction and related to arsenic's effect on oxidative stress. Therefore, we investigated the effectiveness of antioxidants against arsenic induced cardiovascular dysfunction. A growing body of evidence suggests that antioxidant phytonutrients may ameliorate the toxic effects of arsenic on mitochondria by scavenging free radicals. This review identifies 21 antioxidants that can effectively reverse mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in cardiovascular cells and tissues. In addition, we propose that antioxidants have the potential to improve the cardiovascular health of millions of people chronically exposed to elevated arsenic concentrations through contaminated water supplies or used to treat certain types of leukemias. Importantly, we identify conceptual gaps in research and development of new mito-protective antioxidants and suggest avenues for future research to improve bioavailability of antioxidants and distribution to target tissues in order reduce arsenic-induced cardiovascular toxicity in a real-world context.",,"['Pace, Clare', 'Dagda, Ruben', 'Angermann, Jeff']","['Pace C', 'Dagda R', 'Angermann J']","['Department of Environmental Science and Health, University of Nevada, Reno, NV 89557, USA. clare.pace@gmail.com.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine, Reno, NV 89557, USA. rdagda@med.unr.edu.', 'School of Community Health Sciences, University of Nevada, Reno, NV 89557, USA. jeffa@unr.edu.']",['eng'],,['P20 GM103554/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20171205,Switzerland,Toxics,Toxics,101639637,,,,,PMC5750566,,2017/12/06 06:00,2017/12/06 06:01,['2017/12/06 06:00'],"['2017/09/30 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/29 00:00 [revised]', '2017/12/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/06 06:01 [medline]']","['toxics5040038 [pii]', '10.3390/toxics5040038 [doi]']",epublish,Toxics. 2017 Dec 5;5(4). pii: toxics5040038. doi: 10.3390/toxics5040038.,,['NOTNLM'],"['antioxidant', 'arsenic toxicity', 'cardiovascular', 'oxidative stress', 'superoxide']",,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whereas SLL is characterised by its location outside the blood stream, MBL is distinguished from CLL by a monoclonal B-cell count below 5 x 109/l. Due to its low tendency to transform into CLL, correct diagnosis of MBL is essential. We hypothesised that this might not always be the case. METHODS: This study includes data on monoclonal B-lymphocyte count based on diagnostic flow cytometry from patients diagnosed in the period from 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2016 at the Department of Haematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark. A total of 69 patients had less than 5 x 109/l monoclonal B-cells with a CLL-like immunophenotype in peripheral blood. All cases were classified based on the 2008 WHO criteria and evaluated according to the clinical diagnosis of CLL, MBL or SLL in the medical records. A total of 24 of the 69 patients were classified as MBL. RESULTS: In the study cohort, 12 (50%) patients classified as MBL were diagnosed accurately with MBL, whereas nine (38%) were diagnosed with CLL. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study indicate that a sizeable fraction of MBL patients are diagnosed inaccurately with CLL, even after the introduction of the MBL diagnosis.

Although the kinase domain of p210 BCR-ABL is an active driver of CML, the pathological role of its pleckstrin homology (PH) domain remains unclear. Here, we carried out phospholipid vesicle-binding assays to show that cardiolipin (CL), a characteristic mitochondrial phospholipid, is a unique ligand of the PH domain. Arg726, a basic amino acid in the ligand-binding region, was crucial for ligand recognition. A subset of wild-type p210 BCR-ABL that was transiently expressed in HEK293 cells was dramatically translocated from the cytosol to mitochondria in response to carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) treatment, which induces mitochondrial depolarization and subsequent externalization of CL to the organelle's outer membrane, whereas an R726A mutant of the protein was not translocated. Furthermore, only wild-type p210 BCR-ABL, but not the R726A mutant, suppressed CCCP-induced mitophagy and subsequently enhanced reactive oxygen species production. Thus, p210 BCR-ABL can change its intracellular localization via interactions between the PH domain and CL to cope with mitochondrial damage. This suggests that p210 BCR-ABL could have beneficial effects for cancer proliferation, providing new insight into the PH domain's contribution to CML pathogenesis.","['(c) 2017 Molecular Biology Society of Japan and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.']","['Shimasaki, Kentaro', 'Watanabe-Takahashi, Miho', 'Umeda, Masato', 'Funamoto, Satoru', 'Saito, Yoshiro', 'Noguchi, Noriko', 'Kumagai, Keigo', 'Hanada, Kentaro', 'Tsukahara, Fujiko', 'Maru, Yoshiro', 'Shibata, Norihito', 'Naito, Mikihiko', 'Nishikawa, Kiyotaka']","['Shimasaki K', 'Watanabe-Takahashi M', 'Umeda M', 'Funamoto S', 'Saito Y', 'Noguchi N', 'Kumagai K', 'Hanada K', 'Tsukahara F', 'Maru Y', 'Shibata N', 'Naito M', 'Nishikawa K']","['Department of Molecular Life Sciences, Graduate School of Life and Medical Sciences, Doshisha University, Kyotanabe, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Life Sciences, Graduate School of Life and Medical Sciences, Doshisha University, Kyotanabe, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Synthetic Chemistry and Biological Chemistry, Graduate School of Engineering, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Neuropathology, Graduate School of Life and Medical Sciences, Doshisha University, Kyotanabe, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Systems Life Sciences Laboratory, Department of Medical Life Systems, Faculty of Life and Medical Sciences, Doshisha University, Kyotanabe, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Systems Life Sciences Laboratory, Department of Medical Life Systems, Faculty of Life and Medical Sciences, Doshisha University, Kyotanabe, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan.', ""Department of Pharmacology, Tokyo Women's Medical University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan."", ""Department of Pharmacology, Tokyo Women's Medical University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan."", 'Division of Molecular Target and Gene Therapy Products, National Institute of Health Sciences, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular Target and Gene Therapy Products, National Institute of Health Sciences, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Life Sciences, Graduate School of Life and Medical Sciences, Doshisha University, Kyotanabe, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],20171205,England,Genes Cells,Genes to cells : devoted to molecular & cellular mechanisms,9607379,"['0 (Cardiolipins)', '555-60-2 (Carbonyl Cyanide m-Chlorophenyl Hydrazone)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,,"['Carbonyl Cyanide m-Chlorophenyl Hydrazone/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cardiolipins/*metabolism', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mitophagy/*drug effects', '*Pleckstrin Homology Domains', 'Protein Transport']",,,2017/12/06 06:00,2018/06/05 06:00,['2017/12/06 06:00'],"['2017/09/29 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/05 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/gtc.12544 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Cells. 2018 Jan;23(1):22-34. doi: 10.1111/gtc.12544.

Primary: To compare the toxicity of TCH in current clinical practice vs the toxicity observed in the pivotal study, comparing the toxicity in patients that received primary prophylaxis (PP) with colony-stimulating factors vs those that did not receive PP. Secondary: To describe the demographic and clinical characteristics of the study sample, as well as the adverse effects and survival. The data regarding 95 patients were analyzed. Observed toxicity (hematological and extra-hematological) was greater compared to the pivotal study, with the exception of neuropathy and neutropenia. Toxicities ""PP"" vs ""no PP"": Extra-hematological grade 3-4 toxicities: Significant reduction was observed in the ""PP"" group vs the ""no PP"" group referred to fatigue, stomatitis, nausea, and vomiting. Hematological grade 3-4 toxicities: Lesser neutropenia, leukopenia, and febrile neutropenia were observed in the ""PP"" group. Complications associated to treatment: No grade 3-4 cardiac toxicity, leukemia or deaths were recorded. DFS and OS: After a mean follow-up of 22.9 months, only one bone metastatic relapse was detected (DFS: 98.9%; OS: 100%). The combination TCH is very active and effective as adjuvant and neo-adjuvant therapy in Her2-positive breast cancer, and is currently regarded as standard treatment. However, global toxicity as well as hematological toxicity is elevated. The incorporation of PP to TCH significantly reduces hematological toxicity and some of the global toxicity, thus favoring treatment implementation and lessening the clinical complications. We therefore recommend generalization of PP with colony-stimulating factors in patients receiving TCH.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Bayo, Juan', 'Avino, Victoria', 'Toscano, Fatima', 'Jimenez, Francisco']","['Bayo J', 'Avino V', 'Toscano F', 'Jimenez F']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Complejo Hospitalario de Huelva, Huelva, Spain.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Complejo Hospitalario de Huelva, Huelva, Spain.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Complejo Hospitalario de Huelva, Huelva, Spain.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Complejo Hospitalario de Huelva, Huelva, Spain.']",['eng'],,,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20171205,United States,Breast J,The breast journal,9505539,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '15H5577CQD (Docetaxel)', 'BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ERBB2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)', 'P188ANX8CK (Trastuzumab)']",IM,['Breast J. 2018 Jul;24(4):459-461.

This report describes the survival of children with ALL in the United States using the most comprehensive and up-to-date cancer registry data. METHODS: Data from 37 state cancer registries that cover approximately 80% of the US population were used. Age-standardized survival up to 5 years was estimated for children aged 0-14 years who were diagnosed with ALL during 2 periods (2001-2003 and 2004-2009). RESULTS: In total, 17,500 children with ALL were included. The pooled age-standardized net survival estimates for all US registries combined were 95% at 1 year, 90% at 3 years, and 86% at 5 years for children diagnosed during 2001-2003, and 96%, 91%, and 88%, respectively, for those diagnosed during 2004-2009. Black children who were diagnosed during 2001-2003 had lower 5-year survival (84%) than white children (87%) and had less improvement in survival by 2004-2009. For those diagnosed during 2004-2009, the 1-year and 5-year survival estimates were 96% and 89%, respectively, for white children and 96% and 84%, respectively, for black children. During 2004-2009, survival was highest among children aged 1 to 4 years (95%) and lowest among children aged <1 year (60%). CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicate that overall net survival from childhood ALL in the United States is high, but disparities by race still exist, especially beyond the first year after diagnosis. Clinical and public health strategies are needed to improve health care access, clinical trial enrollment, treatment, and survivorship care for children with ALL. Cancer 2017;123:5178-89.

No studies have evaluated whether the latency time between the first malignancy (the primary malignancy [PM]) and the SPM affects cancer-specific survival (CSS). METHODS: A multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression with Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data for 13 regions from 1992 to 2008 was used to ascertain whether the latency time (1-5 vs >/= 6 years) to the development of an SPM affected the CSS and overall survival with respect to either the PM or SPM for AYAs with common SPMs. RESULTS: The majority of 1515 AYAs with an SPM had their PM diagnosed between the ages of 26 and 39 years (74.2%) and an SPM diagnosed within 1 to 5 years (72.9%) of the PM's diagnosis. Overall, AYAs that developed an SPM 1 to 5 years after the diagnosis (vs >/= 6 years) had an increased risk of death from cancer (hazard ratio [HR], 2.52; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.92-3.29) as well as any cause (HR, 2.60; 95% CI, 2.04-3.32). Specifically, for AYAs with an SPM that was leukemia or a colorectal, breast, or central nervous system malignancy, a shorter latency time (1-5 years) from their PM diagnosis was associated with an overall significantly increased risk of death (2.6-fold) from either their PM or that particular SPM. However, latency did not appear to affect the CSS with respect to either the PM or SPM for AYA patients with a lymphoma or sarcoma SPM. CONCLUSIONS: Most AYAs who develop an SPM do so within 1 to 5 years of their primary cancer diagnosis, and they have an increased risk of death from cancer in comparison with AYAs with an SPM developing after longer survivorship intervals.

In the current study, we described the prevalence of sedentary behaviors in survivors of ALL and examined associations between time spent sedentary and body composition and onset of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. METHODS: Participants' self-reported screen time (eg, television, computer) and activity as measured by accelerometer were used to determine activity time (sedentary, light activity, and moderate or vigorous physical activity). The percentage of time spent in each activity was compared between 331 survivors of ALL and 330 controls. Associations between time sedentary and body composition were evaluated in survivors using linear regression models. Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine the association between time sedentary at baseline and CVD risk factor onset during follow-up. RESULTS: Survivors spent approximately 65% of their time sedentary, 32% in light activity, and 2% in moderate or vigorous physical activity compared with 67% (P = .04), 30% (P<.01), and 3% (P<.01), respectively, in controls. Among survivors, percentage lean body mass decreased by 1.0% +/- 0.4% (P = .01) per 10% increase in time sedentary. Survivors who were sedentary >/=60% per day were found to be at an increased risk of high total cholesterol (hazard ratio, 2.52; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-5.64) and any CVD risk factor (hazard ratio, 1.96; 95% confidence interval, 1.16-3.30).

Recent research of normal and leukemia BM microenvironments has revealed several key components of specific niches that provide a sanctuary where subpopulations of leukemia cells evade chemotherapy-induced death and acquire a drug-resistant phenotype, as well as the molecular pathways critical for microenvironment/leukemia interactions. Although the biology of LSCs shares many similarities with that of normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), LSCs are able to outcompete HSCs and hijack BM niches. Increasing evidence indicates that these niches fuel the growth of leukemia cells and contribute to therapeutic resistance and the metastatic potential of leukemia cells by shielding LSCs. Not only ""microenvironment-induced oncogenesis,"" but also a ""malignancy-induced microenvironment"" have been proposed.

METHODS: Data on serum asparaginase activities of 124 children from three clinical studies were included in the analysis, covering an age range from 3 days to 17 years. Most patients received 5000 U/m(2) rASNase intravenously every 3 days. The non-linear mixed effects modelling software (NONMEM((R))) was utilized to identify drivers of rASNase pharmacokinetics in children. Different dose adjustments were simulated for their ability to increase rASNase trough activities in children who do not reach the threshold of 100 U/L. RESULTS: A two-compartment model with allometric weight scaling (0.75 on clearance [CL] and inter-compartmental clearance [Q] and 1 on central [V 1] and peripheral [V 2] volume of distribution) was the best model to describe the pharmacokinetics of rASNase. PK parameters for the median child (19.5 kg) were: CL = 0.0592 L/h, V 1 = 1.18 L, Q = 0.307 L/h, V 2 = 0.316 L. Organ functions, such as liver or kidney function and laboratory values, such as fibrinogen or antithrombin III levels, showed no influence on rASNase pharmacokinetics. In simulations, changing the administration interval from 72 to 48 h was appropriate to maintain rASNase activities above the therapeutic threshold, in patients with activities below 100 U/L 72 h after the first dose.

Genetic susceptibility to benzene toxicity in humans may be related to variations in benzene metabolizing genes. The main objective of this study was to ascertain whether polymorphism of GSTP1, GSTM1, GSTT1 and CYP2E1 genes might influence susceptibility to the adverse effects of benzene among employees of a petrochemical plant. In this cross-sectional study, 124 employees of a petrochemical plant who had been occupationally exposed to benzene and had one or more abnormal hematological parameter (cases) and 184 subjects with a similar exposure scenario, free from any abnormal hematological parameters (referent) were studied. Atmospheric concentrations of benzene were measured and GSTM1 and GSTT1 genotypes were evaluated using the multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. Additionally, GSTP1 and CYP2E1 genotypes were determined by PCR- restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). The frequency of null GSTT1 genotype in cases was significantly higher than that of referent group (32.3 vs. 18.5%, OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.23-3.56, p = 0.004). The mean value of platelets in subjects with null GSTT1 genotype was significantly lower than that of individuals with positive GSTT1 genotype (p = 0.015). Conversely, the mean value of leukocytes was significantly higher in subjects with null GSTM1 genotype as compared to those with positive GSTM1 genotype (p = 0.026). Logistic regression analysis showed that, subjects with null GSTT1 genotype had a significantly higher risk for hematological disorders, as compared to those with positive GSTT1 genotype (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.23-3.56). Moreover, subjects with both null GSTT1 and GSTM1 genotypes had a significantly higher risk for hematological disorders as compared to subjects with positive GSTT1 and GSTM1 genotypes (OR 2.35, 95% CI 1.14-4.8). The results of this study showed that, individuals carrying null GSTT1 or both null STT1 and GSTM1 genotypes had a higher risk and were more susceptible to benzene-induced hematological disorders.",,"['Nourozi, Mohamad Amin', 'Neghab, Masoud', 'Bazzaz, Javad Tavakkoly', 'Nejat, Saharnaz', 'Mansoori, Yaser', 'Shahtaheri, Seyed Jamaleddin']","['Nourozi MA', 'Neghab M', 'Bazzaz JT', 'Nejat S', 'Mansoori Y', 'Shahtaheri SJ']","['Department of Occupational Health Engineering, School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Occupational Health Engineering, Research Center for Health Sciences, Institute of Health, School of Health, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Knowledge Utilization Research Center (KURC), Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Non-communicable Diseases Research Center, Fasa University of Medical Sciences, Fasa, Iran.', 'Department of Occupational Health Engineering, School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. shahtaheri@tums.ac.ir.']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],20171204,Germany,Arch Toxicol,Archives of toxicology,0417615,"['0 (Air Pollutants, Occupational)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (CYP2F1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P450 Family 2)', 'EC 2.5.1.- (glutathione S-transferase T1)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (GSTP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione S-Transferase pi)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (glutathione S-transferase M1)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Air Pollutants, Occupational/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Benzene/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Cytochrome P450 Family 2/genetics', 'Erythrocytes/drug effects', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Glutathione S-Transferase pi/genetics', 'Glutathione Transferase/genetics', 'Hematologic Diseases/blood/*chemically induced', 'Hemoglobins/analysis', 'Humans', 'Iran', 'Leukocytes/drug effects', 'Logistic Models', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects/analysis', '*Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Risk']",PMC6002464,,2017/12/06 06:00,2019/09/04 06:00,['2017/12/06 06:00'],"['2017/09/16 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/04 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00204-017-2104-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s00204-017-2104-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Arch Toxicol. 2018 Jun;92(6):1983-1990. doi: 10.1007/s00204-017-2104-9.

An accurate process for recognizing leukocytes is to evaluate a blood smear under a microscope by an expert. Since, this procedure is manual, time-consuming and tedious, making the procedure automatic would overcome these problems. In an automated CAD (Computer-Aided-Design) system for this purpose, a crucial module is leukocytes recognition. In this paper, we are looking for the best features in order to recognize five types of leukocytes (Monocyte, Lymphocyte, Neutrophil, Eosinophil and Basophil) from microscopic images of blood smear in an automated cell counting system. Methods: In this work, we focus on the texture features and seven categories: GLCM features, Haralick features, Spectral texture features, Wavelet-based features, Gabor-based features, CoALBP and RICLBP are analyzed to find the best features for leukocytes detection. The best features of each category are selected using stepwise regression and finally three well-known classifiers called K-NN, LDA and NB are utilized for classification. Results: The proposed system is tested on a self-provided dataset composed of 200 cell images. In our experiments, to evaluate the process, the accuracy of each leukocyte type and the mean accuracy are computed. RICLBP features achieved the best mean accuracy (85.53%) for LDA classifier. Conclusions: In our experiments, although the maximum mean accuracy (85.53%) went with RICLBP features, but the accuracies of all five leukocyte types weren't maximized for RICLBP features. This result directs us to design and develop a system based on multiple features and multiple classifiers to maximize the accuracies even for each individual cell type in our future work.",,"['Sarrafzadeh, Omid', 'Dehnavi, Alireza M', 'Banaem, Hossein Y', 'Talebi, Ardeshir', 'Gharibi, Arshin']","['Sarrafzadeh O', 'Dehnavi AM', 'Banaem HY', 'Talebi A', 'Gharibi A']","['Department of Biomedical Engineering, Mashhad Branch, Islamic Azad University, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Medical Image and Signal Processing Research Center, Albuquerque.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, School of Advanced Technologies in Medicine, Albuquerque.', 'Medical Image and Signal Processing Research Center, Albuquerque.', 'Medical Image and Signal Processing Research Center, Albuquerque.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Albuquerque.', 'Medical Image and Signal Processing Research Center, Albuquerque.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, PhD student at UNM, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque.']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],,India,J Med Signals Sens,Journal of medical signals and sensors,101577416,,,,,PMC5691561,,2017/12/06 06:00,2017/12/06 06:01,['2017/12/06 06:00'],"['2017/12/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/06 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,J Med Signals Sens. 2017 Oct-Dec;7(4):220-227.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Automatic leukocytes recognition', 'best texture features', 'blood smear', 'computer-aided design (CAD) system', 'microscopic images']",,['There are no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unlike leukemia, management of CNS tumors requires a good multidisciplinary team. Higher rates of treatment abandonment are documented in view of complexity of the treatment with long duration, involving neurosurgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and high cost of treatment. Morbidity associated with CNS tumors may be significant in terms of physical deficits as well as neuropsychological and neuroendocrine sequelae. Pediatric neurooncology is still at a very nascent stage in the developing countries. There are only a few reports on the multidisciplinary approach and outcomes of pediatric brain tumors in developing countries. Aims: The aim of this study is to identify the clinicopathological profile of Pediatric CNS tumors in a tertiary care center located in South India in comparison with reports from other low-and middle-income Countries. Settings and Design: A retrospective analysis of medical records of all children diagnosed with brain tumors from January 2012 to November 2016 at our institute was done. Subjects and Methods: A retrospective study of clinical, pathological profile, and outcomes of children <18 years diagnosed with brain tumors at our institute from January 2012 to November 2016 was done. Histopathological categorization was done as per the WHO classification 2007. The multidisciplinary treatment with respect to surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy was noted and the outcomes were recorded. Statistical Analysis Used: R for Statistical Computing (Version 3.0.2; 2013-09-25). Results: A total of 52 children were diagnosed with male preponderance of 66.6%. Highest incidence was noted in the age group of 0-4 years (50%). Majority of them were supratentorial (59.6%). CNS embryonal tumors contributed to 48% of all our brain tumors. 73% of them underwent either resection or biopsy. Eight (15.3%) of them died due to the progression of disease, but 44% abandoned treatment due to the progression/recurrence of disease. Those lost to follow-up were mostly among the high-risk groups with poor prognosis such as pontine glioma, medulloblastoma (high risk), and primitive neuroectodermal tumor. Conclusions: Although brain tumors constituted 30% of all our solid tumors, only 56% of them received appropriate treatment and 25% abandoned treatment. High rates of abandonment were a consequence of late diagnosis, complex multidisciplinary treatment involved, high treatment cost, lack of uniformity in management between different oncology centers and poor prognosis of the tumor subtype.",,"['Suresh, Supriya Gujjar', 'Srinivasan, Arathi', 'Scott, Julius Xavier', 'Rao, Santosh Mohan', 'Chidambaram, Balasubramaniam', 'Chandrasekar, Sanjay']","['Suresh SG', 'Srinivasan A', 'Scott JX', 'Rao SM', 'Chidambaram B', 'Chandrasekar S']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Kanchi Kamakoti CHILDS Trust Hospital and the CHILDS Trust Medical Research Foundation, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Kanchi Kamakoti CHILDS Trust Hospital and the CHILDS Trust Medical Research Foundation, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Kanchi Kamakoti CHILDS Trust Hospital and the CHILDS Trust Medical Research Foundation, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.', 'Department of Pediatric Neurosurgery, Kanchi Kamakoti CHILDS Trust Hospital and the CHILDS Trust Medical Research Foundation, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.', 'Department of Pediatric Neurosurgery, Kanchi Kamakoti CHILDS Trust Hospital and the CHILDS Trust Medical Research Foundation, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.', 'Department of Radiation-Oncology, Apollo Speciality Hospital, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],,India,J Pediatr Neurosci,Journal of pediatric neurosciences,101273794,,,,,PMC5696660,,2017/12/06 06:00,2017/12/06 06:01,['2017/12/06 06:00'],"['2017/12/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/06 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/jpn.JPN_31_17 [doi]', 'JPN-12-237 [pii]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Neurosci. 2017 Jul-Sep;12(3):237-244. doi: 10.4103/jpn.JPN_31_17.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Childhood brain tumors', 'low- income country', 'outcomes']",,['There are no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Up to now, the majority of KMT2A variants are non-sense and frameshift variants causing a typical form of Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome. We studied KMT2A gene in a cohort of 200 patients with unexplained syndromic and non-syndromic ID and identified four novel variants, one splice and three missense variants, possibly deleterious. We used primary cells from the patients and molecular approaches to determine the deleterious effects of those variants on KMT2A expression and function. For the putative splice variant c.11322-1G>A, we showed that it led to only one nucleotide deletion and loss of the C-terminal part of the protein.

METHODS: Pyrosequencing was used to detect JAK2(V617F) mutational status and measure allele burden, while MPL (exon 10) mutations were analysed by PCR assay and then by direct sequencing. CALR exon 9 mutations were first screened for length changes by GeneScan followed by sequencing. The allele burden of the mutated CALR gene was measured by pyrosequencing. The EEC assay was conducted using a serum-free culture system. RESULTS: The frequencies of the three driver mutations and triple-negative status were similarly distributed between pre-PMF and overt PMF patients, except that pre-PMF patients had a higher incidence of CALR type 2/type-2 like mutations and a lower JAK2(V617F) allele burden. EEC growth and CALR mutations conferred favourable overall survival (OS). A lower JAK2(V617F) allele burden and grade 3 bone marrow fibrosis were associated with shorter OS and decreased leukaemia-free survival (LFS). Type 2/type 2-like CAL mutations were associated with better LFS compared with type1/type 1-like mutations. Patients with triple-negative mutation status had significantly worse OS and LFS. The allele burden of CALR mutations remained unchanged, while some JAK2(V617F) mutations showed clonal expansion in patients during secondary acute myeloid leukaemia transformation. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that EEC growth, a higher JAK2(V617F) allele burden and CALR mutations, especially type 2, were independent predictors for better outcomes in PMF. The allele burden of CALR mutations remained stable, but the allele burden of JAK2(V617F)mutations was variable during leukaemia transformation.","['(c) Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text', 'of the article) 2018.

Early somatic changes may not be detectable or are found by chance in apparently healthy individuals. The same lesions may be detected in pre-malignant clonal conditions. In some patients, these lesions may never become relevant clinically whereas in others, they act together with additional pro-oncogenic hits and thereby contribute to the formation of an overt malignancy. Although some pre-malignant stages of a malignancy have been characterized, no global system to define and to classify these conditions is available. To discuss open issues related to pre-malignant phases of neoplastic disorders, a working conference was organized in Vienna in August 2015. The outcomes of this conference are summarized herein and include a basic proposal for a nomenclature and classification of pre-malignant conditions. This proposal should assist in the communication among patients, physicians and scientists, which is critical as genome-sequencing will soon be offered widely for early cancer-detection.",['Copyright (c) 2017 The Authors.

Caloric restriction in vivo or serum deprivation (SD) in vitro has been shown to be an effective tool for sensitizing cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs. However, the detailed mechanisms underlying the enhancement of apoptosis in cancer cells by SD remain to be elucidated. METHODS: Flow cytometry, caspase activity assay and western blotting were used for cell death rate evaluation. Western blotting, gel-filtration, siRNA approach and qRT-PCR were used to elucidate the mechanism underlying cell death potentiation upon SD. RESULTS: We demonstrated that SD sensitizes cancer cells to treatment with chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin. This effect is independent on activation of caspases-2 and -8, apical caspases triggering apoptosis in response to genotoxic stress. SD potentiates cell death via downregulation of the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1. In fact, SD reduces the Mcl-1 mRNA level, which consequently decreases the Mcl-1 protein level and renders cells more susceptible to apoptosis induction via the formation of apoptosome. CONCLUSIONS: Mcl-1 protein is an important regulator of sensitivity of cancer cells to apoptotic stimuli upon SD. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: This study identifies Mcl-1 as a new target for the sensitization of human cancer cells to cell death by SD, which is of great significance for the development of efficient anti-cancer therapies.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

METHODS: The investigation was performed in vitro by administering each compound into rat peritoneal MCs and rat basophilic leukemia-2H3 cells followed by activation with 50 mug/mL of compound 48/80 or 1 muM of ionomycin. The concentration of histamine released from each group was measured by a high-performance liquid chromatography-fluorometry system with post-column derivatization using o-phthalaldehyde. RESULTS: 8-Hydroxyisocapnolactone-2-3-diol inhibited degranulation of compound 48/80 activated-rat peritoneal MCs with the histamine release percentages of 74.57%, 72.21% and 51.79% when the 10 muM, 30 muM and 100 muM concentrations were used, respectively. Where as about 81% histamine was released by the control group. Degranulation inhibition ability was also observed in ionomycin-activated rat basophilic leukemia-2H3 cells. In contrast, friedelin failed to inhibit degranulation in either cell type. The inhibition of 8-hydroxyisocapnolactone-2-3-diol was not related to the depletion of histamine synthesis as implied by the total histamine measurement. CONCLUSIONS: These results exhibit the promising of 8-hydroxyisocapnolactone-2-3-diol is a potential parent structure for developing a MCs stabilizer.","['Copyright (c) 2017 Hainan Medical University.

Previous reports have indicated that CCL1 is overexpressed in adult T-cell leukemia cells, mediating an autocrine anti-apoptotic loop. Because CCL1 is also known as a potent chemoattractant that plays a major role in inflammatory processes, we investigated the role of CCL1 in the pathogenesis of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1)-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). RESULTS: The results showed that: (1) CCL1 was preferentially expressed in HAM/TSP-derived HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines, (2) CCL1 expression was induced along with Tax expression in the Tax-inducible T-cell line JPX9, (3) transient Tax expression in an HTLV-1-negative T-cell line activated the CCL1 gene promoter, (4) plasma levels of CCL1 were significantly higher in patients with HAM/TSP than in HTLV-1-seronegative patients with multiple sclerosis and HTLV-1-infected asymptomatic healthy carriers, and (5) minocycline inhibited the production of CCL1 in HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines. CONCLUSIONS: The present results suggest that elevated CCL1 levels may be associated with the pathogenesis of HAM/TSP. Although further studies are required to determine the in vivo significance, minocycline may be considered as a potential candidate for the long-term treatment of HAM/TSP via its anti-inflammatory effects, which includes the inhibition of CCL1 expression.",,"['Saito, Mineki', 'Sejima, Hiroe', 'Naito, Tadasuke', 'Ushirogawa, Hiroshi', 'Matsuzaki, Toshio', 'Matsuura, Eiji', 'Tanaka, Yuetsu', 'Nakamura, Tatsufumi', 'Takashima, Hiroshi']","['Saito M', 'Sejima H', 'Naito T', 'Ushirogawa H', 'Matsuzaki T', 'Matsuura E', 'Tanaka Y', 'Nakamura T', 'Takashima H']","['Department of Microbiology, Kawasaki Medical School, 577 Matsushima, Okayama, 701-0192, Japan. mineki@med.kawasaki-m.ac.jp.', 'Department of Microbiology, Kawasaki Medical School, 577 Matsushima, Okayama, 701-0192, Japan.', 'Department of Microbiology, Kawasaki Medical School, 577 Matsushima, Okayama, 701-0192, Japan.', 'Department of Microbiology, Kawasaki Medical School, 577 Matsushima, Okayama, 701-0192, Japan.', 'Department of Neurology and Geriatrics, Kagoshima University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, 8-35-1 Sakuragaoka, Kagoshima, 890-8520, Japan.', 'Department of Neurology and Geriatrics, Kagoshima University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, 8-35-1 Sakuragaoka, Kagoshima, 890-8520, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, 207 Uehara, Okinawa, 903-0215, Japan.', 'Department of Social Work, Faculty of Human and Social Studies, Nagasaki International University, 2825-7 Huis Ten Bosch Machi, Sasebo, Nagasaki, 859-3298, Japan.', 'Department of Neurology and Geriatrics, Kagoshima University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, 8-35-1 Sakuragaoka, Kagoshima, 890-8520, Japan.']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],20171204,England,Virol J,Virology journal,101231645,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Chemokine CCL1)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Receptors, CCR8)', 'FYY3R43WGO (Minocycline)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line', 'Chemokine CCL1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/*drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Minocycline/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/drug therapy/*physiopathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, CCR8/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects', 'Up-Regulation/*genetics']",PMC5715538,,2017/12/06 06:00,2018/07/18 06:00,['2017/12/06 06:00'],"['2017/08/27 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12985-017-0902-6 [doi]', '10.1186/s12985-017-0902-6 [pii]']",epublish,Virol J. 2017 Dec 4;14(1):234. doi: 10.1186/s12985-017-0902-6.,,['NOTNLM'],"['*CCL1', '*HAM/TSP', '*HTLV-1', '*Minocycline', '*Tax']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-8208-5586'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

C-reactive protein (CRP) is a plasma protein whose levels can rise to 1000 mug/ml from the normal <3 mug/ ml during inflammation. RESULTS: We find that CRP inhibits proliferation of the human myeloid leukemia cell line Mono Mac 6 with an IC50 of 75 mug/ ml by inducing apoptosis of these cells. The related proteins serum amyloid P (SAP) and pentraxin 3 (PTX3) do not inhibit Mono Mac 6 proliferation. CRP has no significant effect on the proliferation of other leukemia cell lines such as HL-60, Mono Mac 1, K562, U937, or THP-1, or the survival of normal peripheral blood cells. The effect of CRP appears to be dependent on the CRP receptor FcgammaRI, and is negatively regulated by a phosphatidylinositol -3-kinase pathway.

The efficacy of these drugs is frequently undermined by acquired resistance. One mechanism of proteasome inhibitor resistance may involve the transcription factor Nuclear Factor, Erythroid 2 Like 1 (NFE2L1, also referred to as Nrf1), which responds to proteasome insufficiency or pharmacological inhibition by upregulating proteasome subunit gene expression. This ""bounce-back"" response is achieved through a unique mechanism. Nrf1 is constitutively translocated into the ER lumen, N-glycosylated, and then targeted for proteasomal degradation via the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. Proteasome inhibition leads to accumulation of cytosolic Nrf1, which is then processed to form the active transcription factor. Here we show that the cytosolic enzyme N-glycanase 1 (NGLY1, the human PNGase) is essential for Nrf1 activation in response to proteasome inhibition. Chemical or genetic disruption of NGLY1 activity results in the accumulation of misprocessed Nrf1 that is largely excluded from the nucleus. Under these conditions, Nrf1 is inactive in regulating proteasome subunit gene expression in response to proteasome inhibition. Through a small molecule screen, we identified a cell-active NGLY1 inhibitor that disrupts the processing and function of Nrf1. The compound potentiates the cytotoxicity of carfilzomib, a clinically used proteasome inhibitor, against MM and T cell-derived acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cell lines. Thus, NGLY1 inhibition prevents Nrf1 activation and represents a new therapeutic approach for cancers that depend on proteasome homeostasis.",,"['Tomlin, Frederick M', 'Gerling-Driessen, Ulla I M', 'Liu, Yi-Chang', 'Flynn, Ryan A', 'Vangala, Janakiram R', 'Lentz, Christian S', 'Clauder-Muenster, Sandra', 'Jakob, Petra', 'Mueller, William F', 'Ordonez-Rueda, Diana', 'Paulsen, Malte', 'Matsui, Naoko', 'Foley, Deirdre', 'Rafalko, Agnes', 'Suzuki, Tadashi', 'Bogyo, Matthew', 'Steinmetz, Lars M', 'Radhakrishnan, Senthil K', 'Bertozzi, Carolyn R']","['Tomlin FM', 'Gerling-Driessen UIM', 'Liu YC', 'Flynn RA', 'Vangala JR', 'Lentz CS', 'Clauder-Muenster S', 'Jakob P', 'Mueller WF', 'Ordonez-Rueda D', 'Paulsen M', 'Matsui N', 'Foley D', 'Rafalko A', 'Suzuki T', 'Bogyo M', 'Steinmetz LM', 'Radhakrishnan SK', 'Bertozzi CR']","['Department of Chemistry, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.', 'Department of Chemistry, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.', 'Department of Chemistry, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.', 'Department of Chemistry, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.', 'Department of Pathology, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia 23298, United States.', 'Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, 300 Pasteur Drive, Stanford, California 94305, United States.', 'Genome Biology Unit, European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), 69117 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Genome Biology Unit, European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), 69117 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Genome Biology Unit, European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), 69117 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Genome Biology Unit, European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), 69117 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Genome Biology Unit, European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), 69117 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Glycomine, Inc., 953 Indiana Street, San Francisco, California 94107, United States.', 'Glycomine, Inc., 953 Indiana Street, San Francisco, California 94107, United States.', 'Glycomine, Inc., 953 Indiana Street, San Francisco, California 94107, United States.', 'Glycometabolome Team, Systems Glycobiology Research Group, RIKEN Global Research Cluster, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, 300 Pasteur Drive, Stanford, California 94305, United States.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine, 300 Pasteur Drive, Stanford, California 94305, United States.', 'Genome Biology Unit, European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), 69117 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Genetics, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.', 'Department of Pathology, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia 23298, United States.', 'Department of Chemistry, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Chevy Chase, Maryland 20815, United States.']",['eng'],,"['R00 CA154884/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA200423/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20171025,United States,ACS Cent Sci,ACS central science,101660035,,,,,PMC5704294,,2017/12/05 06:00,2017/12/05 06:01,['2017/12/05 06:00'],"['2017/05/26 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/05 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1021/acscentsci.7b00224 [doi]'],ppublish,ACS Cent Sci. 2017 Nov 22;3(11):1143-1155. doi: 10.1021/acscentsci.7b00224.

Endomitosis is an important process in which the cell replicates its DNA without cytokinesis and develops highly polyploid MK. In this study, to gain a better PLTs production, four small molecules (Rho-Rock inhibitor (RRI), nicotinamide (NIC), Src inhibitor (SI), and Aurora B inhibitor (ABI)) and their combinations were surveyed as MK culture supplements for promoting polyploidization. Three leukemia cell lines as well as primary mononuclear cells were chosen in the function and mechanism studies of the small molecules. In an optimal culture method, cells were treated with different small molecules and their combinations. The impact of the small molecules on megakaryocytic surface marker expression, polyploidy, proliferation, and apoptosis was examined for the best MK polyploidization supplement. The elaborate analysis confirmed that the combination of SI and RRI together with our MK induction system might result in efficient ploidy promotion. Our experiments demonstrated that, besides direct downregulation on the expression of cytoskeleton protein actin, SI and RRI could significantly enhance the level of cyclins through the suppression of p53 and p21.

Nilotinib is a more potent second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor and it inhibits the Src-family kinase LCK and hamper proliferation and function of CD8 (+) T lymphocytes. CD8 (+) T lymphocytes are the main cellular subset responsible for viral clearance in patients with HBV infection. We report a case of HBV reactivation under treatment with nilotinib. Fatal HBV reactivation is not usually related to death in chronic myeloid leukemia patients who have an expectation of longevity with well-tolerated oral drugs. Thus, screening for latent chronic HBV infections including assessment of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc antibody) and antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs), especially at countries with intermediate and high prevalence of HBsAg is warranted.

Decitabine is used in Europe for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in patients aged >/=65 years. However, it can only be administered intravenously due to very low oral bioavailability and a large distribution volume. Oral administration would allow outpatient treatment, improving quality of life and reducing treatment costs. The present study proposes to develop lipid nanocapsules (LNCs), originally designed for lipophilic drugs, to encapsulate decitabine. Two different formulations of LNCs were designed: LNCs based on a high proportion of Transcutol((R)) HP (THP-LNCs) and LNCs associated with a mixture of Transcutol((R)) HP and Tween((R)) 80 (THP-T80-LNCs). The second formulation had a diameter of 26.5+/-0.5 nm, high encapsulation efficiency (>85%), and a drug payload of 472+/-64 microg/mL. Decitabine-loaded THP-T80-LNC cytotoxicity was evaluated on two AML cell lines depending on their decitabine resistance: HEL (not resistant) and HL-60 (resistant). The permeability of decitabine-loaded THP-T80-LNCs was also evaluated on Caco-2 cell monolayers. Decitabine cytotoxicity against HEL and HL-60 was higher when decitabine was loaded in THP-T80-LNCs than when free. Apparent permeability on Caco-2 cell monolayers was also increased, suggesting a potentially useful formulation to increase the oral bioavailability of decitabine.",,"['Briot, Thomas', 'Roger, Emilie', 'Lautram, Nolwenn', 'Verger, Alexis', 'Clavreul, Anne', 'Lagarce, Frederic']","['Briot T', 'Roger E', 'Lautram N', 'Verger A', 'Clavreul A', 'Lagarce F']","['Micro & Nanomedecines Translationelles - MINT, UNIV Angers, INSERM 1066, CNRS 6021, Universite Bretagne Loire, MINT IBS-CHU.', 'Pharmacy Department, University Hospital of Angers.', 'Micro & Nanomedecines Translationelles - MINT, UNIV Angers, INSERM 1066, CNRS 6021, Universite Bretagne Loire, MINT IBS-CHU.', 'Micro & Nanomedecines Translationelles - MINT, UNIV Angers, INSERM 1066, CNRS 6021, Universite Bretagne Loire, MINT IBS-CHU.', 'Micro & Nanomedecines Translationelles - MINT, UNIV Angers, INSERM 1066, CNRS 6021, Universite Bretagne Loire, MINT IBS-CHU.', 'Neurosurgery Department, University Hospital of Angers.', ""CRCINA, INSERM, Universite de Nantes, Universite d'Angers, Angers, France."", 'Micro & Nanomedecines Translationelles - MINT, UNIV Angers, INSERM 1066, CNRS 6021, Universite Bretagne Loire, MINT IBS-CHU.', 'Pharmacy Department, University Hospital of Angers.']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],20171123,New Zealand,Int J Nanomedicine,International journal of nanomedicine,101263847,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Ethylene Glycols)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (Nanocapsules)', '0 (Polysorbates)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'A1A1I8X02B (carbitol)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,,"['Administration, Oral', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Azacitidine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics', 'Biological Availability', 'Caco-2 Cells', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Decitabine', 'Drug Carriers/administration & dosage/*chemistry', 'Drug Liberation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Drug Stability', 'Ethylene Glycols/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Lipids/chemistry', 'Nanocapsules/*administration & dosage/chemistry', 'Polysorbates/chemistry']",PMC5703174,,2017/12/05 06:00,2018/03/06 06:00,['2017/12/05 06:00'],"['2017/12/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/06 06:00 [medline]']","['10.2147/IJN.S147659 [doi]', 'ijn-12-8427 [pii]']",epublish,Int J Nanomedicine. 2017 Nov 23;12:8427-8442. doi: 10.2147/IJN.S147659. eCollection 2017.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Caco2 cells', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'decitabine', 'lipid nanocapsules', 'nanomedicine', 'nanoparticles', 'oral administration']",,['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We are presenting two cases of mixed phenotypic blastic hematolymphoid neoplasms without leukemic involvement at disease presentation in 8-year-old female and 21-year-old male patients. Both the cases had extralymphatic bone involvement in the form of solitary bone lesion. Initially, there was no leukemic involvement in both the cases, but the second case progressed to acute leukemia during the course of the disease. On immunophenotypic evaluation, both the cases revealed blasts showing unequivocal evidence of myeloid and B-lymphoid lineage commitment. These cases were difficult to categorize either into MPAL as the BM was not involved or into lymphoblastic lymphoma due to coexpression of myeloid differentiation. Therefore, we chose to classify them as a bi/mixed phenotypic blastic hematolymphoid neoplasm.

Over 100 BCR-ABL1 single-point mutations have been reported in patients with imatinib-resistant CML. There were few studies reported from India on BCR-ABL kinase mutations in imatinib failure patients. We present our data on imatinib resistance mutation analysis (IRMA) and use of imatinib dose hike and 2(nd)-generation TKI at our institute. Materials and Methods: All patients with a diagnosis of CML in a university hospital from June 2003 to July 2016 and who were tested for IRMA in view of imatinib failure, those in CP, and age <18 years were included in the study. Results: A total of 2110 cases of CML reviewed and 269 cases of CML with imatinib failure were analyzed. The male to female ratio was 1.7:1. The median age at presentation was 36 years (range: 18-66 years). Among these, 26% were primary failures and 74% were secondary failures. The treatment was modified either as imatinib dose hike or nilotinib/dasatinib. Molecular response at 12 months was achieved in 25.7% in imatinib dose hike, 46.6% in nilotinib, and 53.8% in dasatinib arms. The 4-year overall survival in mutation detected group was 37.5% and in nonmutated group was 87.7%. Conclusion: Imatinib-resistant mutations were more common in the cases with secondary failure though not statistically significant. T315I mutation was the common mutation found in the study.

Recently, European Treatment and Outcome Study (EUTOS) scoring system was introduced. Data on risk stratification in pediatric CML population was lacking due to its rarity (<3%). Objective: To study the effectiveness in predicting the response and outcome with three prognostic scores in pediatric CML-chronic phase patients on front line Imatinib. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the hospital records of newly diagnosed CML CP patients (aged </=18 years) from 2006 to 2010 for their risk score, cytogenetic response at 18 months and event free survival (EFS) at the end of 4 years. Events include loss of hematological response, loss of cytological response, progression to accelerated/blast phase (AP/BC). All received free Imatinib under Gleevac international patient assistance program. Results: Data of 106 children was analyzed with median age of 13.5 (ranged 5-18 years) and male preponderance (M:F = 1.14:1).

Aims and Objectives: This study aims to analyze the morphology, immunophenotype, cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities in around 200 patients of AML diagnosed over a period of 7 years at our institute and to determine relative frequency of various subtypes (based on FAB and WHO classification). An attempt to characterize the associations between hematological parameters, immunophenotype and these subtypes was also made. Materials and Methods: All cases diagnosed as AML on morphology, cytochemistry and/or immunophenotyping and tested for recurrent genetic abnormalities during period of Jan 2008-July 2014 were included in the study. Results: Age of presentation was younger in our AML patients as compared to western literature. Amongst FAB and WHO subtypes, M2 and t (15;17) PML-RARA were the most common groups respectively. As expected, CD33, CD13, were the most commonly expressed markers followed by HLA-DR, CD117, CD34 and CD14. Aberrant expression was seen in 62(41.6%) cases, most common was CD7 (15.4%), followed by CD56 (14.8%), CD19 (6.7%) and CD2 (4.7%). Significant associations between immunophenotypic markers and FAB subtypes as well as WHO subtypes were established. Conclusion: This is a hospital based study, giving a detailed account of frequencies of AML subtypes, hematological parameters and immunophenotypic markers in AML patients at our institute. Being a large and one of its kind study to establish significant associations between various haematological and immunophenotypic parameters with respective AML subtypes and genetic abnormalities, it might prove to be very useful in Indian setup where facilities for cytogenetic analysis are not available in many laboratories.",,"['Khera, Rachna', 'Ahmed, Faiq', 'Mundada, Manasi Chetan', 'Devi, Sandhya G', 'Murthy, Sudha S', 'Lavanya, Nambaru', 'Rajappa, Senthil J', 'Mallavarapu, Krishna Mohan', 'Santa, A']","['Khera R', 'Ahmed F', 'Mundada MC', 'Devi SG', 'Murthy SS', 'Lavanya N', 'Rajappa SJ', 'Mallavarapu KM', 'Santa A']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Basavatarakam Indo American Cancer Hospital and Research Institute, Hyderabad, Telangana, India.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Basavatarakam Indo American Cancer Hospital and Research Institute, Hyderabad, Telangana, India.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Basavatarakam Indo American Cancer Hospital and Research Institute, Hyderabad, Telangana, India.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Basavatarakam Indo American Cancer Hospital and Research Institute, Hyderabad, Telangana, India.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Basavatarakam Indo American Cancer Hospital and Research Institute, Hyderabad, Telangana, India.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Basavatarakam Indo American Cancer Hospital and Research Institute, Hyderabad, Telangana, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Basavatarakam Indo American Cancer Hospital and Research Institute, Hyderabad, Telangana, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Basavatarakam Indo American Cancer Hospital and Research Institute, Hyderabad, Telangana, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Basavatarakam Indo American Cancer Hospital and Research Institute, Hyderabad, Telangana, India.']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],,Germany,Indian J Med Paediatr Oncol,Indian journal of medical and paediatric oncology : official journal of Indian Society of Medical & Paediatric Oncology,9604571,,,,,PMC5686964,,2017/12/05 06:00,2017/12/05 06:01,['2017/12/05 06:00'],"['2017/12/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/05 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/ijmpo.ijmpo_89_16 [doi]', 'IJMPO-38-266 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Med Paediatr Oncol. 2017 Jul-Sep;38(3):266-272. doi: 10.4103/ijmpo.ijmpo_89_16.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'French-American-British', 'WHO', 'cytogenetics', 'immunophenotyping']",,['There are no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study evaluated whether treatment with DRE inhibited FcvarepsilonRI-mediated allergic responses in the RBL-2H3 mast cells and investigated the early- and late-phase mechanisms by which DRE exerts its antiallergic effects. IgE anti-DNP/DNP-HSA-sensitized RBL-2H3 mast cells were tested for cytotoxicity to DRE, followed by the assessment of beta-hexosaminidase release. We measured the amounts of inflammatory mediators (e.g., histamine, PGD2, TNF-alpha, IL-4, and IL-6) and examined the expression of genes involved in arachidonate and FcepsilonRI signaling pathways. In addition, we confirmed the antiallergic effects of DRE on passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) in mice. DRE inhibited RBL-2H3 mast cell degranulation and production of allergic mediators in them. In early allergic responses, DRE reduced expression of FcepsilonRI signaling-related genes (e.g., Syk, Lyn, and Fyn) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation in mast cells. In late allergic responses, DRE reduced PGD2 release and COX-2 expression and cPLA2 phosphorylation in FcvarepsilonRI-mediated mast cells. Lastly, 250-500 mg/kg DRE significantly attenuated the IgE-induced PCA reaction in mice. These findings provide novel information on the molecular mechanisms underlying the antiallergic effects of DRE in FcvarepsilonRI-mediated allergic responses.",,"['Do, Hyun Ju', 'Oh, Tae Woo', 'Yang, Ju Hye', 'Park, Kwang Il', 'Ma, Jin Yeul']","['Do HJ', 'Oh TW', 'Yang JH', 'Park KI', 'Ma JY']","['Korean Medicine (KM)-Application Center, Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine (KIOM), 70 Cheomdan-ro, Dong-gu, Daegu 41062, Republic of Korea.', 'Korean Medicine (KM)-Application Center, Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine (KIOM), 70 Cheomdan-ro, Dong-gu, Daegu 41062, Republic of Korea.', 'Korean Medicine (KM)-Application Center, Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine (KIOM), 70 Cheomdan-ro, Dong-gu, Daegu 41062, Republic of Korea.', 'Korean Medicine (KM)-Application Center, Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine (KIOM), 70 Cheomdan-ro, Dong-gu, Daegu 41062, Republic of Korea.', 'Korean Medicine (KM)-Application Center, Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine (KIOM), 70 Cheomdan-ro, Dong-gu, Daegu 41062, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],20171019,United States,Mediators Inflamm,Mediators of inflammation,9209001,"['0 (Anti-Allergic Agents)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '820484N8I3 (Histamine)', 'RXY07S6CZ2 (Prostaglandin D2)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Anti-Allergic Agents/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Histamine/metabolism', 'Interleukin-4/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mast Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Passive Cutaneous Anaphylaxis/drug effects', 'Plant Extracts/*chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Plants, Medicinal/chemistry', 'Polypodiaceae/*chemistry', 'Prostaglandin D2/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",PMC5671741,,2017/12/05 06:00,2018/07/10 06:00,['2017/12/05 06:00'],"['2017/07/10 00:00 [received]', '2017/09/18 00:00 [revised]', '2017/10/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2017/8701650 [doi]'],ppublish,Mediators Inflamm. 2017;2017:8701650. doi: 10.1155/2017/8701650.

This review discusses current concepts related to minimal residual disease (MRD), which is defined as submicroscopic disease detected during morphologic complete remission. The focus is on acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Basic methods for detecting MRD include flow cytometry, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and mutation analysis. Several studies using these assays have demonstrated prognostic implications based on MRD-positive vs MRD-negative status. As our understanding of the biological factors responsible for MRD in AML evolves, residual disease should be evaluated in the context of other prognostic markers. Current therapeutic options for managing MRD in AML are limited, and the clinical implications of a positive MRD test result can be significant. Regarding individual patients, an evidence-based approach must be applied while the institution- and assay-specific differences that currently exist are considered. Challenges associated with MRD assessment, such as the limited standardization of available assays and the paucity of effective agents to eradicate MRD, will need to be overcome before physicians who treat leukemia can use MRD as a tool for clinical management.",,"['Benton, Christopher B', 'Ravandi, Farhad']","['Benton CB', 'Ravandi F']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol,Clinical advances in hematology & oncology : H&O,101167661,,IM,,"['Animals', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Disease Management', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics/*therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis/genetics/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,,2017/12/05 06:00,2018/07/24 06:00,['2017/12/05 06:00'],"['2017/12/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/24 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol. 2017 Nov;15(11):859-867.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most frequent STAT5B mutation, Asp642His (N642H), has been found in over 90 leukemia and lymphoma patients. Here, we used the Vav1 promoter to generate transgenic mouse models that expressed either human STAT5B or STAT5BN642H in the hematopoietic compartment. While STAT5B-expressing mice lacked a hematopoietic phenotype, the STAT5BN642H-expressing mice rapidly developed T cell neoplasms. Neoplasia manifested as transplantable CD8+ lymphoma or leukemia, indicating that the STAT5BN642H mutation drives cancer development. Persistent and enhanced levels of STAT5BN642H tyrosine phosphorylation in transformed CD8+ T cells led to profound changes in gene expression that were accompanied by alterations in DNA methylation at potential histone methyltransferase EZH2-binding sites. Aurora kinase genes were enriched in STAT5BN642H-expressing CD8+ T cells, which were exquisitely sensitive to JAK and Aurora kinase inhibitors. Together, our data suggest that JAK and Aurora kinase inhibitors should be further explored as potential therapeutics for lymphoma and leukemia patients with the STAT5BN642H mutation who respond poorly to conventional chemotherapy.",,"['Pham, Ha Thi Thanh', 'Maurer, Barbara', 'Prchal-Murphy, Michaela', 'Grausenburger, Reinhard', 'Grundschober, Eva', 'Javaheri, Tahereh', 'Nivarthi, Harini', 'Boersma, Auke', 'Kolbe, Thomas', 'Elabd, Mohamed', 'Halbritter, Florian', 'Pencik, Jan', 'Kazemi, Zahra', 'Grebien, Florian', 'Hengstschlager, Markus', 'Kenner, Lukas', 'Kubicek, Stefan', 'Farlik, Matthias', 'Bock, Christoph', 'Valent, Peter', 'Muller, Mathias', 'Rulicke, Thomas', 'Sexl, Veronika', 'Moriggl, Richard']","['Pham HTT', 'Maurer B', 'Prchal-Murphy M', 'Grausenburger R', 'Grundschober E', 'Javaheri T', 'Nivarthi H', 'Boersma A', 'Kolbe T', 'Elabd M', 'Halbritter F', 'Pencik J', 'Kazemi Z', 'Grebien F', 'Hengstschlager M', 'Kenner L', 'Kubicek S', 'Farlik M', 'Bock C', 'Valent P', 'Muller M', 'Rulicke T', 'Sexl V', 'Moriggl R']","['Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Cancer Research, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Animal Breeding and Genetics, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Cancer Research, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Animal Breeding and Genetics, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Cancer Research, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Animal Breeding and Genetics, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, and.', 'Biomodels Austria (Biat), University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'IFA-Tulln, University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Tulln, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Cancer Research, Vienna, Austria.', 'CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Cancer Research, Vienna, Austria.', 'Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Center of Physiology and Pharmacology, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Cancer Research, Vienna, Austria.', 'Center of Pathobiochemistry and Genetics, Institute of Medical Genetics, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Cancer Research, Vienna, Austria.', 'Clinical Institute of Pathology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Unit of Pathology of Laboratory Animals, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna, Austria.', 'CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna, Austria.', 'CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna, Austria.', 'Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Max Planck Institute for Informatics, Saarbrucken, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, and.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann-Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Animal Breeding and Genetics, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, and.', 'Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Cancer Research, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Animal Breeding and Genetics, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171204,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT5B protein, human)', '0 (Stat5b protein, mouse)']",IM,['J Clin Invest. 2018 Jan 2;128(1):113-115.

All 34 exons of NOTCH1 and hotspot exons (exon 9 and exon 10) of FBXW7 were polymerase chain reaction amplified and sequenced for mutations. Our results showed that 13/25 (52%) were NOTCH1-mutated, of which 11 patients (44%) showed mutation in the hotspot exons. Four patients (16%) had mutations in non-hotspot exons of NOTCH1. Notably, 2 T-ALL patients (8%) harbored mutations in both hotspot and non-hotspot exons of NOTCH1, whereas 2 patients (8%) had mutations in the hotspot exons of FBXW7. In all, 7 mutations were identified which were not previously reported. The real-time polymerase chain reaction study in 15 patients revealed that increased expression of activated NOTCH1 was found in NOTCH1/FBXW7 hotspot exon-mutated cases. In addition, NOTCH1/FBXW7-mutated patients had showed upregulated HES1, c-MYC, NOTCH3 gene expression. When survival analysis was performed including samples (n=50) from our previous study, an early treatment response and better survival was observed in NOTCH1/FBXW7 hotspot-mutated patients.

Here, the crystal structure of VLR39 is presented at 1.5 A resolution and compared with those of other protein-specific VLRs. VLR39 adopts a curved solenoid fold and exhibits substantial structural similarity to other protein-binding VLRs. VLR39 has a short LRRCT loop that protrudes outwards away from the concave face and is similar to those of its protein-specific VLR counterparts. Analysis of the VLR39-BCR interaction by size-exclusion chromatography and biolayer interferometry using the scFv version of the BCR confirms that VLR39 recognizes the BCR Fv region.

The genetic profile also separated two subgroups with different EFS (0.75 vs. 0.41; p = .036) in the MRD-positive group, however the OS was not different (0.75 vs. 0.57; p = .293).",,"['Gupta, Sanjeev Kumar', 'Bakhshi, Sameer', 'Chopra, Anita', 'Kamal, Vineet Kumar']","['Gupta SK', 'Bakhshi S', 'Chopra A', 'Kamal VK']","['a Laboratory Oncology Unit , Dr BRA IRCH, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) , New Delhi , India.', 'b Department of Medical Oncology , Dr BRA IRCH, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) , New Delhi , India.', 'a Laboratory Oncology Unit , Dr BRA IRCH, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) , New Delhi , India.', 'c Division of Epidemiology & Biostatistics , National Institute of Epidemiology , Chennai , India.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171203,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*DNA Copy Number Variations', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', '*Genetic Profile', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Prognosis']",,,2017/12/05 06:00,2019/02/08 06:00,['2017/12/05 06:00'],"['2017/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/08 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2017.1408087 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2018 Aug;59(8):1899-1904. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2017.1408087.

Although these are remarkably effective drugs, some mechanisms of resistance have been identified including drug-to-drug interactions. Here we present the case of a chronic myeloid leukemia patient with an inadequate response to imatinib due to concurrent phenytoin administration. Conspicuously low imatinib plasma trough levels were documented. Imatinib dose was increased from 400 to 800 mg with good response. In conclusion, drug-to-drug interactions should be ruled out in cases of resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment. Potent inducers of cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4, as phenytoin, could induce inadequate responses due to increased imatinib clearance and low imatinib trough plasma levels. Thus, this interaction should be avoided. When this is not possible, dose escalation of imatinib and measurement of plasma levels, if available, is recommended.",,"['Osorio, S', 'Escudero-Vilaplana, V', 'Gomez-Centurion, I', 'Gonzalez-Arias, E', 'Garcia-Gonzalez, X', 'Diez, J L']","['Osorio S', 'Escudero-Vilaplana V', 'Gomez-Centurion I', 'Gonzalez-Arias E', 'Garcia-Gonzalez X', 'Diez JL']","['1 Hematology Department, Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Maranon, Madrid, Spain.', '2 Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Gregorio Maranon (IiSGM), Madrid, Spain.', '2 Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Gregorio Maranon (IiSGM), Madrid, Spain.', '3 Pharmacy Department, Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Maranon, Madrid, Spain.', '1 Hematology Department, Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Maranon, Madrid, Spain.', '1 Hematology Department, Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Maranon, Madrid, Spain.', '2 Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Gregorio Maranon (IiSGM), Madrid, Spain.', '3 Pharmacy Department, Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Maranon, Madrid, Spain.', '1 Hematology Department, Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Maranon, Madrid, Spain.', '2 Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Gregorio Maranon (IiSGM), Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],,,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20171203,England,J Oncol Pharm Pract,Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,9511372,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '6158TKW0C5 (Phenytoin)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A)']",IM,,"['Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A/metabolism', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Phenytoin/*administration & dosage', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage']",,,2017/12/05 06:00,2019/04/16 06:00,['2017/12/05 06:00'],"['2017/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/16 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1078155217743565 [doi]'],ppublish,J Oncol Pharm Pract. 2019 Apr;25(3):694-698. doi: 10.1177/1078155217743565.

Here, we explored its efficacy and mechanism of cell death in melanoma and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We found that DDA induced lethal autophagy in vitro and in vivo, including primary AML patient samples, independently of melanoma Braf status or AML molecular and cytogenetic classifications. DDA is a partial agonist on liver-X-receptor (LXR) increasing Nur77, Nor1, and LC3 expression leading to autolysosome formation. Moreover, DDA inhibited the cholesterol biosynthesizing enzyme 3beta-hydroxysterol-Delta(8,7)-isomerase (D8D7I) leading to sterol accumulation and cooperating in autophagy induction. This mechanism of death was not observed with other LXR ligands or D8D7I inhibitors establishing DDA selectivity. The potent anti-tumor activity of DDA, its original mechanism of action and its low toxicity support its clinical evaluation. More generally, this study reveals that DDA can direct control a nuclear receptor to trigger lethal autophagy in cancers.",,"['Segala, Gregory', 'David, Marion', 'de Medina, Philippe', 'Poirot,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-seven patients received a first-line treatment and 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (cladribine-2-CdA) was administered in 31 cases, 19 patients received interferon-alpha (INF-alpha), splenectomy was performed in 16 cases, and rituximab was used in one. RESULTS: Although the highest overall response rate (ORR) was observed in patients receiving 2-CdA upfront, ORRs were comparable in the 2-CdA, INF-alpha, and splenectomy subgroups. Relapse rates were significantly lower in patients who received first-line 2-CdA. The progression-free survival (PFS) rate with 2-CdA was significantly higher than in patients with INF-alpha and splenectomy, but we found similar overall survival rates with all three upfront treatment modalities. Infections including tuberculosis were a major problem.

DESIGN: Presentation of a carefully designed workup taken to evaluate tissue for minimal residual disease, its limitations, and applicability to other patients. To date, there have not been any publications of auto-transplantations in leukemia survivors, owing to an estimated high risk for malignancy induction. SETTING: Large tertiary hospital. PATIENT(S): A 19-year-old acute myeloid leukemia patient underwent ovarian tissue cryopreservation during complete remission before bone marrow transplantation. After prolonged amenorrhea, the patient desired pregnancy. Laboratory tests showed antimullerian hormone <0.1 ng/mL and FSH 116 mIU/mL. Ultrasound revealed no ovarian follicles. INTERVENTION(S): Ovarian tissue cryopreservation and auto-transplantation. Histology, immunohistochemistry, FISH, next-generation sequencing, and xenotransplantation were done to evaluate thawed tissue samples for the presence of leukemia cells. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Evidence for leukemia cells in thawed ovarian tissue, reproductive outcomes and live birth after transplantation, and leukemia-free survival. RESULT(S): Histology was negative for leukemia cells. Three severe combined immunodeficiency mice, grafted with tissue fragments, were followed for 6 months and showed no macroscopic/microscopic signs for leukemia. Fluorescence in situ hybridization for disease-specific gene rearrangement resulted in a read below the probe's cut-off. A next-generation sequencing panel of genes implicated in myeloproliferative disorders did not reveal any significant molecular event. Transplantation was performed, followed by ovarian stimulation and IVF, resulting in the delivery of healthy newborn. More than 2 years have elapsed since transplantation, and the patient is leukemia free. CONCLUSION(S): Harvesting during complete remission, combined with intense tissue evaluation before transplantation, allowed a safe, successful transplantation in an acute myeloid leukemia survivor.","['Copyright (c) 2017 American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the association between pemphigus and the common types of hematologic malignancies. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted comparing pemphigus patients with age-, sex- and ethnicity-matched control subjects regarding the prevalence of 6 comorbid hematologic malignancies. The study was performed using the computerized database of Clalit Health Services ensuring the availability of 4.5 million patients. RESULTS: The study included 1985 pemphigus patients and 9874 control subjects. The prevalence of chronic leukemia (0.9% vs 0.4%, odds ratio [OR] 2.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-3.6), multiple myeloma (0.8% vs 0.4%, OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.2-3.9), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (1.8% vs 1.2%, OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.0-2.2) was greater in patients with pemphigus than in controls. The association with chronic leukemia remained significant following the adjustment for immunosuppressive therapy (adjusted OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.1-3.7). No significant associations were observed between pemphigus and acute leukemia, Hodgkin lymphoma, myelodysplastic syndrome, and polycythemia vera. LIMITATIONS: Lack of immunopathologic validation of the diagnosis of pemphigus. CONCLUSION: A significant association was observed between pemphigus and chronic leukemia, multiple myeloma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Further research is warranted to establish this observation in other cohorts.","['Copyright (c) 2017 American Academy of Dermatology, Inc. Published by Elsevier', 'Inc.

While disease-specific factors such as CML phase, mutational status, and line of treatment are key to TKI selection, other important features must be considered, such as patient-specific comorbidities and TKI safety profiles. Ponatinib, the TKI most recently approved, has demonstrated efficacy in patients with refractory CML, but is associated with an increased risk of arterial hypertension, sometimes severe, and serious arterial occlusive and venous thromboembolic events. A panel of European experts convened to discuss their clinical experience in managing patients with CML. Based on the panel discussions, scenarios in which a CML patient may be an appropriate candidate for ponatinib therapy are described, including presence of the T315I mutation, resistance to other TKIs without the T315I mutation, and intolerance to other TKIs.",['Copyright (c) 2017 The Authors.

The search was conducted on five databases: LILACS, PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus and Web of Science up until July 20th, 2016, with no time or language restrictions. The reference list of the included studies was crosschecked and a partial gray literature search was undertaken. The methodology of the selected studies was evaluated using GRADE. Asparaginase production, optimization using statistical design, purification and characterization were the main evaluated outcomes. Of the 1686 initially gathered studies, 19 met the inclusion criteria after a two-step selection process. Nine species of fungi were reported in the selected studies, out of which 13 studies optimized the medium composition using statistical design for enhanced asparaginase production and six reported purification and characterization of the enzyme. The genera Aspergillus were identified as producers of asparaginase in both solid and submerged fermentation and l-asparagine was the amino acid most used as nitrogen source.

Anthracyclines cause cardiac toxicity and may result in acute or long-term cardiac failure. We describe the use of a ventricular assist device as a bridge to recovery in a child with severe acute anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy, and we review the associated literature. A 6-year-old girl was treated for acute myeloblastic leukaemia with daunorubicin and mitoxantrone. After 2 weeks her final dose of chemotherapy, her Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction decreased to 21%. Despite initiation of medical therapy, she had continued deterioration of left ventricular function and developed evidence of poor end-organ perfusion. She was not a candidate for cardiac transplantation, as the post-transplant immune suppression therapy would put her at risk for recurrence of her malignancy. We placed her on a short-term ventricular assist device as a bridge to ultimately placing her on a long-term ventricular assist device versus continuing medical therapy. Her left ventricular ejection fraction improved to 55% 24 days after ventricular assist device insertion. She was separated from the ventricular assist device 26 days after its insertion.

Most targeted therapies for myeloid leukemia are small molecules or monoclonal antibodies that inhibit the activity of the oncoproteins. However, leukemia cells often develop resistance to these drugs through overexpression of the target protein and/or by obtaining new mutations in the target protein to render them resistant to the drug. Oncoproteins degradation induced by small molecules through ubiquitin or autophagy pathway is considered a better way to avoid drug resistance. Here, we describe the latest advances in the use of small molecules to degrade oncoproteins. We first discuss examples of existing cancer drugs and candidate drugs that act by degrading oncoproteins, and then review the latest development of rational design of small molecules that induce selective degradation of target proteins. Furthermore, small-molecule-based proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) have demonstrated that this technology can effectively degrade target proteins.",,"['Lei, Hu', 'Wang, Weiwei', 'Wu, Yingli']","['Lei H', 'Wang W', 'Wu Y']","['a Hongqiao International Institute of Medicine, Shanghai Tongren Hospital/Faculty of Basic Medicine , Chemical Biology Division of Shanghai Universities E-Institutes, Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of the Chinese Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine , Shanghai , PR China.', 'a Hongqiao International Institute of Medicine, Shanghai Tongren Hospital/Faculty of Basic Medicine , Chemical Biology Division of Shanghai Universities E-Institutes, Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of the Chinese Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine , Shanghai , PR China.', 'a Hongqiao International Institute of Medicine, Shanghai Tongren Hospital/Faculty of Basic Medicine , Chemical Biology Division of Shanghai Universities E-Institutes, Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of the Chinese Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine , Shanghai , PR China.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171204,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Autophagy/drug effects', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/methods', 'Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Proteolysis/*drug effects', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/metabolism']",,,2017/12/05 06:00,2019/06/07 06:00,['2017/12/05 06:00'],"['2017/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/07 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2017.1403600 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2018 Oct;59(10):2297-2304. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2017.1403600.

In most cases, symptoms resolve without neurological consequences. AIM: The aim of this paper is the analysis of predisposing factors, clinical outcomes and radiological features of PRES in eight children with hemato-oncological disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analysed the medical records of eight hemato-oncological patients aged from 3.0 to 16.1 years. The mean of age at primary diagnosis was 8.5 years. RESULTS: All patients had both clinical and radiological PRES features. Seven out of eight underwent intensive chemotherapy regimens. Time elapsed from start of treatment to the occurrence of PRES ranged from 6 to 556 days. In one case, PRES occurred before chemotherapy and was the first symptom of cancer. Most (six of eight) patients had history of hypertension (> 95pc) and some (two of eight) occurred electrolyte imbalance-mainly hypomagnesaemia. Patients presented headache (seven of eight), disturbances of consciousness (six of eight), seizures (six of eight), visual changes (four of eight) and vomiting (three of eight). MRI demonstrated abnormalities in seven children: typical cerebral oedema in the white matter of the occipital to the parietal lobes. Most patient lesions in the MRI shrunk after 4 weeks, and clinical symptoms of PRES disappeared completely within a few hours to few days. CONCLUSION: PRES may complicate oncological treatment in children. Hypertension is the most important risk factor of PRES. PRES should be included in differential diagnosis in all patients with acute neurological symptoms.",,"['Musiol, Katarzyna', 'Waz, Sylwia', 'Boron, Michal', 'Kwiatek, Magdalena', 'Machnikowska-Sokolowska, Magdalena', 'Gruszczynska, Katarzyna', 'Sobol-Milejska, Grazyna']","['Musiol K', 'Waz S', 'Boron M', 'Kwiatek M', 'Machnikowska-Sokolowska M', 'Gruszczynska K', 'Sobol-Milejska G']","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Chemotherapy, Medical University of Silesia, Upper Silesia Children's Care Health Centre, 16 Medykow Str, 40-752, Katowice, Poland. katkamusiol@gmail.com."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Chemotherapy, Medical University of Silesia, Upper Silesia Children's Care Health Centre, 16 Medykow Str, 40-752, Katowice, Poland."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Chemotherapy, Medical University of Silesia, Upper Silesia Children's Care Health Centre, 16 Medykow Str, 40-752, Katowice, Poland."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Chemotherapy, Medical University of Silesia, Upper Silesia Children's Care Health Centre, 16 Medykow Str, 40-752, Katowice, Poland."", ""Department of Diagnostic Imaging, Medical University of Silesia, Upper Silesia Children's Care Health Centre, Katowice, Poland."", ""Department of Diagnostic Imaging, Medical University of Silesia, Upper Silesia Children's Care Health Centre, Katowice, Poland."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Chemotherapy, Medical University of Silesia, Upper Silesia Children's Care Health Centre, 16 Medykow Str, 40-752, Katowice, Poland.""]",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],20171202,Germany,Childs Nerv Syst,Child's nervous system : ChNS : official journal of the International Society for Pediatric Neurosurgery,8503227,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Blood Pressure/physiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Epilepsy/diagnostic imaging/etiology', 'Female', 'Hepatoblastoma/diagnostic imaging/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/diagnostic imaging/*drug therapy', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Neuroblastoma/*drug therapy', 'Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome/diagnostic imaging/*etiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Tomography Scanners, X-Ray Computed']",PMC5856901,,2017/12/05 06:00,2019/07/28 06:00,['2017/12/04 06:00'],"['2017/08/26 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/28 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00381-017-3664-y [doi]', '10.1007/s00381-017-3664-y [pii]']",ppublish,Childs Nerv Syst. 2018 Apr;34(4):691-699. doi: 10.1007/s00381-017-3664-y.

However, little is known about the mechanisms underpinning the unique pathogenesis of ALVJ. In this study, we investigated the gene expression profiles of ALVJ-infected chicken cells and performed a comprehensive analysis of the long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in CEF cells using RNA-Seq. As a result, 36 differentially expressed lncRNAs and 91 genes (FC > 2 and q-values < 0.05) were identified. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that these differentially expressed genes are involved in the innate immune response. Target prediction analysis revealed that these lncRNAs may act in cis or trans and affect the expression of genes which are involved in the anti-viral innate immune responses. Toll-like receptor, RIG-I receptor, NOD-like receptor and JAK-STAT signaling pathways were enriched. Notably, the induced expression of innate immunity genes, including B2M, DHX58, IFI27L2, IFIH1, IRF10, ISG12(2), MX, OAS*A, RSAD2, STAT1, TLR3, IL4I1, and IRF1 (FC > 2 and correlation > 0.95), were highly correlated with the upregulation of several lncRNAs, including MG066618, MG066617, MG066601, MG066629, MG066609 and MG066616.

Currently, multiple testing strategies are required for comprehensive genetic testing in myeloid malignancies. The aim of this proof-of-principle study was to investigate the feasibility of combining detection of genome-wide large CNVs, CN-LOH and targeted gene mutations into a single assay using next-generation sequencing (NGS). METHODS: For genome-wide CNV detection, we designed a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sequencing backbone with 22 762 SNP regions evenly distributed across the entire genome. For targeted mutation detection, 62 frequently mutated genes in myeloid malignancies were targeted. We combined this SNP sequencing backbone with a targeted mutation panel, and sequenced 9 healthy individuals and 16 patients with myeloid malignancies using NGS. RESULTS: We detected 52 somatic CNVs, 11 instances of CN-LOH and 39 oncogenic mutations in the 16 patients with myeloid malignancies, and none in the 9 healthy individuals. All CNVs and CN-LOH were confirmed by SNP microarray analysis. CONCLUSIONS: We describe a genome-wide SNP sequencing backbone which allows for sensitive detection of genome-wide CNVs and CN-LOH using NGS. This proof-of-principle study has demonstrated that this strategy can provide more comprehensive genetic profiling for patients with myeloid malignancies using a single assay.","['(c) Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text', 'of the article) 2018.

In some chemotherapy refractory myeloid leukemia patients, adoptive transfer of NK cells from haploidentical donors can induce remission. We have previously shown that remission induction is linked to NK cell persistence at day +14, but the factors influencing NK cell persistence are unknown. To address this question, patient samples from a phase I trial of National Cancer Institute (NCI) IL-15 in whom either did or did not show NK cell expansion were compared with healthy donor control subjects. Before lymphodepleting chemotherapy, high absolute CD3(+) count was predictive of patients who failed to expand their haploidentical NK cell graft. Interestingly, both groups had elevated expression of inhibitory receptors and decreased cytokine production compared with control subjects, suggestive of T cell exhaustion among all patients before haploidentical NK cell infusion. At day +14, however, haploidentical NK cell expanders had persistence of recipient CD8(+) T cells with the most exhausted inhibitory phenotype (either PD-1(high) or dual PD-1(+)Tim-3(+)) and elevated expression of T-bet and Eomes compared with NK cell nonexpanders and control subjects. This suggested that maintenance of an exhausted T cell state at day +14 permits haploidentical NK cell expansion and supports further efforts to selectively deplete recipient T cells or modulate their dysfunction.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Adipose tissue has been recognized as an endocrine and paracrine organ that secretes various adipokines involved in metabolic regulation and inflammatory processes. In this study, we examined inflammatory factors (IL-6 and TNF-alpha) and adipokines (adiponectin, leptin), in addition to body composition and adiposity, in cancer survivors who underwent hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) during childhood compared with sibling controls. Over 2-year survivors of HCT for hematologic malignancies during childhood were recruited from 2 institutions along with a control population of siblings. Participants underwent evaluation for body composition, anthropometric measurements, and assessment of CVD risk factors and adipokines. Cases were stratified by radiation exposure in the preparative regimen (total body irradiation [TBI] + central nervous system [CNS] irradiation, TBI only, chemotherapy only) and adjusted least squares means were estimated for each adipokine and adjusted by age, sex, race, Tanner stage, and percent fat mass (PFM) percentiles (0-24, 25-74, 75+). A total of 151 HCT survivors and 92 siblings underwent evaluation. Significant differences in mean adipokine levels were detected between survivors and siblings; leptin was significantly higher and adiponectin significantly lower in HCT survivors who received TBI with or without CNS irradiation compared with siblings. IL-6 was significantly higher in all groups of HCT survivors compared with siblings. Body mass index (BMI) was similar in survivors and controls, although PFM was significantly higher in all groups of HCT survivors and lean body mass (LBM) was lower in survivors who received TBI with or without CNS radiation compared with siblings. HCT survivors showed an unfavorable profile of inflammation, adipokines, and adiposity, despite similar BMI as controls. Higher PFM and lower LBM may contribute to these findings. TBI exposure is correlated with greater severity of these observations. Increasing LBM may represent a tangible target for mitigating the high cardiometabolic risks of HCT survivors.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Bu-containing regimens were analyzed together, since no significant differences for patient outcomes were noted between them. Bu patients were older, with better performance status; took longer to achieve first CR and receive HCT; were treated more recently; and were more likely to receive peripheral blood grafts, antithymocyte globulin, or tyrosine kinase inhibitors. With median follow-up of 3.6 years for Bu and 5.3 years for TBI, adjusted 3-year outcomes showed treatment-related mortality Bu 19% versus TBI 25% (P = .04); relapse Bu 37% versus TBI 28% (P = .007); disease-free survival (DFS) Bu 45% versus TBI 48% (P = .35); and overall survival (OS) Bu 57% versus TBI 53% (P = .35). In multivariate analysis, Bu patients had higher risk of relapse (relative risk, 1.46; 95% confidence interval, 1.15 to 1.85; P = .002) compared with TBI patients.

KIR2D family members recognize HLA-C alleles with Asn80 (HLA-C1) or Lys80 (HLA-C2). The predominance of HLA-C1 over HLA-C2 and the frequent presence of KIR2DL1 are characteristic of Japanese people. We compared clinical outcomes among homozygous HLA-C1 (HLA-C1/C1) patients and heterozygous HLA-C1/C2 patients who underwent HLA-matched HSCT for hematologic malignancies by assessing the data of 10,638 patients from the Japanese national registry. HLA-C1/C1 recipients had a lower rate of relapse than HLA-C1/C2 recipients after transplantation for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) (hazard ratio [HR], .79; P = .006) and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) (HR, .48; P = .025), but not for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (HR, 1.36), lymphoma (HR, .97), or low-grade myelodysplastic syndrome (HR, 1.40). We then grouped AML and CML patients together and divided them into several subgroups. Advantages of HLA-C1/C1 recipients over HLA-C1/C2 recipients regarding relapse were observed irrespective of donor relation (related: HR, .79, P = .069; unrelated: HR, .77, P = .022), preparative regimen (myeloablative: HR, .79, P = .014; reduced intensity: HR, .73, P = .084), and occurrence of acute graft-versus-host disease (yes: HR, .70, P = .122; no, HR .71, P = .026) or cytomegalovirus reactivation (reactivated: HR .67,P = .054; nonreactivated: HR .71, P = .033); however, these advantages were not observed in recipients with a delay in achieving complete chimerism (HR, 1.06). The advantage of decreasing relapse and extending relapse-free survival of C1/1 over C1/2 KIR-ligand status was most pronounced in T cell-depleted HSCT (HR, .27; P < .001 and HR, .30; P = .002, respectively) and in children age <15 years (HR, .29; P < .001 and HR .31; P < .001, respectively).

The most common neurological complications are painful peripheral neuropathies. Chemotherapeutics that interfere with microtubules, including plant-derived vinca-alkaloids such as vincristine, can cause these chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathies (CIPN). Available treatments focus on symptom alleviation and pain reduction rather than prevention of the neuropathy. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of specific histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) inhibitors as a preventive therapy for CIPN using multiple rodent models for vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathies (VIPN). HDAC6 inhibition increased the levels of acetylated alpha-tubulin in tissues of rodents undergoing vincristine-based chemotherapy, which correlates to a reduced severity of the neurological symptoms, both at the electrophysiological and the behavioral level. Mechanistically, disturbances in axonal transport of mitochondria is considered as an important contributing factor in the pathophysiology of VIPN. As vincristine interferes with the polymerization of microtubules, we investigated whether disturbances in axonal transport could contribute to VIPN. We observed that increasing alpha-tubulin acetylation through HDAC6 inhibition restores vincristine-induced defects of axonal transport in cultured dorsal root ganglion neurons. Finally, we assured that HDAC6-inhibition offers neuroprotection without interfering with the anti-cancer efficacy of vincristine using a mouse model for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Taken together, our results emphasize the therapeutic potential of HDAC6 inhibitors with beneficial effects both on vincristine-induced neurotoxicity, as well as on tumor proliferation.",['Copyright (c) 2017 The Author(s).

Recent published clinical practice recommendations on behalf of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation relegated the role of for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation to later stages of the disease. To our knowledge, no randomized controlled trial has been performed to date comparing myeloablative versus reduced intensity conditioning regimens in chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients eligible for the procedure. We performed a systematic review/meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation when using myeloablative or reduced intensity conditioning regimens. We report the results in accordance to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. Based on lower non-relapse mortality and slightly better overall survival rates, reduced intensity conditioning regimens appear to be the most desirable choice whenever the procedure is indicated for this disease. It appears highly unlikely that a RCT will be ever performed comparing reduced intensity vs. myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In the absence of such a study, results of this systematic review/meta-analysis represent the best available evidence supporting this recommendation whenever indicated in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.","['Copyright (c) 2017 King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Centre.

FV are ubiquitous in their natural hosts, which include cows, cats, and nonhuman primates (NHP). FV are transmitted mainly through saliva and appear nonpathogenic by themselves, but they may increase morbidity of other pathogens in coinfections. CONCLUSIONS: This review summarizes and discusses what is known about FV infection of natural hosts. It also emphasizes what is known about FV zoonotic infections A large number of studies have revealed that the FV of NHP, simian foamy viruses (SFV), are transmitted to humans who interact with infected NHP. SFV from a variety of NHP establish persistent infection in humans, while bovine foamy virus and feline foamy virus rarely or never do. The possibility of FV recombination and mutation leading to pathogenesis is considered. Since humans can be infected by SFV, a seemingly nonpathogenic virus, there is interest in using SFV vectors for human gene therapy.

Furthermore, granulomatous interstitial nephritis (GIN) is a rare histological diagnosis in patients undergoing a renal biopsy. We herein report a case of GIN due to the diffuse infiltration of CLL cells in a patient who developed progressive renal failure. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient was a 55-year-old man who had been diagnosed with CLL 4 years earlier and who had been followed up without treatment. Although his serum creatinine level had remained normal for three and a half years, it started to increase in the six months prior to his presentation. A urinalysis showed mild proteinuria without any hematuria at the time of presentation. A renal biopsy revealed the diffuse infiltration of CLL cells into the tubulointerstitial area with non-caseating epithelioid cell granulomas. Despite cyclophosphamide treatment, his renal function did not improve, and he ultimately required maintenance hemodialysis.

Here, we developed a novel maturation procedure to evaluate the cellular effect of cysteamine (Cys), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and Y27632 on oocyte in vitro maturation in native Chinese Yangtze river white goats. Oocytes were collected by slicing ovary tissues and matured for 24 h in vitro prior to IVF. Presumptive fertilized oocytes were cultured in embryo media for 8 days. Maturation rates were similar in gonadotropin basal maturation medium and the same medium supplemented with Cys, LIF, or Y27362 (41.0-48.0%; P > 0.05). However, when two substances were co-supplemented into the medium, the maturation rate was higher in the Cys+LIF group than in the LIF+Y27362 and Cys+Y27362 groups (60.0% vs. 43.1% and 25.8%, respectively; P < 0.05). Co-supplementation of all three substances into the medium achieved the highest maturation rate (67.5%; P < 0.05). Compared with oocytes in gonadotropin basal maturation medium, those in medium supplemented with Cys showed increased fertilization (56.1% vs. 72.1%), cleavage (36.7% vs. 44.8%), and blastocyst development (1.7% vs. 4.2%), respectively (P < 0.05). Cys+LIF supplementation further improved fertilization (81.6%), cleavage (54.9%), and blastocyst development (6%; P < 0.05). Furthermore, combined supplementation of all three substances resulted in the best fertilization (84.9%), cleavage (70.7%), and blastocyst development (10.3%; P < 0.05).

However, the differences between somatic cells and immune cells post-infection remain poorly understood. The aim of our study was to detect the different responses in chicken to infection with ALV-J in different cell lines. In this study, we detected transcriptome expression changes during infection with ALV-J in chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF) and HD11 cell lines. RNA-Seq was used to determine the expression levels of mRNA transcripts from the two cell types after infection with ALV-J at 1, 4, and 7 dpi, and gene ontology analyses were used to cluster differentially expressed genes into pathways. Quantitative real-time PCR confirmed the expression of 336 and 269 differentially expressed genes in CEF and HD11 lines, respectively, involved in innate immunity (OASL, CCL4), adaptive immunity (LYZ, CD72), apoptosis and autophagy (WISP2, COMP), inflammation (JSC, IL8), and tumorgenesis (PCNA, GPX3). The notable signal transduction pathways included the PPARs signaling pathway and ECM-receptor interactions in CEF, and the Toll-like receptor, NOD-like receptor, and RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathways in HD11. To our knowledge, this is the first study to use high-throughput sequencing methods to investigate viral infection in different cell types.

We compared the outcomes of underweight patients to those of normal weight and overweight patients. Adult patients with AML who registered in the JALSG AML201 study (n = 1057) were classified into three groups: underweight (body mass index [BMI] < 18.5, n = 92), normal weight (BMI 18.5-25, n = 746), and overweight (BMI >/= 25, n = 219). With the exception of age and male/female ratio, patient characteristics were comparable among the three groups. Rates of complete remission following induction chemotherapy were similar among the three groups (p = 0.68). We observed a significant difference in overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and non-relapse mortality (NRM) between underweight and normal weight patients (3-year OS 34.8 vs. 47.7%, p = 0.01; DFS 28.6 vs. 39.8%, p = 0.02; 1-year NRM 6.2 vs. 2.6%, p = 0.05), but not between underweight and overweight patients. In multivariate analysis, underweight was an independent adverse prognostic factor for OS (p < 0.01), DFS (p = 0.01), and NRM (p = 0.04). During the first induction chemotherapy, the incidences of documented infection (DI) and severe adverse events (AEs) were higher in underweight patients than those in normal weight patients (DI 16 vs. 8.1%, p = 0.04; AE 36 vs. 24%, p = 0.05).

More importantly, the primary and secondary forms of each disease are characterized by common sets of mutations and gene expression abnormalities.

Oral or parenteral adenosine analogues have been also used as immunomodulatory agents in multiple sclerosis and in acute graft-versus-host disease. CASE REPORT: Here, we report the case of a 43-year-old patient with a history of extensive psoriasis who later developed HCL. RESULTS: The patient had achieved complete remission of both psoriasis and HCL after receiving intravenous infusions of pentostatin. It is worth noting that cladribine has already been reported to treat plaque psoriasis lesions in two patients with HCL and in a third patient with gastric marginal zone B cell lymphoma [1].

The mithramycin A biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces argillaceus ATCC12956 was cloned by transformation assisted recombination in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and heterologous expression in Streptomyces lividans TK24 was evaluated. Mithramycin A was efficiently produced by S. lividans TK24 under standard fermentation conditions. To improve the yield of heterologously produced mithramycin A, a collection of derivative strains of S. lividans TK24 were constructed by sequential deletion of known potentially interfering secondary metabolite gene clusters using a protocol based on the positive selection of double crossover events with blue pigment indigoidine-producing gene. Mithramycin A production was evaluated in these S. lividans strains and substantially improved mithramycin A production was observed depending on the deleted gene clusters.

Our previous work showed that the src-family kinase Lck is a targetable mediator of BCR signalling in CLL cells, and that variance in Lck expression associated with ability of BCR to induce signal upon engagement. This latter finding makes Lck similar to ZAP70, another T-cell kinase whose aberrant expression in CLL cells also associates with BCR signalling capacity, but also different because ZAP70 is not easily pharmacologically targetable. Here we describe a robust method of measuring Lck expression in CLL cells using flow cytometry. However, unlike ZAP70 whose expression in CLL cells predicts prognosis, we find Lck expression and disease outcome in CLL are unrelated despite observations that its inhibition produces effects that biologically resemble the egress phenotype taken on by CLL cells treated with idelalisib. Taken together, our findings provide insight into the pathobiology of CLL to suggest a more complex relationship between expression of molecules within the BCR signalling pathway and disease outcome.",,"['Till, Kathleen J', 'Allen, John C', 'Talab, Fatima', 'Lin, Ke', 'Allsup, David', 'Cawkwell, Lynn', 'Bentley, Alison', 'Ringshausen, Ingo', 'Duckworth, Andrew D', 'Pettitt, Andrew R', 'Kalakonda, Nagesh', 'Slupsky, Joseph R']","['Till KJ', 'Allen JC', 'Talab F', 'Lin K', 'Allsup D', 'Cawkwell L', 'Bentley A', 'Ringshausen I', 'Duckworth AD', 'Pettitt AR', 'Kalakonda N', 'Slupsky JR']","['Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK.', 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK.', 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospitals NHS Trust, Liverpool, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Queens Centre for Oncology and Haematology, Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust, Yorkshire, UK.', 'School of Life Sciences, University of Hull, Hull, UK.', 'Hull York Medical School, University of Hull, Hull, UK.', 'Hull York Medical School, University of Hull, Hull, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK.', 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK.', 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK.', 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK. jslupsky@liverpool.ac.uk.']",['eng'],,['MC_PC_12009/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171201,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Purines)', '0 (Quinazolinones)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (LCK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck))', 'YG57I8T5M0 (idelalisib)']",IM,,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck)/*metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Purines/*pharmacology', 'Quinazolinones/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Survival Analysis']",PMC5711840,,2017/12/03 06:00,2019/07/17 06:00,['2017/12/03 06:00'],"['2017/04/13 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-017-17021-w [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-017-17021-w [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2017 Dec 1;7(1):16784. doi: 10.1038/s41598-017-17021-w.,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-6159-6109', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3067-2951', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7410-9004']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This phase 1 study evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary activity of vadastuximab talirine and determined the recommended monotherapy dose in patients with relapsed or refractory AML. Additional expansion cohorts tested vadastuximab talirine in specific subpopulations of relapsed AML, and in a cohort of older, treatment-naive patients. Patients received vadastuximab talirine IV on day 1 (5-60 microg/kg) or on days 1 and 4 (20 microg/kg) of 21-day cycles. A total of 131 patients (median age, 73 years [range, 26-89 years]) had intermediate I-II (48%) or adverse (34%) risk by European LeukemiaNet classification; 50% of patients had underlying myelodysplasia. Two dose-limiting toxicities (grade 2 pulmonary embolism and grade 4 hypocellular marrow) occurred during dose finding. Most adverse events (AEs) were consistent with myelosuppression; nonhematologic AEs included fatigue, nausea, and diarrhea. The 30-day mortality was 8%. At the recommended monotherapy dose of 40 microg/kg, the complete remission + CRi rate was 28% (5 of 18 patients); 50% of patients who responded achieved minimal residual disease negativity. In patients across dose levels who achieved CR or CRi, the median time to full count recovery was 6.4 weeks for neutrophils (>/=1000/microL) and 10.6 weeks for platelets (>/=100 x 10(9)/L).

This reflects the incomplete understanding of the pathophysiology of this disease. A comprehensive proteome analysis of primary human B-CLL cells and B cells from younger as well as elderly healthy donors was performed. For comparison, the chronic B cell leukemia cell line JVM-13 was also included. A principal component analysis comprising 6,945 proteins separated these four groups, placing B cells of aged-matched controls between those of young donors and B-CLL patients, while identifying JVM-13 as poorly related cells. Mass spectrometric proteomics data have been made fully accessible via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD006570-PXD006572, PXD006576, PXD006578, and PXD006589-PXD006591. Remarkably, B cells from aged controls displayed significant regulation of proteins related to stress management in mitochondria and ROS stress such as DLAT, FIS1, and NDUFAB1, and DNA repair, including RAD9A, MGMT, and XPA. ROS levels were indeed found significantly increased in B cells but not in T cells or monocytes from aged individuals. These alterations may be relevant for tumorigenesis and were observed similarly in B-CLL cells. In B-CLL cells, some remarkable unique features like the loss of tumor suppressor molecules PNN and JARID2, the stress-related serotonin transporter SLC6A4, and high expression of ZNF207, CCDC88A, PIGR and ID3, otherwise associated with stem cell phenotype, were determined. Alterations of metabolic enzymes were another outstanding feature in comparison to normal B cells, indicating increased beta-oxidation of fatty acids and increased consumption of glutamine. Targeted metabolomics assays corroborated these results. The present findings identify a potential proteome signature for immune senescence in addition to previously unrecognized features of B-CLL cells and suggest that aging may be accompanied by cellular reprogramming functionally relevant for predisposing B cells to transform to B-CLL cells.","['(c) 2018 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.']","['Mayer, Rupert L', 'Schwarzmeier, Josef D', 'Gerner, Marlene C', 'Bileck, Andrea', 'Mader, Johanna C', 'Meier-Menches, Samuel M', 'Gerner, Samuel M', 'Schmetterer, Klaus G', 'Pukrop, Tobias', 'Reichle, Albrecht', 'Slany, Astrid', 'Gerner, Christopher']","['Mayer RL', 'Schwarzmeier JD', 'Gerner MC', 'Bileck A', 'Mader JC', 'Meier-Menches SM', 'Gerner SM', 'Schmetterer KG', 'Pukrop T', 'Reichle A', 'Slany A', 'Gerner C']","['From the double daggerDepartment of Analytical Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry.', 'section signKarl Landsteiner Institute for Bioanalytical Oncology, Karl Landsteiner Society, Vienna, Austria.', 'paragraph signDepartment of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.', 'From the double daggerDepartment of Analytical Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry.', 'From the double daggerDepartment of Analytical Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry.', 'From the double daggerDepartment of Analytical Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry.', 'From the double daggerDepartment of Analytical Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry.', 'paragraph signDepartment of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.', '||Department of Internal Medicine III, Haematology & Oncology, University Hospital of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', '||Department of Internal Medicine III, Haematology & Oncology, University Hospital of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'From the double daggerDepartment of Analytical Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry.', 'From the double daggerDepartment of Analytical Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry, christopher.gerner@univie.ac.at.', '**Vienna Metabolomics Center (VIME), University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171201,United States,Mol Cell Proteomics,Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,101125647,['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)'],IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aging/*metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Metabolomics', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proteomics']",PMC5795392,,2017/12/03 06:00,2019/01/22 06:00,['2017/12/03 06:00'],"['2017/10/24 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/22 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['S1535-9476(20)32270-2 [pii]', '10.1074/mcp.RA117.000425 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Proteomics. 2018 Feb;17(2):290-303. doi: 10.1074/mcp.RA117.000425.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a case series of 45 patients with FLG3 treated with first-line R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) and observed for an extended time interval. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 100% and the median progression-free survival (PFS) has not been reached, with a 3-year PFS of 70%; 14 (31%) patients relapsed, nearly all within 3 years. The baseline characteristic more strongly associated with a shorter PFS were lymph >4 node sites and presence of B symptoms. Three patients later progressed to diffuse large B cell lymphoma, all had baseline elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase level and high International Prognostic Index score. Median overall survival has not been reached. All 4 patients who later developed acute myeloid leukemia were older than 60 years at the time of start of therapy. CONCLUSION: R-CHOP is an effective first-line treatment for patients with FLG3, and might provide extended PFS, comparable with outcomes observed in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, particularly in subgroups with limited nodal disease.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We hypothesized that allogeneic SCT (alloSCT) could overcome the chemoresistance associated with DEL/DHL. We retrospectively studied the impact of DEL/DHL status in a multicenter cohort of patients who underwent alloSCT for relapsed/refractory (rel/ref) aggressive B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL). Seventy-eight patients transplanted at 3 centers in whom tumor tissue was available for immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization were enrolled; 47% had DEL and 13% had DHL. There were no significant differences in 4-year progression-free (PFS) or overall survival (OS) between patients with DEL compared with patients without DEL (PFS 30% versus 39%, P = .24; OS 31% versus 49%, P = .17) or between patients with DHL compared with patients without DHL (PFS 40% versus 34%, P = .62; OS 50% versus 38%, P = .46). The lack of association between DEL or DHL and outcome was confirmed in multivariable models, although inadequate sample size may have limited our ability to detect significant differences. In our cohort alloSCT produced durable remissions in patients with rel/ref aggressive B-NHL irrespective of DEL and DHL status, justifying its consideration in the treatment of patients with rel/ref DEL/DHL.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

We retrospectively analyzed 2919 adult patients with hematologic malignancies who underwent related PBSCT in Japan between 2001 and 2014. According to the number of CD34(+) cells in the graft, we categorized 2494 patients in the standard group (2 to 5 x 10(6) cells/kg), 377 patient in the low group (1 to 2 x 10(6) cells/kg), and 48 patients in the very low group (<1 x 10(6) cells/kg). Compared with the standard group, the low and very low groups showed delayed neutrophil recovery (93.8%, 89.5%, and 78.3%, respectively at day +28; P < .001) and platelet recovery (69.3%, 53.0%, and 45.5%, respectively at day +28; P < .001). The 2-year overall survival (OS) in the 3 groups was 45.5%, 45.3%, and 29.8%, respectively, with inferior survival in the very low group. However, a higher percentage of high-risk patients may account for the inferior survival in the very low group, and no significant difference in OS was found in a multivariate analysis. There were no differences in relapse, nonrelapse mortality, or the development of graft-versus-host disease among the 3 groups. In conclusion, allogeneic PBSCT with low CD34(+) cell doses of 1 to 2 x 10(6) cells/kg gives acceptable results, whereas further investigations are needed to evaluate the effects of lower doses of <1 x 10(6) cells/kg owing to the smaller number and the higher percentage of patients with adverse prognostic factors in this cohort.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Although bortezomib (BTZ) is one of the most potent proteasome inhibitors available, still possesses limitations related to dose limiting side effects. Several strategies have been developed to improve the delivery of chemotherapies to MM by targeting different moieties expressed on MM cells to nanoparticle delivery systems (NPs), which have failed mainly due to their heterogeneous expression on these cells. Our goal was to test CD38 targeted chitosan NPs as novel targeting moiety for MM to improve the potency and efficacy of BTZ in MM cells and reduce the side effects in healthy tissue. We have showed preferential BTZ release in tumor-microenvironment, specific binding to MM cells, and an improved drug cellular uptake through BTZ diffusion from the surface and endocytosed NPs, which translated in enhanced proteasome inhibition and robust cytotoxic effect on MM cells when BTZ was administered through anti-CD38 chitosan NPs. Furthermore, the anti-CD38 chitosan NPs specifically delivered therapeutic agents to MM cells improving therapeutic efficacy and reducing side effects in vivo. The anti-CD38 chitosan NPs showed low toxicity profile allowing enhancement of proteasome-inhibitory activity and specificity of BTZ by endocytosis-mediated uptake of CD38 representing a promising therapy in MM.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Significantly higher cell uptake and apoptosis were observed in THP-1 cells by PAMAM-bendamustine conjugate which was confirmed by flow cytometry and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Preliminary in vivo studies undertaken included pharmacokinetics studies, organ distribution studies, and tumor inhibition studies. In healthy Wistar rat model (1CBM IV push model), the pharmacokinetic studies revealed that bioavailability and t1/2 increased significantly, i.e., almost 8.5-fold (193.8 +/- 1.116 vs 22.8 +/- 0.158 mug mL(-1)/h) and 5.1-fold (0.75 +/- 0.005 vs 3.85 +/- 0.015 h), respectively, for PAMAM-bendamustine conjugate compared to pure bendamustine ( p < 0.05), however, clearance and volume of distribution were found to be decreased compared to those of free drug. The study suggests that PAMAM-bendamustine conjugate was not only stable for the longer period but also least toxic and highly taken up by THP-1 cells to exert an anticancer effect at the reduced dose. Tumor inhibition and biodistribution studies in tumor-bearing BALB/c mice revealed that PAMAM-bendamustine conjugate was more effective than the pure drug and showed higher accumulation in the tumor.",,"['Gothwal, Avinash', 'Khan, Iliyas', 'Kumar, Pramod', 'Raza, Kaisar', 'Kaul, Ankur', 'Mishra, Anil Kumar', 'Gupta, Umesh']","['Gothwal A', 'Khan I', 'Kumar P', 'Raza K', 'Kaul A', 'Mishra AK', 'Gupta U']","['Department of Pharmacy, School of Chemical Sciences and Pharmacy , Central University of Rajasthan , Bandarsindri, Ajmer , Rajasthan 305817 , India.', 'Department of Pharmacy, School of Chemical Sciences and Pharmacy , Central University of Rajasthan , Bandarsindri, Ajmer , Rajasthan 305817 , India.', 'Department of Pharmacy, School of Chemical Sciences and Pharmacy , Central University of Rajasthan , Bandarsindri, Ajmer , Rajasthan 305817 , India.', 'Department of Pharmacy, School of Chemical Sciences and Pharmacy , Central University of Rajasthan , Bandarsindri, Ajmer , Rajasthan 305817 , India.', 'Division of Cyclotron And Radiopharmaceutical sciences , Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Allied Sciences , New Delhi 110054 , India.', 'Division of Cyclotron And Radiopharmaceutical sciences , Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Allied Sciences , New Delhi 110054 , India.', 'Department of Pharmacy, School of Chemical Sciences and Pharmacy , Central University of Rajasthan , Bandarsindri, Ajmer , Rajasthan 305817 , India.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180430,United States,Mol Pharm,Molecular pharmaceutics,101197791,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Delayed-Action Preparations)', '0 (Dendrimers)', '0 (Nanoconjugates)', '0 (Poly(amidoamine))', '0 (Polyamines)', '981Y8SX18M (Bendamustine Hydrochloride)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Bendamustine Hydrochloride/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Carcinoma, Ehrlich Tumor/drug therapy', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Delayed-Action Preparations/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Dendrimers/chemistry', 'Drug Liberation', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Nanoconjugates/*chemistry', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Polyamines/chemistry', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2017/12/02 06:00,2019/07/04 06:00,['2017/12/02 06:00'],"['2017/12/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/04 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/02 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.7b00625 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Pharm. 2018 Jun 4;15(6):2084-2097. doi: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.7b00625.

Various chromosomal abnormalities (including unbalanced translocations, deletions, ring chromosomes and isochromosomes) result in the loss of 17p and one copy of the TP53 gene. The objective of the present study was to determine whether the type of chromosomal abnormality leading to 17p- and the additional aberrations influenced the prognosis in a series of 195 patients with 17p-CLL. Loss of 17p resulted primarily from an unbalanced translocation (70%) with several chromosome partners (the most frequent being chromosome 18q), followed by deletion 17p (23%), monosomy 17 (8%), isochromosome 17q [i(17q)] (5%) and a ring chromosome 17 (2%). In a univariate analysis, monosomy 17, a highly complex karyotype (>/=5 abnormalities), and 8q24 gain were associated with poor treatment-free survival, and i(17q) (P = .04), unbalanced translocations (P = .03) and 8q24 gain (P = .001) were significantly associated with poor overall survival. In a multivariate analysis, 8q24 gain remained a significant predictor of poor overall survival. We conclude that 17p deletion and 8q24 gain have a synergistic impact on outcome, and so patients with this ""double-hit"" CLL have a particularly poor prognosis. Systematic, targeting screening for 8q24 gain should therefore be considered in cases of 17p- CLL.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Chapiro, Elise', 'Lesty, Claude', 'Gabillaud, Clementine',

However, most patients who eventually relapse have standard or medium risk ALL with low minimal residual disease (MRD) levels. We analysed recurrent microdeletions and other clinical prognostic factors in a cohort of 475 uniformly treated non-high risk precursor B-cell ALL patients with the aim of better predicting relapse and refining risk stratification. Lower relapse-free survival at 7 years (RFS) was associated with IKZF1 intragenic deletions (P < 0.0001); P2RY8-CRLF2 gene fusion (P < 0.0004); Day 33 MRD>5 x 10(-5) (P < 0.0001) and High National Cancer Institute (NCI) risk (P < 0.0001). We created a predictive model based on a risk score (RS) for deletions, MRD and NCI risk, extending from an RS of 0 (RS0) for patients with no unfavourable factors to RS2 + for patients with 2 or 3 high risk factors. RS0, RS1, and RS2 + groups had RFS of 93%, 78% and 49%, respectively, and overall survival (OS) of 99%, 91% and 71%. The RS provided greater discrimination than MRD-based risk stratification into standard (89% RFS, 96% OS) and medium risk groups (79% RFS, 91% OS).

The aim of the conference was to develop recommendations on critical subjects difficult to consider in detail in the ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines. The following areas were identified: (1) the elderly patient, (2) prognostic factors suitable for clinical use, and (3) the 'ultra-high-risk' group. Before the conference, the expert panel was divided into three working groups; each group focused on one of these areas in order to address clinically-relevant questions relating to that topic. All relevant scientific literature, as identified by the experts, was reviewed in advance. During the consensus conference, each working group developed recommendations to address each of the four questions assigned to their group. These recommendations were presented to the entire panel and a consensus was reached. This consensus, which was further developed in continuous post-meeting discussions, formed the basis of three manuscripts, each covering one of the three key areas identified. This manuscript presents the consensus recommendations regarding the clinical management of elderly patients diagnosed with malignant lymphoma. Four clinically-relevant topics identified by the panel were: 1) how to define patient fitness, 2) assessing quality of life, 3) diagnostic work-up and 4) clinical management of elderly patients with lymphoma.

Recently, mutations in CARMA2 have been linked to psoriasis susceptibility due to their acquired altered capacity to activate NF-kappaB. By means of two-hybrid screening with yeast, we identified RING finger protein 7 (RNF7) as an interactor of CARMA2. We present evidence that RNF7 functions as a negative regulator of the NF-kappaB-activating capacity of CARMA2. Mechanistically, RNF7 influences CARMA2 signaling by regulating the ubiquitination state of MALT1 and the NF-kappaB-regulatory molecule NEMO. Interestingly, CARMA2short (CARMA2sh) mutants associated with psoriasis susceptibility escape the negative control exerted by RNF7.

Early after EBV infection in vitro, primary human B cells undergo a transient period of hyper-proliferation, which results in replicative stress and DNA damage, activation of the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway and, ultimately, senescence. In this study, we investigated DDR-mediated senescence in early arrested EBV-infected B cells and characterized the establishment of persistent DNA damage foci. We found that arrested EBV-infected B cells exhibited an increase in promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML NBs), which predominantly localized to markers of DNA damage, as well as telomeric DNA. Furthermore, arrested EBV-infected B cells exhibited an increase in the presence of telomere dysfunction-induced foci. Importantly, we found that increasing human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) expression with danazol, a drug used to treat telomere diseases, permitted early EBV-infected B cells to overcome cellular senescence and enhanced transformation. Finally, we report that EBV-infected B cells undergoing hyper-proliferation are more sensitive than lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) to inhibition of Bloom syndrome-associated helicase, which facilitates telomere replication.

It is still unclear whether any specific molecular alterations could underlie the aggressive behavior of Langerhans cell proliferations. We used targeted next-generation sequencing and array-comparative genomic hybridization to profile 22 LCH samples from different patients together with 3 LCS samples corresponding to different relapses from the same patient. The third LCS relapse was a composite tumor including both B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and LCS components. The 22 LCH samples were mostly of bone origin and showed classic histophenotypical features. Array-comparative genomic hybridization showed in all 3 LCS samples a similar homozygous somatic loss affecting the CDKN2A/B locus, whereas the 17 informative LCH samples did not show any detectable abnormality. In the 3 LCS samples, targeted next-generation sequencing of 495 cancer genes detected common mutations in KMT2D/MLL2 and in both MAP2K1 and NRAS genes, whereas BRAF was not mutated. A NOTCH1 mutation was acquired in 2 LCS samples. The composite LCS/B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia tumor showed the same genetic profile in its 2 components. LCH samples showed mutually exclusive mutations of BRAF (8/20) and MAP2K1 (4/19), but no mutation of KMT2D, NRAS nor NOTCH1. These results suggest that CDKN2A/B deletion and/or simultaneous mutations of MAP2K1 and NRAS may underlie the aggressive behavior of Langerhans cell tumors, and thus could be useful for the diagnosis of malignancy in histiocytic neoplasms.

RECENT FINDINGS: Description of recurrent genetic abnormalities in driver genes, including Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2), myeloproliferative leukemia and calreticulin, a better appreciation of the key diagnostic role of bone marrow features, results of large epidemiologic studies and a few but landmark controlled clinical trials produced in the last decade, all resulted in a reappraisal of the approach to polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia. SUMMARY: The revised 2017 WHO classification of polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia allows early diagnosis and accurate distinction from other chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms, particulary prefibrotic myelofibrosis. The prognostic value of selected mutations is being appreciated and JAK2V617F mutation is currently incorporated as risk variable in prognostic system for essential thrombocythemia. Risk-adjusted stratification is used to select therapeutic approaches that include target agents. However, there is not yet a curative approach to these hematologic neoplasms, and although their management has much improved in the last decades, the associated morbidity and mortality remains significant and may be worsened by toxicities of therapeutic agents.

An ADC typically consists of a small molecule or peptide-based cytotoxic moiety covalently linked, via lysine or cysteine residues, to a monoclonal antibody (mAb) scaffold. Mass spectrometric (MS) characterization of these molecules affords highly accurate molecular weight (MW) and drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) determination and is typically performed using orthogonal acceleration time-of-flight (oa-ToF) analyzers and more recently, Orbitrap instruments. Herein we describe for the first time the use of a 15 T solariX Fourier transform ion cyclotron mass spectrometer to characterize an IgG1 mAb molecule conjugated with biotin via native lysine and cysteine residues, under native-MS and solution conditions. The cysteine-biotin conjugates remained fully intact, demonstrating the ability of the FT-ICR to maintain the noncovalent interactions and efficiently transmit labile protein complexes. Native-MS was acquired and is displayed in magnitude mode using a symmetric Hann apodization function.

Pseudoaneurysms are caused by the breaching of all layers of a blood vessel wall. The extravasated blood is trapped by the surrounding extravascular tissue or clots. Cladosporium was detected during a polymerase chain reaction-based analysis followed by DNA sequencing of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded lung tissue samples.

However, toxicity and resistance to this drug are major problems in the treatment of APL with ATRA. Earlier studies have suggested that the green tea polyphenol epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) induces cell death in hematopoietic neoplasms without adversely affecting normal cells. In the present study, the potential therapeutic effect of EGCG in APL and the underlying molecular mechanisms were investigated. EGCG (100 muM) significantly inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in HL-60 and NB4 cells. This effect was associated with decreased expressions of multidrug resistance proteins ABCB1, and ABCC1, whereas the expressions of pro-apoptotic genes CASP3, CASP8, p21, and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio were significantly increased. EGCG, at 25 muM concentration, induced differentiation of leukemic cells towards granulocytic pattern in a similar manner to that observed for ATRA (1 muM). Furthermore, EGCG suppressed the expression of clinical marker PML/RARalpha in NB4 cells and reduced the expression of HDAC1 in leukemic cells. In conclusion, the results suggested that EGCG can be considered as a potential treatment for APL.","['Copyright (c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['Moradzadeh, Maliheh', 'Roustazadeh, Abazar', 'Tabarraei, Alijan', 'Erfanian, Saiedeh', 'Sahebkar, Amirhossein']","['Moradzadeh M', 'Roustazadeh A', 'Tabarraei A', 'Erfanian S', 'Sahebkar A']","['Golestan Rheumatology Research Center, Golestan University of Medical Sciences, Gorgan, Iran.', 'Research Center for Non-Communicable Diseases and Biochemistry Department, Department of Advanced Medical Sciences and Technologies, School of Medicine, Jahrom University of Medical Sciences (JUMS), Jahrom, Iran.', 'Infectious Diseases Research Center, Golestan University of Medical Sciences, Gorgan, Iran.', 'Research Center for Non-Communicable Diseases and Biochemistry Department, Department of Advanced Medical Sciences and Technologies, School of Medicine, Jahrom University of Medical Sciences (JUMS), Jahrom, Iran.', 'Biotechnology Research Center, Pharmaceutical Technology Institute, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'School of Pharmacy, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],20171129,England,Phytother Res,Phytotherapy research : PTR,8904486,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '8R1V1STN48 (Catechin)', 'BQM438CTEL (epigallocatechin gallate)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (HDAC1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylase 1)']",IM,,"['Apoptosis', 'Catechin/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Histone Deacetylase 1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*metabolism']",,,2017/12/02 06:00,2018/05/23 06:00,['2017/12/02 06:00'],"['2017/07/15 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/24 00:00 [revised]', '2017/10/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/23 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/02 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ptr.5990 [doi]'],ppublish,Phytother Res. 2018 Mar;32(3):471-479. doi: 10.1002/ptr.5990.

Here, we demonstrated that PELJ induced apoptosis by upregulation of DR4 and Fas, and further it is augmented by suppression of XIAP. In addition, The PELJ-induced apoptosis is at least in part by blocking PI3K/Akt pathway. These findings suggest that PELJ may provide evidence of anticancer activities on U937 cells.

Initiating chemotherapy without prior leukocytoreduction may lead to tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). Therapeutic leukocytapheresis (TL) is used as one leukocytoreductive intervention; however, its safety and efficacy in pediatric leukemia has not been established. The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety of TL in pediatric patients and assess the efficacy of TL in reducing WBC count in pediatric leukemia. METHODS: Retrospective chart review was conducted on 14 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 5 with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent TL during the period 2000-2014 at a single institution. RESULTS: Mean WBC count of 19 patients who received TL was 483.2 x 10(9) /L (547.1 in ALL, 304.3 in AML); a portion of patients presented with central nervous system symptoms (15%), respiratory symptoms (10%), or both (10%). TL reduced WBC count (mean 50.7% reduction after a single TL procedure; additional 17.1% reduction after a second TL procedure in 6 patients). Short-term survival immediately following TL was 100% without any major procedural complication. Mean survival time in patients with AML was 1.5 years and with ALL was 6.5 years. CONCLUSIONS: TL significantly reduces WBC number in pediatric leukemia patients as young as 22 days old. In our retrospective study, TL was not associated with any significant complications and suggests that TL is a safe initial procedure in pediatric leukemia.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Thapa, Namisha', 'Pham, Robin', 'Cole, Charles', 'Meinershagen, Mitchell', 'Bowman, Paul W', 'Ray, Anish']","['Thapa N', 'Pham R', 'Cole C', 'Meinershagen M', 'Bowman PW', 'Ray A']","['Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon.', 'University of North Texas Health Science Center, Fort Worth, Texas.', 'Greenville Health System/University of South Carolina, Greenville, South Carolina.', ""Cook Children's Medical Center, Fort Worth, Texas."", 'University of North Texas Health Science Center, Fort Worth, Texas.', ""Cook Children's Medical Center, Fort Worth, Texas.""]",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],20171129,United States,J Clin Apher,Journal of clinical apheresis,8216305,,IM,,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukapheresis/*methods', 'Leukemia/complications/mortality/*therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Leukocytosis/*therapy', 'Leukostasis/therapy', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,2017/12/02 06:00,2018/11/10 06:00,['2017/12/02 06:00'],"['2017/05/22 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/31 00:00 [revised]', '2017/11/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/10 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/02 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jca.21610 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Apher. 2018 Jun;33(3):316-323. doi: 10.1002/jca.21610.

Our increased understanding of the pathogenesis of AML, facilitated by next-generation sequencing, has spurred the development of new compounds in the treatment of AML, particularly the creation of small molecules that target the disease on a molecular level. Various new agents, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors, immune checkpoint inhibitors, monoclonal or bispecific T-cell engager antibodies, metabolic and pro-apoptotic agents are currently investigated within clinical trials.

Homozygous variants in FLVCR1 have been described in association with a clinical syndrome of posterior column ataxia with retinitis pigmentosa (PCARP). Here, we describe a patient with non-syndromic retinitis pigmentosa homozygous for a splice-site variant in FLVCR1 (c.1092 + 5G>A) without evidence of posterior column ataxia or cerebellar degeneration.

In contrast, at presentation, rare cases have clinical, morphologic, and molecular genetic features truly intermediate between primary myelofibrosis and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. The taxonomy and natural history of these diseases are unclear. We identified cases which either: (1) fulfilled the 2008 World Health Organization criteria for primary myelofibrosis but had absolute monocytosis and, when available, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia-related mutations (ASXL1, SRSF2, TET2) or (2) fulfilled criteria of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia but had megakaryocytic proliferation and atypia, marrow fibrosis, and myeloproliferative-type driver mutations (JAK2, MPL, CALR). Patients with established primary myelofibrosis who developed monocytosis and those with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia with marrow fibrosis were excluded. By combining the pathology databases of two large institutions, six eligible cases were identified. Patients were predominantly male and elderly with monocytosis at diagnosis (average 17.5%/2.3 x 10(3)/mul), organomegaly, primary myelofibrosis-like atypical megakaryocytes admixed with a variable number of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia-like hypolobated forms, variable myelodysplasia, marrow fibrosis and osteosclerosis. All had a normal karyotype and no myelodysplasia-associated cytogenetic abnormalities. Five of the patients in whom a more extensive molecular characterization was performed showed co-mutations involving JAK2 or MPL and ASXL1, SRSF2, TET2, NRAS, and/or KRAS. Disease progression has occurred in all and two have died. Rare patients present with features that overlap between primary myelofibrosis and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and are thus difficult to classify based on current World Health Organization criteria. Biologically, these cases likely represent primary myelofibrosis with monocytosis, dysplasia, and secondary (non-driver) mutations at presentation. Alternatively, they may represent a true gray zone of neoplasms.

Thus, mechanism-based novel therapeutic targets warrant exploration. Recently, epidermal growth factor receptor kinase substrate 8 (EPS8), which has been identified as an oncogene and plays an important role in a broad spectrum of solid tumours, was reported to be related to poor prognosis or chemoresistance in acute leukemia patients. However, its role in CML remains unclear. In the present study, using q-RTPCR, we demonstrated that CML patients expressed a higher level of EPS8 mRNA in bone marrow mononuclear cells than healthy controls. Then, to determine the effect of EPS8 on the biological functions of CML cells, EPS8 expression was knocked down in the human CML cell line K562. Reduced proliferation, increased apoptosis, impaired adhesion and migration were observed in K562 cells after EPS8 silencing. Notably, attenuation of EPS8 increased chemosensitivity both in imatinib-sensitive K562 cells and in the imatinib-resistant murine BCR-ABL+ 32D-p210BCR/ABL-T315I cells. Mechanistically, knockdown of EPS8 downregulated p-BCR/ABL and its downstream AKT/mTOR signalling pathway. Finally, knockdown of EPS8 attenuated K562 cell proliferation in BALB/c nude mice. These data indicated that EPS8 regulated the proliferation, apoptosis and chemosensitivity in BCR-ABL positive cells via the BCR-ABL/PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Targeting EPS8 alone or combined with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor may be a promising alternative therapeutic strategy.",,"['Huang, Rui', 'Liu, Huimin', 'Chen, Yiran', 'He, Yanjie', 'Kang, Qian', 'Tu, Sanfang', 'He, Yingzhi', 'Zhou, Xuan', 'Wang, Lei', 'Yang, Jilong', 'Wu, Anqin', 'Li, Yuhua']","['Huang R', 'Liu H', 'Chen Y', 'He Y', 'Kang Q', 'Tu S', 'He Y', 'Zhou X', 'Wang L', 'Yang J', 'Wu A', 'Li Y']","['Department of Hematology, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510280, P.R.

Here, we show evidence that p53 (TP53) and CBFB are sequentially up-regulated in response to RUNX1 depletion, and their mutual interaction causes the physiological resistance against chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. Mechanistically, p53 induced by RUNX1 gene silencing directly binds to CBFB promoter and stimulates its transcription as well as its translation, which in turn acts as a platform for the stabilization of RUNX1, thereby creating a compensative RUNX1-p53-CBFB feedback loop. Indeed, AML cells derived from relapsed cases exhibited higher CBFB expression levels compared to those from primary AML cells at diagnosis, and these CBFB expressions were positively correlated to those of p53.

To address whether this phenomenon plays a role in disease pathogenesis, we generated a knock-in mouse model with NB disruption mediated by 2 point mutations (C62A/C65A) in the Pml RING domain. Although no leukemias developed in Pml(C62A/C65A) mice, these transgenic mice also expressing RARalpha linked to a dimerization domain (p50-RARalpha model) exhibited a doubling in the rate of leukemia, with a reduced latency period. Additionally, we found that response to targeted therapy with all-trans retinoic acid in vivo was dependent on NB integrity. PML-RARalpha is recognized to be insufficient for development of APL, requiring acquisition of cooperating mutations. We therefore investigated whether NB disruption might be mutagenic. Compared with wild-type cells, primary Pml(C62A/C65A) cells exhibited increased sister-chromatid exchange and chromosome abnormalities. Moreover, functional assays showed impaired homologous recombination (HR) and nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair pathways, with defective localization of Brca1 and Rad51 to sites of DNA damage. These data directly demonstrate that Pml NBs are critical for DNA damage responses, and suggest that Pml NB disruption is a central contributor to APL pathogenesis.",['(c) 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Voisset, Edwige', 'Moravcsik, Eva', 'Stratford, Eva W', 'Jaye, Amie', 'Palgrave, Christopher J', 'Hills, Robert K', 'Salomoni, Paolo', 'Kogan, Scott C', 'Solomon, Ellen', 'Grimwade, David']","['Voisset E', 'Moravcsik E', 'Stratford EW', 'Jaye A', 'Palgrave CJ', 'Hills RK', 'Salomoni P', 'Kogan SC', 'Solomon E', 'Grimwade D']","[""Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King's College London, London, United Kingdom."", ""Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King's College London, London, United Kingdom."", 'Department of Tumor Biology, The Norwegian Radium Hospital/Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', ""Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King's College London, London, United Kingdom."", 'School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Surrey, Guildford, United Kingdom.', 'Centre for Trials Research, College of Biomedical & Life Sciences, Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom.', 'UCL Cancer Institute, London, United Kingdom; and.', 'Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center and.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA.', ""Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King's College London, London, United Kingdom."", ""Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King's College London, London, United Kingdom.""]",['eng'],,"['13-1083/Worldwide Cancer Research/United Kingdom', 'R01 CA095274/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171130,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Damage/genetics', 'DNA End-Joining Repair/genetics', 'DNA Repair/*genetics', 'Intranuclear Inclusion Bodies/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mutagenesis/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein/genetics/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/genetics']",PMC5805489,,2017/12/02 06:00,2019/02/05 06:00,['2017/12/02 06:00'],"['2017/07/05 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/05 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/02 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)32490-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2017-07-794784 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2018 Feb 8;131(6):636-648. doi: 10.1182/blood-2017-07-794784.

This phase 1 study evaluated maximum tolerated dose (MTD), pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics (PD), efficacy, and safety of duvelisib in 210 patients with advanced hematologic malignancies. In the dose escalation phase (n = 31), duvelisib 8 to 100 mg twice daily was administered, with MTD determined as 75 mg twice daily. In the expansion phase (n = 179), patients with indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (iNHL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), or T-cell lymphoma (TCL) were treated with 25 or 75 mg duvelisib twice daily continuously. Single-dose duvelisib was rapidly absorbed (time to maximum concentration, 1-2 hours), with a half-life of 5.2 to 10.9 hours. PD results showed inhibition of phospho-AKT (S473) in CLL tumor cells following a single dose and near-complete inhibition of CLL proliferation (Ki-67) by cycle 2. Clinical responses were seen across a range of doses and disease subtypes: iNHL overall response rate, 58% (n = 31) with 6 complete responses (CRs); relapsed/refractory CLL, 56% (n = 55) with 1 CR; peripheral TCL, 50% (n = 16) with 3 CR; and cutaneous TCL, 32% (n = 19). Median time to response was approximately 1.8 months. Severe (grade >/=3) adverse events occurred in 84% of patients: neutropenia (32%), alanine transaminase increase (20%), aspartate transaminase increase (15%), anemia and thrombocytopenia (each 14%), diarrhea (11%), and pneumonia (10%).

Polypharmacology is commonly observed, requiring thorough target deconvolution to understand drug mechanism of action. Using chemical proteomics, we analyzed the target spectrum of 243 clinically evaluated kinase drugs. The data revealed previously unknown targets for established drugs, offered a perspective on the ""druggable"" kinome, highlighted (non)kinase off-targets, and suggested potential therapeutic applications. Integration of phosphoproteomic data refined drug-affected pathways, identified response markers, and strengthened rationale for combination treatments. We exemplify translational value by discovering SIK2 (salt-inducible kinase 2) inhibitors that modulate cytokine production in primary cells, by identifying drugs against the lung cancer survival marker MELK (maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase), and by repurposing cabozantinib to treat FLT3-ITD-positive acute myeloid leukemia.

Mice with targeted deletion of the gene encoding the Cl(-)/HCO3(-) anion exchanger AE2 (also termed SLC4A2), a membrane-bound carrier involved in intracellular pH regulation, showed a progressive decrease in the number of Treg cells. We therefore challenged AE2 as a potential target for tumor therapy, and generated linear peptides designed to bind the third extracellular loop of AE2, which is crucial for its exchange activity. Peptide p17AE2 exhibited optimal interaction ability and indeed promoted apoptosis in mouse and human Treg cells, while activating effector T-cell function. Interestingly, this linear peptide also induced apoptosis in different types of human leukemia, lymphoma and multiple myeloma cell lines and primary malignant samples, while it showed only moderate effects on normal B lymphocytes. Finally, a macrocyclic AE2 targeting peptide exhibiting increased stability in vivo was effective in mice xenografted with B-cell lymphoma. These data suggest that targeting the anion exchanger AE2 with specific peptides may represent an effective therapeutic approach in B-cell malignancies.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],"['Celay, Jon', 'Lozano, Teresa', 'Concepcion, Axel R', 'Beltran, Elena', 'Rudilla, Francesc', 'Garcia-Barchino, Maria Jose', 'Robles, Eloy F', 'Rabal, Obdulia', 'de Miguel, Irene', 'Panizo, Carlos', 'Casares, Noelia', 'Oyarzabal, Julen', 'Prieto, Jesus', 'Medina, Juan F', 'Lasarte, Juan Jose', 'Martinez-Climent, Jose Angel']","['Celay J', 'Lozano T', 'Concepcion AR', 'Beltran E', 'Rudilla F', 'Garcia-Barchino MJ', 'Robles EF', 'Rabal O', 'de Miguel I', 'Panizo C', 'Casares N', 'Oyarzabal J', 'Prieto J', 'Medina JF', 'Lasarte JJ', 'Martinez-Climent JA']","['Division of Hematological-Oncology, Center for Applied Medical Research (CIMA), University of Navarra, CIBERONC, IDISNA, Pamplona, Spain.', 'Program of Immunology and Immunotherapy, Center for Applied Medical Research (CIMA), University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.', 'Division of Hepatology, Center for Applied Medical Research (CIMA), University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.', 'Department of Pathology, New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY, USA.', 'Division of Hematological-Oncology, Center for Applied Medical Research (CIMA), University of Navarra, CIBERONC, IDISNA, Pamplona, Spain.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.', 'Program of Immunology and Immunotherapy, Center for Applied Medical Research (CIMA), University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.', 'Division of Hematological-Oncology, Center for Applied Medical Research (CIMA), University of Navarra, CIBERONC, IDISNA, Pamplona, Spain.', 'Division of Hematological-Oncology, Center for Applied Medical Research (CIMA), University of Navarra, CIBERONC, IDISNA, Pamplona, Spain.', 'Small Molecule Discovery Platform and Molecular Therapeutics Program, Center for Applied Medical Research (CIMA), University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.', 'Small Molecule Discovery Platform and Molecular Therapeutics Program, Center for Applied Medical Research (CIMA), University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Clinica Universidad de Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.', 'Program of Immunology and Immunotherapy, Center for Applied Medical Research (CIMA), University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.', 'Small Molecule Discovery Platform and Molecular Therapeutics Program, Center for Applied Medical Research (CIMA), University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.', 'Program of Immunology and Immunotherapy, Center for Applied Medical Research (CIMA), University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.', 'Division of Hepatology, Center for Applied Medical Research (CIMA), University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.', 'Division of Hepatology, Center for Applied Medical Research (CIMA), University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.', 'Program of Immunology and Immunotherapy, Center for Applied Medical Research (CIMA), University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain jamcliment@unav.es jlasarte@unav.es.', 'Division of Hematological-Oncology, Center for Applied Medical Research (CIMA), University of Navarra, CIBERONC, IDISNA, Pamplona, Spain jamcliment@unav.es jlasarte@unav.es.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171130,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Anions)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Chloride-Bicarbonate Antiporters)', '0 (Peptides)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Anions/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chloride-Bicarbonate Antiporters/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Peptides/*pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/immunology/metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC6058773,,2017/12/02 06:00,2019/07/20 06:00,['2017/12/02 06:00'],"['2017/07/10 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/20 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/02 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2017.175687 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2017.175687 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2018 Jun;103(6):1065-1072. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2017.175687.

Two hundred thirteen ALL patients were treated consecutively at our institution with allogeneic HSCT. Conditioning included TBI (1320 cGy in 8 fractions given twice daily) and cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg) with or without fludarabine (75 mg/m(2)). Patients were divided into 4 groups based on history of CNS disease and whether a CB was given. Of the 160 patients with no history of CNS disease, none received a CB (CNS-/CB-). Of the 53 patients with prior CNS disease, 41 had not received prior cranial irradiation. Thirty of these 41 received a CB of 900 to 1000 cGy in 5 daily fractions (CNS+/CB+), whereas the other 11 did not receive a CB because of physician preference (CNS+/CB-). The remaining 12 patients with prior CNS involvement had previously received cranial irradiation and thus were not candidates for a CB (CNS + PriorRT). Two-year CNS relapse risk, overall survival (OS), and disease-free survival (DFS) were calculated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Seven patients experienced post-transplant CNS relapse: 4 in the CNS-/CB- group, 2 in the CNS+/CB- group, and 1 in the CNS + PriorRT group. None of the 30 patients who received a CB relapsed in the CNS. Two-year CNS relapse risk was 0% in the CNS+/CB+ group compared with 21% (95% CI, 0% to 45%) in the CNS+/CB- group (P = .03). Two-year OS and DFS did not differ between the groups. In conclusion, among ALL patients with prior CNS leukemia, there was a trend toward a reduced risk of post-transplant CNS relapse in patients who received a CB. However, the addition of a CB did not appear to have an impact on OS or DFS.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, it remains unclear whether the poor chemotherapy response and frequent relapse after complete remission of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is also related to procaspase-8 abnormalities. METHODS: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and Sanger sequencing of the procaspase-8 gene (CASP8) were performed. Apoptotic rates were analyzed with Annexin V-FITC staining in cells expressing wild-type (WT) procaspase-8, the Q482H or C360S mutant, or control vector after treatment with or without tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). Western blot analysis was performed to detect activation of procaspase-8 and downstream apoptotic signaling pathway components in those cells. The Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays were performed to detect interaction between WT and mutant procaspase-8 proteins. RESULTS: AML patients carrying the Q482H mutation were likely to develop chemotherapy resistance. Similar to C360S, The Q482H mutation abolished caspase-8-mediated apoptotic signaling and inhibited TRAIL-induced apoptosis. The Q482H mutation impaired procaspase-8 dimerization, thus preventing the self-activation of procaspase-8. CONCLUSION: The procaspase-8 Q482H mutation in AML patients abolishes caspase-8-mediated apoptosis by impairing procaspase-8 dimerization.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The healthy lymph gland, as a hematopoietic organ during the larval stage, can give rise to two mature types of hemocytes, plasmatocytes and crystal cells, which persist into the pupal and adult stages. Homeostasis of the lymph gland is tightly controlled by a series of conserved factors and signaling pathways, which also play key roles in mammalian hematopoiesis. Thus, revealing the hematopoietic mechanisms in Drosophila will advance our understanding of hematopoietic stem cells and their niche as well as leukemia in mammals. In addition, the lymph gland employs a battery of strategies to produce lamellocytes, another type of mature hemocyte, to fight against parasitic wasp eggs, making the lymph gland an important immunological organ.

In the AD model mice, sacran markedly ameliorated AD symptoms such as scratching behavior and edema in ear. In addition, sacran significantly increased water content of the stratum corneum which regulates the skin barrier function. Furthermore, sacran significantly inhibited inflammatory cytokine and chemokine mRNA levels in the dermatitis skin as well as the IgE antibody level in serum. Sacran inhibited inflammatory cytokines mRNA production from Jurkat cells derived from human leukemia T cells after stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the expression and clinical significance of recently described chemerin in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The expression of chemerin in 149 patients with de novo AML and 35 normal controls was quantified by Real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR). Chemerin was down-expressed in AML compared with controls (P=0.042). A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve revealed that chemerin expression could differentiate patients with AML from control subjects (AUC=0.611, 95% CI: 0.490-0.732; P=0.042) respectively. The cohort of AML patients was divided into two groups according to the cut-off value of 0.0826 (79% sensitivity and 54% specificity, respectively). In addition, the AML patients with low chemerin expression had significantly shorter overall survival (OS) than those with high chemerin expression (P=0.049).

Cancer burden was projected into 2029. During 1974-2014, cancer death accounted for 28.80% of all-cause death. The 5 leading causes of cancer death were cancers of the lung & bronchus, stomach, liver, colon & rectum, and esophagus.

The mortalities of cancers of the larynx, bladder, liver, nasopharynx, lung & bronchus, esophagus, lip oral & pharynx, stomach, kidney, and lymphoma were significantly higher in men than in women. Age-standardized mortalities of cancers of the esophagus, stomach, leukemia, female nasopharynx, female bladder, liver, and bone decreased especially after the 1990s, those of the colon & rectum, kidney, prostate, pancreas, breast, gallbladder, and ovary increased significantly. Lung cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and pancreas cancer in women and lung cancer, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, and stomach cancer in men will be the leading causes of cancer death in 2025-2029. Cancer-caused life loss kept increasing since 2000.

Such drug resistance can be linked to dysregulation of ATP-binding cassette (ABC)-transporters leading to increased tyrosine kinase inhibitor efflux, potentially caused by changes in microRNA expression or DNA-methylation. In an in vitro-imatinib-resistance model using K-562 cells, microRNA-212 was found to be dysregulated and inversely correlated to ABC-transporter ABCG2 expression, targeting its 3'-UTR. However, the functional impact on drug sensitivity remained unknown. Therefore, we performed transfection experiments using microRNA-mimics and -inhibitors and investigated their effect on imatinib-susceptibility in sensitive and resistant leukemic cell lines. Under imatinib-treatment, miR-212 inhibition led to enhanced cell viability (p = 0.01), reduced apoptosis (p = 0.01) and cytotoxicity (p = 0.03). These effects were limited to treatment-naive cells and were not observed in cells, which were resistant to various imatinib-concentrations (0.1 muM to 2 muM). Further analysis in treatment-naive cells revealed that miR-212 inhibition resulted in ABCG2 upregulation and increased ABCG2-dependent efflux. Furthermore, we observed miR-212 promoter hypermethylation in 0.5 and 2 muM IM-resistant sublines, whereas ABCG2 methylation status was not altered. Taken together, the miR-212/ABCG2-axis influences imatinib-susceptibility contributing to development of imatinib-resistance.

Here we analyzed for the first time all the intermediate products of DNA demethylation pathway in the form of deoxynucleosides (5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine, 5-(hydroxymethyl)-2'-deoxycytidine, 5-formyl-2'-deoxycytidine and 5-carboxy-2'-deoxycytidine as well as 5-(hydroxymethyl)-2'-deoxyuridine) using automated isotope-dilution online two-dimensional ultra-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry.

The expression levels of TET1, TET2, TET3, SMUG1, and TDG genes were also assayed by RT-qPCR. Our results show a global erasure of 5-hydroxymethyl-2'-deoxycytidine and 5-carboxy-2'-deoxycytidine in DNA of cultured cells compared with DNA from primary malignant tissue. Moreover, malignant cells in culture have a quite different DNA epigenetic profile than cultured normal cells, and different types of malignant cells display different and characteristic profiles of DNA epigenetic marks.

The use of tumor-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) targeting these checkpoint regulators is promising and has led to this novel field of cancer immunotherapy. The first antibody directed against cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), ipilimumab, showed promising results in clinical trials and was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of metastatic melanoma in 2011. Since then, various other immune checkpoint inhibitors are being studied in preclinical and clinical trial phases, targeting programmed-death-1 (PD-1) and its ligand programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), T cell lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG-3), and others. Results from clinical trials are promising, and currently this approach has proven effective and safe in patients with solid tumors and some hematological malignancies in adults. In general, CTLA-4 and PD-1 inhibitors are well tolerated; however, the augmented immune response enabled by this class of agents is associated with a unique group of side effects called immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Experience in pediatrics using immune checkpoint inhibitors for hematological malignancies is limited to Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma as in the ongoing Children's Oncology Group (COG) protocol ADVL1412.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the potential of CNDAC for the therapy of ovarian cancer (OC). METHODS: Drug sensitivity was evaluated using a clonogenic survival assay. Drug combination effects were quantified by median effect analysis. RESULTS: OC cells lacking function of the key HR genes, BRCA1 or BRCA2, were more sensitive to CNDAC than corresponding HR proficient cells. The sensitization was associated with greater levels of DNA damage in response to CNDAC at clinically achievable concentrations, manifested as chromosomal aberrations. Three classes of CNDAC-based drug combinations were investigated. First, the PARP1 inhibitors, rucaparib and talazoparib, were selectively synergistic with CNDAC in BRCA1/2 deficient OC cells (combination index < 1) at a relatively low concentration range. Second, cisplatin and oxaliplatin had additive combination effects with CNDAC (combination index ~ 1). Finally, paclitaxel and docetaxel achieved additive cell-killing effects with CNDAC at concentration ranges of the taxanes similar for both BRCA1/2 deficient and proficient OC cells. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides mechanistic rationales for combining CNDAC with PARP inhibitors, platinum compounds and taxanes in ovarian cancer lacking BRCA1/2 function.",,"['Liu, Xiaojun', 'Jiang, Yingjun', 'Nowak, Billie', 'Qiang, Bethany', 'Cheng, Nancy', 'Chen, Yuling', 'Plunkett, William']","['Liu X', 'Jiang Y', 'Nowak B', 'Qiang B', 'Cheng N', 'Chen Y', 'Plunkett W']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas M.

There is, however, debate on how aneuploid cells arise and whether or not they are a cause or a consequence of tumorigenesis. Further, it is important to distinguish aneuploidy (the ""state"" of the karyotype) from chromosomal instability (CIN; the ""rate"" of karyotypic change). Although CIN leads to aneuploidy, not all aneuploid cells exhibit CIN. One proposed route to aneuploid cells is through an unstable tetraploid intermediate because tetraploidy promotes chromosomal aberrations and tumorigenesis. Tetraploidy or near-tetraploidy (T/NT) (81-103 chromosomes) karyotypes with or without additional structural abnormalities have been reported in acute leukemia, T-cell and B-cell lymphomas, and solid tumors. In solid tumors it has been shown that tetraploidization can occur in response to loss of telomere protection in the early stages of tumorigenesis in colon cancer, Barrett's esophagus, and breast and cervical cancers. In hematological malignancies T/NT karyotypes are rare and the role of telomere dysfunction for the induction of tetraploidization is less well characterized. To further our understanding of possible telomere dysfunction as a mechanism for tetrapolydization in hematological cancers we here characterized the chromosomal complement and measured the telomere content by interphase nuclei quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization (iQFISH) in seven hematological cancer patients with T/NT karyotypes, and after cytogenetic remission. The patients were identified after a search in our local cytogenetic registry in the 5-year period between June 2012 and May 2017 among more than 12,000 analyzed adult patients in this period. One advantage of measuring telomere content by iQFISH is that it is a single-cell analysis so that the telomere content can be distinguished between normal karyotype cells and cells with T/NT karyotypes. We find that the telomeres are particularly short in cells with T/NT karyotypes as compared with normal cells, and in T/NT karyotypes harboring additional chromosomal aberrations as well. These findings suggest that telomere dysfunction in hematological malignancies may be a mechanism for tetraploidization and CIN.",,"['Kjeldsen, Eigil']",['Kjeldsen E'],"['Cancercytogenetic Section, HemoDiagnostic Laboratory, Department of Hematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Tage-Hansens Gade 2, Ent. 4A, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark, Eigil.Kjeldsen@clin.au.dk; Tel.: +45-7846-7799; Fax: +45-7846-7399.

However, previous studies showed that measuring the posaconazole plasma concentration (PPC) on day 3 is effective for predicting steady-state levels. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relevance of early TDM (day 3) of posaconazole for achieving an optimal PPC. METHODS: This prospective study was conducted from September 2014 to August 2016. A total of 148 patients with acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes received a 200 mg posaconazole oral suspension 3 times daily for fungal prophylaxis. During the period from September 2014 to December 2015 (control group), no dose adjustment was performed on day 3. During the period from January 2016 to Aug 2016 (early TDM group), the frequency of posaconazole 200-mg administration was increased to 4 times daily in patients whose PPC on day 3 was <400 ng/mL. The cutoff value for optimal PPC on day 8 was defined as 500 ng/mL. RESULTS: In 21 of 107 patients (20%) in the control group, PPC was <400 ng/mL on day 3. In 15 (71%) of these 21 patients, the PPC was suboptimal on day 8. In the early TDM group, the PPC was <400 ng/mL on day 3 in 4 of 41 patients (10%). After increasing the posaconazole administration frequency in these 4 patients, PPC was suboptimal on day 8 in 1 patient (25%). In both groups, 104 patients had a PPC of >/=500 ng/mL on day 3, but 7% (7/104) of these had a suboptimal level on day 8. CONCLUSIONS: Early TDM on day 3 for posaconazole suspension may help more patients achieve optimal drug levels on day 8, although TDM on day 8 is needed even in patients with optimal levels on day 3.",,"['Suh, Hyeon Jeong', 'Kim, Inho', 'Cho, Joo-Youn', 'Park, Sang-In', 'Yoon, Seo Hyun', 'Hwang, Joo-Hee', 'Bae, Ji Yun', 'Lee, Jeong-Ok', 'Koh, Youngil', 'Song, Kyoung-Ho', 'Choe, Pyoeng Gyun', 'Yu, Kyung-Sang', 'Kim, Eu Suk', 'Kim, Hong Bin', 'Bang, Soo-Mee', 'Kim, Nam Joong', 'Song, Sang Hoon', 'Park, Wan Beom', 'Oh, Myoung-Don']","['Suh HJ', 'Kim I', 'Cho JY', 'Park SI', 'Yoon SH', 'Hwang JH', 'Bae JY', 'Lee JO', 'Koh Y', 'Song KH', 'Choe PG', 'Yu KS', 'Kim ES', 'Kim HB', 'Bang SM', 'Kim NJ', 'Song SH', 'Park WB', 'Oh MD']","['Departments of Internal Medicine and.', 'Departments of Internal Medicine and.', 'Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul National University College of Medicine.', 'Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul National University College of Medicine.', 'Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul National University College of Medicine.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seoul National University College of Medicine.

OBSERVATIONS: Prevalence was 7% (proven, 69%; probable, 16.4%; possible, 14.6%) and did not differ between acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia. Lungs were frequently involved (46%). Aspergillus was the commonest fungus (47%). Visceral abscesses were frequent with candidiasis as compared with invasive molds (P=0.016). IFD resulted in a prolonged admission (mean, 12.6+/-2 d; P=0.014) and death (44%) (Aspergillus, 50%; Candida, 50%; Mucor, 34%). Diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia predicted mortality (P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: IFD was an important cause of treatment related mortality in pediatric leukemia (odds ratio, 8.39).

METHODS: Somatic mutations of aforementioned genes in 412 newly diagnosed AML patients were detected with PCR and direct sequencing. All patients were also subjected to R-banding chromosomal analysis. The results were correlated with the clinical features and prognosis of the patients. RESULTS: The mutation rates of FLT3-ITD, NPM1, CEBPA, c-KIT, DNMT3A and ND4 were 9.0% (26/289), 19.1% (50/262), 18.9% (34/180), 3.4% (7/208), 6.6% (9/137) and 6.9% (4/58), respectively. Patients with poor prognosis based on genetic mutations had lower blood platelet count than those with intermediate and good prognosis (P=0.001 and P=0.001, respectively). None of the three groups attained median overall survival (OS) (P> 0.05). The complete remission (CR) was similar among the three groups (P> 0.05). For patients with different prognosis based on cytogenetic findings, white blood cell count in those with intermediate prognosis was higher than those with good and poor prognosis (P< 0.001 and P=0.004, respectively), while the blood platelet count of the intermediate group was higher than that of the group with good prognosis (P=0.018). No significant difference was found among the three groups in terms of hemoglobin level (P> 0.05). The group with poor prognosis has attained shorter OS compared with those with good and intermediate prognosis (P< 0.001 and P=0.003, respectively). However, the CR rate of the group with good prognosis was higher than that of the intermediate group (P=0.001). For the group with intermediate prognosis, presence of genetic mutations did not correlate with the clinic characteristics such as white blood cell count, blood platelet count, hemoglobin level, OS and CR rate (P> 0.05 for all comparisons).

A detailed developmental and functional analysis of the recovering NK cells was performed to link NK recovery and patient survival. The proportion of NK cells in each developmental stage was similar for patients with low, medium, and high Day 28 NK cell numbers. As compared to healthy controls, patients post-transplant showed reduced NK functional responses upon K562 challenge (CD107a, IFN-gamma, and TNFalpha); however, there were no differences based on Day 28 NK cell number. Patients with low NK numbers had 30% less STAT5 phosphorylation in response to exogenous IL-15 (p=0.04) and decreased Eomes expression (p=0.025) compared to patients with high NK numbers. Decreased STAT5 phosphorylation and Eomes expression may be indicative of reduced sensitivity to IL-15 in the low NK cell group.

Although notable improvements have been achieved in T-ALL treatment, half of the adult T-ALL patients still experience treatment failure. In order to develop a targeted therapy, we need a better understanding of T-ALL pathogenesis. In this study, we used patient-derived cell lines which display resistance to glucocorticoids. We observed that different cell lines are dependent on different survival signaling pathways. Aberrant activation of AKT, p38, S6K or ERK signaling was not found to the same degree in all cell lines studied. To understand the molecular differences in T-ALL cells, we compared gene expression and somatic mutations. Gene set enrichment analysis showed enrichment of the mTORC1, MAPK or TGF-beta signaling pathways. Loss-of-function mutations in the TP53 and FBXW7 genes were identified in all cell lines investigated. Thus, we suggest that T-ALL cells from different patients are addicted to different mutations and thereby to different signaling pathways. Therefore, understanding the enrichment of molecular pathways for each individual patient will provide us with a more precise and specific treatment plan.",,"['Moharram, Sausan A', 'Shah, Kinjal', 'Kazi, Julhash U']","['Moharram SA', 'Shah K', 'Kazi JU']","['Division of Translational Cancer Research, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Lund Stem Cell Center, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Translational Cancer Research, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Lund Stem Cell Center, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Translational Cancer Research, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Lund Stem Cell Center, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],20171106,Australia,J Cancer,Journal of Cancer,101535920,,,,,PMC5706016,,2017/12/01 06:00,2017/12/01 06:01,['2017/12/01 06:00'],"['2017/07/02 00:00 [received]', '2017/09/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/01 06:01 [medline]']","['10.7150/jca.21725 [doi]', 'jcav08p4124 [pii]']",epublish,J Cancer. 2017 Nov 6;8(19):4124. doi: 10.7150/jca.21725. eCollection 2017.,,['NOTNLM'],"['CCRF-CEM.', 'Jurkat', 'Lymphoblast', 'MOLT-3', 'T-ALL']",,['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interest exists.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The resultant BCR/ABL fusion protein displays constitutive tyrosine kinase activity, leading to the induction of aberrant proliferation and neoplastic transformation. The bone marrow (BM) microenvironment is tumor-promoting, and contributes to disease recurrence in Ph+ leukemia. Activity in the BM microenvironment is mediated by several cellular compartments, extracellular matrix, various soluble factors including transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta1), and the hypoxic conditions in the BM niche. TGF-beta1 is released during bone remodeling and plays a role in maintaining leukemic stem cells, as well as being implicated in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process in most solid tumors. Although EMT is largely implicated in epithelial tumors, recent findings argue for an EMT-like process in leukemia as well. The surface receptor CD44 is involved in cell adhesion, cell migration, and homing of normal and malignant hematopoietic stem cells. Elevation of CD44 expression is considered a marker for a worse prognosis in most hematological malignancies. We explored the functions of Snail and Twist1 in Ph+ leukemia. We showed that ectopic expression of Snail and, to a lesser extent, Twist1, upregulates CD44 expression that is beta-catenin-dependent. Moreover, the presence of Snail or Twist1 partially blocked phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced megakaryocyte differentiation, while that of Twist significantly altered imatinib-induced erythroid differentiation. Thus EMT modulators affected proliferation, CD44 gene expression and differentiation ability of Ph+ leukemia cells.",,"['Kidan, Noa', 'Khamaisie, Hazem', 'Ruimi, Nili', 'Roitman, Shay', 'Eshel, Elizabeth', 'Dally, Najib', 'Ruthardt, Martin', 'Mahajna, Jamal']","['Kidan N', 'Khamaisie H', 'Ruimi N', 'Roitman S', 'Eshel E', 'Dally N', 'Ruthardt M', 'Mahajna J']","['Cancer Drug Discovery Program, Migal - Galilee Research Institute, P.O.

Therefore, in this study we aimed to evaluate the contribution of the genotypic variants in the promoter region of MMP7 (A-181G and C-153T) to childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) risk in Taiwan. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this case-control study, 266 patients with childhood ALL and 266 non-cancer controls were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism methodology. RESULTS: The distribution of AA, AG and GG for MMP7 promoter A-181G genotype was 83.5, 12.0 and 4.5% in the childhood ALL group and 89.8%, 9.4 and 0.8% in the non-cancer control group, respectively (p for trend=0.0134), significantly differentially distributed between childhood ALL and control groups. The comparisons in allelic frequency distribution also support the findings that G appears to be the risky allele in childhood ALL. In genotype and gender interaction analysis, it was found that boys carrying the MMP7 A-181G GG and AG+GG genotypes had 9.05- and 2.45-fold odds ratios (ORs) (p=0.0135 and 0.0142, respectively) for childhood ALL compared to those carrying wild-type AA genotype. But these differences were not found in girls. Analysis of genotype interaction with age of onset age showed those aged less than 3.5 years at onset carrying the GG or AG+GG genotypes also had elevated ORs of 8.79- and 2.04-fold (p=0.0150 and 0.0413, respectively) for childhood ALL, but there was no such difference for those having an age at onset of 3.5 years or more. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the MMP7 A-181G genotype interacts with age and gender and may serve as an early and predictive biomarker for childhood ALL.","['Copyright(c) 2017, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']","['Pei, Jen-Sheng', 'Chou, An-Kuo', 'Hsu, Pei-Chen', 'Tsai, Chia-Wen', 'Chang, Wen-Shin', 'Wu, Meng-Feng', 'Wu, Ming-Hsien', 'Hsia, Te-Chun', 'Cheng, Shun-Ping', 'Bau, DA-Tian']","['Pei JS', 'Chou AK', 'Hsu PC', 'Tsai CW', 'Chang WS', 'Wu MF', 'Wu MH', 'Hsia TC', 'Cheng SP', 'Bau DT']","['Department of Pediatrics, Taoyuan General Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taoyuan, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Anesthesiology, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Terry Fox Cancer Research Laboratory, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Taoyuan General Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taoyuan, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Terry Fox Cancer Research Laboratory, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Terry Fox Cancer Research Laboratory, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Terry Fox Cancer Research Laboratory, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Terry Fox Cancer Research Laboratory, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Terry Fox Cancer Research Laboratory, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Taoyuan General Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taoyuan, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Terry Fox Cancer Research Laboratory, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C. datian@mail.cmuh.org.tw artbau2@gmail.com.', 'Graduate Institute of Biomedical Sciences, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Bioinformatics and Medical Engineering, Asia University, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,['EC 3.4.24.23 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 7)'],IM,,"['Asians/genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/ethnology/*genetics', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 7/*genetics', 'Odds Ratio', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/ethnology/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Risk Factors', 'Taiwan']",,,2017/12/01 06:00,2017/12/20 06:00,['2017/12/01 06:00'],"['2017/08/27 00:00 [received]', '2017/09/20 00:00 [revised]', '2017/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/20 06:00 [medline]']","['37/12/6679 [pii]', '10.21873/anticanres.12126 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2017 Dec;37(12):6679-6684. doi: 10.21873/anticanres.12126.,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Childhood leukemia', '*MMP7', '*Taiwan', '*genotype', '*polymorphism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Early reactivation in the setting of allo-HSCT took place mainly in patients without CMV prophylaxis, while late reactivation mainly in those patients who had completed previous prophylaxis or were on anti-CMV strategy based on pre-emptive prophylaxis. We propose classifying risk factors for CMV reactivation and CMV disease in patients after allo-HSCT as major and minor ones. Three major risk factors for CMV reactivation and CMV disease were found: (i) CMV-negative donor CMV-positive recipient serostatus, (ii) acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease, and (iii) unrelated or mismatched donor. CONCLUSION: CMV reactivation should be regarded as a continuous function of recipient and donor CMV-seropositivity and recipient immune suppression, caused by conditioning, immunosuppressive therapy and human leukocyte antigen disparity between donor and recipient.","['Copyright(c) 2017, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']","['Dziedzic, Magdalena', 'Sadowska-Krawczenko, Iwona', 'Styczynski, Jan']","['Dziedzic M', 'Sadowska-Krawczenko I', 'Styczynski J']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Collegium Medicum, Nicolaus Copernicus University Torun, Jurasz University Hospital 1, Bydgoszcz, Poland.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Collegium Medicum, Nicolaus Copernicus University Torun, Jan Biziel University Hospital 2, Bydgoszcz, Poland.', 'Department of Neonatology and Neonatal Intensive Care, Collegium Medicum, Nicolaus Copernicus University Torun, Jan Biziel University Hospital 2, Bydgoszcz, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Collegium Medicum, Nicolaus Copernicus University Torun, Jurasz University Hospital 1, Bydgoszcz, Poland jstyczynski@cm.umk.pl.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,,IM,,"['Blood Donors/classification', 'Cytomegalovirus/*physiology', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/etiology/*virology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Risk Assessment/methods', 'Risk Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Virus Activation']",,,2017/12/01 06:00,2017/12/12 06:00,['2017/12/01 06:00'],"['2017/09/11 00:00 [received]', '2017/09/29 00:00 [revised]', '2017/10/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/12/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/12 06:00 [medline]']","['37/12/6551 [pii]', '10.21873/anticanres.12111 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2017 Dec;37(12):6551-6556. doi: 10.21873/anticanres.12111.,,['NOTNLM'],"['*CMV', '*acute leukemia', '*review', '*risk factors', '*transplantation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Surprisingly, we observed that one third of JAK3-mutant T-ALL cases harbor 2 JAK3 mutations, some of which are monoallelic and others that are biallelic. Our data suggest that wild-type JAK3 competes with mutant JAK3 (M511I) for binding to the common gamma chain and thereby suppresses its oncogenic potential. We demonstrate that JAK3 (M511I) can increase its limited oncogenic potential through the acquisition of an additional mutation in the mutant JAK3 allele. These double JAK3 mutants show increased STAT5 activation and increased potential to transform primary mouse pro-T cells to interleukin-7-independent growth and were not affected by wild-type JAK3 expression.

Although many FLT3 inhibitors have been clinically developed, no first-generation inhibitors have demonstrated clinical efficacy by monotherapy, due to poor pharmacokinetics or unfavorable safety profiles possibly associated with low selectivity against FLT3 kinase. Recently, a selective FLT3 inhibitor, quizartinib, demonstrated favorable outcomes in clinical studies. However, several resistant mutations emerged during the disease progression. To overcome these problems, we developed a novel FLT3 inhibitor, FF-10101, designed to possess selective and irreversible FLT3 inhibition. The co-crystal structure of FLT3 protein bound to FF-10101 revealed the formation of a covalent bond between FF-10101 and the cysteine residue at 695 of FLT3. The unique binding brought high selectivity and inhibitory activity against FLT3 kinase. FF-10101 showed potent growth inhibitory effects on human AML cell lines harboring FLT3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD), MOLM-13, MOLM-14, and MV4-11, and all tested types of mutant FLT3-expressing 32D cells including quizartinib-resistant mutations at D835, Y842, and F691 residues in the FLT3 kinase domain.

Aggregating such data requires a method of normalization that makes patient records comparable. RESULTS: This paper proposed DBNorm, implemented as an R package, is an algorithm that normalizes arbitrarily distributed data to a common, comparable form. Specifically, DBNorm merges data distributions by fitting functions to each of them, and using the probability of each element drawn from the fitted distribution to merge it into a global distribution. DBNorm contains state-of-the-art fitting functions including Polynomial, Fourier and Gaussian distributions, and also allows users to define their own fitting functions if required. CONCLUSIONS: The performance of DBNorm is compared with z-score, average difference, quantile normalization and ComBat on a set of datasets, including several that are publically available. The performance of these normalization methods are compared using statistics, visualization, and classification when class labels are known based on a number of self-generated and public microarray datasets. The experimental results show that DBNorm achieves better normalization results than conventional methods. Finally, the approach has the potential to be applicable outside bioinformatics analysis.",,"['Meng, Qinxue', 'Catchpoole, Daniel', 'Skillicorn, David', 'Kennedy, Paul J']","['Meng Q', 'Catchpoole D', 'Skillicorn D', 'Kennedy PJ']","['School of Software, Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology and the Centre for Artificial Intelligence, University of Technology Sydney (UTS), PO Box 123, 15 Broadway, Ultimo, NSW, 2007, Australia.

We aimed to determine the frequency of TdT-negative B- and T-LL in the community hospital setting. Between 2005 and 2015, 43 pediatric patients were diagnosed with lymphoblastic leukemia at our institution, of which 6 (14%) were characterized as TdT-negative by flow cytometric analysis. Four of these 6 patients had B-LL and the other 2 had T-LL. Two of the 6 TdT-negative patients also had undetectable CD34 expression by flow cytometry (TdT/CD34 double-negatives). Subsequent paraffin immunohistochemistry confirmed the negative CD34 expression in both cases. By contrast, all the 6 patients had weak TdT-like immunoreactivity in their marrow despite the negative flow cytometric analysis. Furthermore, neither TdT/CD34-negative cases showed myc rearrangement by fluorescent in situ hybridization, ruling out Burkitt leukemia as a differential diagnostic consideration. We conclude that TdT-negative pediatric B- and T-LL cases (especially those that are TdT/CD34 double-negative) may pose diagnostic challenge to hematopathologists, and ancillary studies (paraffin immunohistochemistry to detect TdT and fluorescent in situ hybridization to exclude myc rearrangement) may be instrumental in reaching the correct diagnosis.",,"['Yasmeen, Sayeeda', 'Rajkumar, Anita', 'Grossman, Heather', 'Szallasi, Arpad']","['Yasmeen S', 'Rajkumar A', 'Grossman H', 'Szallasi A']","['1 Department of Pathology, Monmouth Medical Center, Long Branch, New Jersey.', '1 Department of Pathology, Monmouth Medical Center, Long Branch, New Jersey.', ""2 The Unterberg Children's Hospital at Monmouth Medical Center, Long Branch, New Jersey."", '1 Department of Pathology, Monmouth Medical Center, Long Branch, New Jersey.']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],20170315,United States,Pediatr Dev Pathol,Pediatric and developmental pathology : the official journal of the Society for Pediatric Pathology and the Paediatric Pathology Society,9809673,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']",IM,,"['Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'New Jersey/epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/epidemiology/metabolism', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,2017/12/01 06:00,2019/05/29 06:00,['2017/12/01 06:00'],"['2017/12/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/29 06:00 [medline]', '2017/12/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1093526617698610 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Dev Pathol. 2017 Nov-Dec;20(6):463-468. doi: 10.1177/1093526617698610.

Examination of the bone marrow aspirate revealed normal cellularity and normal myeloid: erythroid ratio with marked megakaryocytic hyperplasia. Molecular studies on the bone marrow aspirate detected both the major BCR/ABL1 p210 fusion transcript (9280 copies; p210/ ABL1 ratio: 38.2%) and the minor p190 transcript (below limit of quantitation). The platelet count normalized within 2 weeks after treatment with the second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib. Follow-up after 3 months revealed a 1.87 log reduction in p210 transcripts compared to diagnosis and no detectable p190 transcripts.

Over the past decade, many studies have shown a causal role of protein kinase dysregulations or mutations in different human diseases, including cancer. Along these lines, cancer research has demonstrated a key role of many protein kinases during human tumorigenesis and cancer progression, turning these molecules into valid candidates for new targeted therapies. The subsequent discovery and introduction in 2001 of the kinase inhibitor imatinib, as a targeted treatment for chronic myelogenous leukemia, revolutionized cancer genetic pathways research, and lead to the development of multiple small-molecule kinase inhibitors against various malignancies, including breast cancer.

Although transcriptional reprogramming is known to drive decidualization in response to progesterone, the key signaling effectors that directly mediate this hormone response are not fully known. This knowledge gap is clinically significant because identifying the early signals that directly mediate progesterone-driven decidualization will address some of the current limitations in diagnosing and therapeutically treating patients at most risk for early pregnancy loss. We recently revealed that the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) is a direct target of the progesterone receptor and is essential for decidualization of human endometrial stromal cells (hESCs). The purpose of this current work was to identify the genome-wide transcriptional program that is controlled by PLZF during hESC decidualization using an established in vitro hESC culture model, siRNA-mediated knockdown methods, and RNA-sequencing technology followed by bioinformatic analysis and validation. We discovered that PLZF is critical in the regulation of genes that are involved in cellular processes that are essential for the archetypal morphological and functional changes that occur when hESCs transform into epithelioid decidual cells such as proliferation and cell motility. We predict that the transcriptome datasets identified in this study will not only contribute to a broader understanding of PLZF-dependent endometrial decidualization at the molecular level but may advance the development of more effective molecular diagnostics and therapeutics for the clinical management of female infertility and subfertility that is based on a dysfunctional endometrium.","['(c) The Author(s) 2017.

However, it remains unknown whether HTLV-1 preferentially infects these T cells or this virus converts infected precursor cells to specialized T cells. Expression of viral genes in vivo is critical to study viral replication and proliferation of infected cells. Therefore, we first analyzed viral gene expression in non-human primates naturally infected with simian T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (STLV-1), whose virological attributes closely resemble those of HTLV-1. Although the tax transcript was detected only in certain tissues, Tax expression was much higher in the bone marrow, indicating the possibility of de novo infection. Furthermore, Tax expression of non-T cells was suspected in bone marrow. These data suggest that HTLV-1 infects hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow. To explore the possibility that HTLV-1 infects hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), we analyzed integration sites of HTLV-1 provirus in various lineages of hematopoietic cells in patients with HTLV-1 associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) and a HTLV-1 carrier using the high-throughput sequencing method. Identical integration sites were detected in neutrophils, monocytes, B cells, CD8+ T cells and CD4+ T cells, indicating that HTLV-1 infects HSCs in vivo. We also detected Tax protein in myeloperoxidase positive neutrophils. Furthermore, dendritic cells differentiated from HTLV-1 infected monocytes caused de novo infection to T cells, indicating that infected monocytes are implicated in viral spreading in vivo. Certain integration sites were re-detected in neutrophils from HAM/TSP patients at different time points, indicating that infected HSCs persist and differentiate in vivo.

However, the specific role of these enzymes in cancer is still largely unknown. Here we define a pathway that is specific for METTL3 and is implicated in the maintenance of a leukaemic state. We identify METTL3 as an essential gene for growth of acute myeloid leukaemia cells in two distinct genetic screens. Downregulation of METTL3 results in cell cycle arrest, differentiation of leukaemic cells and failure to establish leukaemia in immunodeficient mice. We show that METTL3, independently of METTL14, associates with chromatin and localizes to the transcriptional start sites of active genes. The vast majority of these genes have the CAATT-box binding protein CEBPZ present at the transcriptional start site, and this is required for recruitment of METTL3 to chromatin. Promoter-bound METTL3 induces m(6)A modification within the coding region of the associated mRNA transcript, and enhances its translation by relieving ribosome stalling. We show that genes regulated by METTL3 in this way are necessary for acute myeloid leukaemia. Together, these data define METTL3 as a regulator of a chromatin-based pathway that is necessary for maintenance of the leukaemic state and identify this enzyme as a potential therapeutic target for acute myeloid leukaemia.",,"['Barbieri, Isaia', 'Tzelepis, Konstantinos', 'Pandolfini, Luca', 'Shi, Junwei', 'Millan-Zambrano, Gonzalo', 'Robson, Samuel C', 'Aspris, Demetrios', 'Migliori, Valentina', 'Bannister, Andrew J', 'Han, Namshik', 'De Braekeleer, Etienne', 'Ponstingl, Hannes', 'Hendrick, Alan', 'Vakoc, Christopher R', 'Vassiliou, George S', 'Kouzarides, Tony']","['Barbieri I', 'Tzelepis K', 'Pandolfini L', 'Shi J', 'Millan-Zambrano G', 'Robson SC', 'Aspris D', 'Migliori V', 'Bannister AJ', 'Han N', 'De Braekeleer E', 'Ponstingl H', 'Hendrick A', 'Vakoc CR', 'Vassiliou GS', 'Kouzarides T']","['The Gurdon Institute and Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge, Tennis Court Road, Cambridge CB2 1QN, UK.', 'Haematological Cancer Genetics, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Cambridge CB10 1SA, UK.', 'The Gurdon Institute and Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge, Tennis Court Road, Cambridge CB2 1QN, UK.', 'Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, 1 Bungtown Road, Cold Spring Harbor, New York 11724, USA.', 'The Gurdon Institute and Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge, Tennis Court Road, Cambridge CB2 1QN, UK.', 'The Gurdon Institute and Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge, Tennis Court Road, Cambridge CB2 1QN, UK.', 'Haematological Cancer Genetics, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Cambridge CB10 1SA, UK.', 'The Gurdon Institute and Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge, Tennis Court Road, Cambridge CB2 1QN, UK.', 'The Gurdon Institute and Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge, Tennis Court Road, Cambridge CB2 1QN, UK.', 'The Gurdon Institute and Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge, Tennis Court Road, Cambridge CB2 1QN, UK.', 'Haematological Cancer Genetics, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Cambridge CB10 1SA, UK.', 'Haematological Cancer Genetics, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Cambridge CB10 1SA, UK.', 'Storm Therapeutics Ltd, Moneta Building (B280), Babraham Research Campus, Cambridge CB22 3AT, UK.', 'Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, 1 Bungtown Road, Cold Spring Harbor, New York 11724, USA.', 'Haematological Cancer Genetics, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Cambridge CB10 1SA, UK.', 'Wellcome Trust-MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 0XY, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Trust, Cambridge CB2 0QQ, UK.', 'The Gurdon Institute and Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge, Tennis Court Road, Cambridge CB2 1QN, UK.']",['eng'],,"['WT095663MA/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', '092096/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', '10827/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', '098051/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', '095663/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'A17001/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', '268569/ERC_/European Research Council/International', 'WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'A23015/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'MC_PC_12009/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'C6946/AI4492/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171127,England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'CLE6G00625 (N-methyladenosine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Mettl3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.1.1.62 (METTL3 protein, human)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",IM,['Cell Stem Cell. 2018 Feb 1;22(2):139-141.

We examine how demographic, clinical, and geographic-based characteristics are associated with attendance at the only pediatric survivorship clinic in a largely rural, multistate region. METHODS: One thousand eight hundred sixteen cancer survivors were diagnosed at age </= 25 from 1986 to 2005 while living in the region. Cox models incorporating death as a competing risk and generalized estimating equations calculated hazards ratios (HR) for characteristics measured at the clinic's opening. Subjects were followed from the clinic opening their first visit, death, emigration from the catchment area, or December 31, 2014. RESULTS: Five percent of survivors visited the clinic. Attendance is positively associated with a leukemia or lymphoma diagnosis (HR = 3.32, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.72-6.78 vs CNS tumors), previous relapse (HR = 1.78, 95% CI = 1.00-3.19), and residing >100 mi from the clinic (HR = 2.05, 95% CI 1.03-4.10). Survivors aged >/= 31 years at clinic opening (HR = 0.19, 95% CI = 0.07-0.54) are less likely to attend than younger survivors. Residence between 16 and 100 mi had an inverse association with attendance, although not significant. CONCLUSION: Survivorship clinics are not widely attended by survivors in this catchment region. Efforts should be made to recruit survivors aged >/= 31 and diagnosed with CNS tumors. Distance has a complex association with attendance, which could be attributed to the limited availability of preventative services in regions > 100 mi from the clinic. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Survivors living in this catchment region may not be receiving care necessary to prevent severe late effects.",,"['Ou, Judy Y', 'Smits-Seemann, Rochelle R', 'Wu, Yelena P', 'Wright, Jennifer', 'Kirchhoff, Anne C']","['Ou JY', 'Smits-Seemann RR', 'Wu YP', 'Wright J', 'Kirchhoff AC']","['Cancer Control and Population Sciences, Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, 84112, USA.

However, the effects of these agents on mature B cell lymphoma are not well known. We describe a 50-year-old man who was diagnosed with CML in the chronic phase and treated with imatinib. After 3 years of imatinib therapy that achieved a complete cytogenetic response of CML, he developed Philadelphia-negative follicular lymphoma (FL). Rituximab monotherapy induced a partial response of FL, and he subsequently achieved a major molecular response (MMR) of CML. Three years later, however, the MMR was lost, followed by the progression of FL. Imatinib was switched to nilotinib for the treatment of CML, while we chose watchful waiting for FL. He achieved MMR again under treatment with nilotinib for 8 months including one month of substitutional use of dasatinib due to adverse events, but thereafter nilotinib was switched to bosutinib due to hyperbilirubinemia. With the administration of second-generation TKIs (2G-TKIs) for a total of 18 months, he achieved a complete response to FL without antilymphoma treatment.

The formulation was optimized to achieve high drug loading using Box-Behnken design and response surface methodology. The optimal parameter comprised 2.98% polymer in acetonitrile, a ratio of oil phase to water phase of 1:8.33, and 2.12% emulsifier concentration. High drug loading and uniform spherical shape was achieved. In vitro release study showed sustained release of IRAK1/4 inhibitor for 72 hours as well as sustained release of ABT-737 for more than 120 hours. Uptake efficiency of IRAK/ABT-NP and induced apoptotic T-ALL fraction by IRAK/ABT-NP were much higher than the IRAK1/4 and ABT-737 combined solution. IC50 of IRAK/ABT-NP was two-fold lower than free drug combination in Jurkat cells. Additionally, we conducted in vivo experiments in which IRAK/ABT-NP exhibited greater cytotoxicity toward T-ALL cells, the capacity to significantly restore white blood cell number in peripheral blood, and improved survival time of T-ALL mouse model compared to the IRAK1/4 and ABT-737 combined solution.",,"['Wu, Xiaoyan', 'Wang, Lin', 'Qiu, Yining', 'Zhang, Bingyu', 'Hu, Zhenhua', 'Jin, Runming']","['Wu X', 'Wang L', 'Qiu Y', 'Zhang B', 'Hu Z', 'Jin R']","['Department of Pediatrics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan.']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],20171031,New Zealand,Int J Nanomedicine,International journal of nanomedicine,101263847,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '1SIA8062RS (Polylactic Acid-Polyglycolic Acid Copolymer)', '26009-03-0 (Polyglycolic Acid)', '33X04XA5AT (Lactic Acid)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (IRAK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (IRAK4 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Interleukin-1 Receptor-Associated Kinases)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Biphenyl Compounds/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Drug Liberation', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1 Receptor-Associated Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Lactic Acid/chemistry', 'Mice', 'Nanoparticles/administration & dosage/*chemistry', 'Nitrophenols/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Polyglycolic Acid/chemistry', 'Polylactic Acid-Polyglycolic Acid Copolymer', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Sulfonamides/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC5673049,,2017/12/01 06:00,2018/03/06 06:00,['2017/11/30 06:00'],"['2017/11/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/06 06:00 [medline]']","['10.2147/IJN.S146875 [doi]', 'ijn-12-8025 [pii]']",epublish,Int J Nanomedicine. 2017 Oct 31;12:8025-8034. doi: 10.2147/IJN.S146875. eCollection 2017.,,['NOTNLM'],"['ABT-737', 'Box-Behnken design and response surface methodology', 'IRAK1/4 inhibitor', 'PEG-PLGA', 'T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia']",,['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,['Int J Nanomedicine. 2018 Jan 31;13:615.

The number of patients receiving allogeneic stem cell transplantation in first or second response significantly increased over time whereas autologous transplantation was progressively abandoned. In the 513 younger patients, there were no differences in first complete response, induction failure, incidence of relapse, or non-relapse mortality over time. The period of time was significantly associated with a better overall survival especially in 2010-2014. The 2010-2014 period effect was still significant in multivariate analysis and was independent of allogeneic stem cell transplantation. In the 463 older patients, there was a significant interaction between the period and leukocytosis in multivariate analysis meaning that the 2010-2014 period had only an impact in patients with white blood cell count >50 giga/L for response and overall survival.

Here, we describe that resveratrol, a pleiotropic phytochemical belonging to the stilbenoids, dramatically activates the O2(-)-generating system during retinoic acid (RA)-induced differentiation of human monoblastic leukemia U937 cells to macrophage-like cells. When U937 cells were cultured in the presence of RA and resveratrol, the O2(-)-generating activity increased more than 5-fold compared with that in the absence of the latter. Semiquantitative RT-PCR showed that co-treatment with RA and resveratrol strongly enhanced transcription of the gp91-phox compared with those of the RA-treatment only. On the other hand, immunoblot analysis revealed that co-treatment with RA and resveratrol caused remarkable accumulation of protein levels of gp91-phox (to 4-fold), p22-phox (to 5-fold) and p47-phox (to 4-fold) compared with those of the RA-treatment alone. In addition, ChIP assay suggested that resveratrol participates in enhancing the gene expression of gp91-phox via promoting acetylation of Lys-9 residues and Lys-14 residues of histone H3 within chromatin around the promoter regions of the gene.

Although oral verruciform xanthoma occurs in healthy individuals, it has been also reported in association with some inflammatory conditions. The aim of this study is to report a case of oral verruciform xanthoma associated with chronic graft-versus-host disease and to review the literature on this topic. CASE PRESENTATION: A 47-year-old Caucasian male presented to the Sector of Oral Medicine ""V. Margiotta"", University Policlinic ""P. Giaccone"" of Palermo complaining of a mass on the gingiva. He first noticed the painless mass 1 year ago. He reported to have undergone allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation 15 years ago for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Intraoral examination revealed a well-circumscribed, sessile yellowish and verrucous nodule upon canine, multiple yellowish and verrucous nodules on the hard palate, yellowish and verrucous nodules on left buccal mucosa. In addiction an area of white striae in a reticular pattern with erythema and ulceration was present on the dorsum of the tongue. This lesion was consistent with a known history of oral chronic graft versus host disease. Moreover, we observed a suspected area of oral erythroplakia yet on the dorsum of the tongue. In biopsy specimen of hard palate histopathological examination revealed a diagnosis of verrucous xanthoma of the oral cavity; in addiction in biopsy specimen of the dorsum of the tongue revealed the presence of erythroplakia with high grade dysplasia. CONCLUSION: Verruciform xanthoma of the oral cavity associated with chronic graft-versus-host disease is a rare condition with a usually benign clinical course but malignant transformation has been described in association with oral potential malignant disorder (e.g. chronic graft versus host disease, erythroplakia). Very rare cases showed association with oral chronic graft versus-host-disease. To date, only eight cases were published in the world literature. Therefore it could be important follow up patients also for oral verruciform xanthoma onset.",,"['Capocasale, Giorgia', 'Panzarella, Vera', 'Tozzo, Pietro', 'Mauceri, Rodolfo', 'Rodolico, Vito', 'Lauritano, Dorina', 'Campisi, Giuseppina']","['Capocasale G', 'Panzarella V', 'Tozzo P', 'Mauceri R', 'Rodolico V', 'Lauritano D', 'Campisi G']","['Department of Surgical, Oncological and Oral Sciences, University of Palermo, Via del Vespro 129, 90127, Palermo, Italy.', 'Department of Surgical, Oncological and Oral Sciences, University of Palermo, Via del Vespro 129, 90127, Palermo, Italy.', 'Department of Surgical, Oncological and Oral Sciences, University of Palermo, Via del Vespro 129, 90127, Palermo, Italy.', 'Department of Surgical, Oncological and Oral Sciences, University of Palermo, Via del Vespro 129, 90127, Palermo, Italy.', 'Human Pathology, Department of Health Promotion & Mother and Child Care, University of Palermo, Via Alfonso Giordano 3, 90127, Palermo, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Milan-Bicocca, Via Cadore, 48, 20900, Monza, Italy. dorina.lauritano@unimib.it.', 'Department of Surgical, Oncological and Oral Sciences, University of Palermo, Via del Vespro 129, 90127, Palermo, Italy.']",['eng'],,,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20171128,England,BMC Res Notes,BMC research notes,101462768,,IM,,"['Biopsy', 'Chronic Disease', 'Erythroplasia/*complications/pathology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*complications', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mouth Diseases/*complications/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', 'Xanthomatosis/*complications/pathology']",PMC5704520,,2017/12/01 06:00,2018/07/20 06:00,['2017/11/30 06:00'],"['2017/07/16 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13104-017-2952-7 [doi]', '10.1186/s13104-017-2952-7 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Res Notes. 2017 Nov 28;10(1):631. doi: 10.1186/s13104-017-2952-7.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic graft versus-host-disease', 'Erythroplakia', 'Oral potential malignant disorder', 'Verruciform xanthoma']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3550-1812'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These malignancies affect normal homeostasis and reshape the bone marrow microenvironment. There are limited treatment options for them because of their inevitable aggravation. The current systemic administration of anticancer agents is difficult to achieve ideal therapeutic dose to suppress tumor growth at bone marrow diseased sites, and is always associated with a high incidence of relapse and severe side effects. The limitations of current treatments urge scientists to develop bone marrow targeted drug delivery systems intended for the treatment of diseased bone marrow, which can improve the efficacy of therapeutic agents and reduce their dose-limiting systemic side effects on healthy tissues. In this review we first present the current opinions on bone marrow vasculature, as well as the molecular and structural interactions between tumor cells and the diseased bone marrow.

The aim of our study was to describe changes in the HIV reservoir in a single chronically HIV-infected patient on suppressive antiretroviral therapy who underwent allo-SCT for treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We prospectively collected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by leukapheresis from a 55-year-old man with chronic HIV infection before and after allo-SCT to measure the size of the HIV-1 reservoir and characterize viral phylogeny and phenotypic changes in immune cells. At day 784 post-transplant, when HIV-1 was undetectable by multiple measures-including PCR measurements of both total and integrated HIV-1 DNA, replication-competent virus measurement by large cell input quantitative viral outgrowth assay, and in situ hybridization of colon tissue-the patient consented to an analytic treatment interruption (ATI) with frequent clinical monitoring. He remained aviremic off antiretroviral therapy until ATI day 288, when a low-level virus rebound of 60 HIV-1 copies/ml occurred, which increased to 1,640 HIV-1 copies/ml 5 days later, prompting reinitiation of ART. Rebounding plasma HIV-1 sequences were phylogenetically distinct from proviral HIV-1 DNA detected in circulating PBMCs before transplantation. The main limitations of this study are the insensitivity of reservoir measurements, and the fact that it describes a single case. CONCLUSIONS: allo-SCT led to a significant reduction in the size of the HIV-1 reservoir and a >9-month-long ART-free remission from HIV-1 replication. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that the origin of rebound virus was distinct from the viruses identified pre-transplant in the PBMCs.",,"['Cummins, Nathan W', 'Rizza, Stacey', 'Litzow, Mark R', 'Hua,

However, the use of the fast-track pathway may vary for different patient groups. METHODS: We examined data from 669 220 patients with 35 cancers diagnosed in 2006-2010 following either fast-track or 'routine' primary-to-secondary care referrals using 'Routes to Diagnosis' data. We estimated the proportion of fast-track referrals by sociodemographic characteristic and cancer site and used logistic regression to estimate respective crude and adjusted odds ratios. We additionally explored whether sociodemographic associations varied by cancer. RESULTS: There were large variations in the odds of fast-track referral by cancer (P<0.001). Patients with testicular and breast cancer were most likely to have been diagnosed after a fast-track referral (adjusted odds ratios 2.73 and 2.35, respectively, using rectal cancer as reference); whereas patients with brain cancer and leukaemias least likely (adjusted odds ratios 0.05 and 0.09, respectively, for brain cancer and acute myeloid leukaemia). There were sex, age and deprivation differences in the odds of fast-track referral (P<0.013) that varied in their size and direction for patients with different cancers (P<0.001). For example, fast-track referrals were least likely in younger women with endometrial cancer and in older men with testicular cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Fast-track referrals are less likely for cancers characterised by nonspecific presenting symptoms and patients belonging to low cancer incidence demographic groups.

Here, we employ both data independent acquisition (DIA) and shotgun data dependent acquisition (DDA) workflows for profiling proteins that are differently expressed between Ebf1(+/+) and Ebf1(+/-) cells. Both DDA and DIA were able to reveal the downregulation of the EBF1 transcription factor in Ebf1(+/-) pro-B lymphocytes. Further examination of differentially expressed proteins by DIA revealed that, similar to EBF1, the expression of other B-cell lineage regulators, such as TCF3 and Pax5, is also downregulated in Ebf1 heterozygous cells. Functional DIA analysis of differentially expressed proteins showed that EBF1 heterozygosity resulted in the deregulation of at least eight transcription factors involved in lymphopoiesis and the deregulation of key proteins playing crucial roles in survival, development, and differentiation of pro-B lymphocytes.",,"['Musa, Yaarub R', 'Boller, Soren', 'Puchalska, Monika', 'Grosschedl, Rudolf', 'Mittler, Gerhard']","['Musa YR', 'Boller S', 'Puchalska M', 'Grosschedl R', 'Mittler G']","['Proteomics Facility, double daggerDepartment of Molecular and Cellular Immunology, Max Planck Institute of Immunobiology and Epigenetics , D-79108 Freiburg, Germany.', 'Proteomics Facility, double daggerDepartment of Molecular and Cellular Immunology, Max Planck Institute of Immunobiology and Epigenetics , D-79108 Freiburg, Germany.', 'Proteomics Facility, double daggerDepartment of Molecular and Cellular Immunology, Max Planck Institute of Immunobiology and Epigenetics , D-79108 Freiburg, Germany.', 'Proteomics Facility, double daggerDepartment of Molecular and Cellular Immunology, Max Planck Institute of Immunobiology and Epigenetics , D-79108 Freiburg, Germany.', 'Proteomics Facility, double daggerDepartment of Molecular and Cellular Immunology, Max Planck Institute of Immunobiology and Epigenetics , D-79108 Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171211,United States,J Proteome Res,Journal of proteome research,101128775,"['0 (Ebf1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Data Collection/*methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Lymphopoiesis/genetics', 'Mice', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/*chemistry', 'Proteomics/*methods', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism']",,,2017/11/29 06:00,2018/09/20 06:00,['2017/11/29 06:00'],"['2017/11/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/20 06:00 [medline]', '2017/11/29 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.jproteome.7b00369 [doi]'],ppublish,J Proteome Res. 2018 Jan 5;17(1):76-85. doi: 10.1021/acs.jproteome.7b00369.

METHODS: 103 R/R AML patients were consecutively enrolled in this prospective cohort study. 55 patients were treated by CLAG induction chemotherapy as follows: 5 mg/m(2)/day cladribine (days 1-5); 2 g/m(2)/day cytarabine (days 1-5) and 300 mug/day filgrastim (days 0-5). While 48 patients were treated by FLAG: 30 mg/m(2)/day fludarabine (days 1-5), 2 g/m(2)/day cytarabine (days 1-5), and 300 mug/day filgrastim (days 0-5). RESULTS: CLAG induction chemotherapy achieved 61.7% complete remission rate (CR) and 78.7% overall remission rate (ORR), which was similar with FLAG chemotherapy which realized 48.7% CR and 69.2% ORR. No difference of overall survival (OS) was discovered between two groups either. Age cytarabine 60 years, secondary disease, poor risk stratification and BM blast >/= 42.7% and second or higher salvage therapy were independent factors for worse prognosis. Subgroups analysis revealed that in patients with second or higher salvage therapy, CLAG seemed to achieve a higher CR than FLAG. And in patients with relapsed disease, poor risk stratification or CR at first induction, CLAG seemed to realize a prolonged OS compared to FLAG. CONCLUSION: CLAG was equally effective to FLAG induction chemotherapy in total R/R AML patients, while CLAG seemed to be a better option than FLAG in patients with relapsed disease, poor risk stratification, CR at first induction or second or higher salvage therapies.",,"['Bao, Y', 'Zhao, J', 'Li, Z-Z']","['Bao Y', 'Zhao J', 'Li ZZ']","[""Department of Hematology, Xiangyang No. 1 People's Hospital, Hubei University of Medicine, Xiangyang, China."", 'Department of Hematology, The Central Hospital of Wuhan, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Taihe Hospital, Affiliated to Hubei University of Medicine, 32 Renmin South Road, Shiyan, 442099, China. lizhangzhi07@outlook.com.']",['eng'],,,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20171127,Italy,Clin Transl Oncol,Clinical & translational oncology : official publication of the Federation of Spanish Oncology Societies and of the National Cancer Institute of Mexico,101247119,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cladribine/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/drug therapy/*mortality/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Remission Induction', '*Salvage Therapy', 'Survival Rate', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives']",PMC5996008,,2017/11/29 06:00,2018/10/13 06:00,['2017/11/29 06:00'],"['2017/08/07 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/13 06:00 [medline]', '2017/11/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12094-017-1798-8 [doi]', '10.1007/s12094-017-1798-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Transl Oncol. 2018 Jul;20(7):870-880. doi: 10.1007/s12094-017-1798-8.

Patients who did not progress to myelofibrosis (MF) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) after more than 10 years (n = 50) showed a low frequency of mutations at first sample (18%) and an incidence rate of 1.7 new mutations x 100 person-years. Mutations were detected at first sample in 83% of PV/ET patients who later progressed to AML (n = 12) with these patients having a rate of 25.6 mutations x 100 person-years. Presence of mutations at diagnosis was the unique risk factor for acquiring a new genetic event (HR 2.7, 95% CI 1.1-6.8, p = 0.03) after correction for age, PV diagnosis, and total duration of hydroxyurea (HU) exposure. Patients with additional mutation at first sample showed a higher probability of developing cytopenia under HU therapy and a higher risk of AML (HR 12.2, 95% CI 2.6-57.1, p = 0.001) with mutations in ASXL1 (p < 0.0001), TP53 (p = 0.01), SRSF2 (p < 0.0001), IDH1/2 (p < 0.0001), and RUNX1 (p < 0.0001) being associated with a higher probability of AML. Myelofibrotic transformation was more frequent in patients with additional mutations, especially in SF3B1 (p = 0.02) and IDH1/2 (p < 0.0001) although a persistently high or a progressive increase of the JAK2V617F allele burden while receiving cytoreduction was the strongest predictor of MF transformation (HR 10.8, 95% CI 2.4-49.1, p = 0.002).

Inflammatory signals that are released in response to environmental stressors, such as infection, trigger active cycling of HSCs. These inflammatory signals can also directly induce HSCs to release cytokines into the bone marrow environment, promoting myeloid differentiation. After stress myelopoiesis is triggered, HSCs require intracellular signaling programs to deactivate this response and return to steady state. Prolonged or excessive exposure to inflammatory cytokines, such as in prolonged infection or in chronic rheumatologic conditions, can lead to continued HSC cycling and eventual HSC loss. This promotes bone marrow failure, and can precipitate preleukemic states or leukemia through the acquisition of genetic and epigenetic changes in HSCs. This can occur through the initiation of clonal hematopoiesis, followed by the emergence preleukemic stem cells (pre-LSCs). In this review, we describe the roles of multiple inflammatory signaling pathways in the generation of pre-LSCs and in progression to myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), myeloproliferative neoplasms, and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In AML, activation of some inflammatory signaling pathways can promote the cycling and differentiation of LSCs, and this can be exploited therapeutically.

Alternative approaches are needed to help these adult. In Algeria 'imatib' (CIPLA-India) was introduced in 2006; but no study has been published yet in the North Africa region regarding response and outcome of this copy in CML patients. The goal of this multicenter study is to characterize newly adult CML in the western region of Algeria and to assess the effectiveness and safety of imatib (IM, copy) as frontline therapy for patients with CML. Patients and Methods: The study was carried out in 7 hematology centers in the western Algeria. Patients, who were diagnosed to be suffering from CML between January 1st, 2007 and December 31st, 2014 were selected for data analysis. All patients received a copy preparation, consisting of the alpha crystal form of imatinib, (IM, copy) at an oral dose of 400 mg daily and monitored for tolerance and side effects while on therapy. Results: Between January 2007 and December 2014, 355 patients with CML were treated with imatib (Copy). The median follow- up of the study was 46 months (range: 13-107 months). Complete hematological response (CHR) was seen in 83% of patients within 3 months. According to the Sokal score, 72% patients with low, 78% with intermediate and 69% with high risk disease achieved a CHR in 3 months (p=0.26) and according to the EUTOS score, 81% of patients with low and 70% with high risk disease achieved a CHR in 3 months (p=0.08). The major molecular response (MMR) at six months (M6), M9, M12, M18 and M24 was 21%, 38%, 35%, 51% and 67% respectively and 34% of patients achieved a complete molecular response (CMR). The projected 5-year overall survival (OS) rate was 83%. Side effects of imatib (copy) in this study were similar to those reported previously for the entire imatinib mesylate treatment study and only 8% of patients were intolerant to imatib (copy) and treated with a second generation of BCR-ABL inhibitor. Conclusion: This study reflects real world experience treating patients with CML in a developing country and thus sheds light on differences in this population compared to Western countries. In conclusion, imatib (copy) is effective and safe in treating patients with CML in chronic phase and proves to have a durable outcome. To our knowledge this is the first study reporting the response to imatib (copy) in an Algerian population.",,"['Entasoltan, B', 'Bekadja, M A', 'Touhami, H', 'Mehalhal, N', 'Zouaoui, Z', 'Mesli, N', 'Talbi, M', 'Bachiri, A', 'Michallet, M']","['Entasoltan B', 'Bekadja MA', 'Touhami H', 'Mehalhal N', 'Zouaoui Z', 'Mesli N', 'Talbi M', 'Bachiri A', 'Michallet M']","[""Service d'Hematologie et Therapie Cellulaire, EHU1 Novembre, Oran, Algerie."", ""Service d'Hematologie et Therapie Cellulaire, EHU1 Novembre, Oran, Algerie."", ""Service d'Hematologie, CHU Oran, Algerie."", ""Service d'Hematologie, EPH Mascara, Algerie."", ""Service d'Hematologie, CHU Sidi-Bel-Abbes, Algerie."", ""Service d'Hematologie, CHU Tlemcen, Algerie."", ""Service d'Hematologie, CHU Bechar, Algerie."", ""Service d'Hematologie, HMRU Oran, Algerie."", ""Service d'Hematologie, CHU Lyon, France.""]",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],20171025,Italy,Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis,Mediterranean journal of hematology and infectious diseases,101530512,,,,,PMC5667527,,2017/11/29 06:00,2017/11/29 06:01,['2017/11/29 06:00'],"['2017/07/23 00:00 [received]', '2017/09/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/11/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/29 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4084/MJHID.2017.062 [doi]', 'mjhid-9-1-e2017062 [pii]']",epublish,Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis. 2017 Oct 25;9(1):e2017062. doi: 10.4084/MJHID.2017.062. eCollection 2017.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic Myeloid', 'Generic Imatib', 'Imatinib', 'Leukemia']",,['Competing interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of our study was to evaluate the frequency and prognostic implications of genetic and epigenetic alterations in p15, MGMT, DNMT3A and TP53 genes in acute leukemias. Material and methods: We included in the study 59 patients with acute leukemia. Evaluation of TP53 and DNMT3A mutations was performed using sequencing analysis and PCR-RFLP, respectively. Methylation status of MGMT and p15 genes was evaluated using MSP and COBRA, respectively. For assessment of global DNA methylation ELISA-based kit was used. Results: We found that overall survival was higher for ALL patients. MGMT promoter methylation was significantly associated with patients age at the time of diagnosis (p = 0.03). TP53 and DNMT3A mutations were observed only in AML patients (16.67% and 8.8%, respectively). Patients with acute leukemia and p15 promoter methylation had significantly more frequently mutated TP53 gene (p = 0.04) and AML patients with p15 promoter methylation had significantly more frequently detected global hypomethylation of DNA (p = 0.009). In the group of ALL patients we noted an opposite trend: only patients negative for p15 promoter methylation were characterized by global DNA hypomethylation. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that MGMT promoter methylation can have a considerable impact on the development of acute leukemia in older patients. DNMT3A and TP53 mutations may play a significant role in AML development.

Many of the molecules now known to be active in this overseeing of the evolving immune activation cascade, contributing inhibitory signals to dampen an overexuberant response, belong to the immunoglobulin supergene family. These include members of the CD28/CTLA-4:B7.1/B7.2 receptor/ligand family, PD-1 and PDL-1, CD200 and CD200R, and the more recently described V-domain immunoglobulin suppressor of T-cell activation and its ligand (VSIG-3/IGSF11). Unfortunately, from the point of view of improving immunotargeting of cancer cells, triggering these checkpoint inhibitory signaling pathways, so necessary to maintain self-tolerance, simultaneously acts to prevent effective tumor immunity. The recent development of reagents, predominantly antibodies, to act as checkpoint blockade agents, has had a dramatic effect on human cancer treatment, with a marked reported success for anti-CTLA-4 and PD-1 in particular in clinical trials.

The main clinical features are obvious physical symptoms and symptomatic splenomegaly. It may be converse to leukemia and has a shortened life expectancy. Nowadays, the therapy for PMF is aimed at maintaining comfort and there is no curative treatment. PMF with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), called MDS/MPN-u, is rare and the treatment is complex. In this study, we want to discuss an effective treatment for MDS/MPN via a case report and literature review. Materials and methods: A female patient was diagnosed with MDS/MPN through bone marrow cytology, immunology, cell genetics, molecular biology, and pathology. She received thalidomide and prednisone as initial treatment. Ten months later, the first-line therapy had failed, she presented with clinically relevant pancytopenia and increased blasts in bone marrow. Because decitabine is one of the first-line treatments for MDS and the patient was frail, she received low-dose decitabine as second-line therapy. Decitabine was administered at 15 mg/m(2) once a week for 3 weeks, in a 4 week cycle. If there was improvement the treatment interval was prolonged. Result: After one cycle, the blasts in bone marrow were decreased to 0.5%. After four cycles, she felt comfortable and hematological improvement was achieved. The treatment interval was prolonged. After eight cycles, the spleen reduced to 2 cm under the rib, and she achieved complete hematological remission. After ten cycles, the mutation of JAK2/V617F expression was decreased from 60.63% to 0.01%. During the therapy, the patient presented with grade III-IV hematological toxicity after the first two cycles, but there were no side effects after subsequent cycles. Conclusion: Our research showed that low-dose decitabine may be an effective treatment for MDS/MPN, especially in improving physical symptoms and achieving hematological remission.

Conventional ES cells can be derived and maintained in vitro with media containing the cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), which propagates the pluripotent state by activating STAT3 signaling, and simultaneous inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) and MAP kinase/ERK kinase signaling. However, it is unclear whether overexpression of OCT4 is sufficient to overcome LIF-dependence. Here, we show that inducible expression of OCT4 (iOCT4) supports long-term LIF-independent self-renewal of ES cells cultured in media containing fetal bovine serum (FBS) and a glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) inhibitor, and in serum-free media. Global expression analysis revealed that LIF-independent iOCT4 ES cells and control ES cells exhibit similar transcriptional programs relative to epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) and differentiated cells. Epigenomic profiling also demonstrated similar patterns of histone modifications between LIF-independent iOCT4 and control ES cells.

Novel therapies against alternative targets are needed to circumvent resistance mechanisms. We sought to generate mAbs against human B-cell-activating factor receptor (BAFF-R/TNFRSF13C), which has not yet been targeted successfully for cancer therapy.Experimental Design: Novel mAbs were generated against BAFF-R, expressed as a natively folded cell surface immunogen on mouse fibroblast cells. Chimeric BAFF-R mAbs were developed and assessed for in vitro and in vivo monotherapy cytotoxicity. The chimeric mAbs were tested against human B-cell tumor lines, primary patient samples, and drug-resistant tumors.Results: Chimeric antibodies bound with high affinity to multiple human malignant B-cell lines and induced potent antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) against multiple subtypes of human lymphoma and leukemia, including primary tumors from patients who had relapsed after anti-CD20 therapy. Chimeric antibodies also induced ADCC against ibrutinib-resistant and rituximab-insensitive CD20-deficient variant lymphomas, respectively. Importantly, they demonstrated remarkable in vivo growth inhibition of drug-resistant tumor models in immunodeficient mice.Conclusions: Our method generated novel anti-BAFF-R antibody therapeutics with remarkable single-agent antitumor effects. We propose that these antibodies represent an effective new strategy for targeting and treating drug-resistant B-cell malignancies and warrant further development. Clin Cancer Res; 24(5); 1114-23.

CEBPA mutations are currently identified through conventional capillary sequencing (CCS). With the increasing adoption of next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms, challenges with regard to amplification efficiency of CEBPA due to the high GC content may be encountered, potentially resulting in suboptimal coverage. Here, the performance of an amplicon-based NGS method using a laboratory-developed CEBPA-specific Nextera XT (CEBNX) was evaluated. METHODS: Mutational analyses of the CEBPA gene of 137 AML bone marrow or peripheral blood retrospective specimens were performed by the amplification of the CEBPA gene using the Expand Long Range dNTPack and the amplicons processed by CCS and NGS. CEBPA-specific libraries were then constructed using the Nextera XT V.2 kit. All FASTQ files were then processed with the MiSeq Reporter V.2.6.2.3 using the PCR Amplicon workflow via the customised CEBPA-specific manifest file. The variant calling format files were analysed using the Illumina Variant Studio V.2.2. RESULTS: A coverage per base of 3631X to 28184X was achieved. 22 samples (16.1%) were found to contain CEBPA mutations, with variant allele frequencies (VAF) ranging from 3.8% to 58.2%. Taking CCS as the 'gold standard', sensitivity and specificity of 97% and 97% was achieved. For the transactivation domain 2 polymorphism (c.584_589dupACCCGC/p.His195_Pro196dup), the CEBNX achieved 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity relative to CCS. CONCLUSIONS: Our laboratory-developed CEBNX workflow shows high coverage and thus overcomes the challenges associated with amplification efficiency and low coverage of CEBPA. Therefore, our assay is suitable for deployment in the clinical laboratory.","['(c) Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text', 'of the article) 2018.

Here we show that miR-139-5p is a potent modulator of radiotherapy response in breast cancer via its regulation of genes involved in multiple DNA repair and reactive oxygen species defense pathways. Treatment of breast cancer cells with a miR-139-5p mimic strongly synergized with radiation both in vitro and in vivo, resulting in significantly increased oxidative stress, accumulation of unrepaired DNA damage, and induction of apoptosis. Several miR-139-5p target genes were also strongly predictive of outcome in radiotherapy-treated patients across multiple independent breast cancer cohorts. These prognostically relevant miR-139-5p target genes were used as companion biomarkers to identify radioresistant breast cancer xenografts highly amenable to sensitization by cotreatment with a miR-139-5p mimetic.Significance: The microRNA described in this study offers a potentially useful predictive biomarker of radiosensitivity in solid tumors and a generally applicable druggable target for tumor radiosensitization.

Since acquisition of resistance determinants often results in a loss of fitness, the impact of mcr-1 on the fitness of E. coli and K. pneumoniae was investigated. Escherichia coli J53 and K. pneumoniae PRZ transformants harbouring the TOPO expression vector encoding mcr-1 displayed significantly decreased growth rates compared with isogenic parental strains and controls. In contrast, competitive growth experiments revealed equal growth rates between E. coli J53 pKP2442 transconjugants (TcpKP2442) and the parental strain, whereas K. pneumoniae PRZ TcpKP2442 showed significantly reduced growth rates compared with their parental strain (selection rate constant -1.62 +/- 0.49), indicating a decrease in fitness. Infection of A549 human lung epithelial cells with TcpKP2442 or mcr-1 transformants and controls revealed equal lactate dehydrogenase activities, indicating no significant impact of mcr-1 on cytotoxicity. Likewise, survival of Galleria mellonella larvae infected with mcr-1-expressing strains and isogenic controls was similar. These data indicate that expression of mcr-1 is able to cause a fitness cost when encoded on expression vectors and that acquisition of natural plasmid-borne mcr-1 does not impair fitness in E. coli J53 but negatively influences growth rates in K. pneumoniae PRZ.","['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. and International Society of Chemotherapy.

The risk of recurrence is elevated in patients with high-risk cytogenetic or molecular abnormalities, as well as when allo-HCT is performed in patients with refractory disease or with persistent molecular or radiological (PET-CT scan) residual disease. Within the frame of the 7th annual workshops of the francophone society for bone marrow transplantation and cellular therapy, the working group reviewed the literature in order to elaborate unified guidelines for the prevention and treatment of relapse after allo-HCT. For high risk AML and MDS, a post transplant maintenance strategy is possible, using hypomethylating agents or TKI anti-FLT3 when the target is present. For Philadelphia positive ALL, there was a consensus for the use of post-transplant TKI maintenance. For lymphomas, there are no strong data on the use of post-transplant maintenance, and hence a preemptive strategy is recommended based on modulation of immunosuppression, close follow-up of donor chimerism, and donor lymphocytes infusion. For multiple myeloma, even though the indication of allo-HCT is controversial, our recommendation is post transplant maintenance using bortezomib, due to its a good toxicity profile without increasing the risk of GVHD.","['Copyright (c) 2017 Societe Francaise du Cancer.

Sertad1 is identified as one of the proteins that can bind with iASPP in our previous study by two-hybrid screen. METHODS: Co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence were perfomed to identified the interaction between iASPP and Sertad1 protein. Westernblot and Real-time quantitative PCR were used to determine the expression and activation of proteins. Cell proliferation assays, cell cycle and cell apoptosis were examined by flow cytometric analysis. RESULTS: iASPP combined with Sertad1 in leukemic cell lines and the interaction occurred in the cytoplasm near nuclear membrane. iASPP could interact with Sertad1 through its Cyclin-A, PHD-bromo, C terminal domain, except for S domain. Overexpression of iASPP in leukemic cells resulted in the increased cell proliferation and resistance to apoptosis induced by chemotherapy drugs. While overexpression of iASPP and Sertad1 at the same time could slow down the cell proliferation, lead the cells more vulnerable to the chemotherapy drugs, the resistance to chemotherapeutic drug in iASPP(hi) leukemic cells was accompanied by Puma protein expression. Excess Sertad1 protein could tether iASPP protein in the cytoplasm, further reduced the binding between iASPP and P53 in the nucleus. CONCLUSIONS: Sertad1 could antagonize iASPP function by hindering its entrance into nuclei to interact with P53 in leukemic cells when iASPP was in the stage of overproduction.",,"['Qiu, Shaowei', 'Liu, Shuang', 'Yu, Tengteng', 'Yu, Jing', 'Wang, Min', 'Rao, Qing', 'Xing, Haiyan', 'Tang, Kejing', 'Mi, Yinchang', 'Wang, Jianxiang']","['Qiu S', 'Liu S', 'Yu T', 'Yu J', 'Wang M', 'Rao Q', 'Xing H', 'Tang K', 'Mi Y', 'Wang J']","[""State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science & Peking Union Medical College (CAMS & PUMC), 288 Nanjing Road, Tianjin, 300020, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science & Peking Union Medical College (CAMS & PUMC), 288 Nanjing Road, Tianjin, 300020, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science & Peking Union Medical College (CAMS & PUMC), 288 Nanjing Road, Tianjin, 300020, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science & Peking Union Medical College (CAMS & PUMC), 288 Nanjing Road, Tianjin, 300020, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science & Peking Union Medical College (CAMS & PUMC), 288 Nanjing Road, Tianjin, 300020, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science & Peking Union Medical College (CAMS & PUMC), 288 Nanjing Road, Tianjin, 300020, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science & Peking Union Medical College (CAMS & PUMC), 288 Nanjing Road, Tianjin, 300020, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science & Peking Union Medical College (CAMS & PUMC), 288 Nanjing Road, Tianjin, 300020, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science & Peking Union Medical College (CAMS & PUMC), 288 Nanjing Road, Tianjin, 300020, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science & Peking Union Medical College (CAMS & PUMC), 288 Nanjing Road, Tianjin, 300020, People's Republic of China. wangjx@ihcams.ac.cn.""]",['eng'],,"['81270635/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '81430004/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '12ZCDZSY17500/Tianjin Major Science and Technology Project']",['Journal Article'],20171128,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (PPP1R13L protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SERTAD1 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', 'Repressor Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism']",PMC5704379,,2017/11/29 06:00,2018/07/04 06:00,['2017/11/29 06:00'],"['2016/02/01 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/11/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-017-3787-2 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-017-3787-2 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2017 Nov 28;17(1):795. doi: 10.1186/s12885-017-3787-2.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Leukemic cell', 'P53', 'Sertad1', 'iASPP']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the association of miR-181 expression levels with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains inconclusive, as publications from different groups have reported contradictory results. In this manuscript, a meta-analysis was performed to assess the prognostic significance of miR-181 in AML patients. Eligible studies were retrieved from PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library databases, and a total of 6 studies including 815 AML patients were included in the final analysis. Hazard ratios (HRs) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were extracted and pooled to investigate the correlation between miR-181 and the survival of AML patients.

However, it remains unclear whether the Tim-3-galectin-9 pathway is associated with the pathophysiology of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Thus, we investigated the expression and function of Tim-3 and the clinical impact of its ligand galectin-9 in MDS. Tim-3 expression levels on MDS blasts by CD45/side-scatter or CD34/CD45 gating were increased as MDS progressed to the advanced stage. Tim-3 expression in the MDS blasts was upregulated in the presence of the cell culture supernatant of human stromal cells or the MDS-related cytokine transforming growth factor-beta1. The proliferation of Tim-3(+) MDS blasts was inhibited by the blockade of anti-Tim-3 antibody. Furthermore, plasma levels of galectin-9 were elevated as MDS progressed to the advanced stage in 70 MDS/acute leukemia transformed from MDS patients and was a prognostic factor in 40 MDS patients. Our data demonstrated that the Tim-3-galectin-9 pathway is associated with the pathogenesis and disease progression of MDS.

Here, we applied a pharmacometabolomics approach to identify potential biomarkers associated with response to this regimen in AML patients. Based on clinical response the enrolled 82 patients were subdivided into two groups: complete remission(CR) responders (n=42) and non-responders (n=40). Metabolic profiles of pre-treatment serum from patients were analyzed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry and the metabolic differences between the two groups were investigated by multivariate statistical analysis. A metabolite panel containing dodecanamide and leukotriene B4 dimethylamide (LTB4-DMA) had the power capacity to differentiate the two groups of patients, yielding an area under the receiver operating characteristic of 0.945 (85.2% sensitivity and 88.9% specificity) in the training set and 0.944(84.6% sensitivity and 80.0% specificity) in the test set. The patients with high levels of LTB4-DMA and low amounts of dodecanamide had good sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents. The possible reasons were that dodecanamide was produced by leukemic cells as a lipolytic factor to fuel their growth with a potential role in drug resistance and LTB4-DMA was a potent leukotriene B4 antagonist that could be applicable in the treatment of AML.

Pim-1 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression levels in arterial samples from streptozotocin-induced hyperglycemia rats were increased, compared with their weak expression in normoglycemic groups. In cultured rat VSMCs, HG led to transient Pim-1 expression decline, followed by sustained expression increase at both transcriptional and translational levels. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that HG increased the expression of the 33-kDa isoform of Pim-1, but at much less extent to its 44-kDa plasma membrane isoform. D-glucose at a concentration of 25 mmol/L showed highest activity in stimulating Pim-1 expression. Both Pim-1 inhibitor quercetagetin and STAT3 inhibitor stattic significantly attenuated HG-induced VSMC proliferation and arrested cell cycle progression at the G1 phase. Quercetagetin showed no effect on Pim-1 expression but decreased the phosphorylated-Bad (T112)/Bad ratio in HG-treated VSMCs. However, stattic decreased phosphorylated-STAT3 (Y705) levels and caused transcriptional and translational down-regulation of Pim-1 in HG-treated VSMCs.

We have previously demonstrated that LukS-PV potently promoted differentiation and induced apoptosis in THP-1 cells. However, the precise mechanisms of these actions remain unknown. MicroRNAs (miRs) play important roles in cellular differentiation and apoptosis. This study aimed to investigate the role of miR-125a-3p in LukS-PV-regulated differentiation and apoptosis and its underlying mechanism in THP-1 cells. METHODS: MicroRNA profiling analyses were conducted to determine differential miRNA expression levels in THP-1 cells treated with LukS-PV. Cell differentiation and apoptosis were measured in THP-1 cells by gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments. Bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assays were used to confirm the targets of miR-125a-3p. The effects of the miR-125a-3p targets on cellular differentiation were determined by knocking them down. RESULTS: MiR-125a-3p was up-regulated after treating the human monocytic leukaemia cell line THP-1 with LukS-PV. In addition, miR-125a-3p positively regulated apoptosis and differentiation in THP-1 cells treated with LukS-PV. Concordantly, luciferase reporter assays confirmed that neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) were direct target genes of miR-125a-3p. Moreover, NF1 knockdown in THP-1 cells significantly promoted differentiation in vitro. Finally, the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway, a downstream target of NF1, was activated after NF1 knockdown. CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirm that miR-125a-3p is involved in LukS-PV-mediated cell differentiation and apoptosis in THP-1 cells.","['(c) 2017 The Author(s). Published by S.

One limitation of current single-cell sequencing strategies is a suboptimal capacity to detect all classes of single-nucleotide and structural variants in the same cells. RESULTS: Here we present a new approach for determining comprehensive variant profiles of single cells using a microfluidic amplicon-based strategy to detect structural variant breakpoint sequences instead of using relative read depth to infer copy number changes. This method can reconstruct the clonal architecture and mutational history of a malignancy using all classes and sizes of somatic variants, providing more complete details of the temporal changes in mutational classes and processes that led to the development of a malignant neoplasm. Using this approach, we interrogated cells from a patient with leukemia, determining that processes producing structural variation preceded single nucleotide changes in the development of that malignancy.

However, infectious diseases remain one of the most serious complication in this population, hence associated with a high morbidity and mortality. Prevention, in particular through vaccination, constitutes a cornerstone of the management of immunocompromised hosts, since this procedure aims to protect them once back to life in community after long periods of hospitalization. If the necessity of vaccinating immunocompromised patients as well as their family is unequivocally recognized among health care workers, some questions remain source of debate. Several famous societies edited guidelines, but those differ from each other and cannot be transposed from a country to another without considering their local epidemiology and implemented vaccination schedule. Moreover, development and availability of new vaccines render recommendations constantly susceptible to adaptations. After exhaustive literature review, this article aims to offer pragmatic answers to the main questions raised by healthcare workers when vaccinating children after a bone marrow transplant. We here review all vaccines available and discuss their modalities of administration considering the timing after transplant, the immunological residual status and the medical history of the child. We also offer clues to optimize vaccination of patients' siblings.

One of the important problems in the management of shellfish allergy is the lack of accurate diagnostic assay because the biological and immunological properties of allergens in black tiger shrimp have not been well characterized. This study aims to detect proteins with the ability to bind and cross-link immunoglobulin E (IgE) from black tiger shrimp by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Western blot, and a humanized rat basophilic leukemia reporter cell line RS-ATL8. METHODS: Sera from shrimp allergic subjects were subjected to ELISA and Western blots using raw or cooked shrimp extract as antigens. Pooled sera were used to sensitize the RS-ATL8 reporter cell line and cells were activated by shrimp extract. Eluted protein extracts separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) were tested on the RS-ATL8 cell line and subjected to mass spectrometry to identify potential candidate allergens. RESULTS: Allergic sera reacted stronger to raw shrimp extract than cooked shrimp extract (P=0.009). Western blot demonstrated that major IgE reactivity protein bands were at 32-39 kDa and 91-230 kDa in both raw and cooked shrimp extracts. The eluted protein bands at the molecular weight of 38 and 115 kDa from raw shrimp extract induced IgE cross-linking as assayed by the RS-ATL8 cell line. These protein bands were subjected to mass spectrometry for analysis. Ubiquitin-activating enzyme and crustacyanin were identified as potential candidate novel shrimp allergens. CONCLUSIONS: The RS-ATL8 reporter cell line can be used to identify potential new shrimp allergens that can functionally cross-link IgE and induce mast cell degranulation.","['Copyright (c) 2018 The Korean Academy of Asthma, Allergy and Clinical Immunology', '.

The oncogenic Epstein-Barr virus is a key pathogenic driver in many PTLD cases, through known and unknown mechanisms. The other hematologic cancers include leukemias and plasma cell neoplasms (multiple myeloma and plasmacytoma). Clinical features vary across malignancies and location.

The analysis was based on 5192 children with cancer (age 0-14 years) from 6 prefectural cancer registries in Japan and 21 295 children diagnosed in England during 1993-2010. Differences in incidence rates between the 2 countries were measured with Poisson regression models. Overall survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Incidence rates for Hodgkin lymphoma, renal tumors and Ewing sarcomas in England were more than twice as high as those in Japan. Incidence of germ cell tumors, hepatic tumors, neuroblastoma and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was higher in Japan than in England. Incidence of all cancers combined decreased in Japan throughout the period 1993 to 2010, which was mainly explained by a decrease in registration of neuroblastoma in infants. For many cancers, 5-year survival improved in both countries. The improvement in survival in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) was particularly dramatic in both countries. However, 5-year survival remained less than 80% in 2005-2008 in both countries for AML, brain tumors, soft tissue sarcomas, malignant bone tumors and neuroblastoma (age 1-14 years). There were significant differences in incidence of several cancers between countries, suggesting variation in genetic susceptibility and possibly environmental factors. The decrease in incidence for all cancers combined in Japan was related to the cessation of the national screening program for neuroblastoma. The large improvement in survival in CML coincided with the introduction of effective therapy (imatinib).","['(c) 2017 The Authors.

Despite this improvement, most patients relapse. Here, we describe the outcome of 68 patients with R/R ALL after failure of blinatumomab therapy: 38 (56%) blinatumomab refractory; 30 (44%) relapsing after initial response. After a median follow-up of 49 months, 9 (13%) patients remained alive. The median overall survival after blinatumomab failure was 5.2 months. At the time of failure, among 61 patients evaluated for immunophenotype, 56 (92%) had CD19-positive blasts; only five (8%) had ALL recurrence with CD19-negative disease. Two patients progressed with lower CD19 expression. In summary, the outcome of patients with R/R ALL after blinatumomab failure is poor and treatment of these patients remains an unmet medical need. Our findings indicate that blinatumomab therapy would not exclude a significant number of patients from the potential benefit of subsequent CD19-directed therapies such as chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Jabbour, Elias', 'Dull, Johannes', 'Yilmaz, Musa', 'Khoury, Joseph D', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Jain, Nitin', 'Einsele, Hermann', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Short, Nicholas J', 'Thompson, Philip A', 'Wierda, William', 'Daver, Naval', 'Cortes, Jorge', ""O'brien, Susan"", 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Topp, Max S']","['Jabbour E', 'Dull J', 'Yilmaz M', 'Khoury JD', 'Ravandi F', 'Jain N', 'Einsele H', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Konopleva M', 'Short NJ', 'Thompson PA', 'Wierda W', 'Daver N', 'Cortes J', ""O'brien S"", 'Kantarjian H', 'Topp MS']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik II, Universitatsklinikum Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik II, Universitatsklinikum Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California Irvine, Orange, California.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik II, Universitatsklinikum Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.']",['eng'],,['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171223,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', '4FR53SIF3A (blinatumomab)', 'P93RUU11P7 (Inotuzumab Ozogamicin)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Allografts', 'Antibodies, Bispecific/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/*therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes/chemistry/*drug effects', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Substitution', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Inotuzumab Ozogamicin', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism/mortality/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Treatment Failure', 'Young Adult']",,,2017/11/28 06:00,2019/04/26 06:00,['2017/11/28 06:00'],"['2017/09/21 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/20 00:00 [revised]', '2017/11/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/26 06:00 [medline]', '2017/11/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.24987 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2018 Mar;93(3):371-374. doi: 10.1002/ajh.24987.

Nerve injury-induced protein 1 (Ninjurin 1, Ninj1) is a cell adhesion molecule responsible for cell-to-cell interactions between immune cells and endothelial cells. In the present study, we investigated the proinflammatory and neuroprotective effects of Ninj1 and a dodecamer peptide harboring Ninj1 N-terminal adhesion motif (N-NAM, Pro26~Asn37) in a rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model of stroke. Ninj1 was predominantly induced in neutrophils and endothelial cells in the ischemic hemispheres around 12 h to 1 day post-MCAO, which coincided with a massive neutrophil influx. We demonstrated that intranasal administration of Ninj1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) or N-NAM significantly blocked neutrophil infiltration in postischemic brains. In addition, intranasal administration of Ninj1 siRNA or N-NAM reduced the mean infarct volume to 46.5 +/- 9.2 or 30.6 +/- 11.7% of that of the PBS-treated MCAO controls, respectively, which was accompanied by significant amelioration of neurological and motor deficits. We showed that N-NAM or Ninj1 siRNA effectively blocked the adhesion and transendothelial migration of TNF-alpha-stimulated human myelocytic leukemia cells to human umbilical vein endothelial cells and similarly suppressed adhesion and migration of monocytes. Activations of phosphoinositide 3-kinase and Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 are involved in these Ninj1-mediated processes and can be inhibited by N-NAM or Ninj1 siRNA. These results indicate that Ninj1 plays an important role in neutrophil infiltration in the postischemic brain and N-NAM confers robust neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting Ninj1-mediated infiltration of neutrophils.",,"['Lee, Hye-Kyung', 'Kim, Il-Doo', 'Lee, Hahnbie', 'Luo, Lidan', 'Kim, Seung-Woo', 'Lee, Ja-Kyeong']","['Lee HK', 'Kim ID', 'Lee H', 'Luo L', 'Kim SW', 'Lee JK']","['Department of Anatomy, Inha University School of Medicine, Inchon, Republic of Korea.', 'Medical Research Center, Inha University School of Medicine, Nam-gu Inharo 100,, Inchon, 22212, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Anatomy, Inha University School of Medicine, Inchon, Republic of Korea.', 'Medical Research Center, Inha University School of Medicine, Nam-gu Inharo 100,, Inchon, 22212, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Anatomy, Inha University School of Medicine, Inchon, Republic of Korea.', 'Medical Research Center, Inha University School of Medicine, Nam-gu Inharo 100,, Inchon, 22212, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Anatomy, Inha University School of Medicine, Inchon, Republic of Korea.', 'Medical Research Center, Inha University School of Medicine, Nam-gu Inharo 100,, Inchon, 22212, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Anatomy, Inha University School of Medicine, Inchon, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Inha University School of Medicine, Inchon, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Anatomy, Inha University School of Medicine, Inchon, Republic of Korea. jklee@inha.ac.kr.', 'Medical Research Center, Inha University School of Medicine, Nam-gu Inharo 100,, Inchon, 22212, Republic of Korea. jklee@inha.ac.kr.']",['eng'],,"['2015R1A2A2A01003395/Mid-carrier Research Grant by National Research Foundation of', 'Korea (KR)', '2014R1A5A2009392/Medical Research Center Grant by the NRF of Korean']",['Journal Article'],20171114,United States,Mol Neurobiol,Molecular neurobiology,8900963,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules, Neuronal)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Neuroprotective Agents)', '0 (Ninj1 protein, rat)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rac1 GTP-Binding Protein)']",IM,,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Brain/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Brain Ischemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules, Neuronal/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Cell Communication/drug effects', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Infarction, Middle Cerebral Artery/pathology/physiopathology', 'Inflammation/pathology', 'Male', 'Motor Activity/drug effects', 'Nerve Growth Factors/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Neuroprotective Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Neutrophils/drug effects/metabolism', 'Peptides/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Recovery of Function/drug effects', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology', 'rac1 GTP-Binding Protein/metabolism']",,,2017/11/28 06:00,2019/02/05 06:00,['2017/11/28 06:00'],"['2017/07/09 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/05 06:00 [medline]', '2017/11/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12035-017-0810-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s12035-017-0810-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Neurobiol. 2018 Jul;55(7):6094-6111. doi: 10.1007/s12035-017-0810-1.

In ETV6-ABL1-positive cases, an in-frame fusion produced by a complex rearrangement results in constitutive chimeric tyrosine kinase activity. Monosomy 7 is also a rare and unfavorable chromosomal abnormality in childhood BCP-ALL. Here, we report a 14-year-old female BCP-ALL patient with ETV6-ABL1 fusion combined with monosomy 7. She was admitted to our hospital because of persistent fever. Bone marrow nuclear cell count on admission was 855,000/microL with 90.0% blastic cells of lymphoid morphology. Blasts were positive for CD10, CD19, CD20, CD34, cyCD79a, cyTdT, HLA-DR, and CD66c, had a karyotype of 45, XX, - 7 [18/20] and a split signal for ABL1 FISH probe (92.7%), and were sensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, imatinib and dasatinib, in vitro. ETV6-ABL1 fusion transcript was identified by whole transcriptome sequencing and confirmed by RT-PCR. She was treated with the high-risk protocol based on ALL-BFM 95, achieved complete remission (CR) after induction chemotherapy, and maintained CR for 4 months.

Part I: Indications for fertility preservation.,241-255,10.1007/s00404-017-4594-3 [doi],"PURPOSE: Most guidelines about fertility preservation are predominantly focused on scientific evidence, but are less practically orientated. Therefore, practically oriented recommendations are needed to support the clinician in daily practice. METHODS: A selective literature search was performed based on the clinical and scientific experience of the authors, focussing on the most relevant diseases and gynaecological cancers. This article (Part I) provides information on topics that are essential for the fertility preservation indication, such as disease prognosis, disease therapy and its associated risks to fertility, recommending disease-specific fertility preservation measures. Part II specifically focusses on fertility preservation techniques. RESULTS: In breast cancer patients, fertility preservation such as ovarian tissue and oocyte cryopreservation is especially recommended in low-stage cancer and in women < 35 years of age. In Hodgkin's lymphoma, the indication is mainly based on the chemotherapy regime as some therapies have very low, others very high gonadotoxicity. In borderline ovarian tumours, preservation of fertility usually is achieved through fertility sparing surgery, ovarian stimulation may also be considered. In cervical cancer, endometrial cancer, rheumatic diseases and other malignancies such as Ewing sarcoma, colorectal carcinoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, leukaemia etc., several other factors must be considered to enable an individual, stage-dependent decision. CONCLUSION: The decision for or against fertility preservation depends on the prognosis, the risks to fertility and individual factors such as prospective family planning.",,"['Schuring, A N', 'Fehm, T', 'Behringer, K', 'Goeckenjan, M', 'Wimberger, P', 'Henes, M', 'Henes, J', 'Fey, M F', 'von Wolff, M']","['Schuring AN', 'Fehm T', 'Behringer K', 'Goeckenjan M', 'Wimberger P', 'Henes M', 'Henes J', 'Fey MF', 'von Wolff M']","['UKM Kinderwunschzentrum, Department of Gynaecology and Obstetrics, University Hospital of Munster, Albert-Schweitzer Campus 1, D-11, 48149, Munster, Germany.

Exercise biology is complex and it involves various metabolic and molecular changes that translate into changes in substrate utilization, enzyme activation, and alternatively, improvement in exercise performance. Besides the effect of exercise on muscle metabolism, it has recently been discovered that contracting muscle can induce secretion of molecules called myokines. In the past few decades, a number of myokines have been discovered, such as interleukin-6, irisin, myostatin, interleukin-15, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, beta-aminoisobutyric acid, meteorin-like, leukemia inhibitory factor, and secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine, through secretome analysis. The existence of myokines has enhanced our understanding of how muscles communicate with other organs such as adipose tissue, liver, bone, and brain to exert beneficial effects of exercise at the whole body level. In this review, we focus on the role of these myokines in regulating local muscle metabolism as well as systemic metabolism in an autocrine/paracrine/endocrine fashion.

Multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC), conventional cytogenetics (CG), and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) are routinely performed on bone marrow specimens prior to HCT to assess disease status. We questioned the extent by which pre-HCT evidence of minimal residual disease (MRD) detected by these standard assays, corresponded with post-HCT relapse. We conducted a single center, retrospective study of 166 AML patients who underwent HCT. Thirty-eight of one hundred sixty-six (23%) patients in complete remission (CR) or CR with incomplete count recovery (CRi) had MRD detectable by MFC, CG, or FISH.

In this review, we provide an overview of recent progress in immunotherapy for the treatment of leukemia, focusing on antibody-drug conjugates (ADC), bi-specific T-cell engagers (BiTE), and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. RECENT FINDINGS: Ongoing clinical trials of CAR T cells directed against CD19 have produced complete remission rates as high as 93%, prompting global multicenter phase 2 trials and the first FDA approval of a CAR T-cell therapy. Insights into cytokine release syndrome, a toxicity of CAR T-cell therapy, and the cause for relapse after CAR T-cell therapy are evolving. The bispecific antibody blinatumomab and the ADCs inotuzumab and gemtuzumab have also recently received FDA approval for ALL and AML, respectively, moving these agents into a more prominent role in the relapse setting. SUMMARY: The use of immunotherapy for leukemia has been successful in creating durable remissions for multiply relapsed and refractory patients who previously had little chance of cure. The ongoing clinical and preclinical work continues to advance our understanding of these immune-based therapies, and will shape the next generation of clinical trials.",,"['Foster, Jessica B', 'Maude, Shannon L']","['Foster JB', 'Maude SL']","[""Division of Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.', ""Division of Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Pediatr,Current opinion in pediatrics,9000850,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)']",IM,,"['Antibodies/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods/trends', 'Leukemia/immunology/*therapy']",,,2017/11/28 06:00,2018/12/18 06:00,['2017/11/28 06:00'],"['2017/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/18 06:00 [medline]', '2017/11/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MOP.0000000000000572 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Pediatr. 2018 Feb;30(1):25-29. doi: 10.1097/MOP.0000000000000572.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The MDS-initiating cell is a rare HSC which transmits the genetic abnormalities to its myeloid and lymphoid progeny. The heterogeneity of MDS phenotypes could be linked to the diversity of genetic events involving epigenetic regulators, chromatin modifiers, splicing factors, transcription factors and signaling adaptors, the various combinations and order of mutations in cooperating genes, and the variegation of clonal hematopoietic hierarchy. Usually, epigenetic and splicing gene mutations occur first. A combination of one epigenetic event with a splicing gene alteration is frequent. The HSC compartment is invaded by a dominant and few minor clones organized linearly or with a branched architecture. The dominant clone containing the first initiating mutations produces myeloid and lymphoid lineages in transplanted immune-deficient mice. The mutations confer a selective advantage to myeloid progenitors at the expense of lymphoid progenitors. In the context of differentiation, one mutation may favor the amplification of granulo-monocytic progenitor, which drives the transformation into acute myeloid leukemia. Understanding the hierarchy of mutations provides insights on the mechanism of transformation. Investigation of mutation pattern and distribution along the hematopoietic tree may influence the therapeutic decision for targeted therapy.","['Copyright (c) 2018 ISEH - Society for Hematology and Stem Cells.

There are many identified mechanisms of this immune evasion that can be measured both phenotypically and functionally. Functional studies directly show the ability of the tumor microenvironment to suppress immune responses, typically measured as lymphocyte proliferation, cytokine production or killing ability. While a direct measurement of function is ideal, these assays require ex vivo activation which may not accurately mimic in vivo conditions. Phenotypic assays can directly measure the distribution and activation of immune cell types rapidly after isolation, preserving the conditions present in the patient. While conventional flow cytometry is a rapid and well established assay, it currently allows for measurement of only 12-14 parameters. Mass spectrometry-based flow cytometry, or CyTOF, offers the ability to measure 3-fold more parameters than conventional optical-based modalities providing an advantage in depth of analysis that can be crucial for precious human samples. The goal of this report is to describe the system our group has developed to measure both the phenotype and function of immune cells in the bone marrow of patients with acute myeloid leukemia. We hope to explain our system in the context of previous studies aimed at measuring immune status in tumors and to inform the reader as to some experimental approaches our group has found useful in developing the basic data required to rationally pursue immune-based therapies for patients with cancer.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Attempts to establish a precision medicine platform for AML, however, have been unsuccessful, at least in part due to the use of small compound panels and having relatively slow turn over rates, which restricts the scope of treatment and delays its onset. For this pilot study, we evaluated a cohort of 12 patients with refractory AML using an ex vivo drug sensitivity testing (DST) platform. Purified AML blasts were screened with a panel of 215 FDA-approved compounds and treatment response was evaluated after 72h of exposure. Drug sensitivity scoring was reported to the treating physician, and patients were then treated with either DST- or non-DST guided therapy. We observed survival benefit of DST-guided therapy as compared to the survival of patients treated according to physician recommendation. Three out of four DST-treated patients displayed treatment response, while all of the non-DST-guided patients progressed during treatment.

Our lab and others have demonstrated that a small-molecule inhibitor of WEE1, AZD1775, sensitizes acute leukemia cells to cytarabine; however, a mechanism of combinatorial activity has remained elusive. Thus, we sought to determine the relative contribution of WEE1 targets CDK1 and CDK2 to the combinatorial activity of AZD1775 and cytarabine. To accomplish this, we expressed ""WEE1 resistant"" CDK1 (CDK1-AF) and CDK2 (CDK2-AF) constructs in a T-ALL cell line. Expression of CDK1/2-AF together, but neither alone, enhanced the anti-proliferative effects, DNA damage and apoptosis induced by cytarabine. Furthermore, pharmacologic inhibition of CDK1 alone or CDK1 and CDK2 together reduced the combinatorial activity of AZD1775 and cytarabine. Thus, increased activity of both CDK1 and CDK2 in response to WEE1 inhibition is necessary for the combinatorial activity of AZD1775 and cytarabine.

In search for novel protein biomarkers for disease stratification we investigated the phosphoproteome in leukaemic cells from 62 AML patients at time of diagnosis using immobilized metal-affinity chromatography, protein separation by two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) and mass spectrometry before validation by selected reaction monitoring (SRM). Unsupervised clustering found 27 phosphoproteins significantly discriminating patients according to leukaemic cell differentiation (French-American-British (FAB) classification), cytogenetic and mutational (FLT3, NPM1) status or response to chemotherapy. Monocytic differentiation (FAB M4-M5) correlated with enrichment of proteins involved in apoptosis (MOES, ANXA5 and EFHD2). TALDO, a protein associated with thrombocytopenia if down-regulated, was elevated in patients with wild type NPM1 compared to patients with NPM1 mutation. This study demonstrates the potential of quantitative proteomics in AML classification and risk stratification. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Patients diagnosed with AML are currently categorized according to cellular morphology, cytogenetic alterations and mutations, although the majority of these cellular and genetic alterations have no or unsolved impact on therapy selection or prognosis. We therefore explored the phosphoproteome for abundance changes associated with traditional classifiers to unravel patterns that could stratify patients at the protein level.

Screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE), which possesses excellent properties such as low-cost, disposable and energy-efficient, was modified with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) to improve electrochemical signals and enhance the sensitivity. Rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) mast cells encapsulated in alginate/graphene oxide (NaAgl/GO) hydrogel were immobilized on the MWNTs/SPCE to serve as recognition element. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was employed to record the cell impedance signal as-influenced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa quorum-sensing molecule, N-3-oxododecanoyl homoserine lactone (3OC12-HSL). Experimental results show that 3OC12-HSL caused a significant decrease in cell viability in a dose dependent manner. The EIS value decreased with concentrations of 3OC12-HSL in the range of 0.1-1muM, and the detection limit for 3OC12-HSL was calculated to be 0.094muM. These results were confirmed via cell viability, SEM, TEM analysis. Next, the sensor was successfully applied to monitoring the production of AHLs by spoilage bacteria in three different freshwater fish juice samples which efficiently proved the practicability of this cell based method. Therefore, the proposed cell sensor may serve as an innovative and effective approach to the measurement of quorum signaling molecule and thus provides a new avenue for real-time monitoring the spoilage bacteria in freshwater fish production.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

These disorders are related mainly to chronic severe hemolytic anemia, where red blood cells (RBC) or their precursors are destroyed prematurely (hemolyzed), leading to anemia that cannot be compensated by increased production of new RBC. In such cases, IO is mainly due to repeated RBC transfusions and/or increased uptake of iron in the gastrointestinal tract. Normally, iron is present in the plasma and in the cells bound to compounds that render it redox inactive. Iron overload leaves a fraction of the iron free (labile iron pool) and redox active, leading to the generation of excess free radicals such as the reactive oxygen species. This condition upsets the cellular redox balance between oxidants and antioxidants, leading to oxidative stress. The free radicals bind to various cellular components, thereby becoming toxic to vital organs. Oxidative stress may also affect blood cells, such as RBC, platelets and neutrophils, exacerbating the anemia, and causing recurrent infections and thrombotic events, respectively. The toxic effect of IO can be decreased by treating the patients with iron chelators that enter cells, bind free iron and remove it from the body through the urine and feces. Iron toxicity may be also ameliorated by treatment with anti-oxidants that scavenge free radicals and/or correct their damage. The use of iron chelators is widely accepted when started in young patients with severe chronic anemia, but is still debatable as a therapeutic modality for older patients suffering from IO due to myelodysplastic syndromes. It should be noted that in addition to preventing iron toxicity, some compounds with iron chelator activity may also benefit other aspects of hematological disorders. These aspects include stimulation of platelet production, inhibition of leukemic cell proliferation and induction of their differentiation. Compounds with such multiple activities may prove beneficial for at least some patients with leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

While an increasing number of patients with acute leukemia are being treated with unrelated hematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCT) or umbilical cord blood transplants (UCBT), recent comparative reports of these 2 procedures are lacking. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis of the safety and efficacy of unrelated HSCT and unrelated single-unit UCBT for the treatment of pediatric and adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The primary outcomes were the rates of relapse, overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and days to neutrophil and platelet recovery. Pooled effects (odds ratios [OR] or difference in means) were determined with either random- or fixed-effects models. Our meta-analysis included 9 studies that enrolled 6762 patients (UCBT: n=2026; HSCT: n=4736). The risk of relapse for patients undergoing UCBT was similar to that of patients who received an HSCT (OR=1.030; 95%CI, 0.767 to 1.383, P=0.847). We also found no difference between HSCT and UCBT for OS (pooled OR=1.417; 95%CI, 0.936 to 2.146; P=0.100) or PFS (OR=1.165; 95%CI, 0.996 to 1.362; P=0.056). However, neutrophil and platelet recovery periods were both shorter after HSCT than after UCBT (neutrophil recovery: difference in means=-3.420, 95% CI: -5.491 to -1.349, P=0.001; platelet recovery: difference in means -20.350, 95% CI: -33.656 to -7.044, P=0.003).

This paper specifically reports on our conclusions regarding indolent lymphomas, mainly follicular lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia.","['Copyright (c) 2017 Societe Francaise du Cancer.

By exploiting the tremendous plasticity of myeloid cells, tumors induce a variety of tumor-supportive and immunosuppressive cell phenotypes like tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). The relevance of these cell types in hematopoietic malignancies has only recently gained a stronger attention. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a malignancy of mature B cells that expand in secondary lymphoid organs and the bone marrow, and accumulate in the blood of patients. A large body of evidence suggests that the interactions between CLL cells and non-malignant cells in the tumor microenvironment play a key role in the pathology of this disease. CLL is associated with an inflammatory milieu and defective immune responses. A severe skewing of myeloid and T cells toward leukemia-supportive and immunosuppressive phenotypes have been observed in patient samples and the Emu-TCL1 mouse model of CLL. Myeloid cells were thereby shown to enhance survival of CLL cells and contribute to apoptosis-resistance, to suppress anti-tumoral immunity, and to be involved in immune deficiency of leukemia patients. In addition, treatment regimens that are currently used for CLL target not only directly the malignant cells, but have also an impact on non-malignant bystander cells, including myeloid cells. This review summarizes current literature on these aspects and gives a perspective on how our current knowledge might be used to design novel immunotherapeutic approaches that can be combined with CLL-targeting drugs to achieve better therapeutic responses in CLL patients.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective review of the demographic and clinical characteristics of 498 patients at a pediatric cancer center who received therapy for acute leukemia during 3 successive influenza seasons (2010-2011 through 2012-2013). RESULTS: In 498 patient seasons with a known immunization history (median age, 6 years; range, 1-21), 354 patients (71.1%) were immunized with TIV and 98 (19.7%) received a booster dose of vaccine. Vaccinated and unvaccinated patients had generally similar demographic characteristics. There were no differences in the overall rates of influenza or ILI between vaccinated and unvaccinated patients overall, or in any individual season. There was no difference in the rates of influenza or ILI between patients who received 1 dose of vaccine and those who received 2 doses. Time to first influenza infection and time to first ILI in vaccinated and unvaccinated patients were not different. CONCLUSION: TIV did not protect children and adolescents with acute leukemia against laboratory-confirmed influenza or ILI. Future prospective studies should assess TIV effectiveness in high-risk subpopulations and alternative strategies to prevent influenza should be considered in this population.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

However, the underlying mechanisms were not fully understood. MATERIALS & METHODS: The roles of miR-509-3p in cellular apoptosis were assessed through MTT and DAPI assays. The confirmation of the regulation of BCL2 family members by miR-509-3p was investigated by luciferase reporter assay, western blot, quantitative real-time PCR and rescue experiments. RESULTS: MiR-509-3p can decrease the IC50 values of cisplatin and promote apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells. Furthermore, on a panel of anti-apoptotic proteins, we identified that miR-509-3p could regulate BCL2, BCL2L2 and MCL1 via their 3'UTRs.

Variability in the quality of specimens utilized for biomarker discovery and validation may contribute to this prognostic inconsistency. METHODS: We evaluated the impact of sample heterogeneity on prognostic biomarkers and methods to mitigate any adverse effects of this heterogeneity in 240 cryopreserved bone marrow and peripheral blood specimens from AML patients enrolled on SWOG (Southwest Oncology Group) trials. RESULTS: Cryopreserved samples displayed a broad range in viability (37% with viabilities </=60%) and nonleukemic cell contamination (13% with lymphocyte percentages >20%). Specimen viability was impacted by transport time, AML immunophenotype, and, potentially, patients' age. The viability and cellular heterogeneity in unsorted samples significantly altered biomarker results. Enriching for viable AML blasts improved the RNA quality from specimens with poor viability and refined results for both DNA and RNA biomarkers. For example, FLT3-ITD allelic ratio, which is currently utilized to risk-stratify AML patients, was on average 1.49-fold higher in the viable AML blasts than in the unsorted specimens. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first study to provide evidence that using cryopreserved specimens can introduce uncontrollable variables that may impact biomarker results and enrichment for viable AML blasts may mitigate this impact.",,"['Pogosova-Agadjanyan, Era L', 'Moseley, Anna', 'Othus, Megan', 'Appelbaum, Frederick R', 'Chauncey, Thomas R', 'Chen, I-Ming L', 'Erba, Harry P', 'Godwin, John E', 'Fang, Min', 'Kopecky, Kenneth J', 'List, Alan F', 'Pogosov, Galina L', 'Radich, Jerald P', 'Willman, Cheryl L', 'Wood, Brent L', 'Meshinchi, Soheil', 'Stirewalt, Derek L']","['Pogosova-Agadjanyan EL', 'Moseley A', 'Othus M', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Chauncey TR', 'Chen IL', 'Erba HP', 'Godwin JE', 'Fang M', 'Kopecky KJ', 'List AF', 'Pogosov GL', 'Radich JP', 'Willman CL', 'Wood BL', 'Meshinchi S', 'Stirewalt DL']","['1 Clinical Research Division , Fred Hutch, Seattle, Washington.', '2 SWOG Statistical Center , Fred Hutch, Seattle, Washington.', '2 SWOG Statistical Center , Fred Hutch, Seattle, Washington.', '1 Clinical Research Division , Fred Hutch, Seattle, Washington.', '3 Departments of Oncology and Hematology, University of Washington , Seattle, Washington.', '1 Clinical Research Division , Fred Hutch, Seattle, Washington.', '3 Departments of Oncology and Hematology, University of Washington , Seattle, Washington.', '4 VA Puget Sound Health Care System , Seattle, Washington.', '5 Department of Pathology, University of New Mexico , UNM Comprehensive Cancer Center, Albuquerque, New Mexico .', '6 Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Alabama at Birmingham , Birmingham, Alabama.', '7 Providence Cancer Center, Earle A.

METHODS: For this study, we obtained paired marrow samples at two different time points (initial diagnosis and first complete remission status) in patients with AML. Bone marrow microRNAs were profiled by next-generation small RNA sequencing. Quantification of microRNA expression was performed by counting aligned reads to microRNA genes. RESULTS: Among 38 samples (32 paired samples from 16 AML patients and 6 normal marrow controls), 27 were eligible for sequencing. Small RNA sequencing showed that 12 microRNAs were selectively expressed at higher levels in AML patients than in normal controls. Among these 12 microRNAs, mir-181, mir-221, and mir-3154 were more highly expressed at initial AML diagnosis as compared to first complete remission. Significant correlations were found between higher expression levels of mir-221, mir-146, and mir-155 and higher marrow blast counts. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that mir-221 and mir-181 are selectively enriched in AML marrow and reflect disease activity. mir-3154 is a novel microRNA that is relevant to AML but needs further validation.",,"['Lee, Yun-Gyoo', 'Kim, Inho', 'Oh, Somi', 'Shin, Dong-Yeop', 'Koh, Youngil', 'Lee, Keun-Wook']","['Lee YG', 'Kim I', 'Oh S', 'Shin DY', 'Koh Y', 'Lee KW']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Kangbuk Samsung Hospital, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital and Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital and Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital and Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital and Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, Korea.']",['eng'],,"['2011-0024046/National Research Foundation of Korea', '2015-0024046/National Research Foundation of Korea', 'Ministry of Education', '80020140171/Seoul National University College of Medicine']",['Journal Article'],20171127,Korea (South),Korean J Intern Med,The Korean journal of internal medicine,8712418,"['0 (MIRN221 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN3154 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIrn181 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA', 'Transcriptome', 'Tumor Burden/genetics', 'Young Adult']",PMC6325437,,2017/11/28 06:00,2020/01/30 06:00,['2017/11/28 06:00'],"['2017/03/01 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/30 06:00 [medline]', '2017/11/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['kjim.2017.102 [pii]', '10.3904/kjim.2017.102 [doi]']",ppublish,Korean J Intern Med. 2019 Jan;34(1):178-183. doi: 10.3904/kjim.2017.102.

As with other malignancies, progression may be result of induction and formation of new blood vessels influenced by disease conditions. Cancer cells produce a variety of factors which play important roles in angiogenesis. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is critical for many malignancies, including AMLs. Curcumin, as a natural compound, is able to enhance apoptosis via a mechanism affecting regulatory genes. As a new strategy we here evaluated anti- VEGF properties of curcumin, alone and in combination with thalidomide, in leukemic cell lines. Growth inhibitory effects were assessed by MTT assay and apoptosis was detected by annexin/PI staining in U937 and KG-1 cell lines. mRNA expression levels of VEGF isoforms were evaluated by qRT-PCR. Curcumin inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in both KG-1 and U937 cells and this effect was stronger in combination with thalidomide. In KG-1 cells, the level of VEGF (A, B, C and D) mRNA was decreased in curcumin-treated as compared to untreated cells. Maximum effects were obtained at the concentration of 40 muM curcumin in U937 cells. Taken together, the results indicate that the VEGF autocrine loop may have an impact on AML development and progression and could be considered as a therapeutic target. Thalidomide as a VEGF inhibitor in combination with curcumin appears to have a synergistic impact on inhibition of cell proliferation and promotion of apoptosis.",['Creative Commons Attribution License'],"['Salemi, Mahdieh', 'Mohammadi, Saeed', 'Ghavamzadeh, Ardeshir', 'Nikbakht, Mohsen']","['Salemi M', 'Mohammadi S', 'Ghavamzadeh A', 'Nikbakht M']","['Medical Biotechnology Research Center, Ashkezar Branch, Islamic Azad University, Ashkezar, Yazd, Iran.

The frequency and types of gene mutations in these cases may differ among various populations. The objective of this study was to identify frequencies and types of FLT3-ITD, NPM1, and DNMT3A mutations, and associations of them with clinical data and risk factors in CN-AML and CN-MDS cases in upper Northern Thailand. Methods: Bone marrow samples of 40 CN-AML and 60 CN-MDS patients were analyzed for gene mutations by direct sequencing. In addition, data for potential risk factors were obtained for comparison. Results: Frequencies of FLT3-ITD, NPM1, and DNMT3A mutations were 25.0%, 17.5%, and 10.0%, respectively in CN-AML, but all zero in CN-MDS cases. NPM1 mutations were found at a median age older than the wild type (58 vs 47 years) while DNMT3A mutations were associated with an increase in the white blood cell count. In all patients, factors for the mutations of these three genes included age </= 60 years, and a history of hypertension. Conclusion: When considering mutations in only normal karyotype patients, the frequency of FLT3-ITD, NPM1, DNMT3A mutations in CN-AML patients in upper Northern Thailand were found to occur at lower rates than in Western patients and to differ from other Asian populations including parts of Thailand. No mutations were observed in CN-MDS cases. Some types of gene mutations differed from previous studies, possibly attributable to differences in geography, lifestyle and genetic backgrounds. Links with age </= 60 years and history of hypertension were found. Investigation of these three genes in an intermediate risk group with a normal karyotype is useful for a better understanding of molecular leukemogenetic steps in CN-AML and CN-MDS patients and may be beneficial for planning treatment and prevention in the population of upper Northern Thailand.",['Creative Commons Attribution License'],"['Mevatee, Piyanan', 'Tantiworawit, Adisak', 'Traisathit, Patrinee', 'Puaninta, Chaniporn', 'Mevatee, Umnat', 'Angsuchawan, Sirinda', 'Bumroongkit, Kanokkan']","['Mevatee P', 'Tantiworawit A', 'Traisathit P', 'Puaninta C', 'Mevatee U', 'Angsuchawan S', 'Bumroongkit K']","['Department of Anatomy, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Thailand.

Although GO shows a narrow therapeutic window in early clinical studies, recent reports detailing a modified dosing regimen of GO can be safely combined with induction chemotherapy, and the combination provides significant survival benefits in AML patients. Here we tested whether the survival benefits seen with the combination arise from the enhanced reduction of chemoresidual disease and leukemic initiating cells (LICs). Herein, we use cell line and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) AML models to evaluate the combination of GO with daunorubicin and cytarabine (DA) induction chemotherapy on AML blast growth and animal survival. DA chemotherapy and GO as separate treatments reduced AML burden but left significant chemoresidual disease in multiple AML models. The combination of GO and DA chemotherapy eliminated nearly all AML burden and extended overall survival. In two small subsets of AML models, chemoresidual disease following DA chemotherapy displayed hallmark markers of leukemic LICs (CLL1 and CD34). In vivo, the two chemoresistant subpopulations (CLL1+/CD117- and CD34+/CD38+) showed higher ability to self-renewal than their counterpart subpopulations, respectively. CD33 was coexpressed in these functional LIC subpopulations. We demonstrate that the GO and DA induction chemotherapy combination more effectively eliminates LICs in AML PDX models than either single agent alone. These data suggest that the survival benefit seen by the combination of GO and induction chemotherapy, nonclinically and clinically, may be attributed to the enhanced reduction of LICs.",['Copyright (c) 2018 The Authors.

In recent years, galactomannan detection has markedly improved the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis, but very little is known on how physicians deal with this test in clinical practice. METHODS: This cross-sectional study aimed to analyze the indications for the use of serum galactomannan in a large Brazilian hospital, between 2015 and 2016. No specific protocol was in place for GM request. We reviewed the medical records of adult (>18 years-old) patients who were tested for galactomannan due to one the following indications: screening, diagnosis, or treatment follow-up. Additional variables included demographic data, underlying diseases, presence of neutropenia, and use of previous antifungal (anti-Aspergillus) drugs. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 51 years-old (sd+/-15.8), and 63.3% of patients were male. Patients with hematological malignancies accounted for 60.1% of the cases, mostly acute myeloid leukemia (19.6%). Galactomannan testing was positive in 12.2% of patients, including 1.6% of occasions in which the test was used for screening purposes, 13.2% for diagnosis, and 32.4% during follow-up. Median time for chest imaging request was two days before GM testing. Previous antifungal therapy was reported for 35.1% of patients, mostly amphotericin B (57.1%). CONCLUSION: The correct use of galactomannan testing is essential for an early diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis, which may improve the prognosis of the disease. We demonstrated that clinicians usually ask for galactomannan tests to confirm imaging findings in patients who frequently were on antifungal drugs, something that could be improved by medical education. We observed a low frequency of galactomannan use for preemptive antifungal therapy (25.7%), which is worrying considering the well-known beneficial use of GM testing in this scenario.","['Copyright (c) 2017 Sociedade Brasileira de Infectologia.

FCI results also influence therapeutic decisions and disease prognosis. ClearLLab LS is a 12-antibody 10-color cocktail provided in dry format designed as a screen for patients suspected of having hematolymphoid disease. METHODS: A blinded comparison between ClearLLab LS, (CD8-FITC, Kappa-FITC,CD4-PE, Lambda-PE, CD19-ECD, CD56-PE-Cy5.5, CD10-PE-Cy7, CD34-APC, CD5-APC-A700, CD20-APC-A750, CD3-PB, and CD45-KrO), ClearLLab Reagents (five-color, 17-antibodies) and individual Laboratory Developed Tests (LDTs), was conducted at four laboratories. Evaluation of ClearLLab LS was performed on 210 specimens, compared to the five-color ClearLLab Reagents (IVD and CE-IVD), and a subset (n = 167) to LDTs. RESULTS: ClearLLab LS showed good agreement to ClearLLab Reagents in detecting the absence (104/104) or presence (106/106) of abnormal populations. Of specimens with abnormal populations the ClearLLab LS agreed with the ClearLLab Reagent for neoplasm maturity assessment (70/70 mature and 36/36 immature). Out of 167 specimens with LDTs results, 86 contained abnormal population(s), ClearLLab LS detected 82 (95.3%) of cases. Of the 4 cases not detected by ClearLLab LS, 3 were plasma cell neoplasms and 1 was a mature T cell malignancy. Eighty-one samples with no hematological malignancy as analyzed by LDT were also negative by ClearLLab LS (100% agreement). ClearLLab LS agreed with LDTs assessment of neoplasms' maturity (55/55 mature and 27/27 immature). CONCLUSION: ClearLLab LS screening tube showed excellent agreement between ClearLLab Reagents and with LDT's. The presence of CD34 and CD10 in the tube allowed the detection of blast populations in several acute leukemias and myeloid neoplasms that were tested.

Loss of PLZF results in progressive depletion of SSCs after the first wave of spermatogenesis leading to eventual spermatogenic arrest, apparently the result of a shift in the balance in SSC fate away from self-renewal and toward differentiation. Cumulating evidences have demonstrated that microRNAs are expressed in a cell-specific or stage-specific manner during spermatogenesis and acts as regulators on specific makers such as Stra8, ETV5, and PLZF. However, the post transcriptional function of PLZF still poorly elucidate in mGSCs. Bioinformatic analysis and dual luciferase reporter assay showed that miR-19b-3p binds the 3'UTR of PLZF, suggesting that PLZF is a direct target of miR-19b-3p. The profile of miR-19b-3p and PLZF analyzed in dairy goat testis at different age showed that miR-19b-3p was significantly up-regulated in goat testis at 1, 3, 6 months and downregulated at 12, 18, and 24 months which was inversely correlated with PLZF in the same testis. Focusing on the role of miR-19b-3p, we found that miR-19b-3p changes c-KIT and mTOR signaling through PLZF to promote proliferation in goat nGSCs and infertile mice testes. Over-expression of PLZF significantly reversed miR-19b-3p-mediated proliferation in mice testes. We found also that miR-19b-3p reduced heterochromatin-mediated senescence through PLZF localized on HP1alpha. Taken together, our findings indicate that miR-19b-3p promotes proliferation and reduces heterochromatin-mediated senescence through PLZF in mGSCs.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Daguia Zambe, John Clotaire', 'Zhai, Yuanxin', 'Zhou, Zhe', 'Du, Xiaomi', 'Wei, Yudong', 'Ma, Fanglin', 'Hua, Jinlian']","['Daguia Zambe JC', 'Zhai Y', 'Zhou Z', 'Du X', 'Wei Y', 'Ma F', 'Hua J']","['College of Veterinary Medicine, Shaanxi Centre of Stem Cells Engineering and Technology, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi, China.', 'Faculty of Science, Laboratoire des sciences Agronomiques et Biologiques pour le Developpement (LASBAD), University of Bangui, Central Africa.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Shaanxi Centre of Stem Cells Engineering and Technology, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Shaanxi Centre of Stem Cells Engineering and Technology, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Shaanxi Centre of Stem Cells Engineering and Technology, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Shaanxi Centre of Stem Cells Engineering and Technology, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Shaanxi Centre of Stem Cells Engineering and Technology, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Shaanxi Centre of Stem Cells Engineering and Technology, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi, China.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171124,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (Heterochromatin)', '0 (MIRN19 microRNA, mouse)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Zbtb16 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,,"[""3' Untranslated Regions"", 'Adult Germline Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Proliferation', '*Cellular Senescence', 'Goats', 'Heterochromatin/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Testis/cytology/*metabolism']",,,2017/11/25 06:00,2019/04/16 06:00,['2017/11/25 06:00'],"['2017/06/27 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/16 06:00 [medline]', '2017/11/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.26231 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2018 Jun;233(6):4652-4665. doi: 10.1002/jcp.26231.

Although many aspects of MYC-mediated tumour biology are well characterized, there are currently no effective means for targeting MYC in a specific manner that have been established for clinical use. This review first discusses the role of MYC in the pathogenesis of haematopoietic malignancies, and secondly summarizes how insight into MYC functions could be translated into therapeutic approaches.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of 50 AML patients who were prescribed levofloxacin and 50 AML patients who were not prescribed levofloxacin post-consolidation chemotherapy between June 2006 and August 2013 at a tertiary academic medical center. The primary outcome of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of levofloxacin in preventing hospital readmission due to febrile neutropenia. Secondary outcomes evaluated the safety of this therapy, including the rate of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) within 30 days from discharge of receiving consolidation chemotherapy and rate of fluoroquinolone resistance in positive bacterial cultures. RESULTS: Hospital readmission due to febrile neutropenia after the first consolidation cycle occurred in 42% of patients prescribed levofloxacin, as compared to 72% that were not prescribed levofloxacin (p = 0.002). This was also significantly reduced when levofloxacin was prescribed after all consolidation cycles (51.4 vs. 67%, p = 0.023). CDAD did not occur in any patient prescribed levofloxacin after the first cycle, compared to one case in those not prescribed levofloxacin. Evaluation of the impact on fluoroquinolone resistance was limited due to a paucity of fluoroquinolone susceptibilities reported. CONCLUSIONS: Prescribing oral levofloxacin post-consolidation chemotherapy in AML patients is associated with a reduction in febrile neutropenia. Further research is required to identify the impact on fluoroquinolone resistance and risk of CDAD.",,"['Lee, Samantha S F', 'Fulford, Adrienne E', 'Quinn, Maureen A', 'Seabrook, Jamie', 'Rajakumar, Irina']","['Lee SSF', 'Fulford AE', 'Quinn MA', 'Seabrook J', 'Rajakumar I']","[""Pharmacy Department, St. Michael's Hospital, 30 Bond St, Toronto, ON, M5B 1W8, Canada. leesam@smh.ca."", 'Department of Hematology, London Health Sciences Centre, 800 Commissioners Rd E, London, ON, N6A 5W9, Canada.', 'Department of Hematology, London Health Sciences Centre, 800 Commissioners Rd E, London, ON, N6A 5W9, Canada.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Western University, 1151 Richmond St, London, ON, N6A 3K7, Canada.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Alberta Health Services, Foothills Medical Centre, 1403 29 Street NW, Calgary, AB, T2N 2T9, Canada.']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],20171123,Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '6GNT3Y5LMF (Levofloxacin)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antibiotic Prophylaxis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Chemotherapy-Induced Febrile Neutropenia/*prevention & control', 'Clostridium Infections/drug therapy/prevention & control', 'Consolidation Chemotherapy', 'Female', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/drug therapy/microbiology', 'Levofloxacin/*therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,2017/11/25 06:00,2019/02/06 06:00,['2017/11/25 06:00'],"['2017/05/28 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/06 06:00 [medline]', '2017/11/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00520-017-3976-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s00520-017-3976-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2018 May;26(5):1499-1504. doi: 10.1007/s00520-017-3976-1.

Clinically, WT1 mutations are enriched in relapsed series and are associated to inferior relapse-free survival in thymic T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases. Here we demonstrate that WT1 plays a critical role in the response to DNA damage in T-cell leukemia. WT1 loss conferred resistance to DNA damaging agents and attenuated the transcriptional activation of important apoptotic regulators downstream of TP53 in TP53-competent MOLT4 T-leukemia cells but not in TP53-mutant T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines. Notably, WT1 loss positively affected the expression of the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein, XIAP, and genetic or chemical inhibition with embelin (a XIAP inhibitor) significantly restored sensitivity to gamma-radiation in both T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines and patient-derived xenografts.

He gave a history of recurrent oral ulcers. The panuveitis responded to oral and topical steroids but recurred after the steroids were stopped. His ocular condition again stabilised on restarting oral steroids and azathioprine. The second patient, a 28-year-old man, presented with bilateral anterior segment inflammation, vitritis, exudative retinal detachment and hypopyon in the right eye. He was also on imatinib with the CML being in remission. The uveitis and exudative retinal detachment improved on systemic and topical steroids.

In this study, 15 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia(ALL)and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and hyperleukocytosis were treated with the COBE Spectra apheresis system in the general paediatric ward by the staff from the department of Blood Transfusion. 26 LK procedures were performed. 12 patients (80%) were performed with peripheral veins, others (20%) with femoral veins. Median age, body weight of the patients was 4 years (range from1year 10 month to 7 years) and 15kg (range from10 to 20kg). The median white blood cell (WBC) count of pre-first-LK was 289x10(9)/L (range from 108x10(9)/L to 579x10(9)/L). The median decrease in WBC count after each LK was 34% (range from 14% to 54%), and overall decrease in WBC after completion of LK procedures was 45% (range from 15% to 70%). All of the patients had no further signs of leukostasis and achieved marked reductions in WBC counts. Only minor clinical adverse events were attributable to LK.

Methods Three pairs of shRNA fragment targeting human Alox5 gene were synthesized and inserted into pGenesil-1 interference vector. Enzyme digestion and sequencing were performed to identify the recombinant plasmid pGenesil-1-shRNA-Alox5. The plasmid was then transfected into K562/ADM cells. Real-time quantitative PCR and Western blotting were used to detect the Alox5 mRNA and protein levels to get the best interference group. The pGenesil-1-shRNA-Alox5 plasmid group with higher interference efficiency was selected as the experimental subjects. Real-time quantitative PCR was adopted to detect the expression level of bcr/abl mRNA and Western blotting to detect the BCR/ABL fusion protein, and the apoptotic rate was assessed by flow cytometry.

Methods The HL60 cells were treated with 5, 10, 15 mumol/L lapatinib for 24 hours, and then morphological changes of the cells were observed under optical microscope. CCK-8 assay was used to assess the cell viability. Colony formation assay was performed to detect the cell proliferation ability. Cell apoptosis labeled by annexinV-FITC/PI were analyzed by flow cytometry. Wright modified LIU's staining and Hoechst33342 fluorescent staining were used to observe the morphology of the nucleus. Western blotting was utilized to detect the expressions of Bax, Bcl2, caspase-3, caspase-9, cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-9, cleaved poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (cleaved PARP), cell proliferation regulating inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (CIP2A), c-MYC, AKT and p-AKT. Results Compared with the control group, lapatinib inhibited cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis, induced nuclear fragmentation, chromatin condensation of HL60 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Meanwhile, it down-regulated the expression of Bcl2, up-regulated the levels of Bax, cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-9 and cleaved PARP, and decreased the levels of CIP2A, p-AKT and c-MYC. Conclusion Lapatinib could inhibit cell proliferation and promote apoptosis in HL60 cells by inhibiting the CIP2A/AKT/c-MYC signal pathway.",,"['Liu, Lu', 'Liu, Beizhong', 'Zhao, Yi', 'Chen, Min', 'Yao, Shifei', 'Li, Lianwen', 'Xiao, Chunlan', 'Shan, Zhiling', 'Xu, Ting', 'Gan, Liugen', 'Zhong, Liang']","['Liu L', 'Liu B', 'Zhao Y', 'Chen M', 'Yao S', 'Li L', 'Xiao C', 'Shan Z', 'Xu T', 'Gan L', 'Zhong L']","['Central Laboratory, Yongchuan Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 402160; Ministry-of-Education Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics, Faculty of Laboratory Medical, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.', 'Central Laboratory, Yongchuan Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 402160; Ministry-of-Education Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics, Faculty of Laboratory Medical, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.', 'Central Laboratory, Yongchuan Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 402160, China.', 'Central Laboratory, Yongchuan Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 402160, China.', 'Central Laboratory, Yongchuan Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 402160, China.', 'Central Laboratory, Yongchuan Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 402160, China.', 'Central Laboratory, Yongchuan Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 402160, China.', 'Ministry-of-Education Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics, Faculty of Laboratory Medical, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.', 'Central Laboratory, Yongchuan Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 402160, China.', 'Central Laboratory, Yongchuan Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 402160, China.', 'Ministry-of-Education Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics, Faculty of Laboratory Medical, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China. *Corresponding author, E-mail: 530659075@qq.com.']",['chi'],,,['Journal Article'],,China,Xi Bao Yu Fen Zi Mian Yi Xue Za Zhi,Xi bao yu fen zi mian yi xue za zhi = Chinese journal of cellular and molecular immunology,101139110,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0VUA21238F (Lapatinib)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Lapatinib', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Quinazolines/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",,,2017/11/25 06:00,2018/05/16 06:00,['2017/11/25 06:00'],"['2017/11/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/11/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/16 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Xi Bao Yu Fen Zi Mian Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2017 Oct;33(10):1341-1347.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One mechanism for this interaction is at the level of the blood-brain barriers (BBBs). In this minireview, we examine the several ways the microbiome is known to interact with the CNS barriers. Bacteria can directly release factors into the systemic circulation or can translocate into blood. Once in the blood, the microbiome and its factors can alter peripheral immune cells to promote interactions with the BBB and ultimately with other elements of the neurovascular unit. Bacteria and their factors or cytokines and other immune-active substances released from peripheral sites under the influence of the microbiome can cross the BBB, alter BBB integrity, change BBB transport rates, or induce release of neuroimmune substances from the barrier cells. Metabolic products produced by the microbiome, such as short-chain fatty acids, can cross the BBB to affect brain function. Through these and other mechanisms, microbiome-BBB interactions can influence the course of diseases as illustrated by multiple sclerosis. Impact statement The connection between the gut microbiome and central nervous system (CNS) disease is not fully understood. Host immune systems are influenced by changes to the microbiota and offers new treatment strategies for CNS disease. Preclinical studies provide evidence of changes to the blood-brain barrier when animals are subject to experimental gut infection or when the animals lack a normal gut microbiome. The intestine also contains a barrier, and bacterial factors can translocate to the blood and interact with host immune cells. These metastatic bacterial factors can signal T-cells to become more CNS penetrant, thus providing a novel intervention for treating CNS disease. Studies in humans show the therapeutic effects of T-cell engineering for the treatment of leukemia, so perhaps a similar approach for CNS disease could prove effective. Future research should begin to define the bacterial species that can cause immune cells to differentiate and how these interactions vary amongst CNS disease models.",,"['Logsdon, Aric F', 'Erickson, Michelle A', 'Rhea, Elizabeth M', 'Salameh, Therese S', 'Banks, William A']","['Logsdon AF', 'Erickson MA', 'Rhea EM', 'Salameh TS', 'Banks WA']","['1 Division of Gerontology and Geriatric Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA 98159, USA.', '2 Geriatrics Research Education and Clinical Center, Veterans Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System, Seattle, WA 98108, USA.', '1 Division of Gerontology and Geriatric Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA 98159, USA.', '2 Geriatrics Research Education and Clinical Center, Veterans Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System, Seattle, WA 98108, USA.', '1 Division of Gerontology and Geriatric Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA 98159, USA.', '2 Geriatrics Research Education and Clinical Center, Veterans Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System, Seattle, WA 98108, USA.', '1 Division of Gerontology and Geriatric Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA 98159, USA.', '2 Geriatrics Research Education and Clinical Center, Veterans Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System, Seattle, WA 98108, USA.', '1 Division of Gerontology and Geriatric Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA 98159, USA.', '2 Geriatrics Research Education and Clinical Center, Veterans Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System, Seattle, WA 98108, USA.']",['eng'],,"['P30 DK017047/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AG052354/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AG046619/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 NS093368/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",20171123,England,Exp Biol Med (Maywood),"Experimental biology and medicine (Maywood, N.J.)",100973463,['0 (Biological Products)'],IM,,"['Animals', 'Bacteria/metabolism', 'Bacterial Translocation', 'Biological Products/metabolism', '*Blood-Brain Barrier', 'Central Nervous System/*drug effects/pathology/physiology', '*Gastrointestinal Microbiome', 'Gastrointestinal Tract/*microbiology', 'Humans']",PMC5788145,,2017/11/25 06:00,2018/09/05 06:00,['2017/11/25 06:00'],"['2017/11/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/05 06:00 [medline]', '2017/11/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1535370217743766 [doi]'],ppublish,Exp Biol Med (Maywood). 2018 Jan;243(2):159-165. doi: 10.1177/1535370217743766.

However, in vivo roles for Fer during vertebrate development have remained elusive. In this study, we bridge the gap between the invertebrate and vertebrate realms by showing that Fer kinase is required during zebrafish embryogenesis for normal hematopoiesis and vascular organization with distinct kinase dependent and independent functions. In situ hybridization, quantitative PCR and fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) analyses revealed an increase in both erythrocyte numbers and gene expression patterns as well as a decrease in the organization of vasculature endothelial cells. Furthermore, rescue experiments have shown that the regulation of hematopoietic proliferation is dependent on Fer kinase activity, while vascular organizing events only require Fer in a kinase-independent manner. Our data suggest a model in which separate kinase dependent and independent functions of Fer act in conjunction with Notch activity in a divergent manner for hematopoietic determination and vascular tissue organization.",,"['Dunn, Emily M', 'Billquist, Elizabeth J', 'VanderStoep, Amy L', 'Bax, Phillip G', 'Westrate, Laura M', 'McLellan, Lisa K', 'Peterson, Shelby C', 'MacKeigan, Jeffrey P', 'Putzke, Aaron P']","['Dunn EM', 'Billquist EJ', 'VanderStoep AL', 'Bax PG', 'Westrate LM', 'McLellan LK', 'Peterson SC', 'MacKeigan JP', 'Putzke AP']","['Department of Biology, 300 W.

Tax localizes in the nucleus and cytoplasm in association with organelles. Some activities of Tax depend on interactions with PDZ (PSD-95/Discs Large/Z0-1) domain-containing proteins such as Discs large protein 1 (DLG1) which is involved in cell polarity and proliferation. The DLG1 interaction results in a cytoplasmic co-localization pattern resembling vesicular aggregates, the nature of which is still unknown. To further explore the role of PDZ proteins in HTLV-1 cell transformation, we deeply investigated the Tax-DLG1 association. By fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), we detected, for the first time, the direct binding of Tax to DLG1 within the cell. We showed that the interaction specifically affects the cellular distribution of not only DLG1, but also Tax. After studying different cell structures, we demonstrated that the aggregates distribute into the Golgi apparatus in spatial association with the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC).

It is an important regulator of organellar functions, intracellular molecular trafficking, intercellular communication and intracellular signaling. It is therefore considered as a possible therapeutic target in the treatment of human malignancies. Areas covered: Relevant publications were identified through literature searches in the PubMed database. We searched for original articles and reviews describing the possible importance of V-ATPase for leukemogenesis and chemosensitivity in human myeloid cells, especially acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. Expert commentary: The expression of V-ATPase in the primary human AML cells varies between patients, and high levels are associated with high constitutive release of a wide range of soluble mediators. Several of the molecules included in the V-ATPase interactome may also be important in leukemogenesis and/or development of chemoresistance in human AML. Therapeutic targeting of V-ATPase should therefore be regarded as a possible therapeutic strategy in human AML, but the efficiency of such targeting will probably differ between patients.

Silent hypersensitivity reactions to this microbial enzyme need to be monitored accurately during treatment to avoid adverse effects of the drug and its silent inactivation. Here, we present a dual-response anti-asparaginase sensor that combines indirect SPR and fluorescence on a single chip to perform ELISA-type immunosensing, and correlate measurements with classical ELISA.

This prospective single-center study included 20 patients with iNHL of renal significance (tubulointerstitial presentation [n = 8], glomerulopathy with or without monoclonal Ig deposits [n = 12]) who received a steroid-sparing regimen of rituximab plus bendamustine (BR), with either no or <1 month of steroid intake (as a first line therapy in 80%). Seventeen patients (85%) achieved a complete (CHR, n = 12) or a partial (PHR, n = 5) hematological response. Nine out of the 12 patients (75%) with iNHL-related glomerulopathy had a complete (CRR) or a partial (PRR) renal response. Among the six patients with glomerulopathy and CHR, five had a CRR (83%) compared to 1/6 (17%) that did not reach CHR. eGFR increased from 38 to 58 mL/min/1.73 m(2) , and returned to baseline in five patients. Among the eight patients with a tubulointerstitial presentation, six (75%) had a renal response (5 CRR), and eGFR increased from 29 to 48 mL/min/1.73 m(2) . One patient with a PHR had a renal relapse. Mortality rate was 10% at 12 months. The BR regimen was well tolerated overall. Thus, despite severe renal disease at presentation, a relapsing iNHL in 20% of patients and several comorbidities, the BR regimen was efficient and safe in our series.

METHOD: This single-center study retrospectively investigated the individual comorbidities of the HCT-CI on the outcome of 418 patients that underwent HCT for AML, in CR1 (n = 303, 72%) or CR2 (n = 115, 28%) at our center between 1999 and 2014. RESULTS: Median age at HCT was 50 years (range 18-71). Univariate analysis of the HCT-CI, grouped as score 0 (n = 109), 1-2 (n = 157) and >/=3 (n = 152), demonstrated significant influence on overall survival (OS) (P = .004) and non-relapse mortality (NRM) (P = .02). For individual comorbidities constituting the HCT-CI, variables with a P-value </= .2 on univariate analysis were included in the multivariable analysis. For OS, none of the comorbidities of the HCT-CI demonstrated independent prognostic relevance. However, for NRM, multivariable analysis demonstrated pretransplant diabetes (HR = 2.17, 95% CI = 1.31-3.60, P = .003) and cardiovascular comorbidity (HR = 1.78, 95% CI = 1.15-2.76, P = .01) to be independent predictors of NRM post-transplant. CONCLUSION: Among the comorbidities that compose the HCT-CI, diabetes and cardiovascular comorbidity independently predict NRM in patients undergoing allogeneic HCT for AML.

BCT-100, a pegylated (PEG) recombinant human arginase, can deplete arginine and starve malignant cells of the amino acid. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common cancer of childhood, yet for patients with high risk or relapsed disease prognosis remains poor. We show that BCT-100 is cytotoxic to ALL blasts from patients in vitro by necrosis, and is synergistic in combination with dexamethasone. Against ALL xenografts, BCT-100 leads to a reduction in ALL engraftment and a prolongation of survival. ALL blasts express the arginine transporter CAT-1, yet the majority of blasts are arginine auxotrophic due to deficiency in either argininosuccinate synthase (ASS) or ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC). Although endogenous upregulation or retroviral transduced increases in ASS or OTC may promote ALL survival under moderately low arginine conditions, expression of these enzymes cannot prevent BCT-100 cytotoxicity at arginine depleting doses. RNA-sequencing of ALL blasts and supporting stromal cells treated with BCT-100 identifies a number of candidate pathways which are altered in the presence of arginine depletion. Therefore, BCT-100 provides a new clinically relevant therapeutic approach to target arginine metabolism in ALL.","['(c) 2017 The Authors International Journal of Cancer published by John Wiley &', 'Sons Ltd on behalf of UICC.']","['De Santo, Carmela', 'Booth, Sarah', 'Vardon, Ashley', 'Cousins, Antony', 'Tubb, Vanessa', 'Perry, Tracey', 'Noyvert, Boris', 'Beggs, Andrew', 'Ng, Margaret', 'Halsey, Christina', 'Kearns, Pamela', 'Cheng, Paul', 'Mussai, Francis']","['De Santo C', 'Booth S', 'Vardon A', 'Cousins A', 'Tubb V', 'Perry T', 'Noyvert B', 'Beggs A', 'Ng M', 'Halsey C', 'Kearns P', 'Cheng P', 'Mussai F']","['Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Cancer Sciences, Wolfson Wohl Cancer Research Centre, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Anatomic Pathology, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong.', 'Institute of Cancer Sciences, Wolfson Wohl Cancer Research Centre, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Bio-Cancer Treatment International Ltd, Hong Kong.', 'Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],,"['ETM/374/CSO_/Chief Scientist Office/United Kingdom', 'MR/M009157/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'C596/A18076/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'C596/A17196/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171226,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BCT-100)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)', 'EC 3.5.3.1 (ARG1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.3.1 (Arginase)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Arginase/*pharmacology', 'Arginine/*metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Metabolome/*drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC5849425,,2017/11/24 06:00,2018/10/30 06:00,['2017/11/24 06:00'],"['2017/04/25 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/11 00:00 [revised]', '2017/11/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/30 06:00 [medline]', '2017/11/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.31170 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2018 Apr 1;142(7):1490-1502. doi: 10.1002/ijc.31170.

We examined comparative effectiveness of B and C regimens in real-world community settings. METHODS: This retrospective study examined progression-free survival (PFS) and OS in a US community sample of KRAS WT mCRC patients treated with first-line B (n = 254) or C (n = 146) regimens. Medical records from the Vector Oncology Data Warehouse were used. Disease progression was determined from patient charts. OS was measured from the start of first-line treatment until death. RESULTS: There were no significant difference in either PFS or OS respectively between B-treated compared to C-treated patients (HR = 1.324, 95% CI 0.901, 1.947; HR = 1.080, 95% CI 0.721, 1.617). More B patients received oxaliplatin backbones (74.8 vs. 36.3%), and more C patients received irinotecan backbones (51.4 vs. 20.1%), ps < 0.001.

The current study investigated the pharmacokinetics (PK) of this liposomal formulation. METHODS: CPX-351 PK data (cytarabine, daunorubicin, and metabolites) from a phase I study of relapsed and refractory AML were used for the analysis. Therapy was given days 1, 3, and 5 of induction (3-134 units/m(2)). We developed a population PK model to characterize CPX-351 disposition. RESULTS: 39 patients (3589 samples) were evaluated. Liposomal cytarabine and daunorubicin were modeled separately with their respective metabolites. A one-compartment model fit the parent compounds well; the metabolites required two-compartment models. Weight was an independent predictor of liposomal volumes; mild renal and liver dysfunction were not predictors of clearance or volume (maximum creatinine 1.6 mg/dL and total bilirubin 1.8 mg/dL). Liposomal clearances of the two drugs were highly correlated and 1000-fold smaller than published non-encapsulated values supporting prolonged encapsulation in the liposome. CONCLUSIONS: The PK model demonstrates prolonged exposure to cytarabine and daunorubicin without increases in non-hematologic toxicity that indicates retention of the drugs within the liposome. The unique pharmacology of this formulation may allow for simplified regimens and improved outcomes.",,"['Nikanjam, Mina', 'Capparelli, Edmund V', 'Lancet, Jeffrey E', 'Louie, Arthur', 'Schiller, Gary']","['Nikanjam M', 'Capparelli EV', 'Lancet JE', 'Louie A', 'Schiller G']","['Division of Host-Microbe Systems and Therapeutics, University of California San Diego, 9500 Gilman Drive MC 0657, La Jolla, San Diego, CA, 92093-0657, USA. mnikanjam@ucsd.edu.', 'Division of Host-Microbe Systems and Therapeutics, University of California San Diego, 9500 Gilman Drive MC 0657, La Jolla, San Diego, CA, 92093-0657, USA.', 'H.

Nevertheless, the development of a graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) after transplantation is a high risk and a severe complication with high morbidity and mortality causing therapeutic challenges. Current pharmacological therapies of GvHD lead to generalized immunosuppression followed by severe adverse side effects including infections and relapse of leukemia. Several novel cell-based immunomodulatory strategies for treatment or prevention of GvHD have been developed. Herein, thymus-derived regulatory T cells (tTreg), essential for the maintenance of peripheral immunologic tolerance, are in the focus of investigation. However, due to the limited number of tTreg in the peripheral blood, a complex, time- and cost-intensive in vitro expansion protocol is necessary for the production of an efficient cellular therapeutic. We demonstrated that activation of tTreg using the CD4-binding human immunodeficiency virus-1 protein gp120 leads to a substantially increased suppressor activity of tTreg without the need for additional expansion. Gp120-activated tTreg prevent GvHD development in a preclinical humanized mouse model. In addition, gp120 is not only effective in prevention but also in therapy of GvHD by suppressing all clinical symptoms and improving survival of treated mice. These data indicate that tTreg activation by gp120 is a feasible and potent strategy for significant functional improvement of tTreg as cellular therapeutic for GvHD treatment without the need of complicated, time-intensive, and expensive in vitro expansion of isolated tTreg.",,"['Schloder, Janine', 'Berges, Carsten', 'Tuettenberg, Andrea', 'Jonuleit, Helmut']","['Schloder J', 'Berges C', 'Tuettenberg A', 'Jonuleit H']","['Department of Dermatology, University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg-University, Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology, University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg-University, Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology, University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg-University, Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology, University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg-University, Mainz, Germany.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20171108,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,,,,,PMC5682297,,2017/11/24 06:00,2017/11/24 06:01,['2017/11/24 06:00'],"['2017/09/15 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/11/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/24 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2017.01495 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2017 Nov 8;8:1495. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2017.01495. eCollection 2017.,,['NOTNLM'],"['CD4 stimulation', 'cellular therapy', 'graft-versus-host disease', 'regulatory T cell', 'tolerance']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pim-3 is a member of the provirus integration site for a moloney murine leukemia virus family of proteins that contributes to cell proliferation, survival, and chemotherapy resistance. Therefore, the relationship between Pim-3 expression and response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in rectal cancer patients is important to evaluate. 175 rectal cancer patients who underwent neoadjuvant treatment enrolled in this study. The relationship between Pim-3 expression on immunohistochemical analysis of rectal cancer tissue, which was obtained before treatment, the response to chemoradiotherapy and survival was investigated. The patients with no Pim-3 expression were more likely to achieve a pathologic complete response to chemoradiotherapy than patients with Pim-3 expression (P = 0.001). Cox multivariate analysis showed that the significant prognostic factors were Pim-3 expression (P = 0.003) and the number of neoadjuvant chemotherapy cycles (P = 0.005) for overall survival. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy cycles (P = 0.007), adjuvant chemotherapy cycles (P = 0.004) and pathology types (P = 0.049) were significant prognostic factors for disease-free survival.

Growing evidence supports a role for infection in the etiology of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), and the involvement of the immune system suggests that vaccination may also play a role. However, the findings presented in the published literature are inconsistent. Therefore, we conducted a PRISMA systematic review and meta-analysis. 14 studies were identified and meta-analyzed. Vaccinations studied comprised Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine, Triple vaccine, Hepatitis B vaccine (HBV), Polio, Measles, Rubella, Mumps, trivalent MMR vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (HiB) vaccine. We observed a protective association between any vaccination in the first year of life and risk of childhood leukemia (summary odds ratio (OR) 0.58 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36-0.91]). When individual vaccines were analysed, some evidence of an association was seen only for BCG (summary OR 0.73 [95% CI 0.50-1.08]). In conclusion, early vaccination appears to be associated with a reduced risk of childhood leukemia. This finding may be underpinned by the association observed for BCG.

Despite its essential function, CHK1 has been identified as a target to kill cancer cells and studies using Chk1 haploinsufficient mice initially suggested a role as tumor suppressor. Here, we report on the key role of CHK1 in normal B-cell development, lymphomagenesis and cell survival. Chemical CHK1 inhibition induces BCL2-regulated apoptosis in primary as well as malignant B-cells and CHK1 expression levels control the timing of lymphomagenesis in mice. Moreover, total ablation of Chk1 in B-cells arrests their development at the pro-B cell stage, a block that, surprisingly, cannot be overcome by inhibition of mitochondrial apoptosis, as cell cycle arrest is initiated as an alternative fate to limit the spread of damaged DNA.

CARs are synthetic constructs that, when introduced into mature T cells, confer a second, non-major histocompatibility complex-restricted specificity in addition to the endogenous T cell receptor (TCR). The implications of TCR activation on CAR T cell efficacy has not been well defined. Using an immunocompetent, syngeneic murine model of CD19-targeted CAR T cell therapy for pre-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia in which the CAR is introduced into T cells with known TCR specificity, we demonstrate loss of CD8 CAR T cell efficacy associated with T cell exhaustion and apoptosis when TCR antigen is present. CD4 CAR T cells demonstrate equivalent cytotoxicity to CD8 CAR T cells and, in contrast, retain in vivo efficacy despite TCR stimulation. Gene expression profiles confirm increased exhaustion and apoptosis of CD8 CAR T cells upon dual receptor stimulation compared to CD4 CAR T cells and indicate inherent differences between CD4 and CD8 CAR T cells in the use of T cell-associated signaling pathways. These results provide insights into important aspects of CAR T cell immune biology and indicate opportunities to rationally design CAR constructs to optimize clinical efficacy.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American', 'Association for the Advancement of Science.

We present a case of acute respiratory distress syndrome in a patient with stable chronic lymphatic leukemia not requiring treatment, in whom we diagnosed herpes simplex virus type 1 bronchopneumonitis based on herpes simplex virus type 1 detection in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and clinical response to antiviral treatment. CASE PRESENTATION: A 72-year-old white man presented with symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection. His medical history was significant for chronic lymphatic leukemia, which had been stable without treatment, arterial hypertension, multiple squamous cell carcinomas of the scalp, and alcohol overuse. Community-acquired pneumonia was suspected and appropriate broad-spectrum antibacterial treatment was initiated. Within a few hours, rapid respiratory deterioration led to cardiac arrest. He was successfully resuscitated, but developed acute respiratory distress syndrome. Furthermore, he remained febrile and inflammation markers remained elevated despite antibacterial treatment. Polymerase chain reaction from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and viral culture from tracheobronchial secretions tested positive for herpes simplex virus type 1. We initiated antiviral treatment with acyclovir. Concomitantly we further escalated the antibacterial treatment, although no bacterial pathogen had been isolated at any point. Defervescence occurred rapidly and his C-reactive protein and leukocyte levels decreased. He was successfully weaned from mechanical ventilation, transferred to the ward, and eventually discharged to home.

We have demonstrated that inhibiting MCL-1 is efficacious in suppressing tumour progression in pre-clinical models of breast cancer and revealed that in addition to its role in cell survival, MCL-1 modulated cellular invasion. Utilizing a MCL-1-specific genetic antagonist, we found two possible mechanisms; firstly MCL-1 directly binds to and alters the phosphorylation of the cytoskeletal remodeling protein, Cofilin, a protein important for cytoskeletal remodeling during invasion, and secondly MCL-1 modulates the levels SRC family kinases (SFKs) and their targets. These data provide evidence that MCL-1 activities are not limited to endpoints of extracellular and intracellular signaling culminating in cell survival as previously thought, but can directly modulate the output of SRC family kinases signaling during cellular invasion.

Results: Case 1 was a male patient of 44 years old, whose PLT was 500x10(9)/L when firstly diagnosed ET. After 3 years the disease progressed into myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) while WT1 expression increased from 77 (first visit) to 13 171 copies/10 000 ABL copies, at the same time chromosome changed dramatically.

Methods: The expression level of miRNA-181a in bone marrow mononuclear cells of 120 de novo AML patients with normal karyotype was detected by real time fluorescence quantitative PCR. The direct sequencing method was used to detect IDH1, IDH2, NPM1, FLT3-ITD, DNMT3A and CEBPalpha mutations in CN-AML patients after PCR. The relationship between miRNA-181a expression and gene mutation, the clinical parameters and prognosis were analyzed. Results: The rates of overall surviva1 (OS) in high expression and low expression groups were 25.0 months and 15.0 months, respectively (P<0.05) .

Here, we identified robust expression of the leukemia-associated transcription factor hepatic leukemia factor (Hlf) in normal multipotent hematopoietic progenitors, which was rapidly downregulated upon differentiation. Interference with its normal downregulation revealed Hlf as a strong negative regulator of lymphoid development, while remaining compatible with myeloid fates. Reciprocally, we observed rapid lymphoid commitment upon reduced Hlf activity. The arising phenotypes resulted from Hlf binding to active enhancers of myeloid-competent cells, transcriptional induction of myeloid, and ablation of lymphoid gene programs, with Hlf induction of nuclear factor I C (Nfic) as a functionally relevant target gene. Thereby, our studies establish Hlf as a key regulator of the earliest lineage-commitment events at the transition from multipotency to lineage-restricted progeny, with implications for both normal and malignant hematopoiesis.",['Copyright (c) 2017 The Author(s).

OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinicopathological features, relative frequency and survival among patients from a Peruvian institution. METHODS: Primary cutaneous T-cell lymphomas were defined based on the absence of extracutaneous disease at diagnosis. Classification was performed following the 2008 World Health Organization Classification of Neoplasms of the Hematopoietic and Lymphoid tissues. Risk groups were established according to the 2005 World Health Organization-EORTC classification for cutaneous lymphomas. Data of patients admitted between January 2008 and December 2012 were analyzed. RESULTS: 74 patients were included. Mean age was 49.5 years. In order of frequency, diagnoses were: mycosis fungoides (40.5%), peripheral T-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified (22.95%), adult T-cell lymphoma/leukemia (18.9%), CD30+ lymphoproliferative disorders (6.8%), hydroa vacciniforme-like lymphoma (5.4%), extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma (4.1%) and Sezary syndrome (1.4%). Predominant clinical patterns were observed across different entities. Mycosis fungoides appeared mainly as plaques (93%). Peripheral T-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified and adult T-cell lymphoma/leukemia presentation was polymorphic. All patients with hydroa vacciniforme-like lymphoma presented with facial edema. All cases of extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma appeared as ulcerated nodules/tumors. Disseminated cutaneous involvement was found in 71.6% cases. Forty-six percent of patients were alive at 5 years. Five-year overall survival was 76.4% and 19.2%, for indolent and high-risk lymphomas, respectively (p<0.05). High risk group (HR: 4.6 [2.08-10.18]) and increased DHL level (HR: 3.2 [1.57-6.46]) emerged as prognostic factors for survival. STUDY LIMITATIONS: Small series.

Although ponatinib, a third-generation TKI, improves outcomes for patients with BCR-ABL-dependent mechanisms of resistance, including the T315I mutation, a proportion of patients may have or develop BCR-ABL-independent resistance and fail ponatinib treatment. By modeling ponatinib resistance and testing samples from these CML patients, it is hoped that an alternative drug target can be identified and inhibited with a novel compound. Methods: Two CML cell lines with acquired BCR-ABL-independent resistance were generated following culture in ponatinib. RNA sequencing and gene ontology (GO) enrichment were used to detect aberrant transcriptional response in ponatinib-resistant cells. A validated oncogene drug library was used to identify US Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs with activity against TKI-resistant cells. Validation was performed using bone marrow (BM)-derived cells from TKI-resistant patients (n = 4) and a human xenograft mouse model (n = 4-6 mice per group). All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: We show that ponatinib-resistant CML cells can acquire BCR-ABL-independent resistance mediated through alternative activation of mTOR. Following transcriptomic analysis and drug screening, we highlight mTOR inhibition as an alternative therapeutic approach in TKI-resistant CML cells. Additionally, we show that catalytic mTOR inhibitors induce autophagy and demonstrate that genetic or pharmacological inhibition of autophagy sensitizes ponatinib-resistant CML cells to death induced by mTOR inhibition in vitro (% number of colonies of control[SD], NVP-BEZ235 vs NVP-BEZ235+HCQ: 45.0[17.9]% vs 24.0[8.4]%, P = .002) and in vivo (median survival of NVP-BEZ235- vs NVP-BEZ235+HCQ-treated mice: 38.5 days vs 47.0 days, P = .04). Conclusion: Combined mTOR and autophagy inhibition may provide an attractive approach to target BCR-ABL-independent mechanism of resistance.",,"['Mitchell, Rebecca', 'Hopcroft, Lisa E M', 'Baquero,

It has been suggested that patients with CLL from Africa might have a more aggressive disease compared with white patients. In this study, we aimed to identify genetic factors that may account for this difference. Methods: We analyzed immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) genes' mutational status by performing next-generation sequencing in 25 Senegalese and 50 Italian patients with CLL. Results: We found that Senegalese patients more frequently had adverse prognostic factors and an unmutated profile. Furthermore, we documented that IGHV1 (IGHV1-69), IGHD3, and IGHJ6 were significantly more frequent in Senegalese patients, whereas IGHV3-30 was common and limited to the Italian cohort. Stereotyped receptors commonly detected in the white population were not recorded in our Senegalese series. Conclusions: The different IGH repertoire we observed in the Senegalese cohort may reflect the diverse genetic and microenvironmental (ie, polymicrobial stimulation) background.","['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2017.

However, VDR activation leads to the expression of CYP24A1, a hydroxylase that can inactivate vitamin D3 metabolites. To examine immunoreactivity to VDR and CYP24A1 in mast cells from normal human skin, keratinocyte skin cancers, and disorders of chronic inflammation. Frozen biopsies were collected from the non-lesional and lesional skin of patients with actinic keratosis (AK), Bowen's disease/squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), basal cell carcinoma (BCC), and psoriasis. The expression of VDR and CYP24A1 in tryptase-positive mast cells was analysed using double-staining methods. Less than 0.5% of the mast cells were immunoreactive to VDR in both the non-lesional and lesional skin for all disease groups. In non-lesional skin, only 0.5-2.9% of the mast cells were immunopositive for CYP24A1, however, the percentage of mast cells containing CYP24A1 was significantly increased in lesional skin of AK, SCC, and BCC. In contrast to human skin, LAD2 mast cells cultured from a patient with mast cell sarcoma/leukaemia revealed that about 34% and 6.5% of the cells were immunopositive for VDR and CYP24A1, respectively. Whereas a very small proportion of mast cells in human skin express VDR and CYP24A1, the proportion of mast cells expressing CYP24A1 in keratinocyte skin cancers is increased; the mechanism underlying this is unclear.",,"['Kaukinen, Antti', 'Siiskonen, Hanna', 'Pelkonen, Jukka', 'Harvima, Ilkka T']","['Kaukinen A', 'Siiskonen H', 'Pelkonen J', 'Harvima IT']","['Department of Dermatology, University of Eastern Finland and Kuopio University Hospital, 70210 Kuopio, Finland.', 'Department of Dermatology, University of Eastern Finland and Kuopio University Hospital, 70210 Kuopio, Finland.', 'Department of Clinical Microbiology, University of Eastern Finland, 70210 Kuopio, Finland.', 'Department of Dermatology, University of Eastern Finland and Kuopio University Hospital, 70210 Kuopio, Finland.']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],,France,Eur J Dermatol,European journal of dermatology : EJD,9206420,"['0 (Dihydroxycholecalciferols)', '0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', 'EC 1.14.15.16 (CYP24A1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.15.16 (Vitamin D3 24-Hydroxylase)', 'EC 3.4.21.59 (Tryptases)', 'P6YZ13C99Q (Calcifediol)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', ""Bowen's Disease/immunology/pathology"", 'Calcifediol/immunology', 'Carcinoma, Basal Cell/immunology/pathology', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/immunology/pathology', 'Dihydroxycholecalciferols/immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Keratinocytes/*immunology', 'Male', 'Mast Cells/drug effects/*immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Psoriasis/immunology/pathology', 'Receptors, Calcitriol/analysis/*immunology', 'Skin/chemistry/cytology/immunology', 'Skin Neoplasms/*immunology/pathology', 'Tryptases/analysis', 'Vitamin D3 24-Hydroxylase/analysis/*immunology']",,,2017/11/23 06:00,2018/08/17 06:00,['2017/11/23 06:00'],"['2017/11/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/17 06:00 [medline]', '2017/11/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['ejd.2017.3132 [pii]', '10.1684/ejd.2017.3132 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Dermatol. 2017 Dec 1;27(6):590-598. doi: 10.1684/ejd.2017.3132.,,['NOTNLM'],"['cancer', 'mast cell', 'psoriasis', 'skin', 'vitamin D']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the absence of a concomitant DNMT3A mutation, there was no significant difference in overall survival between FLT3-ITD positive and FLT3-ITD negative patients.

However, to reach this goal, several hurdles have to be overcome, in particular: (i) the apparent lack of suitable targets as effective as CD19; (ii) the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment; (iii) intra-tumoral heterogeneity and antigen-negative relapses.

Its role in inhibiting tumor growth, however, remains elusive. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of SAA on acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here, SAA showed a dose-dependent cell viability inhibition and apoptosis induction in AML cells. At the molecular level, SAA increased the expression of Bak and decreased the expression of Bcl-xL, following by PARP cleavage and caspase-3 activation.

FLT3-ITD is a negative prognostic factor that remains prognostically relevant even after intensive chemotherapy and/or stem cell transplant. FLT3 testing was historically viewed as being purely prognostic; however, with the advent of FLT3 inhibitors, it will likely be seen as both prognostic and predictive. The multikinase inhibitor midostaurin, in combination with chemotherapy, is the first targeted agent to significantly prolong survival in patients with newly diagnosed FLT3-mutated AML and was recently approved by health authorities. Recently, the European LeukemiaNet recommended FLT3 testing (both TKD and ITD) for all patients with AML, with results required within 3 days.

Survival was longer with type 1/like CALR, compared to JAK2 (HR 2.6, 95% CI 1.9-3.5), type 2/like CALR (HR 2.5, 95% CI 1.4-4.5), MPL (HR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-2.9) and triple-negative mutational status (HR 2.4, 95% CI 1.6-3.6), but otherwise similar between the non-type 1/like CALR mutational states (P = .41). In multivariable analysis, the absence of type 1/like CALR (P < .001; HR 2, 95% CI 1.4-2.7), presence of ASXL1/SRSF2 mutations (P < .001; HR 1.9, 95% CI 1.5-2.4) and DIPSS-plus (P < .001) were each predictive of inferior survival. Furthermore, among 210 patients with ASXL1/SRSF2 mutations, survival was significantly longer in the presence vs. absence of type 1/like CALR mutations (median 5.8 vs. 2.9 years; P < .001). Triple-negative status did not disclose additional prognostic information for overall or leukemia-free survival. The observations regarding the prognostic distinction between CALR mutation variants were validated in an external cohort of 386 patients from the University of Florence Careggi hospital. We conclude that type 1/like CALR mutations in PMF not only predict superior survival, but also partially amend the detrimental effect of high molecular risk mutations.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Tefferi, Ayalew', 'Nicolosi, Maura', 'Mudireddy, Mythri', 'Szuber, Natasha', 'Finke, Christy M', 'Lasho, Terra L', 'Hanson, Curtis A', 'Ketterling, Rhett P', 'Pardanani, Animesh', 'Gangat, Naseema', 'Mannarelli, Carmela', 'Fanelli, Tiziana', 'Guglielmelli, Paola', 'Vannucchi, Alessandro M']","['Tefferi A', 'Nicolosi M', 'Mudireddy M', 'Szuber N', 'Finke CM', 'Lasho TL', 'Hanson CA', 'Ketterling RP', 'Pardanani A', 'Gangat N', 'Mannarelli C', 'Fanelli T', 'Guglielmelli P', 'Vannucchi AM']","['Divisions of Hematology, Departments of Medicine and Laboratory Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Divisions of Hematology, Departments of Medicine and Laboratory Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Divisions of Hematology, Departments of Medicine and Laboratory Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Divisions of Hematology, Departments of Medicine and Laboratory Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Divisions of Hematology, Departments of Medicine and Laboratory Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Divisions of Hematology, Departments of Medicine and Laboratory Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Divisions of Hematopathology, Departments of Medicine and Laboratory Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Divisions of Cytogenetics, Departments of Medicine and Laboratory Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Divisions of Hematology, Departments of Medicine and Laboratory Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Divisions of Hematology, Departments of Medicine and Laboratory Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, CRIMM, Center Research and Innovation of Myeloproliferative Neoplasms, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Careggi, University of Florence, Florence, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, CRIMM, Center Research and Innovation of Myeloproliferative Neoplasms, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Careggi, University of Florence, Florence, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, CRIMM, Center Research and Innovation of Myeloproliferative Neoplasms, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Careggi, University of Florence, Florence, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, CRIMM, Center Research and Innovation of Myeloproliferative Neoplasms, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Careggi, University of Florence, Florence, Italy.']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],20171218,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (ASXL1 protein, human)', '0 (CALR protein, human)', '0 (Calreticulin)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '143641-95-6 (MPL protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Calreticulin/*genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Phenotype', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics', 'Young Adult']",,,2017/11/23 06:00,2019/04/26 06:00,['2017/11/23 06:00'],"['2017/11/14 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/26 06:00 [medline]', '2017/11/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.24978 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2018 Mar;93(3):348-355. doi: 10.1002/ajh.24978.

The Retraction has been agreed as this paper was submitted under the joint names of Yan Wang, Jatinder K. Lamba and a third co-author. After acceptance of the paper, Dr Wang wrote to the EiC asking for the name of the third co-author to be dropped because of insufficient contribution. The EiC asked that the request be signed by all three authors. When this arrived, the paper was published online with only Dr Wang and Dr Lamba. However, Dr Lamba wrote to the EiC after publication indicating that she had not previously seen the manuscript and that there were co-authors missing. As it is clear that Dr Lamba's signature was forged, we cannot rely on the integrity of the report. The retraction is with the agreement of Dr Lamba but not of Dr Wang. REFERENCE 1. Wang Y, Lamba JK.

Currently, a cut-off of 2% deviation or 98% sequence identity to germline in IGHV sequence is routinely used to dichotomize CLL patients into mutated and unmutated groups. Because dissimilar IGHV% cut-offs of 1-5% were identified in different studies, we wondered whether no cut-off should be applied and IGHV% treated as a continuous variable. We analysed the significance of IGHV% in 203 CLL patients enrolled on the original frontline fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab (FCR) trial with a median of 10 years follow-up. Using the Cox Proportional Hazard model, IGHV% was identified as a continuous variable that is significantly associated with progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) (P < 0.001). Furthermore, we validated this finding in 323 patients treated with FCR off-protocol and in the total cohort (n = 535). Multivariate analysis revealed a continuous trend. Higher IGHV% levels were incrementally associated with favorable PFS and OS in both FCR-treated cohorts (P < 0.001, both cohorts).

Two recent studies suggested that miR-564 plays a role in tumor inhibition in both lung and breast cancer. However, no evidence reported the mechanism and function of miR-564 in prostate cancer (PCa). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The PCa tissues and their adjacent normal tissues were collected from 50 PCa patients. Expressions of miR-564 in tissues and cells were evaluated with RT-qPCR. The MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide] assay, fl ow cytometry and Western-blot analysis, were applied to detect the proliferation, cell cycle progression and the protein expression of PCa cell lines (PC-3 and DU-145). Migration and invasion of PCa cells were analyzed by Transwell assays. Furthermore, the correlation between miR-564 and MLLT3 was assessed by luciferase reporter assay. Also, the PCa cells were transfected with miR-564 mimics control and inhibitor. RESULTS: In our present research, miR-564 was found dysregulated in PCa cells and to act as a suppressor in PCa cell proliferation, progression of cell cycle, cell invasion and migration. MLLT3 (also known as Af9) is a proto-oncogene, which has first reported in leukemia, and the regulation of its expression remains incompletely elucidated. Also, it is first reported in our study, suggesting that MLLT3 is a direct target of miR-564. The results also showed a significant negative correlation with miR-564 in PCa cells. Furthermore, up-regulation of MLLT3 attenuates the effects of miR-564 on the ability of PCa cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our research demonstrated the suppressor function of miR-564 in PCa, revealing restoration of miR-564 as a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of PCa.",,"['Meng, F-J', 'Meng, F-M', 'Wu, H-X', 'Cao, X-F']","['Meng FJ', 'Meng FM', 'Wu HX', 'Cao XF']","['Laboratory Medicine, Yidu Central Hospital of Weifang City, Weifang, Shandong, China. wochuizhanzha@163.com.']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],,Italy,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,9717360,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN564 microRNA, human)', '0 (MLLT3 protein, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)']",IM,,"['Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/biosynthesis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Metastasis/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Up-Regulation/genetics']",,,2017/11/23 06:00,2018/07/26 06:00,['2017/11/23 06:00'],"['2017/11/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/11/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/26 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci. 2017 Nov;21(21):4828-4834.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the combination of chemotherapies and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has significantly improved the outcome of leukemia patients, a proportion of patients still suffer from relapse after treatment. Upon relapse, a phenomenon termed ""lineage switch"" is observed in a subset of leukemia patients, in which conversion of lymphoblastic leukemia to myeloid leukemia or vice versa is observed. A rare entity of leukemia called mixed-phenotype acute leukemia exhibits co-expression of markers representing two or three lineages. These two phenotypes regarding the lineage ambiguity suggest that the fate of some leukemia retain or acquire a certain degree of plasticity. Studies using animal models provide insight into how lineage specifying transcription factors can enforce or convert a fate in hematopoietic cells. Modeling lineage conversion in normal hematopoietic progenitor cells may improve our current understanding of how lineage switch occurs in leukemia. In this review, we will summarize the role of transcription factors and microenvironmental signals that confer fate plasticity to normal hematopoietic progenitor cells, and their potential to regulate lineage switching in leukemias.

Decades of research have demonstrated that AML evolves from the sequential acquisition of genetic alterations within a single lineage of hematopoietic cells. More recently, the advent of high-throughput sequencing has enabled the identification of a premalignant phase of AML termed preleukemia. Multiple studies have demonstrated that AML can arise from the accumulation of mutations within hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs).

With the advent of increasingly high-throughput and precise RNA-sequencing techniques within the last two decades, it has become well established that miRNAs can regulate almost all cellular processes through their ability to post-transcriptionally regulate a majority of protein-coding genes and countless other non-coding genes. In cancer, miRNAs have been demonstrated to play critical roles by modifying or controlling all major hallmarks including cell division, self-renewal, invasion, and DNA damage among others. Before the introduction of anthracyclines and cytarabine in the 1960s, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was considered a fatal disease. In decades since, prognosis has improved substantially; however, long-term survival with AML remains poor. Resistance to chemotherapy, whether it is present at diagnosis or induced during treatment is a major therapeutic challenge in the treatment of this disease. Certain mechanisms such as DNA damage response and drug targeting, cell cycling, cell death, and drug trafficking pathways have been shown to be further dysregulated in treatment resistant cancers. miRNAs playing key roles in the emergence of these drug resistance phenotypes have recently emerged and replacement or inhibition of these miRNAs may be a viable treatment option. Herein, we describe the roles miRNAs can play in drug resistant AML and we describe miRNA-transcript interactions found within other cancer states which may be present within drug resistant AML. We describe the mechanisms of action of these miRNAs and how they can contribute to a poor overall survival and outcome as well. With the precision of miRNA mimic- or antagomir-based therapies, miRNAs provide an avenue for exquisite targeting in the therapy of drug resistant cancers.",,"['Gabra, Martino Marco', 'Salmena, Leonardo']","['Gabra MM', 'Salmena L']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20171030,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,,PMC5674931,,2017/11/23 06:00,2017/11/23 06:01,['2017/11/23 06:00'],"['2017/08/17 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/11/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/23 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2017.00255 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2017 Oct 30;7:255. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2017.00255. eCollection 2017.,,['NOTNLM'],"['RNA therapy', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'chemotherapy', 'cytarabine', 'daunorubicin', 'drug resistance', 'microRNA']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The neoplastic natural killer (NK) cells usually harbor the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) with a latent viral infection pattern type II; they often have a cytoplasmic CD3epsilon(+) and surface CD3(-), CD2(+), and CD56(+) immunophenotype, and they show complex genetic abnormalities affecting multiple tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes. We present a rare case of CD56-negative ANKL and review the clinical and laboratorial criteria for the diagnosis, as well as the available therapies. Case Presentation: A European 36-year-old male presented with acute onset fever, pallor, weakness, and jaundice. He had hepatosplenomegaly, severe pancytopenia, hepatic cytolysis, and very high serum lactic dehydrogenase levels. The bone marrow studies resulted in the diagnosis of an EBV-positive, CD56-negative ANKL. The patient failed to respond to gemcitabine and cisplatin-based polychemotherapy, dying three months later with leukemic meningitis and multiple cranial nerves palsies. Conclusions: The diagnosis of ANKL is difficult and requires both clinical suspicion and an extensive laboratorial approach.

Since both drugs inhibit topoisomerase II and cause DNA double strand breaks, resistance could be achieved by enhanced DNA damage repair (DDR), via homologous recombination (HR) and/or non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). An important source of extrinsic chemoresistance is the bone marrow stroma. We aimed to reveal intrinsic and stroma-induced signaling pathways that contribute to chemoresistance. Sixty diagnostic pediatric AML samples were cultured on or off stromal cells, with or without chemotherapy. We measured apoptosis, DNA damage signaling, and NHEJ/HR pathway activity by FACS analysis of intracellular cleaved PARP, gammaH2AX, pDNA-PKcs and pATM, respectively. Mitoxantrone strongly increased gammaH2AX and pDNA-PKcs. Neither chemotherapy drug induced pATM. DNA-PK inhibition alleviated mitoxantrone resistance for AML cells on and off stromal cells. Regarding stroma-induced signaling pathways, ERK1/2 was most consistently activated in primary AML cells by stromal cells. ERK1/2 inactivation partially restored chemosensitivity to AML cells on stromal cells. Additionally, low stroma-induced STAT3 activity and strong stroma-induced mitoxantrone resistance were associated with inferior clinical outcome.

Over the past years, the role of several soluble factors involved in these processes has been studied. CLL cells express higher levels of endothelin 1 (ET-1) and ETA receptor as compared to normal B cells. Upon ET-1 stimulation, CLL cells improve their survival and proliferation and reduce their sensitivity to the phosphoinositide-3-kinase delta inhibitor idelalisib and to fludarabine. Here, we demonstrate that CLL cells express not only ETA receptor but also ETB receptor. ET-1 acts as a homing factor supporting CLL cells migration and adhesion to microenvironmental cells. In addition, ET-1 stimulates a pro-angiogenic profile of CLL cells increasing VEGF expression through hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1alpha) accumulation in CLL cells. Macitentan, a specific dual inhibitor of ETA and ETB receptors, targets CLL cells affecting leukemic cells migration and adhesion and overcoming the pro-survival and proliferation signals mediated by microenvironment. Furthermore, macitentan cooperates with ibrutinib inhibiting the BCR pathway and with ABT-199 disrupting BCL2 pathway. Our data describe the biological effects of a new drug, macitentan, able to counteract essential processes in CLL pathobiology as survival, migration, trafficking and drug resistance.

Despite improved overall survival rates, they are still a major contributor to cancer death in children. Aims: To determine the proportion of children with HM in pediatric palliative care (PPC) and to identify the clinical characteristics and symptoms in comparison to children with extracranial solid tumors (non HM patients). Patients and Methods: This study was conducted as a single-center retrospective cohort study of patients in the care of a large specialized PPC team. Results: Fifteen HM and 50 non HM patients were included. Symptoms in which HM patients scored significantly higher than non HM patients were mucositis, difficulty moving, somnolence, fatigue, petechiae and paleness. Blood transfusions were more frequently administered to HM patients, but large external hemorrhage was not observed in any child. A large variety of drugs and appliances were needed by the patients, with morphine being the most frequently prescribed drug. During the study period, a much larger and over the years even increasing number of HM patients (not in the care of the PPC team) died in hospital with an (assumed) curative intent, with two thirds dying in the ICU. Conclusions: Children with HM were referred to outpatient PPC with almost the full clinical picture of advanced leukemia. Noteworthy, the number of children with HM dying at home is decreasing in our center, instead a substantial proportion received high-intensity medical hospital care including novel anticancer therapies. These patients thus seem to be at an increased risk of dying in hospital as the right time to transfer them to palliative care is oftentimes missed.",,"['Hoell, Jessica I', 'Warfsmann, Jens', 'Balzer, Stefan', 'Borkhardt, Arndt', 'Janssen, Gisela', 'Kuhlen, Michaela']","['Hoell JI', 'Warfsmann J', 'Balzer S', 'Borkhardt A', 'Janssen G', 'Kuhlen M']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Center for Child and Adolescent Health, Medical Faculty, Heinrich Heine University of Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Center for Child and Adolescent Health, Medical Faculty, Heinrich Heine University of Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Center for Child and Adolescent Health, Medical Faculty, Heinrich Heine University of Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Center for Child and Adolescent Health, Medical Faculty, Heinrich Heine University of Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Center for Child and Adolescent Health, Medical Faculty, Heinrich Heine University of Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Center for Child and Adolescent Health, Medical Faculty, Heinrich Heine University of Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany.']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],20170923,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,,,,PMC5685721,,2017/11/23 06:00,2017/11/23 06:01,['2017/11/23 06:00'],"['2017/06/02 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/11/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/23 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.21188 [doi]', '21188 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Sep 23;8(52):89939-89948. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.21188. eCollection 2017 Oct 27.,,['NOTNLM'],"['children', 'hematologic malignancies', 'home care', 'palliative care', 'pediatric']",,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors have declared no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the current study we performed a screening for JAK2 mutations and translocations, analyzed the clinical outcome and studied the efficacy of two JAK inhibitors in primary BCP-ALL cells. Importantly, we identify a number of limitations of JAK inhibitor therapy. JAK2 mutations mainly occurred in the poor prognostic subtypes BCR-ABL1-like and non- BCR-ABL1-like B-other (negative for sentinel cytogenetic lesions). JAK2 translocations were restricted to BCR-ABL1-like cases. Momelotinib and ruxolitinib were cytotoxic in both JAK2 translocated and JAK2 mutated cells, although efficacy in JAK2 mutated cells highly depended on cytokine receptor activation by TSLP.

Furthermore, inhibitors induced accumulation of phosphorylated JAK2(Y1007), which resulted in a profound re-activation of JAK2 signaling upon release of the inhibitors.

Here, we identified a recurrent mutation in DHX15 (NM_001358:c.664C>G: p.(R222G)) in one familial AML patient and 4/240 sporadic AML patients. Additionally, DHX15 was commonly overexpressed in AML patients and associated with poor overall survival (OS) (P=0.019) and relapse-free survival (RFS) (P=0.032). In addition, we found a distinct expression pattern of DHX15. DHX15 was highly expressed in hematopoietic stem cells and leukemia cells but was lowly expressed in mature blood cells. DHX15 was down-regulated when AML patients achieved disease remission or when leukemia cell lines were induced to differentiate. DHX15 silencing greatly inhibited leukemia cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis and G1-phase arrest. In contrast, the restoration of DHX15 expression rescued cell viability and reduced cell apoptosis. In addition, we found that DHX15 was down-regulated when cell apoptosis was induced by ATO (arsenic trioxide); overexpression of DHX15 caused dramatic resistance to ATO-induced cell apoptosis, suggesting an important role for DHX15 in cell apoptosis. We further explored the mechanism of DHX15 in apoptosis and found that overexpression of DHX15 activated NF-kB transcription. Knockdown of DHX15 inhibited the nuclear translocation and activation of the NF-kB subunit P65 in leukemia cells. Several downstream targets of the NF-kB pathway were also down-regulated, and apoptosis-associated genes CASP3 and PARP were activated. In conclusion, this study represents the first demonstration that DHX15 plays an important role in leukemogenesis via the NF-kB signaling pathway and may serve as an independent prognostic marker for AML.",,"['Pan, Lili', 'Li, Yang', 'Zhang, Hai-Ying', 'Zheng, Yi', 'Liu, Xiao-Li', 'Hu, Zheng', 'Wang, Yi', 'Wang, Jing', 'Cai, Yuan-Hua', 'Liu, Qiao', 'Chen, Wan-Ling', 'Guo, Ying', 'Huang, Yuan-Mao', 'Qian, Feng', 'Jin, Li', 'Wang, Jiucun', 'Wang, Shao-Yuan']","['Pan L', 'Li Y', 'Zhang HY', 'Zheng Y', 'Liu XL', 'Hu Z', 'Wang Y', 'Wang J', 'Cai YH', 'Liu Q', 'Chen WL', 'Guo Y', 'Huang YM', 'Qian F', 'Jin L', 'Wang J', 'Wang SY']","['Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory on Hematology, Department of Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, PR China.', 'Union Clinical Medical Colleges, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, PR China.', 'Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory on Hematology, Department of Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, PR China.', 'Union Clinical Medical Colleges, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, PR China.', 'Union Clinical Medical Colleges, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, PR China.', 'Union Clinical Medical Colleges, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, PR China.', 'Union Clinical Medical Colleges, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, PR China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering and Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Contemporary Anthropology, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, PR China.', 'Union Clinical Medical Colleges, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, PR China.', 'Union Clinical Medical Colleges, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, PR China.', 'Union Clinical Medical Colleges, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, PR China.', 'Union Clinical Medical Colleges, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, PR China.', 'Union Clinical Medical Colleges, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, PR China.', 'Union Clinical Medical Colleges, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, PR China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering and Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Contemporary Anthropology, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, PR China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering and Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Contemporary Anthropology, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, PR China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering and Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Contemporary Anthropology, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, PR China.', 'Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory on Hematology, Department of Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, PR China.', 'Union Clinical Medical Colleges, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, PR China.']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],20170816,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,,,,PMC5685698,,2017/11/23 06:00,2017/11/23 06:01,['2017/11/23 06:00'],"['2017/05/09 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/11/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/23 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.20288 [doi]', '20288 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Aug 16;8(52):89643-89654. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.20288. eCollection 2017 Oct 27.,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'DHX15', 'NF-kB', 'knockdown', 'overexpression']",,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, the previously described inhibitor of HOX/PBX dimerization, HXR9, is cytotoxic to both AML-derived cell lines and primary AML cells from patients. The mechanism of cell death is not dependent on apoptosis but instead involves a regulated form of necrosis referred to as necroptosis.

Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that baicalin exhibits potent antitumor properties by suppressing cell growth, arresting cell cycle progression and inducing differentiation or apoptosis in leukemia cell lines. However, whether or not the extrinsic pathway is involved in baicalin-induced apoptosis of leukemia cells and the mechanisms underlying the antitumor activity of baicalin remain unclear. In the present study, the effect of baicalin on the expression of caspase-8, Fas cell surface death receptor (Fas) and Fas ligand in HL-60 cells was assessed, and it was demonstrated that the Fas-mediated extrinsic pathway was also involved in baicalin-triggered cell apoptosis, in addition to the intrinsic pathway. Furthermore, baicalin was able to inhibit the proliferation of HL-60 cells by arresting the cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase, and by down-regulating Myc proto-oncogene protein (c-Myc) along with its target gene, human telomerase reverse transcriptase. In summary, the results of the present study demonstrated that baicalin was able to inhibit the growth of HL-60 cells through blockade of the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle, and significantly induce the apoptosis of cells by activating the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. The inhibition of HL-60 cell growth was also demonstrated to be mediated by telomerase inhibition through suppression of c-Myc.

Along disease continuum, these effects collectively result in a progressive decline of NK cell immunity, a phenomenon increasingly recognized as a critical determinant of MM progression. In recent years, unprecedented efforts in drug development and experimental research have brought about emergence of novel therapeutic interventions with the potential to override MM-induced NK cell immunosuppression. These NK-cell enhancing treatment strategies may be identified in two major groups: (1) immunomodulatory biologics and small molecules, namely, immune checkpoint inhibitors, therapeutic antibodies, lenalidomide, and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase inhibitors and (2) NK cell therapy, namely, adoptive transfer of unmanipulated and chimeric antigen receptor-engineered NK cells.

The development of new drugs that could trigger apoptosis in aggressive hematological malignancies, such as AML and CML, may be considered a promising antileukemic strategy. AD0157, a natural marine pyrrolidinedione, has already been described as a compound that inhibits angiogenesis by induction of apoptosis in endothelial cells. The crucial role played by defects in the apoptosis pathways in the pathogenesis, progression and response to conventional therapies of several forms of leukemia, moved us to analyze the effect of this compound on the growth and death of leukemia cells. In this work, human myeloid leukemia cells (HL60, U937 and KU812F) were treated with AD0157 ranging from 1 to 10 muM and an experimental battery was applied to evaluate its apoptogenic potential. We report here that AD0157 was highly effective to inhibit cell growth by promotion of apoptosis in human myeloid leukemia cells, and provide evidence of its mechanisms of action. The apoptogenic activity of AD0157 on leukemia cells was verified by an increased chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation, and confirmed by an augmentation in the apoptotic subG1 population, translocation of the membrane phosphatidylserine from the inner face of the plasma membrane to the cell surface and by cleavage of the apoptosis substrates PARP and lamin-A. In addition, AD0157 in the low micromolar range significantly enhanced the activities of the initiator caspases-8 and -9, and the effector caspases-3/-7 in a dose-dependent manner. Results presented here throw light on the apoptogenic mechanism of action of AD0157, mediated through caspase-dependent cascades, with an especially relevant role played by mitochondria. Altogether, these results suggest the therapeutic potential of this compound for the treatment of human myeloid leukemia.",,"['Garcia-Caballero, Melissa', 'Martinez-Poveda, Beatriz', 'Medina, Miguel A', 'Quesada, Ana R']","['Garcia-Caballero M', 'Martinez-Poveda B', 'Medina MA', 'Quesada AR']","['Departamento de Biologia Molecular y Bioquimica, Facultad de Ciencias, Andalucia Tech, Universidad de Malaga, Malaga, Spain.', 'Unidad 741 de CIBER ""de Enfermedades Raras"" (CIBERER), Malaga, Spain.', 'Departamento de Biologia Molecular y Bioquimica, Facultad de Ciencias, Andalucia Tech, Universidad de Malaga, Malaga, Spain.', 'Unidad 741 de CIBER ""de Enfermedades Raras"" (CIBERER), Malaga, Spain.', 'Departamento de Biologia Molecular y Bioquimica, Facultad de Ciencias, Andalucia Tech, Universidad de Malaga, Malaga, Spain.', 'Unidad 741 de CIBER ""de Enfermedades Raras"" (CIBERER), Malaga, Spain.', 'Departamento de Biologia Molecular y Bioquimica, Facultad de Ciencias, Andalucia Tech, Universidad de Malaga, Malaga, Spain.', 'Unidad 741 de CIBER ""de Enfermedades Raras"" (CIBERER), Malaga, Spain.']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],20171107,Switzerland,Front Pharmacol,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923,,,,,PMC5682012,,2017/11/23 06:00,2017/11/23 06:01,['2017/11/23 06:00'],"['2017/05/07 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/11/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/23 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fphar.2017.00802 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pharmacol. 2017 Nov 7;8:802. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2017.00802. eCollection 2017.,,['NOTNLM'],"['AD0157', 'apoptosis', 'caspases', 'extrinsic/intrinsic pathways', 'mitochondria', 'myeloid leukemia']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, overriding AraC resistance in AML remains an unmet medical need. Here we show that the CHK1 inhibitor (CHK1i) GDC-0575 enhances AraC-mediated killing of AML cells both in vitro and in vivo, thus abrogating any potential chemoresistance mechanisms involving DNA repair. Importantly, this combination of drugs does not affect normal long-term hematopoietic stem/progenitors. Moreover, the addition of CHK1i to AraC does not generate de novo mutations and in patients' samples where AraC is mutagenic, addition of CHK1i appears to eliminate the generation of mutant clones. Finally, we observe that persistent residual leukemic cells are quiescent and can become responsive to the treatment when forced into cycle via granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) administration. This drug combination (AraC+CHK1i+G-CSF) will open the doors for a more efficient treatment of AML in the clinic.",,"['Di Tullio, Alessandro', 'Rouault-Pierre, Kevin', 'Abarrategi, Ander', 'Mian, Syed', 'Grey, William', 'Gribben, John', 'Stewart, Aengus', 'Blackwood, Elizabeth', 'Bonnet, Dominique']","['Di Tullio A', 'Rouault-Pierre K', 'Abarrategi A', 'Mian S', 'Grey W', 'Gribben J', 'Stewart A', 'Blackwood E', 'Bonnet D']","['Hematopoietic Stem Cell Laboratory, The Francis Crick Institute, 1 Midland Road, NW1 1AT, London, UK.', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Laboratory, The Francis Crick Institute, 1 Midland Road, NW1 1AT, London, UK.', 'Department of Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, Chaterhouse Square, EC1M 6BQ, London, UK.', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Laboratory, The Francis Crick Institute, 1 Midland Road, NW1 1AT, London, UK.', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Laboratory, The Francis Crick Institute, 1 Midland Road, NW1 1AT, London, UK.', ""King's College London School of Medicine, Department of Haematological Medicine, The Rayne Institute, 123 Coldharbour Lane, SE5 9NU, London, UK."", 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Laboratory, The Francis Crick Institute, 1 Midland Road, NW1 1AT, London, UK.', 'Department of Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, Chaterhouse Square, EC1M 6BQ, London, UK.', 'Bioinformatic Core, The Francis Crick Institute, 1 Midland Road, NW1 1AT, London, UK.', 'Genentech, 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, CA, CA94 080, USA.', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Laboratory, The Francis Crick Institute, 1 Midland Road, NW1 1AT, London, UK. dominique.bonnet@crick.ac.uk.']",['eng'],,"['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'FC0010045/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'FC0010045/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'FC001045/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171122,England,Nat Commun,Nature communications,101528555,"['0 (GDC-0575)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (CHEK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Checkpoint Kinase 1)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Checkpoint Kinase 1/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*administration & dosage', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mutation/drug effects', 'Piperidines/*administration & dosage', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*administration & dosage', 'Pyridines/*administration & dosage', 'Pyrroles/*administration & dosage', 'U937 Cells', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC5698422,,2017/11/23 06:00,2018/10/03 06:00,['2017/11/23 06:00'],"['2017/04/03 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/11/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/03 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41467-017-01834-4 [doi]', '10.1038/s41467-017-01834-4 [pii]']",epublish,Nat Commun. 2017 Nov 22;8(1):1679. doi: 10.1038/s41467-017-01834-4.,,,,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7671-7364', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4735-5226']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report, dimeric ATRA phosphorylcholine prodrug (Di-ATRA-PC) was designed and assembled into nanoliposomes to improve its pharmacokinetic properties. Di-ATRA-PC prodrug was synthesized by a facile esterification and characterized by mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). The Di-ATRA-PC assembled liposomes were prepared by thin film hydration method with ATRA loading efficiency up to 73wt%. The liposomes have a uniform particle size (73.1+/-3.6nm) with negatively charged surface (-20.5+/-2.5mV) and typical lipid bilayer structure as measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS), transmission electron microscope (TEM) and cryogenic transmission electron microscope (cryo-TEM). In vitro drug release study confirmed that Di-ATRA-PC liposomes could sustainedly release free ATRA in a weakly acidic condition. Furthermore, cellular uptake, MTT and cell apoptosis analysis demonstrated that the liposomes could be successfully internalized into tumor cells to induce apoptosis of MCF-7 and HL-60 cells. More importantly, in vivo pharmacokinetic assay indicated that Di-ATRA-PC liposomes had much longer retention time in comparison with ATRA.

In the case of the compounds described in this paper, activity is linked to different features, in particular the characteristics of the spacer, which seem to be critical for the interaction with the pump. This fact indicates that the presence of a flavone or chromone residue influences the SAR of these series of products, and that flexible molecules can find different productive binding modes with the P-gp recognition site. These results support the synthesis of new compounds that might be useful leads for the development of drugs to control P-gp-dependent MDR.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

METHODS: The expression of CD200 and CD56 by blast cells was assessed by flow cytometry before the start of chemotherapy in 70 B-ALL patients. RESULTS: Positive expression of CD200 was detected in forty-six patients (66%) and CD56 was detected in 7 patients (10%) out of 70 patients, respectively. Only three patients (4.3%) had co-expression for CD200(+) and CD56(+). Splenomegaly and thrombocytopenia were frequently observed more in CD200(+) patients. Increased frequency of CD34(+) was associated with CD200(+)and CD56(+) patients. The CD200(+) and CD56(+) subgroups of B-ALL patients had inferior OS and disease free survival compared to CD 200(-) and CD 56(-) patients.

It is imperative that nurses be knowledgeable of clinical symptoms associated with intravenous (IV) monomethoxypolyethylene glycol (PEG)-asparaginase reactions, as well as potential reaction timing. PURPOSE: This single institution retrospective study describes the clinical factors among patients with IV PEG-asparaginase hypersensitivity reactions. METHODS: Reaction frequency and severity, dose, phase of treatment, and time between infusion initiation and reaction were collected on patients identified as having an IV PEG-asparaginase hypersensitivity reaction while undergoing acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatment. RESULTS: Sixty-three patients (12.8%) developed a hypersensitivity reaction to IV PEG-asparaginase, with the reaction occurring during a median of 3 doses in both risk arms. Reactions were noted </=60 minutes after infusion initiation in 98% of patients, and no reactions were fatal. CONCLUSION: Nurses should carefully observe patients throughout the infusion and anticipate adverse reactions, particularly during the first 3 doses and first 10 minutes of each infusion.

These studies are of tremendous importance for accurate cancer diagnosis and subtype recognition. However, the microarray data of gene expression profiles have small samples, high dimensionality, large noise and data redundancy. To further improve the classification performance of microarray data, a gene selection approach based on the Fisher linear discriminant (FLD) and the neighborhood rough set (NRS) is proposed. First, the FLD method is employed to reduce the preliminarily genetic data to obtain features with a strong classification ability, which can form a candidate gene subset. Then, neighborhood precision and neighborhood roughness are defined in a neighborhood decision system, and the calculation approaches for neighborhood dependency and the significance of an attribute are given. A reduction model of neighborhood decision systems is presented. Thus, a gene selection algorithm based on FLD and NRS is proposed. Finally, four public gene datasets are used in the simulation experiments. Experimental results under the SVM classifier demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is effective, and it can select a smaller and more well-classified gene subset, as well as obtain better classification performance.",,"['Sun, Lin', 'Zhang, Xiaoyu', 'Xu, Jiucheng', 'Wang, Wei', 'Liu, Ruonan']","['Sun L', 'Zhang X', 'Xu J', 'Wang W', 'Liu R']","['a College of Computer & Information Engineering, Henan Normal University , Xinxiang , Henan , China.', 'b Post-doctoral Mobile Station of Biology, College of Life Science, Henan Normal University , Xinxiang , Henan , China.', 'c Engineering Technology Research Center for Computing Intelligence & Data Mining of Henan Province , Xinxiang , Henan , China.', 'a College of Computer & Information Engineering, Henan Normal University , Xinxiang , Henan , China.', 'a College of Computer & Information Engineering, Henan Normal University , Xinxiang , Henan , China.', 'a College of Computer & Information Engineering, Henan Normal University , Xinxiang , Henan , China.', 'c Engineering Technology Research Center for Computing Intelligence & Data Mining of Henan Province , Xinxiang , Henan , China.', 'a College of Computer & Information Engineering, Henan Normal University , Xinxiang , Henan , China.']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],20171219,United States,Bioengineered,Bioengineered,101581063,,IM,,"['Algorithms', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Colonic Neoplasms/diagnosis/*genetics/pathology', 'Computational Biology', 'Databases, Genetic', 'Datasets as Topic', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genes, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/*genetics/pathology', 'Lung Neoplasms/diagnosis/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/diagnosis/*genetics/pathology']",PMC5972918,,2017/11/23 06:00,2019/03/06 06:00,['2017/11/23 06:00'],"['2017/11/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/06 06:00 [medline]', '2017/11/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/21655979.2017.1403678 [doi]'],ppublish,Bioengineered. 2018 Jan 1;9(1):144-151. doi: 10.1080/21655979.2017.1403678.

In this study, we report that the leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF; named as OnLif) from a teleost fish, Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), is essential for the proliferation, survival, and pluripotency maintenance of Nile tilapia ES cells (TES1) by activating the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3). This protein has 221 amino acid residues with similar sequence features to mammalian LIF. By fusing to a small ubiquitin-related modifier and inducing expression at 16 degrees C, the soluble tag-free protein had been successfully obtained. Further investigation indicates that OnLif could significantly enhance the proliferation and survival of TES1. Moreover, it contributed to the pluripotency maintenance of TES1 characteristic of high expression of pluripotency genes, no or low expression of differentiation genes, and strong alkaline phosphatase activity. Notably, it mediated Stat3 phosphorylation, whose inhibitor treatment could lead to apoptosis. In addition, OnLif significantly enhanced the proliferation of ES cells from medaka (Oryzias latipes), suggesting its potential role in other fish ES cells. These data first suggest that Lif/Stat3 signaling has an essential role in the self-renewal of ES cells from fish, just like that in the ground state pluripotency maintenance of mouse and human ES cells. Our study would not only be helpful for the understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying self-renewal of ES cells from the perspective of evolution but also facilitate ES-based biotechnology application in fishery.",,"['Wei, Jing', 'Fan, Zhenhua', 'Yang, Zhuo', 'Zhou, Yujie', 'Da, Fan', 'Zhou, Linyan', 'Tao, Wenjing', 'Wang, Deshou']","['Wei J', 'Fan Z', 'Yang Z', 'Zhou Y', 'Da F', 'Zhou L', 'Tao W', 'Wang D']","['Key Laboratory of Freshwater Fish Reproduction and Development, Ministry of Education, Laboratory of Aquatic Science of Chongqing, School of Life Sciences, Southwest University , Chongqing, China .', 'Key Laboratory of Freshwater Fish Reproduction and Development, Ministry of Education, Laboratory of Aquatic Science of Chongqing, School of Life Sciences, Southwest University , Chongqing, China .', 'Key Laboratory of Freshwater Fish Reproduction and Development, Ministry of Education, Laboratory of Aquatic Science of Chongqing, School of Life Sciences, Southwest University , Chongqing, China .', 'Key Laboratory of Freshwater Fish Reproduction and Development, Ministry of Education, Laboratory of Aquatic Science of Chongqing, School of Life Sciences, Southwest University , Chongqing, China .', 'Key Laboratory of Freshwater Fish Reproduction and Development, Ministry of Education, Laboratory of Aquatic Science of Chongqing, School of Life Sciences, Southwest University , Chongqing, China .', 'Key Laboratory of Freshwater Fish Reproduction and Development, Ministry of Education, Laboratory of Aquatic Science of Chongqing, School of Life Sciences, Southwest University , Chongqing, China .', 'Key Laboratory of Freshwater Fish Reproduction and Development, Ministry of Education, Laboratory of Aquatic Science of Chongqing, School of Life Sciences, Southwest University , Chongqing, China .', 'Key Laboratory of Freshwater Fish Reproduction and Development, Ministry of Education, Laboratory of Aquatic Science of Chongqing, School of Life Sciences, Southwest University , Chongqing, China .']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171221,United States,Stem Cells Dev,Stem cells and development,101197107,"['0 (Fish Proteins)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Fish Proteins/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Oryzias/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*physiology', 'Tilapia/*metabolism']",,,2017/11/23 06:00,2018/11/02 06:00,['2017/11/23 06:00'],"['2017/11/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/02 06:00 [medline]', '2017/11/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/scd.2017.0207 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells Dev. 2018 Jan 15;27(2):123-132. doi: 10.1089/scd.2017.0207.

In this study, we have investigated whether quercetin, curcumin and their combination induce apoptosis and inhibit growth of K562 cells. We have observed that quercetin and curcumin combination induced apoptosis accompanied by increased ROS and decreased GSH levels as well as loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. Our mRNA and protein expression results suggested that cytochrome c was released from mitochondria causing PARP and caspase-9 cleavages, the hallmarks of mitochondrial apoptotic pathway.

The goal of this study was to examine adherence, satisfaction, and efficacy of Cogmed across coaches. Survivors of pediatric brain tumors and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (N = 68) were randomized to intervention (Cogmed) or waitlist control. The intervention group was matched with one of two coaches. Cognitive assessments were completed before and after intervention, and participants and caregivers in the intervention group completed satisfaction surveys. T-tests showed no differences in adherence across coaches (number of sessions completed p = .38; d = .32). Noninferiority statistics were not consistently equivalent for satisfaction, but equivalence was supported for caregiver perceptions of pragmatic utility and participant perceptions of logistical ease of Cogmed. Equivalence was not consistently suggested for cognitive outcomes, but was supported on measures tapping relevant cognitive domains (attention, working memory, processing speed, academic fluency). This study suggests adherence can be maintained across coaches. While aspects of satisfaction and cognitive outcomes were equivalent, the possible influence of coach-based variables cannot be ruled out.

Differential methylation analysis between patients and controls allowed us to identify abnormalities in DNA methylation, including hypermethylation of specific genes and large genome regions with aberrant DNA methylation. Unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis identified two main clusters that associated with the clinical, biological, and genetic features of patients. Group 1 was enriched in patients with adverse clinical and biological characteristics and poorer overall and progression-free survival. In addition, significant differences in DNA methylation were observed between patients with low risk and intermediate/high risk karyotypes and between TET2 mutant and wild type patients.

The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that increasing cancer incidence rates are due to secular trends in pregnancy characteristics that are established risk factors for childhood cancer incidence including older maternal age, higher birthweight, and lower birth order. We also considered temporal trends in sociodemographic characteristics including race/ethnicity and poverty. PROCEDURE: We conducted a time series county-level ecologic analysis using linked population-based data from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results cancer registries (1975-2013), birth data from the National Center for Health Statistics (1970-2013), and sociodemographic data from the US Census (1970-2010). We estimated unadjusted and adjusted average annual percent changes (AAPCs) in incidence of combined (all diagnoses) and individual types of cancer among children, ages 0-4 years, from Poisson mixed models. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant unadjusted temporal rise in incidence of combined childhood cancers (AAPC = 0.71%; 95% CI = 0.55-0.86), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (0.78%; 0.49-1.07), acute myeloid leukemia (1.86%; 1.13-2.59), central nervous system tumors (1.31%; 0.94-1.67), and hepatoblastoma (2.70%; 1.68-3.72). Adjustment for county-level maternal age reduced estimated AAPCs between 8% (hepatoblastoma) and 55% (combined). However, adjustment for other county characteristics did not attenuate AAPCs, and AAPCs remained significantly above 0% in models fully adjusted for county-level characteristics. CONCLUSION: Although rising maternal age may account for some of the increase in childhood cancer incidence over time, other factors, not considered in this analysis, may also contribute to temporal trends.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Kehm, Rebecca D', 'Osypuk, Theresa L', 'Poynter, Jenny N', 'Vock, David M', 'Spector, Logan G']","['Kehm RD', 'Osypuk TL', 'Poynter JN', 'Vock DM', 'Spector LG']","['Division of Epidemiology & Community Health, University of Minnesota School of Public Health, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Division of Epidemiology & Community Health, University of Minnesota School of Public Health, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Division of Epidemiology & Clinical Research, Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Division of Biostatistics, University of Minnesota School of Public Health, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Division of Epidemiology & Clinical Research, Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.']",['eng'],,"['P2C HD041023/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009529/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA094061/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA099936/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20171121,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,,"['*Birth Order', '*Birth Weight', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', '*Maternal Age', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Risk Factors', 'SEER Program', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'United States/epidemiology']",PMC5766387,['NIHMS915650'],2017/11/22 06:00,2019/03/26 06:00,['2017/11/22 06:00'],"['2017/08/10 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/04 00:00 [revised]', '2017/10/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/26 06:00 [medline]', '2017/11/22 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.26888 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2018 Mar;65(3). doi: 10.1002/pbc.26888.

Patients are predisposed to infection due to immune defects related to the primary disease, and as a result of therapy. The range of infectious complications has evolved alongside therapeutic advances in the treatment of CLL. More recently several novel therapeutic compounds have been introduced in CLL, whose unique safety profiles will probably have an impact on the prophylaxis and management of infections in these patients. Areas covered: This review describes the pathogenesis of infections due to intrinsic CLL or therapy-related immunosuppression, and elightens the importance of proactive and reactive infection management as a key focus of patient care. Infections related to conventional chemotherapy, immunochemotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, target therapies with B-cell receptor pathway inhibitors and Bcl-2 antagonists are reviewed. Expert commentary: Despite the importance of infection management and prevention in high-risk patients, there are only limited infection risk-assessment guidelines that can be easily used in clinical practice to guide more appropriate infection prophylaxis and its management. Here we provide an overview of suggested prophylaxis management of infection, and include key prophylactic interventions that we feel should be performed in CLL patients routinely.",,"['Tadmor, Tamar', 'Welslau, Manfred', 'Hus, Iwona']","['Tadmor T', 'Welslau M', 'Hus I']","['a The Ruth and Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Hematology Unit , Bnai-Zion Medical Center , Haifa , Israel.', 'b Haemato-Onkologische Schwerpunktpraxis am Klinikum Aschaffenburg , Aschaffenburg , Germany.', 'c Department of Clinical Transplantology , Medical University of Lublin , Lublin , Poland.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20171127,England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,['0 (Anti-Infective Agents)'],IM,,"['Anti-Infective Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Humans', '*Infection Control', 'Infections/diagnosis/*etiology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*complications/drug therapy/immunology', 'Risk Assessment']",,,2017/11/22 06:00,2018/12/12 06:00,['2017/11/22 06:00'],"['2017/11/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [medline]', '2017/11/22 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17474086.2018.1407645 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2018 Jan;11(1):57-70. doi: 10.1080/17474086.2018.1407645.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Cultures of lymphocytes were stimulated with S. ansochromogenes L-asparaginase, and cytotoxicity, cell viability, cell stimulation and cytokine production were analysed. This new S. ansochromogenes L-asparaginase induced activation and proliferation of the TCD8(+) lymphocyte subset and produced higher TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-2 and IL-10 levels in a 24-h assay. CONCLUSION: Streptomyces ansochromogenes L-asparaginase is a promising molecule to be used in in vivo models and to deepen preclinical tests against acute lymphoblast leukaemia. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: L-asparaginase is an indispensable component of the chemotherapeutic treatment of acute lymphoblast leukaemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Currently, drugs such as Asparaginase((R)) , Kidrolase((R)) , and Elspar((R)) and Erwinase((R)) are efficient against leukemic disease, but promote immunosuppression and other side effects in human organisms.

Early recognition of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients presenting clinical features suspected for a transformation is useful to avoid exposing them to multiple lines of therapy that, being targeted to CLL progression, have poor efficacy against RS. Because of the low specificity (~ 50-60%) of clinical signs of RS (such as rapid and discordant bulky localized lymphadenopathies, elevated LDH levels, emergent physical deterioration, and/or fever in the absence of infection), a (18)FDG PET/CT and a biopsy are recommended to confirm RS. A (18)FDG PET/CT showing low uptake is helpful to rule out RS and avoid unnecessary risks and costs of performing a biopsy. A (18)FDG PET/CT showing a high uptake is not diagnostic of RS but may help in the choice of the site where the biopsy is to be performed. In the setting of the diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) variant of RS, the definition of a clonal relationship between RS and the underlying CLL may guide the choice of treatment. If a clonal relationship is confirmed (the most common situation), rituximab-CHOP-like treatment does not guarantee long-lasting remissions, and should be used as induction therapy followed by consolidation with a stem cell transplant in physically fit patients. If the CLL and RS are clonally unrelated (the less common situation), the management should be that of a de novo DLBCL. In the setting of the rare Hodgkin lymphoma variant of RS, which is usually clonally unrelated to the CLL, ABVD with or without radiotherapy may be curative of the aggressive lymphoma.",,"['Condoluci, Adalgisa', 'Rossi, Davide']","['Condoluci A', 'Rossi D']","['Division of Hematology, Oncology Institute of Southern Switzerland, Bellinzona, Switzerland.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Oncology Research, Bellinzona, Switzerland.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology Institute of Southern Switzerland, Bellinzona, Switzerland. davide.rossi@eoc.ch.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Oncology Research, Bellinzona, Switzerland. davide.rossi@eoc.ch.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20171121,United States,Curr Treat Options Oncol,Current treatment options in oncology,100900946,['4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)'],IM,,"['Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/pathology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Disease Progression', 'Hodgkin Disease/diagnosis/pathology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/pathology/*therapy', 'Lymphadenopathy/diagnosis/pathology/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/diagnosis/pathology/*therapy', 'Rituximab/therapeutic use']",,,2017/11/22 06:00,2018/07/10 06:00,['2017/11/22 06:00'],"['2017/11/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/11/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11864-017-0512-y [doi]', '10.1007/s11864-017-0512-y [pii]']",epublish,Curr Treat Options Oncol. 2017 Nov 21;18(12):75. doi: 10.1007/s11864-017-0512-y.,,['NOTNLM'],"['*CLL', '*DLBCL', '*Hodgkin lymphoma', '*Richter syndrome', '*Transformation', '*Treatment']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The high expression of INF-gamma (INF-gamma) is a primary pathogenic factor in SLE. It is found that ATO can reduce INF-gamma expression levels in lupus-prone mice, whereas it is not clear whether ATO has the same effect on SLE patients. Therefore, this study was to investigate the underlying mechanism of the effects of ATO on the expression of INF-gamma in splenocytes of MRL/lpr mice and PBMCs of human lupus. The mRNA and protein expression levels of INF-gamma were assessed by real-time RT-PCR and ELISA, respectively. The histone acetylation status of the INF-gamma promoter and the binding of RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) to the INF-gamma promoter were detected using a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) technique. The mRNA and protein expression levels of INF-gamma decreased in both splenocytes of MRL/lpr mice and PBMCs of SLE patients with ATO treatment, which were accompanied by reduced histone H4 and H3 acetylation in INF-gamma promoter and decreased combination of RNA Pol II to the INF-gamma promoter. Therefore, ATO may reduce the expression level of the INF-gamma by altering the levels of INF-gamma promoter acetylation and the combination of RNA Pol II to the INF-gamma promoter in splenocytes of MRL/lpr mice and PBMCs of SLE patients.",,"['Hu, Hongye', 'Chen, Enjiu', 'Li, Yongji', 'Zhu, Xiaochun', 'Zhang, Ting', 'Zhu, Xiaofang']","['Hu H', 'Chen E', 'Li Y', 'Zhu X', 'Zhang T', 'Zhu X']","['Department of Surgical Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Department of Pneumology, The People Hospital of Pingyang, Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Department of Rheumatology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Nan Bai Xiang Street, Ouhai District, Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province, 325000, China.', 'Department of Rheumatology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Nan Bai Xiang Street, Ouhai District, Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province, 325000, China.', 'Department of Rheumatology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Nan Bai Xiang Street, Ouhai District, Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province, 325000, China.', 'Department of Rheumatology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Nan Bai Xiang Street, Ouhai District, Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province, 325000, China. june8587@outlook.com.']",['eng'],,['Y20090240/Major projects of Wenzhou science and technology project'],['Journal Article'],20171120,United States,Biol Trace Elem Res,Biological trace element research,7911509,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/metabolism', 'Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic/blood/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred MRL lpr', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Spleen/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Young Adult']",,,2017/11/22 06:00,2018/10/23 06:00,['2017/11/22 06:00'],"['2017/06/28 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/23 06:00 [medline]', '2017/11/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12011-017-1206-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s12011-017-1206-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Biol Trace Elem Res. 2018 Aug;184(2):391-397. doi: 10.1007/s12011-017-1206-9.

Transcription induction and recruitment of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) by PML-RARalpha and subsequent hypermethylation are components of this perturbation. Arsenic trioxide (ATO), an important drug in APL therapy, concurrent with degradation of PML-RARalpha induces cell cycle change and apoptosis. How ATO causes cell cycle alteration has remained largely unexplained. Here, we investigated DNA methylation patterns of cell cycle regulatory genes promoters, the effects of ATO on the methylated genes and cell cycle distribution in an APL cell line, NB4. Analysis of promoter methylation status of 22 cell cycle related genes in NB4 revealed that CCND1, CCNE1, CCNF, CDKN1A, GADD45alpha, and RBL1 genes were methylated 60.7, 84.6, 58.6, 8.7, 33.4, and 73.7%, respectively, that after treatment with 2 muM ATO for 48 h, turn into 0.6, 13.8, 0.1, 6.6, 10.7, and 54.5% methylated. ATO significantly reduced the expression of DNMT1, 3A, and 3B. ATO induced the expression of CCND1, CCNE1, and GADD45alpha genes, suppressed the expression of CCNF and CDKN1A genes, which were consistent with decreased number of cells in G1 and S phases and increased number of cells in G2/M phase. In conclusion, demethylation and alteration in the expression level of the cell cycle related genes may be possible mechanisms in ATO-induced cell cycle arrest in APL cells. It may suggest that ATO by demethylation of CCND1 and CCNE1 and their transcriptional activation accelerates G1 and S transition into the G2/M cell cycle arrest.",,"['Hassani, Saeed', 'Khaleghian, Ali', 'Ahmadian, Shahin', 'Alizadeh, Shaban', 'Alimoghaddam, Kamran', 'Ghavamzadeh, Ardeshir', 'Ghaffari, Seyed H']","['Hassani S', 'Khaleghian A', 'Ahmadian S', 'Alizadeh S', 'Alimoghaddam K', 'Ghavamzadeh A', 'Ghaffari SH']","['Hematology Department, School of Allied Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Semnan University of Medical Sciences, Semnan, Iran.', 'Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Tehran, P.O.

Some clinical trials, however, resulted in severe adverse events caused by vector-induced proto-oncogene activation, which showed that retroviral vectors may retain a genotoxic potential associated to proviral integration in the human genome. The adverse events sparked a renewed interest in the biology of retroviruses, which led in a few years to a remarkable understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying retroviral integration site selection within mammalian genomes. This review summarizes the current knowledge on retrovirus-host interactions at the genomic level, and the peculiar mechanisms by which different retroviruses, and their related gene transfer vectors, integrate in, and interact with, the human genome.

The protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) is an enzyme involved in growth and survival pathways promoting tumorigenesis. However, little is known about the biologic function of PRMT5 and its therapeutic potential in multiple myeloma (MM). In the present study, we identified and validated PRMT5 as a new therapeutic target in MM. PRMT5 is overexpressed in patient MM cells and associated with decreased progression-free survival and overall survival. Either genetic knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of PRMT5 with the inhibitor EPZ015666 significantly inhibited growth of both cell lines and patient MM cells. Furthermore, PRMT5 inhibition abrogated NF-kappaB signaling.

We hypothesized that multiple myeloma (MM) cells might recruit and reprogram DCs to a tumor-permissive phenotype by changes within their microRNA (miRNA) network. By analyzing six different miRNA-profiling data sets, miR-29b was identified as the only miRNA upregulated in normal mature DCs and significantly downregulated in tumor-associated DCs. This finding was validated in primary DCs co-cultured in vitro with MM cell lines and in primary bone marrow DCs from MM patients. In DCs co-cultured with MM cells, enforced expression of miR-29b counteracted pro-inflammatory pathways, including signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and nuclear factor-kappaB, and cytokine/chemokine signaling networks, which correlated with patients' adverse prognosis and development of bone disease. Moreover, miR-29b downregulated interleukin-23 in vitro and in the SCID-synth-hu in vivo model, and antagonized a Th17 inflammatory response. All together, these effects translated into strong anti-proliferative activity and reduction of genomic instability of MM cells. Our study demonstrates that MM reprograms the DCs functional phenotype by downregulating miR-29b whose reconstitution impairs DCs ability to sustain MM cell growth and survival.

The SERCA (sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase) inhibitor thapsigargin inhibits mutant NOTCH1 receptors compared with wild type in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), but its administration is predicted to be toxic in humans. Leveraging the addiction of ALL to folic acid, we conjugated folate to an alcohol derivative of thapsigargin via a cleavable ester linkage. JQ-FT is recognized by folate receptors on the plasma membrane and delivered into leukemia cells as a potent antileukemic agent. In mechanistic and translational models of T-ALL, we demonstrate NOTCH1 inhibition in vitro and in vivo. These proof-of-concept studies support the further optimization of this first-in-class NOTCH1 inhibitor with dual selectivity: leukemia over normal cells and NOTCH1 mutants over wild-type receptors.

We describe a new PRIT approach for the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM) and other B-cell malignancies, for which we developed an anti-CD38-bispecific fusion protein that eliminates endogenous biotin interference and immunogenic elements. In murine xenograft models of MM and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), the CD38-bispecific construct demonstrated excellent blood clearance and tumor targeting. Dosimetry calculations showed a tumor-absorbed dose of 43.8 Gy per millicurie injected dose of (90)Y, with tumor-to-normal organ dose ratios of 7:1 for liver and 15:1 for lung and kidney. In therapy studies, CD38-bispecific PRIT resulted in 100% complete remissions by day 12 in MM and NHL xenograft models, ultimately curing 80% of mice at optimal doses. In direct comparisons, efficacy of the CD38 bispecific proved equal or superior to streptavidin (SA)-biotin-based CD38-SA PRIT. Each approach cured at least 75% of mice at the highest radiation dose tested (1200 microCi), whereas at 600- and 1000-microCi doses, the bispecific outperformed the SA approach, curing 35% more mice overall (P < .004). The high efficacy of bispecific PRIT, combined with its reduced risk of immunogenicity and endogenous biotin interference, make the CD38 bispecific an attractive candidate for clinical translation. Critically, CD38 PRIT may benefit patients with unresponsive, high-risk disease because refractory disease typically retains radiation sensitivity. We posit that PRIT might not only prolong survival, but possibly cure MM and treatment-refractory NHL patients.",['(c) 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Green, Damian J', ""O'Steen, Shyril"", 'Lin, Yukang', 'Comstock, Melissa L', 'Kenoyer, Aimee L', 'Hamlin, Donald K', 'Wilbur, D Scott', 'Fisher, Darrell R', 'Nartea, Margaret', 'Hylarides, Mark D', 'Gopal, Ajay K', 'Gooley, Theodore A', 'Orozco, Johnnie J', 'Till, Brian G', 'Orcutt, Kelly D', 'Wittrup, K Dane', 'Press, Oliver W']","['Green DJ', ""O'Steen S"", 'Lin Y', 'Comstock ML', 'Kenoyer AL', 'Hamlin DK', 'Wilbur DS', 'Fisher DR', 'Nartea M', 'Hylarides MD', 'Gopal AK', 'Gooley TA', 'Orozco JJ', 'Till BG', 'Orcutt KD', 'Wittrup KD', 'Press OW']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Department of Medicine and.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.', 'Versant Medical Physics, Richland, WA; and.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Department of Medicine and.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Department of Medicine and.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Department of Medicine and.', 'Department of Chemical Engineering and.', 'Department of Biological Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA.', 'Department of Chemical Engineering and.', 'Department of Biological Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Department of Medicine and.']",['eng'],,"['K01 CA188151/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA076287/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA205248/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171120,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,['Blood. 2018 Feb 8;131(6):589-590.

While apoptosis has been suggested as a possible mechanism underlying MPTP-induced cell death and several apoptosis-associated proteins have been implicated in MPTP-animal models, relevant information regarding the possible involvement of Mcl-1 (myeloid cell leukemia 1) protein is missing. Mcl-l is an important member of the Bcl-2 family that is thought to be a highly regulated controller of cell death and survival. However, the expression level of Mcl-1 in response to MPTP-treatment has not been examined in any area of the brain previously. In the present study, an acute MPTP treatment regimen was utilized with male C57BL/6 mice (10mg/kg i.p. injections, 4 times with 2 h intervals) and several protein markers were examined 24-h after the initial injection. Dramatic decreases in the immunoreactivities of tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine transporters were observed. Western-blot analysis and immunocytochemical labeling demonstrated an MPTP-induced decrease in Mcl-1 protein levels in the striatum. In addition, the two proteins BAX and ERK, both of which are also involved in apoptosis signaling, were examined. While the total BAX levels showed no significant difference between the control and MPTP-treated groups, levels of phosphorylated ERK were significantly increased following MPTP-treatment. Since Mcl-1 is an anti-apoptotic protein, down-regulation of Mcl-1 following MPTP-treatment would be expected to lead to increased apoptotic activities processes, leading to increased neurodegeneration.",['Published by Elsevier B.V.'],"['Lu, Edward', 'Sarkar, Sumit', 'Raymick, James', 'Paule, Merle G', 'Gu, Qiang']","['Lu E', 'Sarkar S', 'Raymick J', 'Paule MG', 'Gu Q']","['Division of Neurotoxicology, National Center for Toxicological Research, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, United States.', 'Division of Neurotoxicology, National Center for Toxicological Research, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, United States.', 'Division of Neurotoxicology, National Center for Toxicological Research, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, United States.', 'Division of Neurotoxicology, National Center for Toxicological Research, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, United States.', 'Division of Neurotoxicology, National Center for Toxicological Research, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, United States.

Peer review of the Draft IRIS Assessment by a National Academy of Science committee noted that ""causal determinations are not supported by the narrative provided in the draft"" (NRC 2011). They offered recommendations for improving the Draft IRIS assessment and identified several important research gaps. Over the six years since the NRC peer review, significant new science has been published. We identify and summarize key recommendations made by NRC and map them to this new science, including extended analysis of epidemiological studies, updates of earlier occupational cohort studies, toxicological experiments using a sensitive mouse strain, mechanistic studies examining the role of exogenous versus endogenous formaldehyde in bone marrow, and several critical reviews. With few exceptions, new findings are consistently negative, and integration of all available evidence challenges the earlier conclusions that formaldehyde causes leukemia. Given formaldehyde's commercial importance, environmental ubiquity and endogenous production, accurate hazard classification and risk evaluation of whether exposure to formaldehyde from occupational, residential and consumer products causes leukemia are critical.",['Copyright (c) 2017 The Authors.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease, more than half of the AML cases exhibit normal karyotype (NK). Approximately 50-60 percent of patients with NK-AML carry NPM1 mutations which are characterized by cytoplasmic dislocation of the NPM1 protein. In AML, mutant NPM1 (NPM1c+) acts in a dominant negative fashion and also blocks the differentiation of myeloid cells through gain-of-function for the AML phenotype. Currently, there is limited knowledge on the gain-of-function mechanism of mutant NPM1. Here, we review the known mechanisms of mutant NPM1 in the pathogenesis of AML. We describe genetic abnormalities, the clinical significance of exon-12 mutations in the NPM1 gene, and chromosomal translocations including the recently discovered NPM1-TYK2, and NPM1-HAUS1. Also, we outline the possible therapeutic interventions for the treatment of AML by targeting NPM1.

The underlying immunologic and cellular processes involved in driving fluid extravasation and the severe anaphylactic phenotype are not fully elucidated. OBJECTIVE: We sought to define the interaction and requirement of IL-4 and vascular endothelial (VE) IL-4 receptor alpha chain (IL-4Ralpha) signaling in histamine-abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homology 1 (ABL1)-mediated VE dysfunction and fluid extravasation in the severity of IgE-mediated anaphylactic reactions in mice. METHODS: Mice deficient in VE IL-4Ralpha and models of passive and active oral antigen- and IgE-induced anaphylaxis were used to define the requirements of the VE IL-4Ralpha and ABL1 pathway in severe anaphylactic reactions. The human VE cell line (EA.hy926 cells) and pharmacologic (imatinib) and genetic (short hairpin RNA knockdown of IL4RA and ABL1) approaches were used to define the requirement of this pathway in VE barrier dysfunction. RESULTS: IL-4 exacerbation of histamine-induced hypovolemic shock in mice was dependent on VE expression of IL-4Ralpha. IL-4- and histamine-induced ABL1 activation in human VE cells and VE barrier dysfunction was ABL1-dependent. Development of severe IgE-mediated hypovolemia and shock required VE-restricted ABL1 expression. Treatment of mice with a history of food-induced anaphylaxis with the ABL kinase inhibitor imatinib protected the mice from severe IgE-mediated anaphylaxis. CONCLUSION: IL-4 amplifies IgE- and histamine-induced VE dysfunction, fluid extravasation, and the severity of anaphylaxis through a VE IL-4Ralpha/ABL1-dependent mechanism. These studies implicate an important contribution by the VE compartment in the severity of anaphylaxis and identify a new pathway for therapeutic intervention of IgE-mediated reactions.","['Copyright (c) 2017 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.

Although a number of advances have increased the knowledge of leukemia pathophysiology, its etiology remains less well understood. The role of infectious agents, such as viruses, bacteria, or parasites, in the pathogenesis of leukemia has been discussed. To date, several cellular mechanisms involving infectious agents have been proposed to cause leukemia following infections. However, although leukemia can be triggered by contact with such agents, they can also be beneficial in developing immune stimulation and protection despite the risk of leukemic clones. In this review, we analyze the proposed hypotheses concerning how infectious agents may play a role in the origin and development of leukemia, as well as in a possible mechanism of protection following infections.

More recently, a deeper insight into the mechanism of antitumor immunity and tumor immunoevasion have facilitated the development of novel immunotherapy agents. Certain targeted agents have the ability of inhibiting tumor growth without causing severe lymphocytopenia and amplifying antitumor immune response by increasing tumor antigenicity, enhancing intratumoral T cell infiltration, and altering the tumor immune microenvironment, which provides a rationale for combining targeted therapy with immunotherapy. Targeted therapy can elicit dramatic responses in selected patients by interfering with the tumor-intrinsic driver mutations. But in most cases, resistance will occur over a relatively short period of time. In contrast, immunotherapy can yield durable, albeit generally mild, responses in several tumor types via unleashing host antitumor immunity. Thus, combination approaches might be able to induce a rapid tumor regression and a prolonged duration of response. We examine the available evidence regarding immune effects of targeted therapy, and review preclinical and clinical studies on the combination of targeted therapy and immunotherapy for cancer treatment.

The Bcl-2 gene family members play important roles in the regulation of apoptosis and are frequently altered in cancers. One such member is pro-apoptotic protein Bcl-2-related Ovarian Killer (BOK). Despite its critical role in apoptosis, the regulation of BOK expression is poorly understood in cancers. Here, we discovered that miR-296-5p regulates BOK expression by binding to its 3'-UTR in breast cancers. Interestingly, miR-296-5p also regulates the expression of anti-apoptotic protein myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1), which is highly expressed in breast cancers. Our results reveal that Mcl-1 and BOK constitute a regulatory feedback loop as ectopic BOK expression induces Mcl-1, whereas silencing of Mcl-1 results in reduced BOK levels in breast cancer cells. In addition, we show that silencing of Mcl-1 but not BOK reduced the long-term growth of breast cancer cells. Silencing of both Mcl-1 and BOK rescued the effect of Mcl-1 silencing on breast cancer cell growth, suggesting that BOK is important for attenuating cell growth in the absence of Mcl-1. Depletion of BOK suppressed caspase-3 activation in the presence of paclitaxel and in turn protected cells from paclitaxel-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that glycogen synthase kinase (GSK3) alpha/beta interacts with BOK and regulates its level post-translationally in breast cancer cells. Taken together, our results suggest that fine tuning of the levels of pro-apoptotic protein BOK and anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 may decide the fate of cancer cells to either undergo apoptosis or proliferation.",,"['Onyeagucha, Benjamin', 'Subbarayalu, Panneerdoss', 'Abdelfattah, Nourhan', 'Rajamanickam, Subapriya', 'Timilsina, Santosh', 'Guzman, Rosa', 'Zeballos, Carla', 'Eedunuri, Vijay', 'Bansal, Sanjay', 'Mohammad, Tabrez', 'Chen, Yidong', 'Vadlamudi, Ratna K', 'Rao, Manjeet K']","['Onyeagucha B', 'Subbarayalu P', 'Abdelfattah N', 'Rajamanickam S', 'Timilsina S', 'Guzman R', 'Zeballos C', 'Eedunuri V', 'Bansal S', 'Mohammad T', 'Chen Y', 'Vadlamudi RK', 'Rao MK']","[""Greehey Children's Cancer Research Institute, The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, Texas, 78229 USA."", 'Department of Cell Systems and Anatomy, The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, Texas, 78229 USA.', ""Greehey Children's Cancer Research Institute, The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, Texas, 78229 USA."", 'Department of Cell Systems and Anatomy, The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, Texas, 78229 USA.', ""Greehey Children's Cancer Research Institute, The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, Texas, 78229 USA."", 'Department of Cell Systems and Anatomy, The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, Texas, 78229 USA.', ""Greehey Children's Cancer Research Institute, The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, Texas, 78229 USA."", 'Department of Cell Systems and Anatomy, The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, Texas, 78229 USA.', ""Greehey Children's Cancer Research Institute, The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, Texas, 78229 USA."", 'Department of Cell Systems and Anatomy, The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, Texas, 78229 USA.', ""Greehey Children's Cancer Research Institute, The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, Texas, 78229 USA."", 'Department of Cell Systems and Anatomy, The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, Texas, 78229 USA.', ""Greehey Children's Cancer Research Institute, The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, Texas, 78229 USA."", 'Department of Cell Systems and Anatomy, The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, Texas, 78229 USA.', ""Greehey Children's Cancer Research Institute, The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, Texas, 78229 USA."", 'Department of Cell Systems and Anatomy, The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, Texas, 78229 USA.', ""Greehey Children's Cancer Research Institute, The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, Texas, 78229 USA."", 'Department of Epidemiology and Statistics, The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, Texas, 78229 USA.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, Texas, 78229 USA.', ""Greehey Children's Cancer Research Institute, The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, Texas, 78229 USA."", 'Department of Cell Systems and Anatomy, The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, Texas, 78229 USA.']",['eng'],,"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA054174/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA179120/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM113245/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20170912,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,,,,PMC5689661,,2017/11/22 06:00,2017/11/22 06:01,['2017/11/22 06:00'],"['2017/04/19 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/11/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/22 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.20841 [doi]', '20841 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Sep 12;8(49):85984-85996. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.20841. eCollection 2017 Oct 17.,,['NOTNLM'],"['BOK', 'GSK3alpha/beta', 'Mcl-1', 'apoptosis', 'breast cancer']",,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declared that no conflicts of interest exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Depending on either wild type, or mutant, RUNX1 transcriptional regulation, the cell-context specific miR-221-regulated KIT level translates into differential single cell fate decisions.

However, the pro-differentiation and anti-proliferation effects of LSD1 inhibition in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are not yet fully understood. Here, we report that small hairpin RNA (shRNA) mediated LSD1 inhibition causes a remarkable transcriptional activation of myeloid lineage marker genes (CD11b/ITGAM and CD86), reduction of cell proliferation and decrease of clonogenic ability of human AML cells. Cell surface expression of CD11b and CD86 is significantly and dynamically increased in human AML cells upon sustained LSD1 inhibition. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and quantitative PCR (ChIP-qPCR) analyses of histone marks revealed that there is a specific increase of H3K4me2 modification and an accompanied increase of H3K4me3 modification at the respective CD11b and CD86 promoter region, whereas the global H3K4me2 level remains constant. Consistently, inhibition of LSD1 in vivo significantly blocks tumor growth and induces a prominent increase of CD11b and CD86.

Lipopolysaccharide-induced production of IL-1beta and TNF-a as well as reduced TLR2 expression in neutrophils from CLL than in neutrophils from controls suggesting their tolerant state. Finally, phenotypic alterations of neutrophils, particularly elevation of CD64 and CD54 markers, correlated with disease activity and treatment, and low percentage of neutrophils. Taken together, the alterations in percentage and functional characteristics of neutrophils reflect the clinical course of CLL.

Major scientific and clinical advances have led to a better understanding of the disease biology, and the majority of patients achieve a complete remission (CR) after induction therapy. Relapse risk, however, remains considerable and is the leading cause of death in this patient population. Significant efforts to improve outcomes emphasize use of post-remission therapies such as hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), an increasingly utilized modality. Improvement in transplantation techniques, understanding of donor:recipient histocompatibility, and increased availability of alternative donors have resulted in greater use of allogeneic HCT. Despite a graft-versus-leukemia effect and lower post-HCT relapse rates, allogeneic HCT continues to be plagued by treatment-related mortality (TRM) and chronic graft-versus-host disease. Better understanding of AML risk stratification and issues relating to minimal residual disease (MRD) as well as extremely low TRM rates with autografts have prompted clinicians to re-explore use of autologous HCT in subsets of favorable and intermediate-risk CR1 AML patients. Herein, we highlight the evolving literature and treatment outcomes for autologous HCT in AML.

Analysis of the formation and repair of DSB is relevant in a broad spectrum of research areas including genome integrity, genotoxicity, radiation biology, aging, cancer, and drug development. In response to DSB, the histone H2AX is phosphorylated at Serine 139 in a region of several megabase pairs forming discrete nuclear foci detectable by immunofluorescence microscopy. In addition, 53BP1 (p53 binding protein 1) is another important DSB-responsive protein promoting repair of DSB by nonhomologous end-joining while preventing homologous recombination. According to the specific functions of gammaH2AX and 53BP1, the combined analysis of gammaH2AX and 53BP1 by immunofluorescence microscopy may be a reasonable approach for a detailed analysis of DSB. This manuscript provides a step-by-step protocol supplemented with methodical notes for performing the technique. Specifically, the influence of the cell cycle on gammaH2AX foci patterns is demonstrated in normal fibroblasts of the cell line NHDF. Further, the value of the gammaH2AX foci as a biomarker is depicted in x-ray irradiated lymphocytes of a healthy individual. Finally, genetic instability is investigated in CD34+ cells of a patient with acute myeloid leukemia by immunofluorescence microscopy of gammaH2AX and 53BP1.",,"['Popp, Henning D', 'Brendel, Susanne', 'Hofmann, Wolf-Karsten', 'Fabarius, Alice']","['Popp HD', 'Brendel S', 'Hofmann WK', 'Fabarius A']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Medical Faculty Mannheim of the Heidelberg University; henning.popp@medma.uni-heidelberg.de.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Medical Faculty Mannheim of the Heidelberg University.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Medical Faculty Mannheim of the Heidelberg University.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Medical Faculty Mannheim of the Heidelberg University.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', 'Video-Audio Media']",20171103,United States,J Vis Exp,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,101313252,"['0 (TP53BP1 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor p53-Binding Protein 1)']",IM,,"['*DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded', '*DNA Repair', 'Humans', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Tumor Suppressor p53-Binding Protein 1/*genetics']",PMC5755291,,2017/11/21 06:00,2018/03/30 06:00,['2017/11/21 06:00'],"['2017/11/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3791/56617 [doi]'],epublish,J Vis Exp. 2017 Nov 3;(129). doi: 10.3791/56617.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Common techniques employed include serum deprivation; chemicals which arrest cells at different cell cycle phases; or the use of mitotic shake-off which exploits their reduced adherence. However, all of these have disadvantages. For example, serum starvation works well for normal cells but less well for tumor cells with compromised cell cycle checkpoints due to oncogene activation or tumor suppressor loss. Similarly, chemically-treated cell populations can harbor drug-induced damage and show stress-related alterations. A technique which circumvents these problems is counterflow centrifugal elutriation (CCE), where cells are subjected to two opposing forces, centrifugal force and fluid velocity, which results in the separation of cells on the basis of size and density. Since cells advancing through the cycle typically enlarge, CCE can be used to separate cells into different cell cycle phases. Here we apply this technique to primary acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. Under optimal conditions, an essentially pure population of cells in G1 phase and a highly enriched population of cells in G2/M phases can be obtained in excellent yield. These cell populations are ideally suited for studying cell cycle-dependent mechanisms of action of anticancer drugs and for other applications. We also show how modifications to the standard procedure can result in suboptimal performance and discuss the limitations of the technique.

SHP2 has been shown to contribute to the progression of a number of cancer types including leukemia, gastric, and breast cancers. It also regulates T-cell activation by interacting with inhibitory immune checkpoint receptors such as the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and B- and T-lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA). Thus, SHP2 inhibitors have drawn great attention by both inhibiting tumor cell proliferation and activating T cell immune responses toward cancer cells. In this study, we report the identification of an allosteric SHP2 inhibitor 1-(4-(6-bromonaphthalen-2-yl)thiazol-2-yl)-4-methylpiperidin-4-amine (23) that locks SHP2 in a closed conformation by binding to the interface of the N-terminal SH2, C-terminal SH2, and phosphatase domains. Compound 23 suppresses MAPK signaling pathway and YAP transcriptional activity and shows antitumor activity in vivo.

CD22 is also expressed in most cases of B-ALL and is usually retained following CD19 loss. We report results from a phase 1 trial testing a new CD22-targeted CAR (CD22-CAR) in 21 children and adults, including 17 who were previously treated with CD19-directed immunotherapy. Dose-dependent antileukemic activity was observed, with complete remission obtained in 73% (11/15) of patients receiving >/=1 x 10(6) CD22-CAR T cells per kg body weight, including 5 of 5 patients with CD19(dim) or CD19(-) B-ALL. Median remission duration was 6 months. Relapses were associated with diminished CD22 site density that likely permitted CD22(+) cell escape from killing by CD22-CAR T cells. These results are the first to establish the clinical activity of a CD22-CAR in B-ALL, including leukemia resistant to anti-CD19 immunotherapy, demonstrating potency against B-ALL comparable to that of CD19-CAR at biologically active doses.

Several scoring systems (HCT-specific comorbidity index [HCT-CI]/modified European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation risk score [mEBMT]) have been adopted to predict HCT outcomes in other hematologic malignancies. We retrospectively evaluated HCT-CI and mEBMT to predict nonrelapse mortality (NRM) in 824 ATL patients registered in the Japan Society for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation TRUMP database, from 2008 until 2013. A higher HCT-CI was associated with greater NRM when comparing HCT-CI 0 versus HCT-CI 1 to 3 and HCT-CI 0 versus HCT-CI >/= 4. A higher mEBMT score was not associated with higher NRM when comparing mEBMT 0 to 3 with 4 to 6. Because ATL patients are older and consequently at risk of additional complications, we developed an optimized prognostic index for ATL (ATL-HCT-PI) using known risk factors: age, HCT-CI, and donor-recipient sex combination. The ATL-HCT-PI scores effectively predicted the 2-year NRM (22.0%, 27.7%, and 44.4%, respectively). Therefore, the newly developed ATL-HCT-PI, in combination with other risk factors, is more useful for predicting NRM in HCT for ATL patients.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Previous research has suggested that reducing the intensity of calcineurin inhibitor-based graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis may be an effective strategy for abrogating the risk of relapse in pediatric patients undergoing matched sibling donor (MSD) HCT. We reasoned that the benefits of this strategy could be maximized by selectively applying it to those patients least likely to develop GVHD. We conducted a study of risk factors for GVHD, to risk-stratify patients based on age. Patients age <18 years with leukemia who received myeloablative, T cell-replete MSD bone marrow transplantation and calcineurin inhibitor-based GVHD prophylaxis between 2000 and 2013 and were entered into the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research registry were included. The cumulative incidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD (aGVHD) was 19%, that of grade II-IV aGVHD 7%, and that of chronic GVHD (cGVHD) was 16%. Compared with age 13 to 18 years, age 2 to 12 years was associated with a lower risk of grade II-IV aGVHD (hazard ratio [HR], .42; 95% confidence interval [CI], .26 to .70; P = .0008), grade II-IV aGVHD (HR, .24; 95% CI, .10 to .56; P = .001), and cGVHD (HR, .32; 95% CI, .19 to .54; P < .001). Compared with 2000-2004, the risk of grade II-IV aGVHD was lower in children undergoing transplantation in 2005-2008 (HR, .36; 95% CI, .20 to .65; P = .0007) and in 2009-2013 (HR, .24; 95% CI. .11 to .53; P = .0004). Similarly, the risk of grade III-IV aGVHD was lower in children undergoing transplantation in 2005-2008 (HR, .23; 95% CI, .08 to .65; P = .0056) and 2009-2013 (HR, .16; 95% CI, .04 to .67; P = .0126) compared with those doing so in 2000-2004. We conclude that aGVHD rates have decreased significantly over time, and that children age 2 to 12 years are at very low risk for aGVHD and cGVHD. These results should be validated in an independent analysis, because these patients with high-risk malignancies may be good candidates for trials of reduced GVHD prophylaxis.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the main indication to perform allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Here, we reviewed the clinical results obtained using T-cell-replete platforms in different clinical situations such as first or further complete remission, refractory disease, and in the elderly population. Overall, the toxic profile of T-cell-replete haploidentical transplantation is similar to transplantation from other donors, with positive aspects such as a reduced incidence of chronic graft-versus-host disease. Leukemia-free survival and overall survival are also similar. In conclusion, T-cell-replete haploidentical transplantation represents a new frontier in the treatment landscape of AML, lessening problems linked to donor search and ensuring that a donor can be found for all patients in a timely manner.","['Copyright (c) 2018 ISEH - Society for Hematology and Stem Cells.

The gold standard for detecting these cytogenetic abnormalities is interphase fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) performed on cell smears or tissue sections on glass slides. Fluorescently labelled DNA probes bind to specific chromosomal regions and the signal detected by fluorescent microscopy. Generally only 200 cells are assessed and the limit of sensitivity is 3% positive cells. Here we report the development and use of imaging flow cytometry to assess chromosomes by FISH in phenotyped CLL cells in suspension. Thousands of CLL cells, identified by their phenotype, are assessed for specific FISH probe signals using an automated, high throughput imaging flow cytometer. The ""extended depth of field"" capability of the imaging flow cytometer enables FISH probe signals (""spots"") to be resolved and localised within the (stained) nucleus of the immunophenotyped cells. We report the development of the automated ""immuno-flowFISH"" on normal blood using the Amnis ImageStreamX mark II platform and illustrate the clinical application of the method for the assessment of chromosome 12 in CLL.

Acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome during the course of ALL is a rare entity. Some of these cases are therapy-related while the others occur due to lineage switch. The correct diagnosis relies on comparing the immunophenotypes and cytogenetic/molecular alterations of the myeloid neoplasm and the ALL. We present the clinical, pathologic and cytogenetic features of a case of an 18-year-old male with prior treatment for B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) who developed therapy-related myeloid neoplasm (t-MN) 4-5years after his initial diagnosis of B-ALL. CASE PRESENTATION: A 13-year-old boy with no significant past medical history presented to Harbor-UCLA Medical Center (HUMC) in November 2012 with night sweats, fevers and chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, weakness, and weight loss. Peripheral blood flow cytometric analysis disclosed B-ALL. The blasts expressed CD10, CD19, CD22 (dim), CD34, CD38, HLA-DR, and TdT, and were negative for CD20, CD13, CD33, CD117, and cytoplasmic MPO. Chromosomal analysis and a supplemental fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) study performed on the bone marrow aspirate showed an abnormal karyotype (47,XY,+X,del(9)(p21p21)[4]/46,XY[16]). He achieved remission after induction chemotherapy and remained in remission until March 2016 when bilateral testicular masses were noted. Biopsy of the left testicular mass showed relapsed B-ALL. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) contained rare TdT-positive blasts, suggestive of minimal/early involvement by B-ALL. However, there was no evidence of acute leukemia in his bone marrow at this time. He was then treated with COG protocol AALL1331 randomized to blinatumomab arm and achieved second remission. In June 2017, the patient's peripheral blood smear showed 11% circulating monoblasts. By flow cytometry, the blasts expressed CD4, CD11b, CD13, CD15, CD33, CD38, CD56, and CD64. In addition, a few TdT-positive blasts were seen in his CSF cytospin smear. Bone marrow biopsy was subsequently performed which was consistent with evolving acute myeloid leukemia. A diagnosis of myeloid neoplasm, consistent with t-MN was made. Chromosomal analysis and FISH studies performed on his bone marrow aspirate showed normal karyotype (46,XY[20]), negative FISH result for deletion 9p21 locus, and positive KMT2A (MLL) rearrangement, respectively. Despite of chemotherapy, the patient died within one month after diagnosis. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Diagnosis of t-MN should be suspected in patients with a history of receiving cytotoxic agents and/or irradiation. In this case study, we diagnosed t-MN with KMT2A rearrangement in a patient with history of B-ALL with 9p deletion and gain of X chromosome. Unusual features associated with this case are discussed.",['Published by Elsevier Inc.'],"['Qing, Xin', 'Panosyan, Eduard', 'Yue, Changjun', 'Ji, Ping', 'Gotesman, Moran', 'French, Samuel', 'Cai, Junchao']","['Qing X', 'Panosyan E', 'Yue C', 'Ji P', 'Gotesman M', 'French S', 'Cai J']","['Department of Pathology, Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, 1000 West Carson Street, Torrance, CA 90502, USA.

Initially, the EuroFlow consortium developed a step-by-step standard operating protocol for instrument setup of >/=8-color flow cytometers that were available in 2006, when the EuroFlow activities started. Currently, there are 14 instruments from 9 manufacturers capable of 3-laser excitation and >/=8 color measurements. The specific adaptations required in the instrument set-up to enable them to acquire the standardized 8-color EuroFlow protocols are described here. Overall, all 14 instruments can be fitted with similar violet, blue and red lasers for simultaneous measurements of >/=8 fluorescent dyes. Since individual instruments differ both on their dynamic range (scale) and emission filters, it is not accurate to simply recalculate the target values to different scale, but adjustment of PMT voltages to a given emission filter and fluorochrome, is essential. For this purpose, EuroFlow has developed an approach using Type IIB (spectrally matching) particles to set-up standardized and fully comparable fluorescence measurements, in instruments from different manufacturers, as demonstrated here for the FACSCanto II, and Navios and MACSQuant flow cytometers. Data acquired after such adjustment on any of the tested cytometry platforms could be fully superimposed and therefore analyzed together. The proposed approach can be used to derive target values for any combination of spectrally distinct fluorochromes and any distinct emission filter of any new flow cytometry platform, which enables the measurement of the 8-color EuroFlow panels in a standardized way, by creating superimposable datafiles.",['Copyright (c) 2017.

Since not only CD8 but also CD4 T cells are key players for efficient antitumor responses, the targeted redirection of both subsets with the same antigen-specific TCR comes more and more into focus. Although rapidly evolving technologies enable the reliable genetic re-programming of T cells, the limited availability of TCRs that induce T-cell activation in both T-cell subsets without CD4/CD8 co-receptor contribution hampers the broad application of this approach. We developed a novel stimulation approach, which drives the activation and proliferation of CD4 T-cell populations capable of inducing effector functions in a CD4-independent manner. Naive-enriched CD4 T cells were stimulated against dendritic cells (DC) expressing allogeneic HLA-DP antigens upon RNA transfection and CD4/HLA interactions were blocked by the addition of CD4 binding antibody. Evolving CD4 T-cell populations were specifically activated independent of the CD4 co-signal and induced strong TCR-mediated IFN-gamma secretion as well as cytolysis upon recognition of leukemia cells expressing HLA-DP antigen.

Here, we performed a translational study in active CS and CS in remission (RCS) to evaluate the subclinical cardiometabolic burden and to explore the direct pro-inflammatory and prothrombotic potential of their sera on the endothelium in an in vitro translational atherothrombotic cell model. PATIENTS: Cross sectional study. The groups were (n = 9/group): I. RCS; II. Active CS (ACS) and III. Controls (CTR), all matched for age, body mass index, sex, without other hormonal deficits. DESIGN: We evaluated in vivo: cardiometabolic profile; endothelial markers (sVCAM-1, NO); endothelial dysfunction (FMD); intima-media thickness and body composition (DEXA). In vitro endothelial cells (EC) were exposed to sera taken from the different subjects to evaluate inflammatory EC response (tisVCAM) and thrombogenicity of the generated extracellular matrix (ECM): von Willebrand factor (VWF) and platelet reactivity. RESULTS: Three of the 9 RCS subjects were on glucocorticoid replacement therapy (GC-RT). Patients on GC-RT had a shorter period of time in stable remission. In vivo analysis ACS showed typically metabolic features, while cardiometabolic markers reached statistical significance for RCS only for Hs-CRP (P < .01). In vitro:EC exposed to ACS and RCS sera displayed increased tisVCAM-1 (P < .01 for ACS and P < .05 for RCS vs CTR), VWF (P < .01 for ACS and P < .05 for RCS vs CTR) and platelet adhesion on ECM (P < .01 for ACC and P < .05 for RCS vs CTR). No statistically significant differences were observed between GC-RT RSC and RCS without GC-RT.

Dysregulation of miRNAs is implicated in invasion and metastasis in several human cancer types, and leukemia is not an exception. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a hematological malignancy characterized by the proliferation of early lymphoid precursors that replace normal hematopoietic cells of the bone marrow. The expression profiling of miRNAs in ALL could be used for the classification of the disease establishing specific diagnoses and offering prognostic values in the near future. The correlation of miRNAs dysregulation and biology of ALL demonstrates that specific miRNA may be a potential therapeutic target. In this review we have focused our attention on the correlations between ALL and miRNAs, their link with signaling pathways and transcription factors in the disease and miRNA targeting therapeutic strategies with their advantages and potential use in clinical applications.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Ultimo, Simona', 'Martelli, Alberto M', 'Zauli, Giorgio', 'Vitale, Marco', 'Calin, George A', 'Neri, Luca M']","['Ultimo S', 'Martelli AM', 'Zauli G', 'Vitale M', 'Calin GA', 'Neri LM']","['Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine and Surgery, Sport and Exercise Medicine Centre (SEM), University of Parma, Parma, Italy.', 'CoreLab, Hospital-University of Parma, Parma, Italy.', 'Departments of Experimental Therapeutics and Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Center for RNA Interference and Non-Coding RNAs, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180228,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics']",,,2017/11/21 06:00,2019/09/24 06:00,['2017/11/21 06:00'],"['2017/08/10 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/24 06:00 [medline]', '2017/11/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.26290 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2018 Aug;233(8):5642-5654. doi: 10.1002/jcp.26290.

The activation and function of NK cells are affected by tumor microenvironments. NK cells are also important players in leukemic microenvironment. However, their characteristics in leukemic microenvironment, including maturation status, phenotype, subpopulations and functional roles especially immunoregulatory potential, have not been well established. Here, we studied these characteristics of NK cells in MLL-AF9 induced mouse acute myeloid leukemia (AML) model. Increase of more mature NK cells were detected in the AML spleen. Splenic AML microenvironment promoted NK cell activation in early and middle stages of leukemia. Cytotoxicity molecules and cytokines were up-regulated in activated NK cells. Furthermore, NK cells from AML microenvironment regulated T cell function, not only by maintaining the activation of CD4(+) and promoting the degranulation of cytotoxic CD8(+) T cells but also by influencing the differentiation of CD4(+) T cells. Moreover, two NK cell subpopulations marked by DNAM-1 (CD226) had distinct cytokine expression patterns but similar regulatory effects on T cells.

Identification of effective therapies with genomic-based precision medicine is hampered by intratumour heterogeneity and incomplete understanding of the contribution of various mutations within specific cancer phenotypes. Ex-vivo drug-response profiling in patient biopsies might aid effective treatment identification; however, proof of its clinical utility is limited. METHODS: We investigated the feasibility and clinical impact of multiparametric, single-cell, drug-response profiling in patient biopsies by immunofluorescence, automated microscopy, and image analysis, an approach we call pharmacoscopy. First, the ability of pharmacoscopy to separate responders from non-responders was evaluated retrospectively for a cohort of 20 newly diagnosed and previously untreated patients with acute myeloid leukaemia. Next, 48 patients with aggressive haematological malignancies were prospectively evaluated for pharmacoscopy-guided treatment, of whom 17 could receive the treatment. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival in pharmacoscopy-treated patients, as compared with their own progression-free survival for the most recent regimen on which they had progressive disease. This trial is ongoing and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT03096821. FINDINGS: Pharmacoscopy retrospectively predicted the clinical response of 20 acute myeloid leukaemia patients to initial therapy with 88.1% accuracy. In this interim analysis, 15 (88%) of 17 patients receiving pharmacoscopy-guided treatment had an overall response compared with four (24%) of 17 patients with their most recent regimen (odds ratio 24.38 [95% CI 3.99-125.4], p=0.0013). 12 (71%) of 17 patients had a progression-free survival ratio of 1.3 or higher, and median progression-free survival increased by four times, from 5.7 (95% CI 4.1-12.1) weeks to 22.6 (7.4-34.0) weeks (hazard ratio 3.14 [95% CI 1.37-7.22], p=0.0075). INTERPRETATION: Routine clinical integration of pharmacoscopy for treatment selection is technically feasible, and led to improved treatment of patients with aggressive refractory haematological malignancies in an initial patient cohort, warranting further investigation.

Twenty-eight de novo patients with AML, diagnosed with HL between 2002 and 2015 at the Hacettepe Hematology Department, were analyzed retrospectively. Leukapheresis was performed in 10 patients, and the mean WBC decrease with leukapheresis was 57.4x10(3)/mul which accounts for 31% of the initial WBC count. The indications for leukapheresis were hyperviscosity and prophylaxis in four and six patients, respectively. In the group of patients who received leukapheresis, three of four patients who had hyperviscosity symptoms died, and three of six patients died who did not have symptoms. In our study, we observed that the leukapheresis procedure is highly effective in reducing plasma WBC levels. However, although it is statistically insignificant, our findings also revealed that there is a much higher rate of death in patients who were treated with leukapheresis. Therefore we conclude that leukapheresis does not lower rates of early death; nevertheless, this finding should be confirmed by prospective studies with larger cohorts.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We identified by flow cytometric studies of chemokine receptors and DNA SNP microarray analysis significant differences between cells from CLL and SLL patients. Proteomic analysis revealed two potential markers (m/z 3091 and 8707) to distinguish the two disorders. There was a significantly greater expression of leucocyte trafficking receptor CXCR3 (CD183) and migration and homing receptor CXCR4 (CD184), and significantly lower expression of cell adhesion molecule integrin alpha4 chain (CD49d), on CLL cells, compared with SLL cells. Conversely, SNP microarrays revealed greater numbers of copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity chromosomal aberrations, as well as gross chromosomal aberrations, in the SLL group, compared with the CLL group. These findings revealed that there was a significantly greater expression of trafficking, migration and homing receptors and significantly lower expression of adhesion molecules on CLL cells than on SLL cells, and that SLL may be a more progressive disease than CLL, with a more complex genotype.",['Copyright (c) 2017.

Metaphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) inferred a four-break rearrangement of three chromosomes, namely 1, 8 and 12. First, there was a balanced translocation t(1;12)(p13;p13.2) in which the ETV6 was split between der(1) and der(12). Second, an inverted insertion of 8q12.1~q24.21 into 1p13 occurred, thus bringing ETV6 and LYN into juxtaposition in the correct 5' to 3' orientation to produce an in-frame chimeric fusion gene on der(1). Notwithstanding two previous reports of ETV6-LYN fusion in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), we report the first case of this fusion in AML and hence broaden its disease association. We also illustrate the clinical utility of NGS based detection of gene fusion in the setting of complex karyotype or cryptic aberration, since this method does not require a priori knowledge of the translocation partner and exact breakpoints to guide the application of appropriate primers or probes.",['Copyright (c) 2017 The Authors.

Subsequent studies elucidated a common region of highest-level amplification that includes RUNX1. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is the most common method used to identify iAMP21, which is defined as the presence of five or more total copies of RUNX1, with three or more extra RUNX1 signals on a single abnormal chromosome 21. More recently, chromosomal microarray (CMA) and next generation sequencing have uncovered a characteristic chromosome 21 copy number profile in cases of iAMP21. We present a case of iAMP21 that does not fit the formal FISH definition. However, CMA uncovered the characteristic chromosome 21 copy number profile that is seen in iAMP21, demonstrating that CMA is helpful for the detection of this entity when FISH results are ambiguous.

The underlying mechanisms have not been fully explored. Early studies show that dose, exposure timing, and the time at which immune function is assessed influence whether trichothecenes act in an immunosuppressive or immunostimulatory fashion. Recent studies suggest that the immunomodulatory function of trichothecenes is also actively shaped by competing cell-survival and death-signaling pathways. Autophagy may also promote trichothecene immunosuppression, although the mechanism may be complicated. Moreover, trichothecenes may generate an ""immune evasion"" milieu that allows pathogens to escape host and vaccine immune defenses. Some trichothecenes, especially macrocyclic trichothecenes, also potently kill cancer cells. T-2 toxin conjugated with anti-cancer monoclonal antibodies significantly suppresses the growth of thymoma EL-4 cells and colon cancer cells. The type B trichothecene diacetoxyscirpenol specifically inhibits the tumor-promoting factor HIF-1 in cancer cells under hypoxic conditions. Trichothecin markedly inhibits the growth of multiple cancer cells with constitutively activated NF-kappaB. The type D macrocyclic toxin Verrucarin A is also a promising therapeutic candidate for leukemia, breast cancer, prostate cancer, and pancreatic cancer. The anti-cancer activities of trichothecenes have not been comprehensively summarized. Here, we first summarize the data on the immunomodulatory effects of trichothecenes and discuss recent studies that shed light on the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms. These mechanisms include autophagy and major signaling pathways and their crosstalk. Second, the anti-cancer potential of trichothecenes and the underlying mechanisms will be discussed.

In the current study, the mutagenesis of BCRABL was analyzed via focusing on the process of drug resistance, rather than the final results. Clone sequencing of the BCRABL gene and other control genes was applied in two imatinibresistant cell models. The results have indicated that imatinib actively and selectively causes sporadic mutations in the BCRABL gene, however not in the control genes. The majority of the mutations of BCRABL were not the clinically observed T315I mutation, suggesting that the T315I mutation may be due to clonal expansion of cells with survival advantages.

We recently reported results of a phase 2 trial of PEG-IFN-alpha-2a in 83 patients with ET and PV after a median follow-up of 83 months. Here we report an analysis of bone marrow (BM) responses in these patients. Methods: Among 83 patients, 58 (70%, PV 25, ET 31) had evaluable BM samples. BM responses and fibrosis grading were defined according to the International Working Group for Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Research and Treatment, and the European Consensus on grading of BM fibrosis, respectively. BM was assessed prior to enrollment, and every 6-24 months while on therapy in all patients, and after therapy discontinuation in some patients. Results: The median age of analyzed 58 patients was 52 years, and 29% were males. After a median follow-up of 84 months, 32 patients are still on study. Hematologic (HR) and molecular responses (MR) were seen in 93 and 69% patients, respectively. Twenty-nine patients (50%) had a BM response, including 13 (22%) with a complete BM response (BM-CR). Moreover, 13 patients (22%) have experienced complete resolution of bone marrow reticulin fibrosis. Patients with BM response had higher duration of HR and MR, and lower discontinuation rate. Furthermore, patients with BM-CR had a higher probability of complete MR. The median duration of BM-CR was 30 months, and 9 patients have maintained their BM-CR (69%), including five who have maintained their response after discontinuation of therapy. Despite this observation, the pattern of HR, MR and BM response, their durability and interrelation was heterogeneous. Conclusions: Our results show the ability of PEG-IFN-alpha-2a to induce complete BM responses in a subset of ET and PV patients, but its correlation with durable clinically relevant treatment benefit warrants further investigation.

The course of this very heterogeneous disease, traditionally treated with chemotherapeutic agents usually in combination with rituximab, typically has been characterized by remissions and relapses, and survival times vary greatly, depending on intrinsic biological attributes of the leukemia. The developments of the last few years have been transformative, ushering in an era of novel, molecularly targeted therapies, made possible by extensive efforts to elucidate the biology of the disease that predated the new targeted drugs. Thus, successful therapeutic targeting of the B-cell receptor signaling pathway and of the Bcl-2 anti-apoptotic protein with small molecules has now made chemotherapy-free approaches possible, hopefully mitigating the risk of development of therapy-related myeloid neoplasms and making eventual cure of CLL with the use of optimal drug combinations a realistic goal. Most importantly, these therapies have demonstrated unprecedented efficacy in patients with deletion 17p/TP53 mutation, a subset that historically has been very difficult to treat. However, as we gain more experience with the newer agents, unique safety concerns and resistance mechanisms have emerged, as has the issue of cost, as these expensive drugs are currently administered indefinitely. Accordingly, novel laboratory-based strategies and clinical trial designs are being explored to address these issues. The availability of whole exome/genome sequencing has given us profound insights into the mutational landscape of CLL.

CBY1 is encoded by C22orf2 (22q13.1) Its antagonistic function on beta-catenin involves the direct interaction with: The C-terminal activation domain of beta-catenin, which hinders beta-catenin binding with Tcf/Lef transcription factors hence repressing beta-catenin transcriptional activation. 14-3-3 scaffolding proteins (sigma or xi), which drive CBY1 nuclear export into a stable tripartite complex with beta-catenin. The relative proximity of C22orf2 gene encoding for CBY1 to the BCR breakpoint on chromosome 22q11, whose translocation and rearrangement with the c-ABL is the causative event of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), suggested that gene haploinsufficiency may play a role in the disease pathogenesis and progression. We found CBY1 down-modulation associated with the BCR-ABL1, promoted by transcriptional mechanisms (promoter hyper-methylation) and post-transcriptional events, addressing the protein towards proteasome-dependent degradation through SUMOylation. CBY1 reduced expression in clonal progenitors and, more importantly, in leukemic stem cells (LSC), is contingent upon the tyrosine kinase (TK) activity of BCR-ABL1 fusion protein. Accordingly, its induction by Imatinib (IM) and second generation TK inhibitors contributes to beta-catenin inactivation through multiple events encompassing the activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-associated unfolded protein response (UPR) and autophagy, eventually leading to apoptotic death.

The toxicity and efficacy of tyrosine kinase inhibitors might depend on the activity of transmembrane transporters. However, the impact of transporters genes polymorphisms in nilotinib setting is still debated. We investigated the possible correlation between single nucleotide polymorphisms of hOCT1 (rs683369 [c.480C>G]) and ABCB1 (rs1128503 [c.1236C>T], rs2032582 [c.2677G>T/A], rs1045642 [c.3435C>T]) and nilotinib efficacy and toxicity in a cohort of 78 patients affected by chronic myeloid leukemia in the context of current clinical practice. The early molecular response was achieved by 81% of patients while 64% of them attained deep molecular response (median time, 26 months). The 36-month event-free survival was 86%, whereas 58% of patients experienced toxicities. Interestingly, hOCT1 and ABCB1 polymorphisms alone or in combination did not influence event-free survival or the adverse events rate. Therefore, in contrast to data obtained in patients treated with imatinib, hOCT1 and ABCB1 polymorphisms do not impact on nilotinib efficacy or toxicity. This could be relevant in the choice of the first-line therapy: patients with polymorphisms that negatively condition imatinib efficacy might thus receive nilotinib as first-line

Recent data indicate that high BAALC expression levels may also be used as marker for residual disease following acute myeloid leukemia treatment. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) offers a curative treatment for acute myeloid leukemia patients. However, disease recurrence remains a major clinical challenge and identification of high-risk patients prior to HSCT is crucial to improve outcomes. We performed absolute quantification of BAALC copy numbers in peripheral blood prior (median 7 days) to HSCT in complete remission (CR) or CR with incomplete peripheral recovery in 82 acute myeloid leukemia patients using digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) technology. An optimal cut-off of 0.14 BAALC/ABL1 copy numbers was determined and applied to define patients with high or low BAALC/ABL1 copy numbers. High pre-HSCT BAALC/ABL1 copy numbers significantly associated with higher cumulative incidence of relapse and shorter overall survival in univariable and multivariable models. Patients with high pre-HSCT BAALC/ABL1 copy numbers were more likely to experience relapse within 100 days after HSCT. Evaluation of pre-HSCT BAALC/ABL1 copy numbers in peripheral blood by ddPCR represents a feasible and rapid way to identify acute myeloid leukemia patients at high risk of early relapse after HSCT. The prognostic impact was also observed independently of other known clinical, genetic, and molecular prognosticators. In the future, prospective studies should evaluate whether acute myeloid leukemia patients with high pre-HSCT BAALC/ABL1 copy numbers benefit from additional treatment before or early intervention after HSCT.",,"['Jentzsch, Madlen', 'Bill, Marius', 'Grimm, Juliane', 'Schulz, Julia', 'Goldmann, Karoline', 'Beinicke, Stefanie', 'Hantschel, Janine', 'Ponisch, Wolfram', 'Franke, Georg-Nikolaus', 'Vucinic, Vladan', 'Behre, Gerhard', 'Lange, Thoralf', 'Niederwieser, Dietger', 'Schwind, Sebastian']","['Jentzsch M', 'Bill M', 'Grimm J', 'Schulz J', 'Goldmann K', 'Beinicke S', 'Hantschel J', 'Ponisch W', 'Franke GN', 'Vucinic V', 'Behre G', 'Lange T', 'Niederwieser D', 'Schwind S']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],20170927,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,,,,PMC5675684,,2017/11/21 06:00,2017/11/21 06:01,['2017/11/21 06:00'],"['2017/07/18 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/21 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.21322 [doi]', '21322 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Sep 27;8(50):87944-87954. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.21322. eCollection 2017 Oct 20.,,['NOTNLM'],"['BAALC', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'allogeneic stem cell transplantation', 'prognosis', 'residual disease']",,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukemia relapse may occur because current therapies eliminate proliferating leukemia cells but fail to eradicate quiescent leukemia-initiating cells (LICs) that can reinitiate the disease after a period of latency. While we demonstrated that p53 target gene Necdin maintains hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) quiescence, its roles in LIC quiescence and response to chemotherapy are unclear. In this study, we utilized two well-established murine models of human AML induced by MLL-AF9 or AML1-ETO9a to determine the role of Necdin in leukemogenesis. We found that loss of Necdin decreased the number of functional LICs and enhanced myeloid differentiation in vivo, leading to delayed development of leukemia induced by MLL-AF9. Importantly, Necdin null LICs expressing MLL-AF9 were less quiescent than wild-type LICs. Further, loss of Necdin enhanced the response of MLL-AF9(+) leukemia cells to chemotherapy treatment, manifested by decreased viability and enhanced apoptosis. We observed decreased expression of Bcl2 and increased expression of p53 and its target gene Bax in Necdin null leukemia cells following chemotherapy treatment, indicating that p53-dependent apoptotic pathways may be activated in the absence of Necdin. In addition, we found that loss of Necdin decreased the engraftment of AML1-ETO9a(+) hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in transplantation assays. However, Necdin-deficiency did not affect the response of AML1-ETO9a(+) hematopoietic cells to chemotherapy treatment. Thus, Necdin regulates leukemia-initiating cell quiescence and chemotherapy response in a context-dependent manner. Our findings suggest that pharmacological inhibition of Necdin may hold potential as a novel therapy for leukemia patients with MLL translocations.",,"['Yao, Chonghua', 'Kobayashi, Michihiro', 'Chen, Sisi', 'Nabinger, Sarah C', 'Gao, Rui', 'Liu, Stephen Z', 'Asai, Takashi', 'Liu, Yan']","['Yao C', 'Kobayashi M', 'Chen S', 'Nabinger SC', 'Gao R', 'Liu SZ', 'Asai T', 'Liu Y']","['Department of Rheumatism, Shanghai Municipal Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA.']",['eng'],,"['F32 CA203049/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 DK106846/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR001108/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20170918,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,,,,PMC5675657,,2017/11/21 06:00,2017/11/21 06:01,['2017/11/21 06:00'],"['2017/03/13 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/21 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.20999 [doi]', '20999 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Sep 18;8(50):87607-87622. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.20999. eCollection 2017 Oct 20.,,['NOTNLM'],"['MLL-AF9', 'Necdin', 'chemotherapy', 'leukemia-initiating cells', 'quiescence']",,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declared that no conflicts of interest exists.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Molecular mechanisms for WT1 are, however, incompletely understood. Here, we identify the transcriptional coregulator NAB2 as a target gene of WT1. Analysis of gene expression profiles of leukemic samples revealed a positive correlation between the expression of WT1 and NAB2, as well as a non-zero partial correlation. Overexpression of WT1 in hematopoietic cells resulted in increased NAB2 levels, while suppression of WT1 decreased NAB2 expression. WT1 bound and transactivated the proximal NAB2 promoter, as shown by ChIP and reporter experiments, respectively. ChIP experiments also revealed that WT1 can recruit NAB2 to the IRF8 promoter, thus modulating the transcriptional activity of WT1, as shown by reporter experiments.

Many lead to neutropenia, leaving patients at risk of life-threatening infections and result in bad outcomes. New treatment options are needed to improve overall survival. We previously showed that GZD824, a novel BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has anti-tumor activity in Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) chronic myeloid leukemia cells and tumor models. Here, we show that GZD824 decreases cell viability, induces cell-cycle arrest, and causes apoptosis in pre-B ALL cells. Furthermore, Ph- pre-B ALL cells were more sensitive to GZD824 than Ph+ pre-B ALL cells. GZD824 consistently reduced tumor loads in Ph- pre-B ALL xenografts but failed to suppress Ph+ pre-B ALL xenografts. GZD824 decreased phosphorylation of SRC kinase, STAT3, RB and C-myc. It also downregulated the expression of BCL-XL, CCND1 and CDK4 and upregulated expression of CCKN1A. Expression of IRS1 was decreased in GZD824-treated pre-B ALL cells, blocking the PI3K/AKT pathway.

Since TERT deregulation is a common step in leukaemia, treatments targeting telomerase might be useful for the therapy of hematologic malignancies.

We recently demonstrated that the adoptive transfer of T cell transduced with an HLA-A2-restricted T-cell receptor (TCR), which recognize human TERT with high avidity, controls human B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL) progression without severe side-effects in humanized mice. In the present report, we show the ability of our approach to limit the progression of more aggressive leukemic pathologies, such as acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL).

The breakpoint cluster region-ABL proto-oncogene 1 (BCR-ABL) rearrangement leads to a p210 chimeric protein in typical chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), whereas 17-25% of patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia and 0.9-3% patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) carry a p190(BCR-ABL) fusion protein. Cases of patients with AML/CML carrying two specific primary molecular changes, BCR-ABL and core binding factor-beta-myosin heavy chain 11 (CBFbeta-MYH11) fusion genes have been rarely reported. The present study aimed to understand the nature and mechanism of this particular type of leukemia through case reports and literature review. A total of four patients who were diagnosed as AML/CML with BCR-ABL and CBFbeta-MYH11 fusion genes in the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University (Suzhou, China) between January 2004 and December 2012 were examined. Morphological analysis of bone marrow cells, flow cytometry, quantitative polymerase chain reaction of p(210BCR-ABL) and CBFbeta-MYH11 transcripts as well as cytogenetic and fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses were performed. A total of 4 patients who exhibited fusion of p(210BCR-ABL) and CBFbeta-MYH11 were identified. A single patient (case 1) was first diagnosed CML-acute phase (AP), which progressed rapidly to CML-blast crisis (BC), and three patients (cases 2, 3 and 4) were diagnosed with AML with bone marrow eosinophilia at first presentation with no evidence of previous onset of CML. All cases achieved remission following conventional chemotherapy/hematological stem cell transplantation combined with the inhibitor of tyrosine kinase (TKI) maintenance therapy. The patients with CML carrying and expressing BCR-ABL and CBFbeta-MYH11 fusion genes appeared more likely to rapidly progress to AP or BC. Therefore, the product of the CBFbeta-MYH11 fusion gene may serve an important role in the transformation of CML. The co-expression of p(210BCR-ABL) and CBFbeta-MYH11 fusion genes in myeloid leukemia may be a molecular event occurring not only during the development of CML, but also in AML.",,"['Wang, Yuan-Yuan', 'Ding, Wen-Jing', 'Jiang, Feng', 'Chen, Zi-Xing', 'Cen, Jian-Nong', 'Qi, Xiao-Fei', 'Liang, Jian-Ying', 'Liu, Dan-Dan', 'Pan, Jin-Lan', 'Chen, Su-Ning']","['Wang YY', 'Ding WJ', 'Jiang F', 'Chen ZX', 'Cen JN', 'Qi XF', 'Liang JY', 'Liu DD', 'Pan JL', 'Chen SN']","['Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, Suzhou, Jiangsu 215006, P.R.

Although HGBL-MBR is frequently found in cases with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or Burkitt lymphoma-like B-cell lymphoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)-like disease of HGBL-MBR (AL-HGBL-MBR) has been reported incidentally. Case presentation: A 69-year-old Japanese woman developed remittent fever and increasing systemic bone pain. The bone marrow examination revealed that more than 90% of nuclear cells were blastoid cells, which were positive for CD10, CD19, CD20, and surface IgMkappa and negative for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT). Cytogenetic studies confirmed that the patient had de novo AL-HGBL-MBR with the extra copies of MYC and loss of chromosome 17p. She showed resistance to chemoimmunotherapy and died seven months after the diagnosis. The literature review identified further 47 de novo AL-HGBL-MBR cases within the last 32 years. The median age was 61 years (range, 27 - 86); the male/female ratio was 2.0. Thirty-eight cases (79%) presented a clinical picture of ALL at diagnosis; 14 (36%) of 39 available cases showed central nervous system involvement. Loss of 17p and translocations at 2p12-13, 3q27, 9p13 were frequently observed as additional cytogenetic abnormalities. Although the median survival of 46 available cases was only five months (range, 0.1-18), rituximab use significantly improved the survival of AL-HGBL-MBR (log-rank test, P = 0.0294). Conclusion: Our patient and most reported de novo AL-HGBL-MBR cases showed resistance to conventional chemoimmunotherapy and disastrous consequences. AL-HGBL-MBL is a rare, but should be considered a distinct clinical condition in HGBL-MBR.

However, the molecular basis underlying cooperation between transcription factor expression and additional oncogenic mutations in driving T-ALL has been difficult to assess due to limited robust T-cell model systems. Here we utilize a new ex vivo pro-T-cell model to study oncogenic cooperation. Using a systems biological approach we first dissect the pro-T-cell signaling network driven by interleukin-7, stem cell factor and Notch1 and identify key downstream Akt, Stat, E2f and Myc genetic signaling networks. Next, this pro-T-cell system was used to demonstrate that ectopic expression of the TAL1 transcription factor and Pten deletion are bona-fide cooperating events resulting in an increased stem cell signature, upregulation of a specific E2f signaling network and metabolic reprogramming with higher influx of glucose carbons into the tricarboxylic acid cycle.

We aimed to explore the association between remission status and PROs 6-12 months following induction chemotherapy. METHODS: Forty-two patients completed three validated instruments characterizing symptom burden (Patient Care Monitor v2.0), distress (NCCN Distress Thermometer), and QOL (FACT-Leu), as part of a longitudinal observational study. We used regression models to explore the relationship between remission status and PROs, and explore differences by initial disease type (de novo versus secondary/relapsed AML). RESULTS: Those with secondary or relapsed AML at study onset had marked impairments in all measures compared to de novo AML patients. After 6 months, their mean distress score was 4.8 (> 4.0 warrants intervention), they reported a mean of 14.1 moderate/severe symptoms and had a mean QOL score of 113.6, compared to 1.0, 1.7, and 155.2, respectively, for those with de novo AML (p < .0001). Similarly, patients in relapse had a mean distress score of 5.3, a mean of 12.8 moderate/severe symptoms, and a mean QOL score of 113.4, compared to 1.8, 5.7, and 143.8, respectively, among those in remission (p < .005). These patterns persisted after adjusting for baseline differences (p < .0001). CONCLUSION: Remission is associated with markedly better patient well-being in AML. Patients with secondary or relapsed AML face more severe symptom burden, distress, and QOL issues after induction. Interventions are needed to improve AML patients' experiences of illness.",,"['Kayastha, Neha', 'Wolf, Steven P', 'Locke, Susan C', 'Samsa, Gregory P', 'El-Jawahri, Areej', 'LeBlanc, Thomas W']","['Kayastha N', 'Wolf SP', 'Locke SC', 'Samsa GP', 'El-Jawahri A', 'LeBlanc TW']","['Duke University School of Medicine, Box: DUMC 2927, Durham, NC, 27703, USA.', 'Duke Cancer Institute, Box: DUMC 2715, Durham, NC, 27710, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Duke University Medical Center, 2424 Erwin Road, Suite 1102 Hock Plaza Box 2721, Durham, NC, 27710, USA.', 'Duke Cancer Institute, Box: DUMC 2715, Durham, NC, 27710, USA.', 'Duke Cancer Institute, Box: DUMC 2715, Durham, NC, 27710, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Duke University Medical Center, 2424 Erwin Road, Suite 1102 Hock Plaza Box 2721, Durham, NC, 27710, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, 55 Fruit Street, Yawkey 9E, Boston, MA, 02114, USA.', 'Duke University School of Medicine, Box: DUMC 2927, Durham, NC, 27703, USA. thomas.leblanc@duke.edu.', 'Duke Cancer Institute, Box: DUMC 2715, Durham, NC, 27710, USA. thomas.leblanc@duke.edu.', 'Duke University School of Medicine, Box 2715, DUMC, Durham, NC, 27710, USA. thomas.leblanc@duke.edu.']",['eng'],,"['UL1 TR001117/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', '128776-MRSG-15-185-01-PCSM/American Cancer Society', 'UL1TR001117/Foundation for the National Institutes of Health']",['Journal Article'],20171118,Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,,IM,,"['Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Patient Reported Outcome Measures', 'Quality of Life/*psychology', 'Remission Induction/*methods']",PMC5921898,['NIHMS960743'],2017/11/21 06:00,2019/01/31 06:00,['2017/11/20 06:00'],"['2017/09/05 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/31 06:00 [medline]', '2017/11/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00520-017-3973-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s00520-017-3973-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2018 May;26(5):1437-1445. doi: 10.1007/s00520-017-3973-4.

It contains a furan group at the A-ring of the core isoflavone structure and can inhibit the activity of glyoxalase I, an enzyme that catalyzes the detoxification of methylglyoxal (MG), a by-product of glycolysis. In the present study, we found that erypoegin K has a potent cytotoxic effect on human leukemia HL-60 cells. Its cytotoxic effect was much stronger than that of a known glyoxalase I inhibitor S-p-bromobenzylglutathione cyclopentyl diester. Conversely, erypoegin K demonstrated weak cytotoxicity toward normal human peripheral lymphocytes. The treatment of HL-60 cells with erypoegin K significantly induced caspase-3 activity, whereas the pretreatment of the cells with caspase-3 inhibitor suppressed erypoegin K-induced cell death. Furthermore, nuclear condensation and apoptotic genome DNA fragmentation were observed in erypoegin K-treated HL-60 cells.

We retrospectively analyzed data of 36 patients with hematological (n = 35) or molecular relapse (n = 1) of acute myeloid leukemia (AML, n = 29) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS, n = 7) collected from 6 German transplant centers. Patients were treated with a median of 2 cycles DAC (range, 1 to 11).

In 22 patients (61%), a median of 2 DLI per patient (range, 1 to 5) was administered in addition to DAC. As a result, overall response rate was 25% including 6 complete remissions (CR, 17%) and 3 partial remissions (PR, 8%). Three patients within the first-line group achieved CR, while also 3 patients receiving DAC as second-line treatment reached CR including 2 patients with previous Aza failure. Median duration of CR was 10 months (range, 2 to 33) and no patient relapsed so far. The 2-year OS rate was 11% (+/- 6%) without any difference between first-line and pretreated patients. Incidence of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease was 19 and 5%.

The aims of this study were to investigate the efficacy and safety of dasatinib in Japanese patients and to explore the factors that affect the achievement of molecular responses. METHODS: The primary endpoint was a major molecular response (MMR) by 12 months. The halving time for BCR-ABL1 transcripts was calculated using transcript levels. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients with chronic-phase CML (CML-CP) were enrolled and 30 received 100 mg dasatinib once daily. At 24 months of follow-up, 21 (72%) and 24 (83%) patients achieved an MMR by 12 and 24 months, respectively; the rates of a deep molecular response (DMR) by 12 and 24 months were 48 and 59%, respectively. A shorter halving time of BCR-ABL1 transcripts (</=10.6 days) accurately predicted both an MMR and a DMR. The incidence of pleural effusion was 50%. Our study reconfirmed the efficacy and safety of dasatinib treatment in Japanese patients with newly diagnosed CML-CP. In addition, the usefulness of the halving time of BCR-ABL1 transcripts was validated. CONCLUSION: These data emphasize the significance of an early treatment response in achieving a DMR during dasatinib therapy.","['(c) 2017 S.

However, the clinical implications of DOK1/2 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remain largely unknown. To investigate the clinical significance, real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) was carried out to detect DOK1/2 expressions in 125 de novo AML patients and 28 healthy controls. Real-time quantitative methylation-specific PCR (RQ-MSP) and bisulfite sequencing PCR (BSP) were applied to detect DOK1/2 methylation level and density. DOK1/2 expressions were significantly down-regulated in AML patients. The promoters of DOK1/2 were highly hypermethylated and negatively correlated with DOK1/2 expressions in AML patients. In addition, we also confirmed that DOK1/2 expressions could be restored by DOK1/2 demethylation using 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine in leukemia cell line THP-1. Survival analyses showed that low-expressed DOK1/2 were associated with markedly shorter overall survival and leukemia free survival in both whole-cohort AML and non-M3 AML patients. Multivariate analyses further revealed that DOK1/2 were act as independent prognostic factors in AML patients. These findings indicate that decreased DOK1/2 expressions associated with their promoter hypermethylations predict adverse prognosis in AML.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['He, Pin-Fang', 'Xu, Zi-Jun', 'Zhou, Jing-Dong', 'Li, Xi-Xi', 'Zhang, Wei', 'Wu, De-Hong', 'Zhang, Zhi-Hui', 'Lian, Xin-Yue', 'Yao, Xin-Yu', 'Deng, Zhao-Qun', 'Lin, Jiang', 'Qian, Jun']","['He PF', 'Xu ZJ', 'Zhou JD', 'Li XX', 'Zhang W', 'Wu DH', 'Zhang ZH', 'Lian XY', 'Yao XY', 'Deng ZQ', 'Lin J', 'Qian J']","[""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, P.R.

Hypersensitivity reactions are the most frequent and may lead to early discontinuation of treatment. The present study aimed to investigate suspicions of adverse reactions during the infusion of asparaginase in a pediatric cohort. METHODS: A retrospective observational study was carried out at a university pediatric institute in the state of Rio de Janeiro. Information regarding clinical features and characteristics of adverse reactions was collected from hospital medical records. Suspicions of adverse reactions were classified regarding causality and severity. RESULTS: Seventy-three suspicions of adverse reactions were recorded during asparaginase infusion in 72 children in the study period. Allergic hypersensitivity reactions were suspected in 60.5% of the cases. Of these, 25% of the reactions occurred during induction and 61.1% in concomitant use with vincristine, findings that diverge from other studies. High-risk classification and younger age were considered risk factors for these reactions. A total of 72.4% of the reactions were classified as grade 1 or 2, which suggest that not all are related to antibody formation; this highlights the importance of differential diagnosis with other reactions, such as non-allergic hypersensitivity and hyperammonemia. CONCLUSION: The implementation of the differential diagnosis of reactions related to infusion of asparaginase with ammonia dosage and classification of the grade of reactions is crucial to facilitate the identification and proper management of each type of reaction.",['Copyright (c) 2017.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Hospital records of 67 patients, who underwent allogeneic HSCT for ALL, were analyzed retrospectively for microbiologically documented infection: bacterial infection (BI), viral infection (VI), and fungal infection (FI). The majority of patients (40/67; 59.7%) underwent HSCT from matched unrelated donors (MUD). RESULTS: In total, 84 BI in 31 patients, 93 VI in 50 patients, and 27 FI in 22 patients were diagnosed. No differences were found in the frequency of occurrence of BI according to the type of transplant (P = .16); the occurrence of VI was statistically more frequent in MUD transplant recipients as compared with matched sibling donors (MSD) and mismatched related donors (MMFD; P = .001) and there was a trend in MUD patients for the higher occurrence of FI in comparison with MSD and MMFD transplants (P = .08). Regarding disease status, the occurrence of BI, VI, and FI was statistically more frequent in children who underwent transplantation in their first complete remission (CR1), rather than those who underwent transplantation in >/=CR2 (P < .05). In conclusion, infectious complications are an important cause of morbidity in children with ALL treated with allogeneic HSCT and the incidence of infections is high in this group of patients.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The outcomes of FeLV infection in domestic cats vary according to host susceptibility, virus strain, and infectious challenge dose. Jaguarundis (Puma yagouaroundi) are small wild felids from South and Central America. We previously reported on FeLV infections in jaguarundis. We hypothesized here that the outcomes of FeLV infection in P. yagouaroundi mimic those observed in domestic cats. The aim of this study was to investigate the population of jaguarundis at Fundacao Parque Zoologico de Sao Paulo for natural FeLV infection and resulting outcomes. METHODS: We investigated the jaguarundis using serological and molecular methods and monitored them for FeLV-related diseases for 5 years. We retrieved relevant biological and clinical information for the entire population of 23 jaguarundis held at zoo. Post-mortem findings from necropsies were recorded and histopathological and immunohistopathological analyses were performed. Sequencing and phylogenetic analyses were performed for FeLV-positive samples. For sample prevalence, 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Fisher's exact test was used to compare frequencies between infected and uninfected animals. P-values <0.05 were considered significant. RESULTS: In total, we detected evidence of FeLV exposure in four out of 23 animals (17%; 95% CI 5-39%). No endogenous FeLV (enFeLV) sequences were detected. An intestinal B-cell lymphoma in one jaguarundi was not associated with FeLV. Two jaguarundis presented FeLV test results consistent with an abortive FeLV infection with seroconversion, and two other jaguarundis had results consistent with a progressive infection and potentially FeLV-associated clinical disorders and post-mortem changes. Phylogenetic analysis of env revealed the presence of FeLV-A, a common origin of the virus in both animals (100% identity) and the closest similarity to FeLV-FAIDS and FeLV-3281 (98.4% identity), originally isolated from cats in the USA. CONCLUSIONS: We found evidence of progressive and abortive FeLV infection outcomes in jaguarundis, and domestic cats were probably the source of infection in these jaguarundis.",,"['Filoni, Claudia', 'Helfer-Hungerbuehler, A Katrin', 'Catao-Dias, Jose Luiz', 'Marques, Mara Cristina', 'Torres, Luciana Neves', 'Reinacher, Manfred', 'Hofmann-Lehmann, Regina']","['Filoni C', 'Helfer-Hungerbuehler AK', 'Catao-Dias JL', 'Marques MC', 'Torres LN', 'Reinacher M', 'Hofmann-Lehmann R']","['Institute of Biosciences, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Sao Paulo State University (UNESP), Campus Botucatu, Rua Professor Doutor Antonio Celso Wagner Zanin SN, Botucatu, Sao Paulo, 18618-689, Brazil. claudiafiloni@gmail.com.', 'Vetsuisse Faculty, Clinical Laboratory and Center for Clinical Studies, University of Zurich, Winterthurerstrasse 260, 8057, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'School of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Sciences, Department of Pathology, University of Sao Paulo (USP), Av.

Bcr-Abl protein depletion is considered as a way to overcome drug resistance to TKIs. In our study, Chk1 inhibitors, AZD7762 and MK-8776, had strong antitumor effects on CML cell line KBM5 and imatinib-resistant form KBM5(T315I). Moreover, Chk1 inhibitors showed a strong cytotoxic effect on leukemia cells from primary CML and imatinib-resistance CML patients, but low cytotoxic effect on normal human mononuclear cells. Then, we found that Chk1 inhibitors induced apoptosis and increased DNA damage in CML cell lines with the degradation of the Bcr-Abl protein. Using the proteasome inhibitor and an immunoprecipitation assay, we found that Chk1 inhibitors triggered the degradation of Bcr-Abl through ubiquitination, which is depending on E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP. At last, MK-8776 showed a significant tumor-suppressive effect of KBM5(T315I) cell in xenograft tumor models.

TCTP has an important role for cell cycle and normal development. On the other side, tumor reversion and malignant transformation have been associated with TCTP. TCTP has been found among the 12 genes that are differentially expressed during mouse oocyte maturation, and an overexpression of this gene was reported in a wide variety of different cancer types. Its antiapoptotic effect is indicated by the interaction with several proapoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family and the p53 tumor suppressor protein. In this article, we draw attention to the role of TCTP in cancer, especially, focusing on cell differentiation and tumor reversion, a biological process by which highly tumorigenic cells lose their malignant phenotype. This protein has been shown to be the most strongly downregulated protein in revertant cells compared to the parental cancer cells. Decreased expression of TCTP results either in the reprogramming of cancer cells into reversion or apoptosis. As conventional chemotherapy is frequently associated with the development of drug resistance and high toxicity, the urge for the development of new or additional scientific approaches falls into place. Differentiation therapy aims at reinducing differentiation backward to the nonmalignant cellular state. Here, different approaches have been reported such as the induction of retinoid pathways and the use of histone deacetylase inhibitors. Also, PPARgamma agonists and the activation of the vitamin D receptor have been reported as potential targets in differentiation therapy. As TCTP is known as the histamine-releasing factor, antihistaminic drugs have been shown to target this protein. Antihistaminic compounds, hydroxyzine and promethazine, inhibited cell growth of cancer cells and decreased TCTP expression of breast cancer and leukemia cells. Recently, we found that two antihistaminics, levomepromazine and buclizine, inhibited cancer cell growth by direct binding to TCTP and induction of cell differentiation. These data confirmed that TCTP is an exquisite target for anticancer differentiation therapy and antihistaminics have potential to be lead compounds for the direct interaction with TCTP as new inhibitors of human TCTP and tumor growth.",,"['Seo, Ean-Jeong', 'Fischer, Nicolas', 'Efferth, Thomas']","['Seo EJ', 'Fischer N', 'Efferth T']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Institute of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, Johannes Gutenberg University, Staudinger Weg 5, 55128, Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Institute of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, Johannes Gutenberg University, Staudinger Weg 5, 55128, Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Institute of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, Johannes Gutenberg University, Staudinger Weg 5, 55128, Mainz, Germany. efferth@uni-mainz.de.']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],,Germany,Results Probl Cell Differ,Results and problems in cell differentiation,0173555,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Histamine Antagonists)', '0 (TPT1 protein, human)', '0 (Tpt1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tumor Protein, Translationally-Controlled 1)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Histamine Antagonists/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Tumor Protein, Translationally-Controlled 1']",,,2017/11/18 06:00,2019/07/20 06:00,['2017/11/18 06:00'],"['2017/11/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/11/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-3-319-67591-6_14 [doi]'],ppublish,Results Probl Cell Differ. 2017;64:263-281. doi: 10.1007/978-3-319-67591-6_14.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cell development', 'Histaminic drugs', 'Tumor reversion']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Back in 2000, we discovered TCTP in two quite different ways: first, we looked at protein partners of TSAP6 and one of them was TCTP. Then, in collaboration with Sidney Brenner, we performed a high-throughput differential screening comparing the parental cancer cells with revertants. The results indicated that TCTP was of the most differentially expressed genes. These two approaches were carried out only months apart. They guided our research and led to the discoveries of drugs that inhibit the function of TCTP. Much of the preclinical data on sertraline as an inhibitor of TCTP in cancer were obtained with Judith Karp at Johns Hopkins. This drug is now given in combination with Ara-C to patients in a phase I clinical trial for Acute Myeloid Leukemia.

In this population-based case-control study, we identified 32,000 patients with lymphoid neoplasms, diagnosed at ages 0-79 years during the period 1987-2011, and 160,000 matched controls in Sweden. Using prospectively registered data on their first-degree relatives, we evaluated the impact of parental age on the risk of lymphoid neoplasms by subtype. Overall, each 5-year increment in maternal age was associated with a 3% increase in incidence of offspring lymphoid neoplasms (hazard ratio = 1.03, 95% confidence interval: 1.02, 1.04). The association was similar for paternal age and present even among individuals older than 70 years of age at diagnosis. Stratified analyses further revealed that the association was limited to certain subtypes, mostly of indolent nature. Risks of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, follicular lymphoma, and mantle cell lymphoma were 5%-10% higher per 5-year increment in maternal age, but no associations were observed for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, plasma cell neoplasms, or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. These findings indicated that prenatal genetic or epigenetic changes influence risk of adult lymphoid neoplasms and suggest a difference in this association between aggressive and indolent lymphoma subtypes.","['(c) The Author(s) 2017.

29148893,NLM,MEDLINE,20190715,20190715,1527-7755 (Electronic) 0732-183X (Linking),36,3,2018 Jan 20,Reduced-Intensity Delayed Intensification in Standard-Risk Pediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Defined by Undetectable Minimal Residual Disease: Results of an International Randomized Trial (AIEOP-BFM ALL 2000).,244-253,10.1200/JCO.2017.74.4946 [doi],"Purpose Delayed intensification (DI) is an integral part of treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), but it is associated with relevant toxicity. Therefore, standard-risk patients of trial AIEOP-BFM ALL 2000 (Combination Chemotherapy Based on Risk of Relapse in Treating Young Patients With ALL) were investigated with the specific aim to reduce treatment intensity. Patients and Methods Between July 2000 and July 2006, 1,164 patients (1 to 17 years of age) with standard-risk ALL (defined as the absence of high-risk cytogenetics and undetectable minimal residual disease on days 33 and 78) were randomly assigned to either experimental reduced-intensity DI (protocol III; P-III) or standard DI (protocol II; P-II). Cumulative drug doses of P-III were reduced by 30% for dexamethasone and 50% for vincristine, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide, which shortened the treatment duration from 49 to 29 days. The study aimed at noninferiority of reduced-intensity P-III; analyses were performed according to treatment given. Results For P-III and P-II, respectively, the 8-year rate of disease-free survival (+/- SE) was 89.2 +/- 1.3% and 92.3 +/- 1.2% ( P = .04); cumulative incidence of relapse, 8.7 +/- 1.2% and 6.4 +/- 1.1% ( P = .09); and overall survival, 96.1 +/- 0.8% and 98.0 +/- 0.6% ( P = .06). Patients with ETV6-RUNX1-positive ALL and patients 1 to 6 years of age performed equally well in both arms. The incidence of death during remission was comparable, which indicates equivalent toxicity. The 8-year cumulative incidence rate of secondary malignancies was 1.3 +/- 0.5% and 0.6 +/- 0.4% for P-III and P-II, respectively ( P = .37). Conclusion Although the criteria used for the standard-risk definition in this trial identified patients with exceptionally good prognosis, reduction of chemotherapy was not successful mainly because of an increased rate of relapse. The data suggest that treatment reduction is feasible in specific subgroups, which underlines the biologic heterogeneity of this cohort selected according to treatment response.",,"['Schrappe, Martin', 'Bleckmann, Kirsten', 'Zimmermann, Martin', 'Biondi, Andrea', 'Moricke, Anja', 'Locatelli, Franco', 'Cario, Gunnar', 'Rizzari, Carmelo', 'Attarbaschi, Andishe', 'Valsecchi, Maria Grazia', 'Bartram, Claus R', 'Barisone, Elena', 'Niggli, Felix', 'Niemeyer, Charlotte', 'Testi, Anna Maria', 'Mann, Georg', 'Ziino, Ottavio', 'Schafer, Beat', 'Panzer-Grumayer, Renate', 'Beier, Rita', 'Parasole, Rosanna', 'Gohring, Gudrun', 'Ludwig, Wolf-Dieter', 'Casale, Fiorina', 'Schlegel, Paul-Gerhardt', 'Basso, Giuseppe', 'Conter, Valentino']","['Schrappe M', 'Bleckmann K', 'Zimmermann M', 'Biondi A', 'Moricke A', 'Locatelli F', 'Cario G', 'Rizzari C', 'Attarbaschi A', 'Valsecchi MG', 'Bartram CR', 'Barisone E', 'Niggli F', 'Niemeyer C', 'Testi AM', 'Mann G', 'Ziino O', 'Schafer B', 'Panzer-Grumayer R', 'Beier R', 'Parasole R', 'Gohring G', 'Ludwig WD', 'Casale F', 'Schlegel PG', 'Basso G', 'Conter V']","[""Martin Schrappe, Kirsten Bleckmann, Anja Moricke, and Gunnar Cario, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Kiel; Martin Zimmermann and Gudrun Gohring, Hannover Medical School, Hannover; Claus R.

The interconnection between the JAK-STAT pathway, epigenetic regulation or DNA damage control is still poorly understood in cancer cell biology. Areas covered: Here, we focus on a broader description of mutational insights into myeloproliferative neoplasms and peripheral T-cell leukemia and lymphomas, since sequencing efforts have identified similar combinations of driver mutations in these diseases covering different lineages. We summarize how these pathways might be interconnected in normal or cancer cells, which have lost differentiation capacity and drive oncogene transcription. Expert opinion: Due to similarities in driver mutations including epigenetic enzymes, JAK-STAT pathway activation and mutated checkpoint control through TP53, we hypothesize that similar therapeutic approaches could be of benefit in these diseases. We give an overview of how driver mutations in these malignancies contribute to hematopoietic cancer initiation or progression, and how these pathways can be targeted with currently available tools.",,"['Orlova, Anna', 'Wingelhofer, Bettina', 'Neubauer, Heidi A', 'Maurer, Barbara', 'Berger-Becvar, Angelika', 'Keseru, Gyorgy Miklos', 'Gunning, Patrick T', 'Valent, Peter', 'Moriggl, Richard']","['Orlova A', 'Wingelhofer B', 'Neubauer HA', 'Maurer B', 'Berger-Becvar A', 'Keseru GM', 'Gunning PT', 'Valent P', 'Moriggl R']","['a Institute of Animal Breeding and Genetics , University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna , Vienna , Austria.', 'b Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Cancer Research , Vienna , Austria.', 'a Institute of Animal Breeding and Genetics , University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna , Vienna , Austria.', 'b Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Cancer Research , Vienna , Austria.', 'a Institute of Animal Breeding and Genetics , University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna , Vienna , Austria.', 'b Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Cancer Research , Vienna , Austria.', 'c Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology , University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna , Vienna , Austria.', 'g Department of Chemical & Physical Sciences , University of Toronto Mississauga , Mississauga , Canada.', 'h Department of Chemistry , University of Toronto , Toronto , Canada.', 'd Medicinal Chemistry Research Group, Research Centre for Natural Sciences , Hungarian Academy of Sciences , Budapest , Hungary.', 'g Department of Chemical & Physical Sciences , University of Toronto Mississauga , Mississauga , Canada.', 'h Department of Chemistry , University of Toronto , Toronto , Canada.', 'e Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology , Medical University of Vienna , Vienna , Austria.', 'f Ludwig Boltzmann-Cluster Oncology , Medical University of Vienna , Vienna , Austria.', 'a Institute of Animal Breeding and Genetics , University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna , Vienna , Austria.', 'b Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Cancer Research , Vienna , Austria.', 'i Medical University Vienna , Vienna , Austria.']",['eng'],,"['497203/CIHR/Canada', '495468/CIHR/Canada']","['Journal Article', 'Review', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171124,England,Expert Opin Ther Targets,Expert opinion on therapeutic targets,101127833,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (STAT Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'DNA Damage/genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinases/metabolism', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Peripheral/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'STAT Transcription Factors/metabolism']",PMC5743003,,2017/11/18 06:00,2017/12/28 06:00,['2017/11/18 06:00'],"['2017/11/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/28 06:00 [medline]', '2017/11/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/14728222.2018.1406924 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Ther Targets. 2018 Jan;22(1):45-57. doi: 10.1080/14728222.2018.1406924.

In this study, seven kinds of CDMW were found to decrease degranulation and histamine release in immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated rat basophilic leukemia (RBL)-2H3 cells. The production of cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-4) was inhibited by these CDMW in RBL-2H3 cells, and their chemical structures were established mainly based on detailed analysis of their NMR spectra. CDMW-3, CDMW-5, and CDMW-15 were further demonstrated to block mast cell-dependent passive cutaneous anaphylaxis in IgE-sensitized mice. Bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) were established to clarify the effect of CDMW-3, CDMW-5, and CDMW-15 on mast cells. The seven kinds of CDMW decreased the degranulation and histamine release of BMMCs. Furthermore, flow cytometry results indicated that CDMW-3, CDMW-5, and CDMW-15 increased the annexin(+) cell population of BMMCs.

Patients usually die within days to months, even after receiving prompt therapeutic management. Here we performed the first comprehensive study of ANKL by integrating whole genome, transcriptome and targeted sequencing, cytokine array as well as functional assays. Mutations in the JAK-STAT pathway were identified in 48% (14/29) of ANKL patients, while the extracellular STAT3 stimulator IL10 was elevated by an average of 56-fold (P < 0.0001) in the plasma of all patients examined. Additional frequently mutated genes included TP53 (34%), TET2 (28%), CREBBP (21%) and MLL2 (21%). Patient NK leukemia cells showed prominent activation of STAT3 phosphorylation, MYC expression and transcriptional activities in multiple metabolic pathways. Functionally, STAT3 activation and MYC expression were critical for the proliferation and survival of ANKL cells. STAT signaling regulated the MYC transcription program, and both STAT signaling and MYC transcription were required to maintain the activation of nucleotide synthesis and glycolysis. Collectively, the JAK-STAT pathway represents a major target for genomic alterations and IL10 stimulation in ANKL. This newly discovered JAK/STAT-MYC-biosynthesis axis may provide opportunities for the development of novel therapeutic strategies in treating this subtype of leukemia.",,"['Huang, Liang', 'Liu, Dan',

Large cohorts of sAML to MPN are difficult to obtain and there is very little scientific literature or prospective trials for determining robust prognostic markers and efficient treatments. We analyzed event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) of 73 patients with MPN who progressed to sAML, based on their epidemiological characteristics, the preexisting MPN, the different treatments received, the different prognostic groups and the responses achieved according to the ELN, and their mutational status determined by next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS). For 24 patients, we were able to do a comparative NGS analysis at both MPN and sAML phase. After acute transformation EFS and OS were respectively of 2.9 months (range: 0-48.1) and 4.7 months (range: 0.1-58.8). No difference in EFS or OS regarding the previous MPN, the ELN2017 prognostic classification, the first-line therapy or the response was found. After univariate analysis, three genes, TP53, SRSF2 and TET2, impacted pejoratively sAML prognosis at sAML time. In multivariate analysis, TP53 (P = .0001), TET2 (P = .011) and SRSF2 (P = .018) remained independent prognostic factors. Time to sAML transformation was shorter in SRSF2-mutated patients (51.2 months, range: 14.7-98) than in SRSF2-unmutated patients (133.8 months, range: 12.6-411.2) (P < .001). Conventional clinical factors (age, karyotype, ELN2017 prognostic classification, treatments received, treatments response, Allo-SCT...) failed to predict the patients' outcome. Only the mutational status appeared relevant to predict patients' prognosis at sAML phase.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Venton, Geoffroy', 'Courtier, Frederic', 'Charbonnier, Aude', ""D'incan, Evelyne"", 'Saillard, Colombe', 'Mohty, Bilal', 'Mozziconacci, Marie-Joelle', 'Birnbaum, Daniel', 'Murati, Anne', 'Vey, Norbert', 'Rey, Jerome']","['Venton G', 'Courtier F', 'Charbonnier A', ""D'incan E"", 'Saillard C', 'Mohty B', 'Mozziconacci MJ', 'Birnbaum D', 'Murati A', 'Vey N', 'Rey J']","[""Departement d'Hematologie, Institut Paoli-Calmettes (IPC), 13009, Marseille."", 'Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille, (CRCM), Inserm, U1068, CNRS UMR7258, 13009, Marseille.', 'Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille, (CRCM), Inserm, U1068, CNRS UMR7258, 13009, Marseille.', ""Departement d'Oncologie Moleculaire, Institut Paoli-Calmettes (IPC), 13009, Marseille."", 'Aix-Marseille Universite, UM 105, Marseille, F-13284, France.', ""Departement d'Hematologie, Institut Paoli-Calmettes (IPC), 13009, Marseille."", ""Departement d'Hematologie, Institut Paoli-Calmettes (IPC), 13009, Marseille."", ""Departement d'Hematologie, Institut Paoli-Calmettes (IPC), 13009, Marseille."", ""Departement d'Hematologie, Institut Paoli-Calmettes (IPC), 13009, Marseille."", 'Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille, (CRCM), Inserm, U1068, CNRS UMR7258, 13009, Marseille.', ""Departement d'Oncologie Moleculaire, Institut Paoli-Calmettes (IPC), 13009, Marseille."", 'Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille, (CRCM), Inserm, U1068, CNRS UMR7258, 13009, Marseille.', ""Departement d'Oncologie Moleculaire, Institut Paoli-Calmettes (IPC), 13009, Marseille."", 'Aix-Marseille Universite, UM 105, Marseille, F-13284, France.', 'Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille, (CRCM), Inserm, U1068, CNRS UMR7258, 13009, Marseille.', ""Departement d'Oncologie Moleculaire, Institut Paoli-Calmettes (IPC), 13009, Marseille."", 'Aix-Marseille Universite, UM 105, Marseille, F-13284, France.', ""Departement d'Hematologie, Institut Paoli-Calmettes (IPC), 13009, Marseille."", 'Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille, (CRCM), Inserm, U1068, CNRS UMR7258, 13009, Marseille.', 'Aix-Marseille Universite, UM 105, Marseille, F-13284, France.', ""Departement d'Hematologie, Institut Paoli-Calmettes (IPC), 13009, Marseille."", 'Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille, (CRCM), Inserm, U1068, CNRS UMR7258, 13009, Marseille.']",['eng'],,,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171206,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '147153-65-9 (SRSF2 protein, human)', '170974-22-8 (Serine-Arginine Splicing Factors)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Dioxygenases)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (TET2 protein, human)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Allografts', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Dioxygenases', 'Female', '*Genes, Neoplasm', 'Genes, p53', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/genetics/*pathology', 'Palliative Care', 'Precancerous Conditions/genetics/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Progression-Free Survival', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Serine-Arginine Splicing Factors/genetics', 'Survival Analysis']",,,2017/11/18 06:00,2019/04/26 06:00,['2017/11/18 06:00'],"['2017/11/02 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/08 00:00 [revised]', '2017/11/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/26 06:00 [medline]', '2017/11/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.24973 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2018 Mar;93(3):330-338. doi: 10.1002/ajh.24973.

The synthesized compounds were structurally verified by IR, (1) H NMR, (13) C NMR, mass spectra, and elemental analyses. The antitumor activity of the synthesized compounds was evaluated through DNA binding assays and the 60-cell line panel according to the US NCI-DTP protocol or a selection of human tumor cell lines: breast cancer (MCF-7), liver cancer (HepG-2), and colorectal cancer (HCT-116). Most of the compounds had better DNA/ethidium bromide fluorescence quenching rather than methyl green displacement, suggesting superior DNA intercalation over DNA groove binding. Compounds 8 and 14b showed the best quenching effect with KSV = 4.27 x 10(5) M(-1) . Moreover, the results for compounds 8, 4c, and 4e revealed a possible dual DNA binding mode with the intercalation to be superior, with KSV 4.27 x 10(5) , 3.96 x 10(5) , and 3.51 x 10(5) M(-1) , respectively, compared to 42%, 45%, and 43% methyl green displacement, respectively. Out of the 60-cell line panel, the leukemia HL-60 cell line was the most susceptible to growth inhibition when treated with 14a, resulting in 61% growth, followed by the lung carcinoma cell line NCI-H522 showing 67% growth when treated with 9.

The aim of this study is to analyse the effectiveness of various RT doses for EMD in the modern treatment era. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between January 2000 and June 2016, 20 patients with total of 45 lesions underwent RT for EMD at our institution. RESULTS: With a median radiation dose of 26 Gy (range 4-42 Gy), local remission could be achieved in 91% of patients (complete remission rate: 71%). The median duration of local control (DOLC) was 17 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.5-33) and the median overall survival (OS) after chloroma onset was 24 months (95% CI 11-38). No noticeable difference between high- and low-dose regimens has been observed (74% versus 68%; P = 0.5). In the multivariate analysis, only Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score and bone marrow state during RT have proven to be determinant for durable local control and OS. CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose RT (</=26 Gy) achieves good local control compared to high-dose regimes. Bone marrow state during RT and ECOG score during RT may play a crucial role, influencing both DOLC and OS.",,"['Oertel, Michael', 'Elsayad, Khaled', 'Haverkamp, Uwe', 'Stelljes, Matthias', 'Eich, Hans Theodor']","['Oertel M', 'Elsayad K', 'Haverkamp U', 'Stelljes M', 'Eich HT']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, University Hospital of Muenster, Albert-Schweitzer-Campus 1, Building A1, 48149, Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University Hospital of Muenster, Albert-Schweitzer-Campus 1, Building A1, 48149, Muenster, Germany. khaled.elsayad@uni-muenster.de.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University Hospital of Muenster, Albert-Schweitzer-Campus 1, Building A1, 48149, Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital of Muenster, Albert-Schweitzer-Campus 1, Building A1, 48149, Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University Hospital of Muenster, Albert-Schweitzer-Campus 1, Building A1, 48149, Muenster, Germany.']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],20171116,Germany,Strahlenther Onkol,Strahlentherapie und Onkologie : Organ der Deutschen Rontgengesellschaft ...

CLL is rarely the cause of solitary bone lesions; such lesions in the context of CLL are believed to result from either Richter's transformation or metastasis from another primary malignancy. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC), on the other hand, is a malignancy which frequently metastasizes to bone and may cause an osteolytic solitary bone lesion. The origin of a solitary bone lesion in a patient with multiple potential primary malignancies has prognostic implications and affects treatment protocol, and as such must be diagnosed accurately. We describe a patient with CLL and a history of RCC who is found to have an incidental solitary bone lesion of the T11 vertebra. After two separate CT-guided biopsies revealed various lymphoid cell predominance and no evidence of RCC, treatment with low dose external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) was employed. Post-therapy MRI showed further propagation of the lesion. Surgical corpectomy was subsequently performed and postoperative pathology of the lesion was consistent with RCC. The patient was treated with bisphosphonates and a higher dose of EBRT.

RAS genes have been elucidated as major participants in the development and progression of cancer. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at H-RAS cDNA position 81 T-->C (rs12628) has been found to be associated with the risk of many human cancers like gastrointestinal, oral, colon, bladder and thyroid carcinomas. Therefore, we hypothesized that this polymorphisms in H-RAS could influence susceptibility to chronic myeloid leukemia as well, and we conducted this study to test the hypothesis in Indian population. Method: H-RAS polymorphism was studied in 100 chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients and 100 healthy controls by restriction fragmentation length polymorphism (RFLP-PCR). Associations between polymorphism and clinicopathological features of CML patients were investigated. Results: In CML patients, the TT, TC and CC genotype frequency was 38%, 61% and 1% respectively, compared to 92%, 8% and 0% in healthy controls respectively. Compared to TT genotype, CT was significantly associated with increased risk of CML (odds ratio (OR): 8.4, P < 0.00001). There was a statistically significant correlation of H-RAS polymorphism with phases (P < 0.0003), molecular response (P < 0.0001), hematological response (P < 0.04) and thrombocytopenia (P < 0.003). However, there was no correlation of this polymorphism found with other clinical parameters. Conclusion: H-RAS T81C polymorphism was found to be associated with CML risk and prognosis of CML. These results suggest that C heterozygosis may be considered a potential risk factor for CML development in the North Indian population.",,"['Mir, Rashid', 'Ah, Imtiyaz', 'Javid, Jamsheed', 'Zuberi, Mariyam', 'Guru, Sameer', 'Mirza, Masroor', 'Farooq, Shazia', 'Yadav, Prasant', 'Ray, Prakash C', 'Gupta, Naresh', 'Saxena, Alpana']","['Mir R', 'Ah I', 'Javid J', 'Zuberi M', 'Guru S', 'Mirza M', 'Farooq S', 'Yadav P', 'Ray PC', 'Gupta N', 'Saxena A']","['Faculty of Applied Medical Sciences, University of Tabuk, Tabuk 71491, Saudi Arabia.', 'These authors contributed equally to this paper.', 'Cancer Genetics Lab, Department of Biochemistry and Associated Hospitals, New Delhi, India.', 'These authors contributed equally to this paper.', 'Cancer Genetics Lab, Department of Biochemistry and Associated Hospitals, New Delhi, India.', 'Cancer Genetics Lab, Department of Biochemistry and Associated Hospitals, New Delhi, India.', 'Cancer Genetics Lab, Department of Biochemistry and Associated Hospitals, New Delhi, India.', 'Cancer Genetics Lab, Department of Biochemistry and Associated Hospitals, New Delhi, India.', 'Cancer Genetics Lab, Department of Biochemistry and Associated Hospitals, New Delhi, India.', 'Cancer Genetics Lab, Department of Biochemistry and Associated Hospitals, New Delhi, India.', 'Cancer Genetics Lab, Department of Biochemistry and Associated Hospitals, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Medicine, Maulana Azad Medical College and Associated Hospitals, New Delhi, India.', 'Cancer Genetics Lab, Department of Biochemistry and Associated Hospitals, New Delhi, India.']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],20150412,Canada,World J Oncol,World journal of oncology,101564097,,,,,PMC5649720,,2015/04/01 00:00,2015/04/01 00:01,['2017/11/18 06:00'],"['2015/04/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.14740/wjon912e [doi]'],ppublish,World J Oncol. 2015 Apr;6(2):321-328. doi: 10.14740/wjon912e.

Methods: A retrospective study of a total of 106 microbiologically febrile episodes in hospitalized adult neutropenic cancer patients, who were admitted from May 2009 to May 2013, at King Fahad Specialist Hospital, Dammam, Saudi Arabia, was conducted. Results: Among 106 microbiologically documented febrile neutropenic episodes, the majority of malignancies were solid tumors accounting for 53.8% (57/106) and hematological malignancies accounted for 46.23% (49/106). The most common malignancies were non-Hodgkin's lymphoma 19.81% (21/106) followed by acute myeloid leukemia 15.09% (16/106), then colorectal cancer 13.21% (14/106), pancreatic cancer and acute lymphoblastic leukemia accounting for 5.66% (6/106) each, multiple myeloma 4.72% (5/106), gall bladder cancer 3.77% (4/106), and lung cancer 2.83% (3/106). A total of 138 bacterial isolates were identified. The overall prevalence of gram-negative bacteria was 65.94% (91/138) and for gram-positive bacteria was 34.06% (47/138). The most common bacterial isolation sites were blood 33.32% (46 isolates), urine 29.71% (41 isolates), wound 19.55% (27 isolates), body fluids 9.41% (13 isolates) and sputum 7.96% (11 isolates). The most predominant pathogens were Escherichia coli 30.43 (42/138), Klebsiella pneumonia 14.49% (20/138), Staphylococcus aureus 13.04% (18/138), Sptreptococcus spp. 7.25% (10/138), Pseudomonas spp. 7.25% (10/138), Enterococcus spp. 5.80% (8/138), Staphylococcus spp. 4.35% (6/138), Corynebacterium spp. 3.62% (5/138), Enterobacter spp. 3.62% (5/138), Acinobacter spp. 2.90% (4/138), Serratia marcescens 2.17% (3/138), Proteus mirabilis 1.45% (2). Aeromonas hydrophylia, Citrobacter freundii, Providencia stuartii, Sphingomonas paucimobilis and Stenotropomonas multipholia contributed to 0.72% with one isolate each. For gram-negative Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumonia, the extended-spectrum beta-lactamases producers (ESBLs) rates were 38% and 22.22% respectively. For Pseudomonas aerugenosa imipenem-cilastatin resistance rate was 18.84%. For gram-positive bacteria, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) rate was 28.62%. The vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE) rate was 1.18%. Conclusion: Gram-negative bacteria were more prevalent as a cause of infection in adult cancer patients with febrile neutropenia at our institution, with Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumonia with high ESBLs rates being the most common pathogens.

Retrospectively, we identified several risk factors for EMR in our patient. Interestingly, the use of all-trans retinoic acid has recently been associated with higher risk of EMR possibly due to up-regulation of adhesion molecules on the surface of the leukemic cell, resulting in their passage through the endothelium to extramedullary tissues. However, data remain conflicting in that regard. Although universal CNS prophylaxis has been suggested, the low incidence of EMR among APL patients renders this strategy less attractive.

Mutations in genes encoding TFs or graded reduction in their expression levels can induce the development of various malignant diseases such as acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Growth Factor Independence 1 (GFI1) is a transcriptional repressor with key roles in haematopoiesis, including regulating self-renewal of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) as well as myeloid and lymphoid differentiation. Analysis of AML patients and different AML mouse models with reduced GFI1 gene expression levels revealed a direct link between low GFI1 protein level and accelerated AML development and inferior prognosis. Here, we report that upregulated expression of GFI1 in several widely used leukemic cell lines inhibits their growth and decreases the ability to generate colonies in vitro. Similarly, elevated expression of GFI1 impedes the in vitro expansion of murine pre-leukemic cells. Using a humanized AML model, we demonstrate that upregulation of GFI1 expression leads to myeloid differentiation morphologically and immunophenotypically, increased level of apoptosis and reduction in number of cKit(+) cells.

Here we show that circulating CLL B cells neither express CXCR1 or CXCR2 nor they respond to exogenous IL-8 when cultured in vitro alone or in the presence of monocytes/nurse-like cells. By intracellular staining and ELISA we show that highly purified CLL B cells do not produce IL-8 spontaneously or upon activation through the B cell receptor. By contrast, we found that a minor proportion (<0.5%) of contaminating monocytes in enriched suspensions of leukemic cells might be the actual source of IL-8 due to their strong capacity to release this cytokine.

Here we show that expression of MPP1, a PDZ-domain-containing protein, highly correlated with ABCC4 in AML, is associated with worse overall survival in AML. Murine hematopoietic progenitor cells overexpressing MPP1 acquired the ability to serially replate in methylcellulose culture, a property crucially dependent upon ABCC4. The highly conserved PDZ-binding motif of ABCC4 is required for ABCC4 and MPP1 to form a protein complex, which increased ABCC4 membrane localization and retention, to enhance drug resistance.

Although few data are available on treatment, anti-ERBB2 therapeutic agents may be effective for ERBB2-mutant cancers. The familial lung cancer patient in one of the authors' institutes developed bone metastasis with enlarging lung tumors and was treated with the ERBB2 inhibitor afatinib. We also encountered a patient with ampullary adenocarcinoma with ERBB2 G660D and S310F comutations in another institute of the authors', revealed by comprehensive genomic profiling. This patient was then treated with afatinib and also achieved transitory response. We also searched for ERBB2 transmembrane mutations in various types of cancers in PubMed, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and the Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets (MSK-IMPACT) database. Besides our two cases, two patients with V659E mutations were found via PubMed. Three potential patients were found in TCGA. In addition, MSK-IMPACT allowed identification of three additional urothelial carcinomas with G660D mutations and two lung adenocarcinomas with V659E mutations. Our experience suggests that establishing a database of integrated information regarding the clinical genome and therapeutic outcome of patients with recurrent but less common mutations is essential to implement precision oncology. KEY POINTS: Rare but targetable mutations such as avian erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2 (erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2) (ERBB2; human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [HER2]) transmembrane domain (TMD) mutations can be detected by comprehensive genomic profiling.Afatinib may be effective for patients with cancer with ERBB2 (HER2) TMD mutations.In order to implement precision oncology, it is important to establish a database of integrated information regarding the clinical genomes and therapeutic outcomes of patients with recurrent but less common mutations.",['(c) AlphaMed Press 2017.'],"['Yamamoto, Hiromasa', 'Toyooka, Shinichi', 'Ninomiya, Takashi', 'Matsumoto, Shigemi', 'Kanai, Masashi', 'Tomida, Shuta', 'Kiura, Katsuyuki', 'Muto, Manabu', 'Suzawa, Ken', 'Desmeules, Patrice', 'Kris, Mark G', 'Li, Bob T', 'Ladanyi, Marc']","['Yamamoto H', 'Toyooka S', 'Ninomiya T', 'Matsumoto S', 'Kanai M', 'Tomida S', 'Kiura K', 'Muto M', 'Suzawa K', 'Desmeules P', 'Kris MG', 'Li BT', 'Ladanyi M']","['Department of Thoracic, Breast and Endocrinological Surgery, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan.', 'Department of Thoracic, Breast and Endocrinological Surgery, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan toyooka@md.okayama-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Clinical Genomic Medicine, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Respiratory Medicine, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan.', 'Department of Therapeutic Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Therapeutic Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Genomic Medicine, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Respiratory Medicine, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan.', 'Department of Therapeutic Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Human Oncology & Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.']",['eng'],,['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171116,United States,Oncologist,The oncologist,9607837,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '41UD74L59M (Afatinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ERBB2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)']",IM,,"['Adenocarcinoma/*drug therapy/genetics/secondary', 'Afatinib/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/*genetics']",PMC5813752,,2017/11/18 06:00,2019/09/13 06:00,['2017/11/18 06:00'],"['2017/07/23 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/13 06:00 [medline]', '2017/11/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['theoncologist.2017-0345 [pii]', '10.1634/theoncologist.2017-0345 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncologist. 2018 Feb;23(2):150-154. doi: 10.1634/theoncologist.2017-0345.

It is well established that somatic mutations are important in cancer initiation and progression as well as in creation of tumor diversity. Now also modifications of the transcriptome are emerging as a significant force during the transition from normal cell to malignant tumor. Editing of adenosine (A) to inosine (I) in double-stranded RNA, catalyzed by adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs), is one dynamic modification that in a combinatorial manner can give rise to a very diverse transcriptome. Since the cell interprets inosine as guanosine (G), editing can result in non-synonymous codon changes in transcripts as well as yield alternative splicing, but also affect targeting and disrupt maturation of microRNA. ADAR editing is essential for survival in mammals but its dysregulation can lead to cancer. ADAR1 is for instance overexpressed in, e.g., lung cancer, liver cancer, esophageal cancer and chronic myoelogenous leukemia, which with few exceptions promotes cancer progression. In contrast, ADAR2 is lowly expressed in e.g. glioblastoma, where the lower levels of ADAR2 editing leads to malignant phenotypes. Altogether, RNA editing by the ADAR enzymes is a powerful regulatory mechanism during tumorigenesis. Depending on the cell type, cancer progression seems to mainly be induced by ADAR1 upregulation or ADAR2 downregulation, although in a few cases ADAR1 is instead downregulated.

Oncologic rehabilitation treatment may result in improved physical and mental impairment. There is a paucity of information about rehabilitation service utilization among cancer patients in Ethiopia. Hence, the purpose of this study was to assess the rehabilitation service for cancer patient and associated factors at Black Lion hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. METHODS: A hospital-based cross-sectional quantitative study was conducted from March to April 2014. Convenient sampling method was employed to recruit the study participants. Interviewer administered questionnaire was used to collect data. Data were entered into EPI data version 3.1 and exported to SPSS (16.0) software for analysis. Descriptive analysis, binary and multiple logistic regression were carried out. Significance association was interpreted using adjusted odds ratio at 95% confidence interval and p-value less than 0.05. RESULT: A sample of 423 patients aged 18 years and older were involved in the study. Breast cancer (25%), colorectal cancer (20.6%), cervical cancer (14.7%), lymphoma (7.7%), lung (7.2%), leukemia (5.4%), kidney (3.6%) and prostate cancer (2.6%) were the common forms of cancer diagnosed at cancer unit of the Black Lion Hospital. Twenty six percent of cancer patients received rehabilitation service at least once. The main rehabilitation services given were nutritional and psychological support. Unavailability of supplies, lack of professionals and cost of service were among the barriers to receiving rehabilitation services. CONCLUSION: Only a few cancer patients received cancer rehabilitation services. Increasing the knowledge of the professionals, stocking cancer units with necessary supplies, and other comprehensive programs are needed.",,"['Worku, Teshager', 'Mengistu, Zuriash', 'Semahegn, Agumasie', 'Tesfaye, Gezahegn']","['Worku T', 'Mengistu Z', 'Semahegn A', 'Tesfaye G']","['College of Health and Medical Sciences, Haramaya University, PO.

However, it has also been associated with several potentially serious complications, including thrombosis. Pegaspargase-induced cerebral venous thrombosis and bone marrow necrosis are very rare. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 50-year-old female developed headache, weakness of the right lower extremity, fever, and bone pain after chemotherapy including pegaspargase for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. DIAGNOSES: Her imaging studies and bone marrow examinations were compatible with cerebral venous thrombosis and bone marrow necrosis. INTERVENTIONS: The patient received anticoagulation therapy with rivaroxaban. OUTCOMES: After treatment with rivaroxaban, she had a good outcome without major or minor bleeding. LESSONS: Clinicians should be aware of the very rare but possible induction of bone marrow necrosis during pegaspargase treatment when there is necrosis in other organs. Because of its greater safety and convenience, rivaroxaban gains popularity over traditional anticoagulant drugs.",,"['Sui, Jingrui', 'Zhang, Yongming', 'Yang, Liqing', 'Wang, Hui', 'Xu, Junqing', 'Wei, Rongxia', 'Hao, Yaping', 'Wang, Xiaolei', 'Peng, Jun', 'Ma, Junjie']","['Sui J', 'Zhang Y', 'Yang L', 'Wang H', 'Xu J', 'Wei R', 'Hao Y', 'Wang X', 'Peng J', 'Ma J']","['aDepartment of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan bDepartment of Hematology, Yantai Yuhuangding Hospital Affiliated to Qingdao University, Yantai cDepartment of Hepatobiliary Surgery, Yantaishan Hospital, Yantai dDepartment of Neurology, Yantai Yuhuangding Hospital Affiliated to Qingdao University, Yantai eDepartment of Endocrinology, Yantai Yuhuangding Hospital Affiliated to Qingdao University, Yantai, China.']",['eng'],,,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '7D96IR0PPM (pegaspargase)', '9NDF7JZ4M3 (Rivaroxaban)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Asparaginase/*adverse effects', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Necrosis/chemically induced/drug therapy', 'Polyethylene Glycols/*adverse effects', 'Remission Induction', 'Rivaroxaban/*therapeutic use', 'Sinus Thrombosis, Intracranial/*chemically induced/*drug therapy']",PMC5704855,,2017/11/18 06:00,2017/12/12 06:00,['2017/11/18 06:00'],"['2017/11/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/11/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000008715 [doi]', '00005792-201711170-00074 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2017 Nov;96(46):e8715. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000008715.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Data also revealed that only Zn-complex exhibited remarkable apoptosis in drug-sensitive CCRF-CEM and multidrug-resistant CEM/ADR5000 cancer cells as assessed by MTT, Cell cycle and AnnexinV binding assay. Moreover, Zn-complex altered ROS and GSH level of the respective cell lines. Finally, treatment of Zn-complex in Swiss albino mice did not show any systemic toxicity in preliminary trials in normal mice and remarkably increased the life-span of EAC bearing mice.

Patients received 3- to 7-day continuous intravenous infusions of rigosertib, an inhibitor of Ras-effector pathways that interacts with the Ras-binding domains, common to several signaling proteins including Raf and PI3 kinase. Rigosertib was administered at doses of 650-1700mg/m(2)/day in 14-day cycles. Initial dose escalation followed a Fibonacci scheme, followed by recommended phase 2 dose confirmation in an expanded cohort. Rigosertib was well tolerated for up to 23 cycles, with no treatment-related deaths and 18% of patients with related serious adverse events (AEs). Common AEs were fatigue, diarrhea, pyrexia, dyspnea, insomnia, and anemia. Rigosertib exhibited biologic activity, with reduction or stabilization of bone marrow blasts and improved peripheral blood counts in a subset of patients. Ten of 19 evaluable patients (53%) demonstrated bone marrow/peripheral blood responses (n=4 MDS, n=1 AML) or stable disease (n=3 MDS, n=2 AML).

Given costly novel therapeutics for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, we used the framework to compare net health benefit (NHB) and cost within Medicare of all regimens listed in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines. METHODS: The current NCCN guidelines for chronic lymphocytic leukemia were reviewed. All referenced studies were screened, and only randomized controlled prospective trials were included. The revised ASCO Value Framework was used to calculate NHB. Medicare drug pricing was used to calculate the cost of therapies. RESULTS: Forty-nine studies were screened. The following observations were made: only 10 studies (20%) could be evaluated; when comparing regimens studied against the same control arm, ranking NHB scores were comparable to their preference in guidelines; NHB scores varied depending on which variables were used, and there were no clinically validated thresholds for low or high values; treatment-related deaths were not weighted in the toxicity scores; and six of the 10 studies used less potent control arms, ranked as the least-preferred NCCN-recommended regimens. CONCLUSION: The ASCO Value Framework is an important initial step to quantify value of therapies. Essential limitations include the lack of clinically relevant validated thresholds for NHB scores and lack of incorporation of grade 5 toxicities/treatment-related mortality into its methodology. To optimize its application for clinical practice, we urge investigators/sponsors to incorporate and report the required variables to calculate the NHB of regimens and encourage trials with stronger comparator arms to properly quantify the relative value of therapies.",,"['Seymour, Erlene K', 'Schiffer, Charles A', 'de Souza, Jonas A']","['Seymour EK', 'Schiffer CA', 'de Souza JA']","['Karmanos Cancer Institute/Wayne State University, Detroit, MI; and The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL.', 'Karmanos Cancer Institute/Wayne State University, Detroit, MI; and The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL.', 'Karmanos Cancer Institute/Wayne State University, Detroit, MI; and The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",20171116,United States,J Oncol Pract,Journal of oncology practice,101261852,,IM,,"['Cost-Benefit Analysis/*economics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*economics', 'Medical Oncology/*economics', 'Medicare/*economics', 'Prospective Studies', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'United States']",,,2017/11/18 06:00,2018/07/17 06:00,['2017/11/18 06:00'],"['2017/11/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/17 06:00 [medline]', '2017/11/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JOP.2017.024778 [doi]'],ppublish,J Oncol Pract. 2017 Dec;13(12):e1002-e1011. doi: 10.1200/JOP.2017.024778.

The assessment was based on a dossier compiled by the pharmaceutical company (hereinafter referred to as ""the company""). The dossier was sent to IQWiG on 1 February 2016. The drug ibrutinib is approved for several therapeutic indications. The present assessment module I contains the assessment of the therapeutic indication chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). Research question The aim of this report was to assess the added benefit of ibrutinib compared with the appropriate comparator therapy (ACT) specified by the G-BA for adult patients with CLL: who have received at least one prior therapy, or as first-line treatment in the presence of 17p deletion or TP53 mutation in patients unsuitable for chemo-immunotherapy. According to the approval of ibrutinib, the G-BA distinguished between 2 subindications within the therapeutic indication CLL: pretreated patients and treatment-naive patients with 17p deletion or TP53 mutation. The G-BA further divided pretreated patients into 2 subpopulations. Accordingly, the assessment was conducted for a total of 3 research questions. The company accepted the ACT specified by the G-BA within the respective research question. The assessment was conducted based on patient-relevant outcomes and on the data provided by the company in the dossier.","['Copyright (c) 2016 by the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Healthcare', '(IQWiG).']",,,,['eng'],,,"['Review', 'Book']",,"Cologne, Germany",,,,,,,,,,2017/11/17 06:01,2017/11/17 06:01,,,['NBK458435 [bookaccession]'],,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Ibrutinib', 'Leukemia - Lymphocytic - Chronic - B-Cell', 'Benefit Assessment']",,,['Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care'],,,,,,,20171117,['Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG)'],['IQWiG Dossier Assessment Extracts'],['Ibrutinib -- Benefit Assessment According to section sign35a Social Code Book V'],['2017/11/17 06:01'],,

However, the mechanistic role of BCAT1 in this process remains largely uncertain. Here, by performing high-resolution proteomic analysis of human acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) stem-cell and non-stem-cell populations, we find the BCAA pathway enriched and BCAT1 protein and transcripts overexpressed in leukaemia stem cells. We show that BCAT1, which transfers alpha-amino groups from BCAAs to alpha-ketoglutarate (alphaKG), is a critical regulator of intracellular alphaKG homeostasis. Further to its role in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, alphaKG is an essential cofactor for alphaKG-dependent dioxygenases such as Egl-9 family hypoxia inducible factor 1 (EGLN1) and the ten-eleven translocation (TET) family of DNA demethylases. Knockdown of BCAT1 in leukaemia cells caused accumulation of alphaKG, leading to EGLN1-mediated HIF1alpha protein degradation. This resulted in a growth and survival defect and abrogated leukaemia-initiating potential. By contrast, overexpression of BCAT1 in leukaemia cells decreased intracellular alphaKG levels and caused DNA hypermethylation through altered TET activity. AML with high levels of BCAT1 (BCAT1(high)) displayed a DNA hypermethylation phenotype similar to cases carrying a mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH(mut)), in which TET2 is inhibited by the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate. High levels of BCAT1 strongly correlate with shorter overall survival in IDH(WT)TET2(WT), but not IDH(mut) or TET2(mut) AML. Gene sets characteristic for IDH(mut) AML were enriched in samples from patients with an IDH(WT)TET2(WT)BCAT1(high) status. BCAT1(high) AML showed robust enrichment for leukaemia stem-cell signatures, and paired sample analysis showed a significant increase in BCAT1 levels upon disease relapse. In summary, by limiting intracellular alphaKG, BCAT1 links BCAA catabolism to HIF1alpha stability and regulation of the epigenomic landscape, mimicking the effects of IDH mutations. Our results suggest the BCAA-BCAT1-alphaKG pathway as a therapeutic target to compromise leukaemia stem-cell function in patients with IDH(WT)TET2(WT) AML.",,"['Raffel, Simon', 'Falcone, Mattia',

Cytogenetic abnormalities detected at primary diagnosis may change over time. Karyotype changes can be characterized as cytogenetic evolution, cytogenetic regression or a combination of both. While the exact mechanism of cytogenetic evolution is not completely understood, the process of cytogenetic evolution is not random, but follows different, and often disease-specific patterns during progression and relapse of myeloid neoplasms. Important lessons were learned from the cytogenetic evolution pathways observed over the course of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), progressing through chronic phase into accelerated phase and blast crisis. Cytogenetic evolution pathways of CML are divided into major and minor route abnormalities. The major route changes include an extra Ph chromosome (+Ph) trisomy 8 (+8) and the occurrence of an i(17q). The six most common minor route abnormalities include -7, -17, +17, +21 and -Y and one structural change, t(3;21). Recently an increased number of CML cases with karyotype abnormalities in Ph-negative cells have been reported in patients treated with imatinib. These abnormalities include trisomy 8, abnormalities of chromosome 7, and chromosome 20. The significance of the Ph-negative karyotype changes in subsequent development of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is unclear. Nevertheless, the occurrence of clonal abnormalities in Ph-negative cells underlines the importance of conventional cytogenetic studies in monitoring of CML patients. In AML, karyotype changes commonly occur between diagnosis and relapse status post chemotherapy. Karyotype evolution seems more common in patients who had unfavorable aberrations at diagnosis as compared to patients with favorable or intermediate abnormalities. Karyotype evolution results in shortened remission duration as compared to cases without cytogenetic change. Recent studies on cytogenetic evolution at relapse after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) were similar to the data observed in chemotherapy-treated AML. Serial bone marrow evaluations after allo-HCT offer insights into the dynamics of karyotype evolution, notably, they demonstrated that a detection of karyotype abnormalities is usually followed by a relapse within the next 90 days. As a contrast, karyotype abnormalities were not observed in patients who do not relapse in the next 3 months. CGE at relapse was associated with significantly decreased postrelapse and post-transplantation survival compared with the non-CGE group.

SHIP1 knockout mice develop a myeloproliferative syndrome and concomitant deletion of SHIP1 and the tumor suppressor PTEN leads to the development of lethal B-cell lymphomas. In the study presented here, we investigated the role of SHIP1 as a tumor suppressor in myeloid leukemia cells in an in vivo xenograft transplantation model. NSG Mice transplanted with UKE-1 cells derived from a secondary AML showed a significantly extended lifespan after lentiviral-mediated overexpression of SHIP1 in comparison to the vector control cohort. In contrast, the AML-derived SHIP1(Y643H) mutant, which has a strongly reduced enzymatic activity showed a significant reversion of the SHIP1-induced prolongation of the survival time. In addition, the analysis of 290 AML patients revealed a correlation between expression of SHIP1 and overall survival of the AML patients. These results indicate that SHIP1 can act as a tumor suppressor in acute myeloid leukemia cells and that higher SHIP1 expression is associated with prolonged overall survival in AML patients.

In the past ALL was intractable but now the survival probability is as high as 80-90%. Improved supportive care, treatment stratification based on relapse risk, biological features of leukemic cells, and optimization of treatment regimens by nationwide and international collaboration have contributed to this dramatic improvement. While including traditional risk factors (e.g. age and leukocyte count at diagnosis), the treatment has been modified based on biological characteristics (aneuploidy and translocation) and treatment response (assessed by minimal residual disease). Treatment for pediatric ALL typically consists of induction therapy with steroids, vincristine, and asparaginase with or without anthracycline, followed by multi-agent consolidation including high-dose methotrexate and re-induction therapy. After consolidation, less intensive maintenance therapy is required for 1-2 years to maintain event-free survival. Recently, using advanced genomic analysis technology, novel sentinel genomic alterations that may provide more precise stratification or therapeutic targets, were identified. Moreover, in the last decade germline variations have been recognized as similarly important contributors to understanding the etiology and sensitivity of ALL to treatment.

Some pathogens encode gene products that behave like oncogenic factors, hijacking cellular pathways to promote the survival and proliferation of infected cells in vivo. Some of these viral oncoproteins trigger a cellular damage defense response leading to senescence; however, other viral factors hinder this suppressive effect, suggesting that cooperation of those viral factors is important for malignant transformation. Coinfection with multiple agents is known to accelerate cancer development in certain cases. For example, parasitic or bacterial infection is a risk factor for adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma induced by human T-cell leukemia virus type 1, and Epstein-Barr virus and malaria are closely associated with endemic Burkitt lymphoma. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection is accompanied by various types of infection-related cancer. These findings indicate that these oncogenic pathogens can cooperate to overcome host barriers against cancer development. In this review, the authors focus on the collaborative strategies of pathogens for oncogenesis from two different points of view: (i) the cooperation of two or more different factors encoded by a single pathogen; and (ii) the acceleration of oncogenesis by coinfection with multiple agents.","['(c) 2017 The Authors.

The clinical course of iT-LBP is indolent, and no therapy is usually required. A major concern is misdiagnosis as T-lymphoblastic lymphoma, and a correct diagnosis of iT-LBP often requires not only pathological analysis but also careful monitoring of the clinical course. The aim of this study was to broaden the knowledge of pathologists and physicians concerning this as yet not well-recognised entity. METHODS AND RESULTS: We report a case of iT-LBP concomitant with ACC, along with a literature review of all 14 cases of iT-LBP reported to date.

Until recently therapeutic options mainly consisted of palliative care, chemotherapy, donor lymphocyte infusions and second transplantation in selected cases. Still many patients either do not tolerate intensive therapies or do not achieve durable remissions and will finally succumb. Given this unmet medical need the hypomethylating agents (HMA), Azacitidine (Aza) and Decitabine (DAC) have been tested as salvage therapy in patients with myeloid malignancies relapsing after allo-SCT. Furthermore, they have also been incorporated into prophylactic and pre-emptive approaches to avoid haematological relapse. In this review, we summarize the evidence from retrospective studies but also from a few prospective trials regarding the use of HMA after transplant. To aid clinicians in their daily clinical practice, we also comment on some practical aspects such as dosing and schedule, the choice of HMA and the use of complementary cellular therapies. Finally, this review also gives an overview on potential mechanisms mediating the efficacy of HMA after transplant as well as ongoing preclinical research and clinical activities aiming to further improve this treatment approach.",,"['Schroeder, Thomas', 'Rautenberg, Christina', 'Haas, Rainer', 'Germing, Ulrich', 'Kobbe, Guido']","['Schroeder T', 'Rautenberg C', 'Haas R', 'Germing U', 'Kobbe G']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, Medical Faculty, University of Duesseldorf, Moorenstr. 5, 40225, Dusseldorf, Germany. thomas.schroeder@med.uni-duesseldorf.de.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, Medical Faculty, University of Duesseldorf, Moorenstr. 5, 40225, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, Medical Faculty, University of Duesseldorf, Moorenstr. 5, 40225, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, Medical Faculty, University of Duesseldorf, Moorenstr. 5, 40225, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, Medical Faculty, University of Duesseldorf, Moorenstr. 5, 40225, Dusseldorf, Germany.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20171115,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,,"['Allografts', 'Azacitidine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use', 'Decitabine', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Salvage Therapy', '*Secondary Prevention', '*Stem Cell Transplantation']",,,2017/11/17 06:00,2018/06/05 06:00,['2017/11/17 06:00'],"['2017/10/08 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/05 06:00 [medline]', '2017/11/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-017-2364-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-017-2364-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2018 Feb;107(2):138-150. doi: 10.1007/s12185-017-2364-4.

However, the development of CART technology and its wider application is partly limited by the patient-specific nature of such a platform and by the time required for manufacturing. The efficacious generation of universal allogeneic CART cells would overcome these limitations and represent a major advance in the field. However, several obstacles in the generation of universal CART cells need to be overcome, namely the risk of CART rejection and the risk of graft-versus-host disease mediated by the allogeneic CART.

These novel drugs have already significantly increased survival rates. The first available immune checkpoint inhibitors were cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) inhibitors (such as ipilimumab), followed by programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and programmed cell death protein ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors (such as pembrolizumab and nivolumab). Anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 therapies have demonstrated better efficacy and tolerability and less severe adverse effects compared to anti-CTLA-4 agents. Idelalisib, a PI3Kdelta isoform inhibitor, is another immunotherapeutic agent that is often classified separately and is currently used in treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Despite successful therapeutic responses, immune-related adverse events have been reported with the use of these agents. The gastrointestinal side effects, particularly diarrhea, are among the most commonly reported symptoms. The histologic features of immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated colitis show a spectrum of patterns of injury among various drug classes. There is significant overlap between immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated colitis and other colitides, making the differential diagnosis difficult-especially in the absence of clinical history.

Of 2206 patients, 185 (8.3%) were identified as AYA: 105 (57%) ET, 43 (23%) PV, and 37 (20%) MF. The median age was 33 years [range, 16-39], and median follow-up time 3 years [range, 0.04-25]. JAK2 allele burdens were significantly lower among AYA JAK2V617F-mutated patients in both PV (p = 0.001) and MF (p = 0.005). Seven percent of MPN AYA patients were diagnosed with a thrombotic event at, or prior to, diagnosis. Over the short median follow-up, 4 thrombotic (PV = 1, MF = 3) and 3 leukemia (ET = 2, MF = 1) events occurred. In multivariate analysis, AYA did not predict for thrombotic or transformational events across three cohorts. In the MF cohort, there was a reduced frequency of negative prognostic variables of anemia (p = 0.011) and leukocytosis (p = 0.048) in AYA when compared with non-AYA. Overall survival was significantly superior in the AYA cohorts in all three MPN groups, namely MF (p < 0.001), PV (p < 0.001), and ET (p = 0.002).

Upregulation of menin was reported in HCC patients and high levels of menin correlate with poor patient prognosis. The protein-protein interaction between menin and histone methyltransferase mixed lineage leukemia 1 (MLL1) plays an important role in the development of HCC, implying that pharmacologic inhibition of this interaction could lead to new therapeutic strategy for the HCC patients. Here, we demonstrate that the menin-MLL inhibitor MI-503 shows antitumor activity in in vitro and in vivo models of HCC and reveals the potential mechanism of menin contribution to HCC. Treatment with MI-503 selectively kills various HCC cell lines and this effect is significantly enhanced by a combination of MI-503 with sorafenib, the standard-of-care therapy for HCC. Furthermore, MI-503 reduces sphere formation and cell migration in in vitro HCC models. When applied in vivo, MI-503 gives a strong antitumor effect both as a single agent and in combination with sorafenib in mice xenograft models of HCC. Mechanistically, treatment with MI-503 downregulates expression of several genes known to play a critical role in proliferation and migration of HCC cells, including PEG10, and displaces the menin-MLL1 complex from the PEG10 promoter, resulting in reduced H3K4 methylation and transcriptional repression. Overall, our studies reveal a mechanistic link between menin and genes involved in HCC and demonstrate that pharmacologic inhibition of the menin-MLL interaction might represent a promising therapeutic approach for HCC.

IL3 receptor alpha (IL3Ralpha, or CD123) is expressed on the majority of AML blasts, and there is evidence that its expression is increased on leukemic relative to normal hematopoietic stem cells, which makes it an attractive target for antibody-based therapy. Here, we report the generation and preclinical characterization of SGN-CD123A, an antibody-drug conjugate using the pyrrolobenzodiazepine dimer (PBD) linker and a humanized CD123 antibody with engineered cysteines for site-specific conjugation. Mechanistically, SGN-CD123A induces activation of DNA damage response pathways, cell-cycle changes, and apoptosis in AML cells. In vitro, SGN-CD123A-mediated potent cytotoxicity of 11/12 CD123(+) AML cell lines and 20/23 primary samples from AML patients, including those with unfavorable cytogenetic profiles or FLT3 mutations. In vivo, SGN-CD123A treatment led to AML eradication in a disseminated disease model, remission in a subcutaneous xenograft model, and significant growth delay in a multidrug resistance xenograft model. Moreover, SGN-CD123A also resulted in durable complete remission of a patient-derived xenograft AML model. When combined with a FLT3 inhibitor quizartinib, SGN-CD123A enhanced the activity of quizartinib against two FLT3-mutated xenograft models. Overall, these data demonstrate that SGN-CD123A is a potent antileukemic agent, supporting an ongoing trial to evaluate its safety and efficacy in AML patients (NCT02848248).

This study investigated the association between poly-miRTS of Ara-C/anthracycline metabolic pathways genes and the outcome of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in Chinese patients after Ara-C-based chemotherapy. METHODS: A total of 17 poly-miRTS were selected from the SNPinfo Web Server and genotyped in 206 Chinese Han non-FAB-M3 AML patients using the SEQUENOM Mass-ARRAY system. RESULTS: Among these 17 poly-miRTS, five Ara-C metabolic gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, NT5C2 rs10786736 and rs8139, SLC29A1 rs3734703, DCTD rs7278, and RRM1 rs1042919) were identified to significantly associate with complete AML remission and/or overall and relapse-free survival (OS and RFS, respectively), and four anthracycline-metabolic gene SNPs (ABCC1 rs3743527, rs212091, and rs212090 and CBR1 rs9024) were significantly associated with chemotherapy-related toxicities. Moreover, SLC29A1 rs3734703 was shown to associate with both chemotherapy response and survival (adjusted OR 2.561 in the overdominant model; adjusted HR 2.876 for OS and 2.357 for RFS in the dominant model). CONCLUSIONS: The data from the current study demonstrated that the poly-miRTS of Ara-C/anthracyclines metabolic genes predicted the sensitivity and side effects of AML to Ara-C-based chemotherapy and patient survival.

Method: Twenty-five neutropenic PIFD children with acute leukemia or post hematopoietic stem cells transplantation in Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University were selected from January 2012 to June 2015, including 12 males and 13 females, age range 2-15 (average 6.2+/-2.0) years. There were 12 cases of acute leukemia (AL) after chemotherapy, 4 cases of acute leukemia (AL) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) and 9 cases of beta-thalassemia major after allo-HSCT. All children received MCM for the treatment of PIFD, the dosage of MCM was 3-4 mg/ (kg.d) , once a day. The children received 2 to 6 courses of treatment, individually with a course of 7 days. 1, 3-beta-D glucan assay (G test), galactomannan antigen test (GM test), high-resolution CT and the biochemical indexes for organ functions were closely monitored. Result: Twenty-five cases were diagnosed as PIFD, including 2 patients diagnosed as proven, 6 as probable and 17 as possible. Of the 25 cases, 1 was confirmed aspergillus by biopsy pathology and 1 was candida albicans by blood culture. The G and GM test with positive results was 5 and 2 respectively. Chest CT scans of the 25 cases had obvious lesions: air crescent sign and cavitation in 4 cases, diffuse ground glass change in 9 cases, double lung scattered patchy, small nodules and cord like high density shadow in 7 cases, unilateral or bilateral chest wall wedge-shaped consolidation edge in 5 cases and pleural effusion in 5 patients. The effective rate of MCF in treatment of PIFD was 68% (17/25), including 13 cases cured, 4 cases improved, 4 cases were improved clinically and in 4 cases the treatment was ineffective. Eight cases were effective in MCF monotherapy group (12 cases) and nine were effective in MCF combined therapy group(13 cases), respectively. Side-effects including allergies, gastrointestinal side effects, electrolyte disturbances, impairment of liver and kidney function, and myelosuppression were not found in those children treated with MCF.

We evaluated whether in utero exposure to antidepressants increased the risk of childhood cancer. METHODS: This population-based cohort study using national registers in Denmark comprised 915 128 liveborn singletons during 1998-2012. We categorised children into three mutually exclusive exposure groups according to maternal redemption of an antidepressant prescription from 2 years before pregnancy until delivery of the index child: Unexposed (N = 863 033), prior user (use before but not during pregnancy) (N = 30 607), and use during pregnancy (N = 21 488). The children were followed from birth until first diagnosis of cancer, death, emigration, or December 31, 2012, whichever came first. The children were followed maximum 14.9 years and contributed to 6.9 x 10(6) person-years at risk. We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) of cancer using Cox regression with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: In total, 1298 (0.1%) children were diagnosed with cancer. Antidepressant use during pregnancy was not associated with a significantly increased risk of childhood cancer in general; the HR was 1.03 (95% CI, 0.63-1.68), compared to children born by mothers who discontinued antidepressant use prior to pregnancy. The association between in utero exposure to antidepressants and childhood cancer did not depend on type or duration of antidepressant use. There was no strong evidence indicating a higher risk of leukaemia or nervous system tumours among children exposed to antidepressants in utero. CONCLUSION: Antidepressant use during pregnancy was not significantly associated with childhood cancer in general nor with leukaemia or nervous system tumours in specific.","['Copyright (c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['Momen, Natalie C', 'Munk-Olsen, Trine', 'Li, Jiong', 'Ingstrup, Katja G', 'Olsen, Jorn', 'Bergink, Veerle', 'Liu, Xiaoqin']","['Momen NC', 'Munk-Olsen T', 'Li J', 'Ingstrup KG', 'Olsen J', 'Bergink V', 'Liu X']","['Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'The National Center for Register-based Research, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Lundbeck Foundation Initiative for Integrative Psychiatric Research, iPSYCH, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'The National Center for Register-based Research, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Epidemiology, Fielding School of Public Health, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'The National Center for Register-based Research, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'The Department of Psychiatry, Erasmus Medical Centre, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'The National Center for Register-based Research, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171115,England,Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf,Pharmacoepidemiology and drug safety,9208369,['0 (Antidepressive Agents)'],IM,,"['Adult', 'Antidepressive Agents/*adverse effects', 'Child, Preschool', 'Denmark/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Maternal Exposure/*adverse effects/statistics & numerical data', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications/*drug therapy', 'Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Registries/statistics & numerical data', 'Risk Factors', 'Young Adult']",,,2017/11/16 06:00,2019/09/10 06:00,['2017/11/16 06:00'],"['2017/05/08 00:00 [received]', '2017/09/22 00:00 [revised]', '2017/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/10 06:00 [medline]', '2017/11/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pds.4352 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf. 2018 Jan;27(1):114-118. doi: 10.1002/pds.4352.

Its pathophysiology remains unclear. We describe the management of 6 children with symptomatic CDC who did not respond to antifungal therapy. METHODS: The databases of the hematology-oncology departments of 2 tertiary pediatric medical centers were searched for all patients diagnosed with CDC from 2003 to 2015, who responded to corticosteroids after failing antifungal therapy. Clinical, laboratory and radiologic data were collected. RESULTS: Six patients (3 women, 3 men; 9-18 years of age) met the study criteria. Underlying diseases were acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 3) and large B-cell lymphoma, acute myeloid leukemia and severe aplastic anemia (n = 1 each). Presenting symptoms/signs of CDC were fever in all cases, with abdominal or chest pain, and/or mucositis. Candida infection was identified in blood cultures in 4 patients and in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in one. In the absence of response to antifungal agents (4-50 days from CDC diagnosis), prednisone 2 mg/kg/day or equivalent was administered. CDC-attributable clinical symptoms resolved in 4 patients within 6-19 days; one patient required an additional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent. Abnormalities on imaging decreased or disappeared within 5 months to 2 years in 4 patients. CONCLUSIONS: In children with persistent symptomatic CDC, despite adequate antifungal therapy, administration of corticosteroids may yield rapid resolution of symptoms and decreased inflammatory markers. In patients who do not respond to steroids, the addition of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug should be considered.",,"['Shkalim-Zemer, Vered', 'Levi, Itzhak', 'Fischer, Salvador', 'Tamary, Hannah', 'Yakobovich, Joanne', 'Avrahami, Gali', 'Gilad, Gil', 'Elitzur, Sara', 'Yaniv, Isaac', 'Elhasid, Ronit', 'Manistersky, Michal', 'Shalit, Itamar']","['Shkalim-Zemer V', 'Levi I', 'Fischer S', 'Tamary H', 'Yakobovich J', 'Avrahami G', 'Gilad G', 'Elitzur S', 'Yaniv I', 'Elhasid R', 'Manistersky M', 'Shalit I']","[""From the Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel, Petach Tikva, Israel."", 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', ""Pediatric Infectious Diseases Unit, Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel, Petach Tikva, Israel."", ""From the Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel, Petach Tikva, Israel."", 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', ""From the Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel, Petach Tikva, Israel."", 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', ""From the Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel, Petach Tikva, Israel."", 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', ""From the Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel, Petach Tikva, Israel."", 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', ""From the Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel, Petach Tikva, Israel."", 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', ""From the Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel, Petach Tikva, Israel."", 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', ""From the Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel, Petach Tikva, Israel."", 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', ""Pediatric Infectious Diseases Unit, Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel, Petach Tikva, Israel.""]",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Pediatr Infect Dis J,The Pediatric infectious disease journal,8701858,"['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)', '0 (Antifungal Agents)', 'Systemic candidiasis']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones/*therapeutic use', 'Antifungal Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Candidiasis/*drug therapy', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Female', 'Fever/microbiology', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Invasive Fungal Infections/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tertiary Care Centers', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2017/11/16 06:00,2019/05/14 06:00,['2017/11/16 06:00'],"['2017/11/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/14 06:00 [medline]', '2017/11/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/INF.0000000000001844 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Infect Dis J. 2018 Jul;37(7):686-690. doi: 10.1097/INF.0000000000001844.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, these alterations have not been described outside the context of B-ALL. Methods: Cytogenomic array and molecular analysis identified a Ph-like signature in a mixed-phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL), B/myeloid, confirmed using conventional immunophenotypic and cytochemical analysis. Results: Flow cytometry identified a blast population demonstrating a B-cell lineage and myeloperoxidase positivity. A P2RY8-CRLF2 fusion and JAK1 mutation were detected, both of which are associated with Ph-like features. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first report of Ph-like MPAL, which may represent a new diagnostic entity. We emphasize the need for refinement of diagnostic criteria for MPALs and highlight an opportunity for expansion of inclusion criteria in ongoing clinical trials studying the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy to include cases of Ph-like MPAL.","['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2017.

Smad3 operates downstream of growth/differentiation factors that utilize activin receptor-like kinase (ALK)-4, 5, or 7, such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), activin, and myostatin. STAT3 principally functions downstream of cytokines that exert their effects via gp130 and Janus family kinases, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and oncostatin M. Accumulating evidence indicates that Smad3 and STAT3 engage in crosstalk in a highly context-dependent fashion, cooperating in some conditions while acting antagonistically each other in others. Here, we review the crosstalk between Smad3 and STAT3 in various biological contexts, including early tumorigenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, fibrosis, and T cell differentiation.","['(c) The Author 2017.

In our study, we sought to investigate the effect of blocking transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta1) and C-X-C motif chemokine 12 (CXCL12) receptor CXCR4 on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells in an MSC co-culture system. METHODS: Human MSCs were obtained by BM aspirates and their phenotype and functional properties were confirmed in vitro. Co-cultures of AML cells on MSCs were initiated and compared to those on mouse fibroblasts (MS-5) and liquid cultures. Additionally, the effect of blocking CXCR4 and TGF-beta1 on AML cells was tested with and without the addition of cytarabine. RESULTS: MSCs from BM showed a typical phenotype and differentiation pattern. Co-culture of AML cells on MSCs resulted in a significantly higher proliferation capacity than on MS-5 or liquid culture. Blockade of TGF-beta1 increased AML cell proliferation and chemosensibility, while the CXCR4 antagonist plerixafor showed anti-proliferative effects and did not change cytarabine-induced cell death compared to control. DISCUSSION: Human MSCs are potent feeder cells, able to maintain AML cells in long-term culture. This favorable co-existence seems to be due in part to molecules important for communication within the niche. Blockade of TGF-beta1 and CXCL12 was associated with different effects on AML cell proliferation and chemotherapy resistance. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest a strong supporting affinity between MSCs and AML cells within the leukemic niche, where TGF-beta1 and CXCL12 pathways play an important role.",,"['Schelker, Roland Christian', 'Iberl, Sabine', 'Muller, Gunnar', 'Hart, Christina', 'Herr, Wolfgang', 'Grassinger, Jochen']","['Schelker RC', 'Iberl S', 'Muller G', 'Hart C', 'Herr W', 'Grassinger J']","['a Department of Internal Medicine III, Hematology and Oncology , University Hospital of Regensburg , Regensburg , Germany.', 'a Department of Internal Medicine III, Hematology and Oncology , University Hospital of Regensburg , Regensburg , Germany.', 'a Department of Internal Medicine III, Hematology and Oncology , University Hospital of Regensburg , Regensburg , Germany.', 'a Department of Internal Medicine III, Hematology and Oncology , University Hospital of Regensburg , Regensburg , Germany.', 'a Department of Internal Medicine III, Hematology and Oncology , University Hospital of Regensburg , Regensburg , Germany.', 'a Department of Internal Medicine III, Hematology and Oncology , University Hospital of Regensburg , Regensburg , Germany.']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],20171115,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta1)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Biomarkers', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemokine CXCL12/*metabolism', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Grading', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1/*metabolism']",,,2017/11/16 06:00,2018/09/27 06:00,['2017/11/16 06:00'],"['2017/11/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/27 06:00 [medline]', '2017/11/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10245332.2017.1402455 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2018 Jul;23(6):337-345. doi: 10.1080/10245332.2017.1402455.

Caffeic acid phenethyl ester's (CAPE's) anti-proliferative and apoptotic properties have been reported in leukemia cell lines. However, CAPE's effect on drug resistance and cellular metabolism is still unknown. Thus, in this study, we aimed to explore CAPE's effect on drug resistance and oxidative phosphorylation (oxphos). METHODS: Leukemia cell lines NB-4, HL-60, and K562 were treated with CAPE. ATP-based cell viability assay was used. For gene expression studies, RNAs were isolated and reverse transcribed. To investigate CAPE's effect on mitochondrial dysfunction in AML cell lines, we examined oxygen consumption rates (OCRs) in our cell lines. RESULTS: We found 5 muM CAPE sensitized all cell lines to cytarabine. This similar effect was also observed in the Decitabine-resistant K562 cell line. However, no difference was seen in MDR1 expression upon CAPE treatment in all cell lines. OCR significantly decreased upon CAPE treatment in all cell lines, while the expression of key regulatory glycolytic enzymes increased in K562 and NB-4 cell lines. Expression of STAT3 also changed upon CAPE treatment. DISCUSSION: Our results suggested that CAPE alters cellular metabolism by decreasing oxphos and increasing glycolysis in K562 and NB-4 cells. Furthermore, CAPE treatment altered STAT3 expression regarding alterations in oxphos and aerobic glycolysis. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest a new property of CAPE, which is oxphos repression, and a presumptive link between altered metabolism and drug resistance.",,"['Yucel, Burcu', 'Sonmez, Mehmet']","['Yucel B', 'Sonmez M']","['a Medical Faculty, Department of Medical Biology , Karadeniz Technical University , Trabzon , Turkey.', 'b Medical Faculty, Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology , Karadeniz Technical University , Trabzon , Turkey.']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],20171115,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression', 'Glycolysis/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Oxidative Phosphorylation/*drug effects', 'Oxygen Consumption/drug effects', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism']",,,2017/11/16 06:00,2018/09/27 06:00,['2017/11/16 06:00'],"['2017/11/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/27 06:00 [medline]', '2017/11/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10245332.2017.1402454 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2018 Jul;23(6):330-336. doi: 10.1080/10245332.2017.1402454.

Quizartinib is a selective and highly potent FLT3 inhibitor that has shown strong single-agent activity in relapsed or refractory (R/R) AML. This phase 1, open-label, sequential group dose-escalation trial (NCT 01390337) is the first evaluating safety and tolerability of quizartinib in combination with SOC chemotherapy in newly diagnosed AML (ndAML). Nineteen patients unselected for FLT3 mutational status received one of three quizartinib dihydrochloride dose levels (DL): 60 mg/d for 7 days (DL1; n = 6), 60 mg/d for 14 days (DL2; n = 7), and 40 mg/d for 14 days (DL-1; n = 6); administered orally starting on day 4 of chemotherapy. Median age was 43.8 years. Ten patients completed induction and consolidation. Three patients experienced dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs): 2 at DL2 (1 pericardial effusion; 1 febrile neutropenia, decreased platelet count, and QT prolongation); 1 at DL-1 (pericarditis). Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was identified as DL-1. Most common grade 3/4 adverse events were febrile neutropenia (47%), neutropenia (42%), thrombocytopenia (32%), and anemia (26%). There were no apparent additional toxicities with addition of quizartinib to chemotherapy although grade </=1 QT prolongation was observed at MTD. Sixteen patients (84%) achieved a response; 14 (74%) composite complete response; 2 (11%) morphologic leukemia-free state.

They are more selective than conventional chemotherapy, and often elicit fewer systemic adverse events, however toxicities still exist. Cutaneous toxicities are common and their management presents a novel challenge to physicians and patients. Ponatinib is a third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor increasingly reported to cause cutaneous eruption. A 50-year-old woman with a history of chronic myelogenous leukemia presented with a 4-month history of worsening atrophic and ichthyosiform pink plaques involving the axillae, thighs and abdomen; red patches were also observed on the cheeks and forehead. She was started on the third-generation, ponatinib, 5 months earlier because of disease refractory to previous therapies including interferon, imatinib, dasatinib and bosutinib. A skin biopsy revealed perifollicular fibrosis, alternating orthokeratosis and parakeratosis, and a sparse perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate consistent with a pityriasis rubra pilaris-like reaction. Topical tretinoin 0.025% cream was initiated, resulting in resolution within 3 weeks without discontinuation of ponatinib. A review of previous reports identified significant similarities among the ponatinib-induced drug reactions.

The 3(4,5)dimethylthiahiazo (-z-y1)-3,5-di-phenytetrazoliumromide (MTT) method was used to assay the vitality of the Eca109 cells following treatment with GEM (116 microg/ml). The cell apoptosis was measured by using fluorescence activated cell sorting. The proteins in the treated Eca109 cells were extracted, validated, and assayed via twodimensional gel electrophoresis combined with matrixassisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDITOFMS). The differentially expressed proteins were then determined by western blotting. Furthermore, alterations in mitochondrial ultrastructure of the treated cells were observed under a transmission electron microscope. GEM significantly inhibited the growth of the Eca109 cells in a concentration and timedependent manner, and the 50% inhibition concentration (IC50) value was 3.87 microg/ml. The MALDITOFMS analysis revealed that there were three differentially expressed proteins following the GEM treatment, compared with the control. The differential proteins were verified to be B cell lymphoma2 associated X, apoptosis regulator (Bax)alpha, apoptosisassociated specklike protein containing a CARD (ASC) and myeloid cell leukemia sequence (Mcl)1. Western blotting revealed that the expression levels of ASC and Baxalpha proteins in the treated cancer cells were significantly upregulated, whereas the Mcl1 protein expression was markedly downregulated compared with the control. Furthermore, the GEM treatment destroyed the mitochondrial ultrastructure of the cancer cells, leaving swelled mitochondria, a fading matrix and destroyed the mitochondrial cristae.

However, studies have yet to determine whether SRPK1 suppresses leukemia cell growth and induces apoptosis. Studies have also yet to reveal the underlying mechanisms. In the present study, the effects of downregulating SRPK1 gene expression on chronic myeloid leukemia cell lines (K562 cells) were investigated through RNA interference (RNAi) and the proliferation inhibition and apoptosis induction of SRPK1 in K562 cells were analyzed. K562 cells were transfected with two different concentrations of siRNA, and the transfection efficiency was detected via flow cytometry. The expression of SRPK1 was detected via reverse transcriptionquantitative polymerase chain reaction. K562 cell proliferation and apoptosis were analyzed using MTT and flow cytometry respectively. The roles of caspase3, poly (ADPribose) polymerase (PARP), p53 and B-cell lymphoma (Bcl)2/Bcl2 associated X, apoptosis regulator (Bax) proteins in the apoptosis of human K562 cells were further examined through western blot analysis. The SRPK1 expression was lower in the K562 cells transfected with SRPK1siRNA compared with untransfected cells. The inhibition rate in the transfected groups was increased compared with the untransfected groups. Compared with control groups, the number of apoptotic cells in the SRPK1silenced groups increased. The number of early apoptotic cells also increased. The cleaved caspase3, cleaved PARP and p53 expression levels were significantly increased in the RNAi groups compared with control groups.

Paradoxically, human thioredoxin (TXN1) was first identified as the adult T cell leukemia-derived factor (ADF), a secreted protein. ADF has been implicated in a wide variety of cell-to-cell communication systems acting as a cytokine or a chemokine. TRX80 is a truncated TXN1 protein with cytokine activity. The unconventional secretion mechanism of these extracellular thioredoxins is unknown. The thioredoxin system is relying on glucose metabolism through the pentose phosphate pathway that provides reducing power in the form of NADPH, the cofactor of thioredoxin reductase (TXNRD). While a complete extracellular TXN system is present in the blood in the form of circulating TXN1 and TXNDR1, the source of extracellular NADPH remains a mystery. In the absence of redox regenerating capacity, extracellular thioredoxins may rather be prooxidant agents. Rod-derived cone viability factor (RdCVF) is the product of intron retention of the nucleoredoxin-like 1 (NXNL1) gene, a secreted truncated thioredoxin-like protein. The other product encoded by the gene, RdCVFL, is an enzymatically active thioredoxin.

The aim of this investigation was to identify prognostic biomarkers for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) by using the gene expression profile dataset from public database. Methods: The gene expression profile dataset and corresponding overall survival (OS) information of three cohorts of AML patients from GSE12417 and The Cancer Genome Atlas AML project (TCGA-LAML) were included in the present study. Prognostic gene screening was performed by using a survival package, whereas time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed using the survivalROC package. Results: In the three cohorts, 11 genes were identified that were significantly associated with AML OS. A linear prognostic model of the 11 genes was constructed and weighted by regression coefficient (beta) from the multivariate Cox regression analyses of GSE12417 HG-U133A cohort to divide patients into high- and low-risk groups. GSE12417 HG-U133 plus 2.0 and TCGA-LAML were validation cohorts. Patients assigned to the high-risk group exhibited poor OS compared to patients in the low-risk group. The 11-gene signature is a prognostic marker of AML and demonstrates good performance for predicting 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS as evaluated by survivalROC in the three cohorts.

However, expressing Notch1 mutant alleles in mice fails to efficiently induce the development of leukemia. We performed a gain-of-function screen to identify proteins that enhanced signaling by leukemia-associated Notch1 mutants. The transcription factors MAFB and ETS2 emerged as candidates that individually enhanced Notch1 signaling, and when coexpressed, they synergistically increased signaling to an extent similar to that induced by core components of the Notch transcriptional complex. In mouse models of T-ALL, MAFB enhanced leukemogenesis by the naturally occurring Notch1 mutants, decreased disease latency, and increased disease penetrance. Decreasing MAFB abundance in mouse and human T-ALL cells reduced the expression of Notch1 target genes, including MYC and HES1, and sustained MAFB knockdown impaired T-ALL growth in a competitive setting. MAFB bound to ETS2 and interacted with the acetyltransferases PCAF and P300, highlighting its importance in recruiting coactivators that enhance Notch1 signaling. Together, these data identify a mechanism for enhancing the oncogenic potential of weak Notch1 mutants in leukemia models, and they reveal the MAFB-ETS2 transcriptional axis as a potential therapeutic target in T-ALL.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American', 'Association for the Advancement of Science.

However, data regarding the impact of HMAs on NK cell functionality are mostly derived from in vitro studies with high nonclinical relevant drug concentrations. In the present study, we report a comparative study of azacitidine (AZA) and decitabine (DAC) in combination with allogeneic NK cells generated from CD34(+) hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC-NK cells) in in vitro and in vivo AML models. In vitro, low-dose HMAs did not impair viability of HSPC-NK cells. Furthermore, low-dose DAC preserved HSPC-NK killing, proliferation, and interferon gamma production capacity, whereas AZA diminished their proliferation and reactivity. Importantly, we showed HMAs and HSPC-NK cells could potently work together to target AML cell lines and patient AML blasts. In vivo, both agents exerted a significant delay in AML progression in NOD/SCID/IL2Rg(null) mice, but the persistence of adoptively transferred HSPC-NK cells was not affected. Infused NK cells showed sustained expression of most activating receptors, upregulated NKp44 expression, and remarkable killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor acquisition. Most importantly, only DAC potentiated HSPC-NK cell anti-leukemic activity in vivo. Besides upregulation of NKG2D- and DNAM-1-activating ligands on AML cells, DAC enhanced messenger RNA expression of inflammatory cytokines, perforin, and TRAIL by HSPC-NK cells. In addition, treatment resulted in increased numbers of HSPC-NK cells in the bone marrow compartment, suggesting that DAC could positively modulate NK cell activity, trafficking, and tumor targeting. These data provide a rationale to explore combination therapy of adoptive HSPC-NK cells and DAC in patients with AML.",['(c) 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Cany, Jeannette', 'Roeven, Mieke W H', 'Hoogstad-van Evert, Janneke S', 'Hobo, Willemijn', 'Maas, Frans', 'Franco Fernandez, Rosalia', 'Blijlevens, Nicole M A', 'van der Velden, Walter J', 'Huls, Gerwin', 'Jansen, Joop H', 'Schaap, Nicolaas P M', 'Dolstra, Harry']","['Cany J', 'Roeven MWH', 'Hoogstad-van Evert JS', 'Hobo W', 'Maas F', 'Franco Fernandez R', 'Blijlevens NMA', 'van der Velden WJ', 'Huls G', 'Jansen JH', 'Schaap NPM', 'Dolstra H']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Laboratory of Hematology.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Laboratory of Hematology.', 'Department of Hematology, and.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Laboratory of Hematology.', 'Department of Gynecology, Radboud University Medical Center (Radboudumc), Nijmegen, The Netherlands; and.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Laboratory of Hematology.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Laboratory of Hematology.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Laboratory of Hematology.', 'Department of Hematology, and.', 'Department of Hematology, and.', 'Department of Hematology, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Laboratory of Hematology.', 'Department of Hematology, and.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Laboratory of Hematology.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171114,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Il2rg protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin Receptor Common gamma Subunit)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/*therapeutic use', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Decitabine/*therapeutic use', 'Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Interleukin Receptor Common gamma Subunit/genetics', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*transplantation', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID']",PMC5757681,,2017/11/16 06:00,2019/05/08 06:00,['2017/11/16 06:00'],"['2017/06/22 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/08 06:00 [medline]', '2017/11/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)32564-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2017-06-790204 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2018 Jan 11;131(2):202-214. doi: 10.1182/blood-2017-06-790204.

However, TKI are not yet curative, because most patients retain leukemic stem cells (LSC) and their progenitors in bone marrow and relapse following treatment cessation. At diagnosis, deregulation of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway is involved in LSC and progenitor expansion. Here, we report that BMP pathway alterations persist in TKI-resistant patients. In comparison with patients in complete cytogenetic remission, TKI-resistant LSC and progenitors display high levels of BMPR1b expression and alterations of its cellular localization. In vitro treatment of immature chronic phase CML cells with TKI alone, or in combination with interferon-alpha, results in the preferential survival of BMPR1b(+) cells. We demonstrated persistent and increasing BMP4 production by patients' mesenchymal cells with resistance. Patient follow-up revealed an increase of BMPR1b expression and in BMP4 expression in LSC from TKI-resistant patients in comparison with diagnosis, while remaining unchanged in sensitive patients. Both leukemic and nonleukemic cells exhibit higher BMP4 levels in the bone marrow of TKI-resistant patients. Exposure to BMP2/BMP4 does not alter BCR-ABL transcript expression but is accompanied by the overexpression of TWIST-1, a transcription factor highly expressed in resistant LSC. By modulating BMP4 or BMPR1b expression, we show that these elements are involved in TKI resistance. In summary, we reveal that persistence of BMP alterations and existence of an autocrine loop promote CML-primitive cells' TKI resistance.",['(c) 2017 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Grockowiak, Elodie', 'Laperrousaz, Bastien', 'Jeanpierre, Sandrine', 'Voeltzel, Thibault', 'Guyot, Boris', 'Gobert, Stephanie', 'Nicolini, Franck E', 'Maguer-Satta, Veronique']","['Grockowiak E', 'Laperrousaz B', 'Jeanpierre S', 'Voeltzel T', 'Guyot B', 'Gobert S', 'Nicolini FE', 'Maguer-Satta V']","['Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) Unite Mixte de Recherche (UMR) and.', 'INSERM Unite 1052, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Lyon (CRCL), Lyon, France.', 'Universite de Lyon, Lyon, France.', 'Department of Signaling of Tumor Escape, CRCL, Lyon, France.', 'Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) Unite Mixte de Recherche (UMR) and.', 'INSERM Unite 1052, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Lyon (CRCL), Lyon, France.', 'Universite de Lyon, Lyon, France.', 'Department of Signaling of Tumor Escape, CRCL, Lyon, France.', 'CNRS UMR 5672, Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon, Lyon, France.', 'Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) Unite Mixte de Recherche (UMR) and.', 'INSERM Unite 1052, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Lyon (CRCL), Lyon, France.', 'Universite de Lyon, Lyon, France.', 'Department of Signaling of Tumor Escape, CRCL, Lyon, France.', 'Centre Leon Berard, Lyon, France.', 'Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) Unite Mixte de Recherche (UMR) and.', 'INSERM Unite 1052, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Lyon (CRCL), Lyon, France.', 'Universite de Lyon, Lyon, France.', 'Department of Signaling of Tumor Escape, CRCL, Lyon, France.', 'Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) Unite Mixte de Recherche (UMR) and.', 'INSERM Unite 1052, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Lyon (CRCL), Lyon, France.', 'Universite de Lyon, Lyon, France.', 'Department of Signaling of Tumor Escape, CRCL, Lyon, France.', 'Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) Unite Mixte de Recherche (UMR) and.', 'INSERM Unite 1052, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Lyon (CRCL), Lyon, France.', 'Universite de Lyon, Lyon, France.', 'Department of Signaling of Tumor Escape, CRCL, Lyon, France.', 'Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) Unite Mixte de Recherche (UMR) and.', 'INSERM Unite 1052, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Lyon (CRCL), Lyon, France.', 'Universite de Lyon, Lyon, France.', 'Department of Signaling of Tumor Escape, CRCL, Lyon, France.', 'Centre Leon Berard, Lyon, France.', 'Hematology Department, Centre Hospitalier Lyon Sud, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Pierre-Benite, France; and.', 'French Group of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) (Fi-LMC), Institut Bergonie, Bordeaux, France.', 'Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) Unite Mixte de Recherche (UMR) and.', 'INSERM Unite 1052, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Lyon (CRCL), Lyon, France.', 'Universite de Lyon, Lyon, France.', 'Department of Signaling of Tumor Escape, CRCL, Lyon, France.', 'French Group of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) (Fi-LMC), Institut Bergonie, Bordeaux, France.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20171114,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (BMP4 protein, human)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (TWIST1 protein, human)', '0 (Twist-Related Protein 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.30 (BMPR1B protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.30 (Bone Morphogenetic Protein Receptors, Type I)']",IM,,"['*Autocrine Communication', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4/analysis/metabolism', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein Receptors, Type I/analysis/metabolism', 'Bone Morphogenetic Proteins/analysis/*metabolism', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/analysis/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Twist-Related Protein 1/analysis/metabolism']",,,2017/11/16 06:00,2018/01/25 06:00,['2017/11/16 06:00'],"['2017/08/08 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/25 06:00 [medline]', '2017/11/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)32603-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2017-08-801019 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2017 Dec 28;130(26):2860-2871. doi: 10.1182/blood-2017-08-801019.

METHODS: We conducted a multisite retrospective observational time series study from 2005 to 2013. We implemented academic detailing as the intervention of an antimicrobial stewardship programme in leukaemia units at a hospital, piloted February-July 2010, then fully implemented December 2010-March 2013, with no intervention in August-November 2010. Internal control was the same hospital's allogeneic haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation unit. External control was the combined leukaemia-haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation unit at another hospital. Primary outcome was antimicrobial utilization (antibiotics and antifungals) in defined daily dose per 100 patient-days (PD). Secondary outcomes were antimicrobial cost (Canadian dollars per PD); cost and utilization by drug class; length of stay; 30-day inpatient mortality; and nosocomial Clostridium difficile infection. We used autoregressive integrated moving average models to evaluate the impact of the intervention on outcomes. RESULTS: The intervention group included 1006 patients before implementation and 335 during full implementation. Correspondingly, internal control had 723 and 264 patients, external control 1395 and 864 patients. Antimicrobial utilization decreased significantly in the intervention group (p <0.01, 278 vs. 247 defined daily dose per 100 PD), increased in external control (p = 0.02, 237.4 vs. 268.9 defined daily dose per 100 PD) and remained stable in internal control (p = 0.66). Antimicrobial cost decreased in the intervention group (p = 0.03; $154.59 per PD vs. $128.93 per PD), increased in external control (p = 0.01; $109.4 per PD vs. $135.97 per PD) but was stable in internal control (p = 0.27). Mortality, length of stay and nosocomial C. difficile rate in intervention group remained stable. CONCLUSIONS: The antimicrobial stewardship programme reduced antimicrobial use in leukaemia patients without affecting inpatient mortality and length of stay.","['Copyright (c) 2017 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious', 'Diseases.

Following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo-HSCT), pDC reconstitution in the BM and PB gradually attain levels similar to those in healthy individuals. We have investigated the recovery of pDC following allo-HSCT as a means to predict successful marrow engraftment. We retrospectively studied immune reconstitution of pDC in the BM of 48 patients following allo-HSCT for initial diagnoses of leukemia or other malignancies. Multi-parameter flow cytometry was used to detect the CD45(+)CD123(bright) HLA-DR(+) CD4(low) pDCs in BM aspirates at 2-14months (median 6months) post allo-HSCT. Percentages of pDCs were analyzed along with engraftment, acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), event-free survival, relapse and death over a period of up to 39months (median 30) following HSCT. We report that higher levels of pDCs in the BM post-HSCT are associated with successful engraftment, less severity of aGVHD, lower relapse rate, higher event-free survival and overall survival (P value <0.05 for all). pDC levels detected at a shorter time interval 2-8months (median 5months) following HSCT also showed similar results.

We have previously shown that mESCs seeded in a type I collagen matrix demonstrate a loss of pluripotent marker expression and differentiate towards an osteogenic lineage. In this study, we examined if this effect was mediated in part through Arginylglycylaspartic acid (RGD) dependent integrin activity and/or mechano-transduction. RESULTS: The results from this study suggest that mESC interaction with the local microenvironment through RGD dependent integrins play a role in the regulation of mESC core transcription factors (TF), Oct-4, Sox 2 and Nanog. Disruption of this interaction with a cyclic RGD peptide (cRGDfC) was sufficient to mimic the effect of a mechanical stimulus in terms of pluripotent gene expression, specifically, we observed that supplementation with cRGDfC, or mechanical stimulus, significantly influenced mESC pluripotency by down-regulating core transcription factors. Moreover, our results indicated that the presence of the cRGDfC peptide inhibited integrin expression and up-regulated early lineage markers (mesoderm and ectoderm) in a Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) dependent manner. When cRGDfC treated mESCs were injected in Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice, no tissue growth and/or teratoma formation was observed, suggesting that the process of mESC tumor formation in vivo is potentially dependent on integrin interaction. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the disruption of cell-integrin interaction via cRGDfC peptide can mimic the effect of mechanical stimulation on mESC pluripotency gene expression and also inhibit the tumorigenic potential of mESCs in vivo.",,"['Hazenbiller, Olesja', 'Duncan, Neil A', 'Krawetz, Roman J']","['Hazenbiller O', 'Duncan NA', 'Krawetz RJ']","['McCaig Institute for Bone and Joint Health, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.', 'McCaig Institute for Bone and Joint Health, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.', 'Department of Civil Engineering Schulich School of Engineering, University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada.', 'McCaig Institute for Bone and Joint Health, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada. rkrawetz@ucalgary.ca.', 'Department of Cell Biology and Anatomy, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, 3330 Hospital Drive N.W, Calgary, AB, T2N 4N1, Canada. rkrawetz@ucalgary.ca.']",['eng'],,"['RMF-82497/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada', '203436-2010/Canadian Network for Research and Innovation in Machining Technology,', 'Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada']",['Journal Article'],20171114,England,BMC Cell Biol,BMC cell biology,100966972,"['0 (Collagen Type I)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Peptides, Cyclic)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (cyclic arginine-glycine-aspartic acid peptide)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Biomechanical Phenomena/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Lineage/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Collagen Type I/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/*drug effects/genetics', 'Integrins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism/*physiology', 'Peptides, Cyclic/*pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",PMC5686896,,2017/11/16 06:00,2018/05/23 06:00,['2017/11/16 06:00'],"['2017/01/27 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/11/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12860-017-0148-6 [doi]', '10.1186/s12860-017-0148-6 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cell Biol. 2017 Nov 14;18(1):32. doi: 10.1186/s12860-017-0148-6.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Collagen type I', 'Confined compression', 'Cyclic RGD peptide', 'Embryonic stem cell', 'Integrins', 'Mechano-transduction']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The main outcome measure of the study was the rate of suspected cancer diagnoses made by GP within one year prior to the index date. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to estimate the relationship between defined demographic and clinical variables and suspected cancer diagnoses. This study included 31,628 individuals. Within the year prior to the confirmed cancer diagnosis, 5% of the population received suspected cancer diagnoses.

In cell lines overexpressing PML-RARA, and in the NB4 t(15;17)-positive cell line, FOXC1 expression was lower than in other non-APL cell lines, and increased following treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), due to functional binding of ATRA to the FOXC1 promoter region.

Here we report that upregulation of Mcl-1 (Myeloid cell leukemia-1) confers acquired resistance to Taxol in human gastric cancer. Mcl-1 is shown to be stabilized in Taxol -resistant gastric cancer cells because of the hyper-activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. The increased Mcl-1 prevents of the permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane, thereby blocking the Taxol-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, inhibition of Mcl-1 or PI3K/Akt pathway significantly reversed the resistant phenotype of Taxol-resistant human gastric cancer cells.

Crenolanib is a potent and selective inhibitor of wild-type as well as mutant isoforms of the class III receptor tyrosine kinases FLT3 and PDGFRalpha/beta. Notably, crenolanib inhibits constitutively active mutant-FLT3 isoforms resulting from amino acid substitutions of aspartic acid at codon 835, which is homologous to codon 816 in the KIT gene - suggesting sensitivity against mutant-KIT D816 isoforms as well. Here we demonstrate that crenolanib targets KIT D816 in SM and CBF AML models: crenolanib inhibits cellular proliferation and initiates apoptosis of mastocytosis cell lines expressing these mutations. Target-specificity was confirmed using an isogenic cell model. In addition, we demonstrate that KIT D816 mutations are targetable with clinically achievable doses of crenolanib. Further, a rationale to combine cladribine (2-CDA), the therapeutic standard in SM, with crenolanib is provided.

Our in vitro results showed that AML promyelocytic (HL60) and monocytic (THP1) (but not erythroid- HEL) lineages are well adapted to VEGF and lactate rich environment. Their metabolic adaptation relies on high rates of glycolysis to generate intermediates for PPP to support cell proliferation, and on the consumption of glycolysis-generated lactate to supply biomass and energy production. VEGF orchestrates this metabolic network by regulating MCT1 expression. Bromopyruvic acid (BPA) was proven to be an effective cytotoxic in AML, possibly transported by MCT1.

Some gene mutations are specific for MDS and were associated with disease subtypes, and the patterns of mutational pathways could be associated with progressive MDS. The patterns, frequencies and functional pathways of gene mutations are different, but somehow related, between MDS and AML. Multivariate analysis suggested that patients with >/= 2 mutations had poor progression-free survival, while GATA1/GATA2, DNMT3A and KRAS/NRAS mutations were associated with poor overall survival. Based on a novel system combining IPSS-R and molecular markers, these MDS patients were further divided into 3 more accurate prognostic subgroups. A panel of 11 target genes was proposed for genetic profiling of MDS. The study offers new insights into the molecular signatures of MDS and the genetic consistency between MDS and AML. Furthermore, results indicate that MDS could be classified by mutation combinations to guide the administration of individualized therapeutic interventions.",,"['Xu, Yuanyuan', 'Li, Yan', 'Xu, Qingyu', 'Chen, Yuelong', 'Lv, Na', 'Jing, Yu', 'Dou, Liping', 'Bo, Jian', 'Hou, Guangyuan', 'Guo, Jing', 'Wang, Xiuli', 'Wang, Lili', 'Li, Yonghui', 'Chen, Chongjian', 'Yu, Li']","['Xu Y', 'Li Y', 'Xu Q', 'Chen Y', 'Lv N', 'Jing Y', 'Dou L', 'Bo J', 'Hou G', 'Guo J', 'Wang X', 'Wang L', 'Li Y', 'Chen C', 'Yu L']","['Department of Hematology and BMT center, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Hainan Branch of Chinese PLA General Hospital, Sanya 572013, Hainan Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology and BMT center, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Hainan Branch of Chinese PLA General Hospital, Sanya 572013, Hainan Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology and BMT center, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.', 'Medical school of Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, China.', 'Annoroad Gene Technology Co.

Unlike other MLL translocations, MLL-AF4-induced proB-ALL is exceptionally difficult to model in mice/humans. Previous work has investigated the relevance of the reciprocal translocation fusion protein AF4-MLL for t(4;11) leukemia, finding that AF4-MLL is capable of inducing proB-ALL without requirement for MLL-AF4 when expressed in murine hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs). Therefore, AF4-MLL might represent a key genetic lesion contributing to t(4;11)-driven leukemogenesis. Here, we aimed to establish a humanized mouse model by using AF4-MLL to analyze its transformation potential in human cord blood-derived CD34(+) HSPCs. We show that AF4-MLL-expressing human CD34(+) HSPCs provide enhanced long-term hematopoietic reconstitution in primary immunodeficient recipients but are not endowed with subsequent self-renewal ability upon serial transplantation. Importantly, expression of AF4-MLL in primary neonatal CD34(+) HSPCs failed to render any phenotypic or hematological sign of disease, and was therefore not sufficient to initiate leukemia within a 36-week follow-up. Species-specific (epi)-genetic intrinsic determinants may underlie the different outcome observed when AF4-MLL is expressed in murine or human HSPCs.",,"['Prieto, Cristina', 'Marschalek, Rolf', 'Kuhn, Alessa', 'Bursen, Adelheid', 'Bueno, Clara', 'Menendez, Pablo']","['Prieto C', 'Marschalek R', 'Kuhn A', 'Bursen A', 'Bueno C', 'Menendez P']","['Department of Biomedicine, Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, School of Medicine, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institute of Pharmaceutical Biology/DCAL, Goethe-University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmaceutical Biology/DCAL, Goethe-University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmaceutical Biology/DCAL, Goethe-University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Department of Biomedicine, Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, School of Medicine, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CIBERONC), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Biomedicine, Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, School of Medicine, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CIBERONC), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institucio Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avancats, Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],20170726,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,,,,PMC5669860,,2017/11/16 06:00,2017/11/16 06:01,['2017/11/16 06:00'],"['2017/04/19 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/11/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/16 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.19567 [doi]', '19567 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Jul 26;8(47):81936-81941. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.19567. eCollection 2017 Oct 10.,,['NOTNLM'],"['AF4-MLL', 'B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'CD34 HSPCs', 'leukemogenesis']",,['CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS The authors have nothing to disclose.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, most of the patients will lose their response after a few years. Defining the outcome of patients with LEN failure and determining the impact of subsequent therapies is therefore important to develop alternative strategies. Based on an international collaboration, we were able to compile a total of 392 patient cases of lower-risk MDS patients with 5q deletion and to analyze their outcome after failure of lenalidomide. The median survival following LEN failure was 23 months. We observed a negative impact on survival of advanced age, higher bone marrow blast count at LEN initiation, progression after LEN failure, and unfavorable cytogenetics. Among the treatment strategies, we observed a relatively prolonged survival of patients treated subsequently with hypomethylating agents and only a limited impact on survival of allogeneic transplantation.

The full capacity of T cell immune surveillance is dependent on T cell homeostasis, particularly for central memory T (TCM) cells and stem cell memory T (TSCM) cells. In this study, distribution of T cell subsets in peripheral blood from 12 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and 12 cases with CML in complete remission (CR) was analyzed using a multicolor flow cytometer, and 16 samples from healthy individuals (HIs) served as control. The proportion of CD8(+) TSCM and CD4(+) and CD8(+) TCM cells were lower, while CD4(+) effector memory T (TEM) cells and CD4(+) and CD8(+) terminal effector T (TEF) cells were higher in CML patients compared with HIs. Moreover, the proportion of CD8(+)CD28(-) T cells, which were found to have the immune suppressive function, increased in the naive T (TN) cell and TCM subsets in CML patients compared with HIs. Our study reveals that elimination of leukemia cells by treating with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) restores the memory T cell distribution from a skewed pattern in CML patients who are under leukemia burden, indicating that leukemia-specific immune responses mediated by T cells might be induced and maintained in CML patients, however, these responsive T cells might gradually become exhausted due to the continued existence of leukemia cells and their environment; therefore, T cell activation using a different approach remains a key point for enhancing global T cell immunity in CML patients, even for those with CR status.",,"['Yao, Danlin', 'Xu, Ling', 'Tan, Jiaxiong', 'Zhang, Yikai', 'Lu, Shuai', 'Li, Mingde', 'Lu, Sichun', 'Yang, Lijian', 'Chen, Shaohua', 'Chen, Jie', 'Lai, Jing', 'Lu, Yuhong', 'Wu, Xiuli', 'Zha, Xianfeng', 'Li, Yangqiu']","['Yao D', 'Xu L', 'Tan J', 'Zhang Y', 'Lu S', 'Li M', 'Lu S', 'Yang L', 'Chen S', 'Chen J', 'Lai J', 'Lu Y', 'Wu X', 'Zha X', 'Li Y']","['Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Institute of Hematology, Jinan University, School of Medicine, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Institute of Hematology, Jinan University, School of Medicine, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Institute of Hematology, Jinan University, School of Medicine, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Institute of Hematology, Jinan University, School of Medicine, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Institute of Hematology, Jinan University, School of Medicine, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Institute of Hematology, Jinan University, School of Medicine, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Institute of Hematology, Jinan University, School of Medicine, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Institute of Hematology, Jinan University, School of Medicine, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Institute of Hematology, Jinan University, School of Medicine, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Institute of Hematology, Jinan University, School of Medicine, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Institute of Hematology, Jinan University, School of Medicine, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],20170916,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,,,,PMC5669853,,2017/11/16 06:00,2017/11/16 06:01,['2017/11/16 06:00'],"['2017/06/28 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/11/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/11/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/16 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.20965 [doi]', '20965 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Sep 16;8(47):81852-81859. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.20965. eCollection 2017 Oct 10.,,['NOTNLM'],"['CML', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunology and Microbiology Section', 'TKI', 'TSCM', 'memory T cells']",,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For some cancers, such as acute myeloid leukaemia, chemotherapy is one of preferential methods. However, due to the lack of selectivity to cancer cells, cytostatic agents cause toxicity to normal tissues. Here, we study the effect of doxorubicin (DOX) on the mechanical properties of DNA molecules, leukemic blast cells and erythrocytes, using optical tweezers. In addition, we controlled the subcellular distribution of the drug by confocal microscopy. Our results indicated that doxorubicin affects mechanical properties of cellular structures. In all cases the drug reduced mechanical strength of examined objects. For the leukemic cells the drug subcellular distribution was predominantly nuclear with some particulate cytoplasmic fluorescence. In erythrocytes, doxorubicin showed fluorescence mainly in cytoplasm and plasma membrane. The lowering of blast cells stiffness may be due to the interaction of doxorubicin with nuclear structures, especially with nucleic acids, as our studies with DNA confirmed. In addition, it is known that DOX inhibits the polymerization of actin and thus cytoskeletal modification may also be important in reducing of cell mechanical strength. In the case of erythrocytes - the non-nucleated cells, a significant effect on the decrease of cell stiffness, besides the cytoskeleton, may have the interaction of the drug with the cell membrane. Experiments with model phospholipid membranes confirmed that observed increase in cell elasticity originates, among other things, from the drug incorporation in the lipid membrane itself. The lowering of mechanical strength of leukemic cells may have an significant impact on the effectiveness of chemotherapy. However, the fact that doxorubicin interacts not only with proliferating cancer cells, but also with the health ones may explains the high toxicity of the drug at the therapeutic concentrations. Our observations also suggest that chemotherapy with doxorubicin may decrease the risk of vascular complications in acute leukemia, due to increasing the cell elasticity.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

MiR-182-5p functions as an oncogene or a potential suppressive miRNA in cancers, but its expression and function in AML is unknown. The purpose is to investigate the roles of miR-182-5p in AML in this study. MiR-182-5p was examined in the blood samples of AML and it was found that miR-182-5p expression levels were higher in AML tissues than it in their normal controls, so did in the AML cells. BCL2L12 and BCL2 were predicted as target genes of miR-182-5p and verified using luciferase reporter assay. BCL2L12 and BCL2 mRNA and protein levels were up-regulated in the AML cells with miR-182-5p inhibition. Cellular function of miR-182-5p indicated that miR-182-5p suppression in AML cells could decrease cell proliferation and reverse cisplatin (DDP) resistance via targeting BCL2L12 and BCL2 expression. Inhibition of miR-182-5p promoted AML cell apoptosis by targeting BCL2 or BCL2L12.

Methods: Until December 31st 2016, 18 patients using nilotinib and 83 using imatinib were recruited in our study. The efficacy and safety of two groups were evaluated. Results: A total of 101 patients with CML-CP included 18 receiving nilotinib and 83 imatinib. The optimal response rates at 3, 6, 12 and 18 months in nilotinib and imatinib group were 88.9% (16/18) vs 57.3% (47/82) (P=0.012), 82.4% (14/17) vs 55.7% (44/79) (P=0.041), 9/12 vs 63.9% (39/61) (P=0.460), 6/9 vs 68.9% (31/45) (P=0.896) respectively. The optimal response rates by 3 months in low sokal risk group on nilotinib and imatinib were 9/9 vs 76.5%(26/34) (P=0.107), in intermediate and high sokal risk group were 7/8 vs 45.2%(14/31) (P=0.032). At the end of follow-up, the rate of major molecular response (MMR) in nilotinib group was 72.2%, which was higher than 56.6% in imatinib group (P=0.021). The rate of complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) in nilotinib group was 100%, which was higher than 71.1% in imatinib group (P = 0.002). Progression free survival (PFS) rates in nilotinib and imatinib groups were 94.4% and 98.8% (P=0.019) respectively; whereas event free survival (EFS) rates were 88.9% and 48.2% (P=0.045). The incidence of drug related adverse reactions in nilotinib and imatinib was similar with only minor proportion of grade 3/4 adverse reactions. Conclusions: Nilotinib achieves a deeper molecular response in a shorter time than imatinib in newly diagnosed patients with CML-CP, especially in patients with high risk outcome.

Methods: Fifty-three cases of TLTS were selected from the pathologic files from Peking University People's Hospital from April 2002 to April 2017. According to WHO classification of tumors of hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues (2008) and its updated classification (2016), the cases were studied by microscopy, immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, combined with the bone marrow biopsy and clinical examination. Results: In 53 cases of TLTS, the male to female ratio was 3.4ratio1.0; the mean age was 55.4 years (range 21-76 years), and all patients presented with variable degree of splenomegaly. Laboratory examination showed increased percentage of lymphocyte in peripheral blood in 22 cases, and elevated serum LDH level in 24 cases. Abnormal blood counts were seen in 26 cases pre-operatively, in which 22 cases showed complete or partial correction of these abnormalities post-operatively (84.6%, 22/26). The clinical symptoms included abdominal pain or distension, fatigue, fever, and weight loss, etc. Seventeen cases presented with lymphadenopathy of abdomen or other sites. Bone marrow biopsy was performed in 30 cases, and 19 cases were involved by tumor (63.3%). Of all 53 cases, 43 were diagnosed as primary splenic lymphoma (PSL), and the remaining 10 cases as secondary TLTS. According to Ann Arbor staging, 14 cases were stages or , 6 were stage and 28 were stage . By histopathologic classification, 43 cases of PSL were splenic B-cell marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL; 48.8%, 21/43), diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL; 23.3%, 10/43), splenic diffuse red pulp small B-cell lymphoma (11.6%, 5/43), mantle cell lymphoma (9.3%, 4/43), follicular lymphoma (4.7%, 2/43), and composite lymphoma (CL, DLBCL and classical Hodgkin lymphoma; 2.3%, 1/43). The remaining 10 cases were chronic lymphocytic leukaemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (4 cases), hairy cell leukaemia (1 case), hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTL; 5 cases), with lesions in other sites. Of the 53 cases of TLTS, 47 were B cell neoplasm (88.7%, 47/53), and the T cell neoplasms were all HSTL(5 cases, 9.4%, 5/53), 1 case was composite lymphoma. In 11 cases of TLTS, EBER in situ hybridization was performed and all cases were negative. Forty eight cases had follow-up data, and the median survival period was 17.0 months(range: 1-96 months). The survival of patients with SMZL and DLBCL were 25.7 and 18.6 months respectively. Thirteen patients died (27.1%, 13/48). The prognosis of those with elevated LDH level, high clinical stage, B symptoms and older than 60 years of age was worse. And the prognosis of DLBCL was worse than that of SMZL. There was no statistically significant difference between these factors and prognosis (P>0.05). Conclusions: Most TLTS cases present with splenomegaly and abnormal blood counts, and complete or partial remission of blood counts isseen after splenectomy. The most common pathologic types of TLTS are SMZL and DLBCL. Definite diagnosis of TLTS could be made by combining clinical features, histopathology, immunophenotype, genetics, bone marrow biopsy and laboratory examination.",,"['Chen, D B', 'Shen, D H', 'Zhang, H', 'Wang, Y', 'Song, Q J', 'Yang, S M', 'Fang, X Z']","['Chen DB', 'Shen DH', 'Zhang H', 'Wang Y', 'Song QJ', 'Yang SM', 'Fang XZ']","[""Department of Pathology, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing 100044, China.""]",['chi'],,,['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Bing Li Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua bing li xue za zhi = Chinese journal of pathology,0005331,,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/pathology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Splenectomy', 'Splenic Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Splenomegaly/diagnosis', 'Young Adult']",,,2017/11/15 06:00,2017/12/27 06:00,['2017/11/15 06:00'],"['2017/11/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0529-5807.2017.11.008 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Bing Li Xue Za Zhi. 2017 Nov 8;46(11):775-781. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0529-5807.2017.11.008.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Diagnosis, differential', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lymphoma, B-cell', 'Splenic neoplasms']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 2015, the International Agency for Research on Cancer classified glyphosate as ""probably carcinogenic to humans,"" noting strong mechanistic evidence and positive associations for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in some epidemiologic studies. A previous evaluation in the Agricultural Health Study (AHS) with follow-up through 2001 found no statistically significant associations with glyphosate use and cancer at any site. Methods: The AHS is a prospective cohort of licensed pesticide applicators from North Carolina and Iowa. Here, we updated the previous evaluation of glyphosate with cancer incidence from registry linkages through 2012 (North Carolina)/2013 (Iowa). Lifetime days and intensity-weighted lifetime days of glyphosate use were based on self-reported information from enrollment (1993-1997) and follow-up questionnaires (1999-2005). We estimated incidence rate ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using Poisson regression, controlling for potential confounders, including use of other pesticides. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: Among 54 251 applicators, 44 932 (82.8%) used glyphosate, including 5779 incident cancer cases (79.3% of all cases). In unlagged analyses, glyphosate was not statistically significantly associated with cancer at any site. However, among applicators in the highest exposure quartile, there was an increased risk of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) compared with never users (RR = 2.44, 95% CI = 0.94 to 6.32, Ptrend = .11), though this association was not statistically significant. Results for AML were similar with a five-year (RRQuartile 4 = 2.32, 95% CI = 0.98 to 5.51, Ptrend = .07) and 20-year exposure lag (RRTertile 3 = 2.04, 95% CI = 1.05 to 3.97, Ptrend = .04). Conclusions: In this large, prospective cohort study, no association was apparent between glyphosate and any solid tumors or lymphoid malignancies overall, including NHL and its subtypes.

Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) is frequently altered in DLBCL and inhibition of HDAC6 has potent anti-tumor effects in vitro and in vivo. We profiled miRNAs that altered in the HDAC6 knockdown DLBCL cells with NanoString nCounter assay and identified microRNA-27b (miR-27b) as the most significantly increased miRNA. We validated decreased expression of miR-27b in DLBCL tissues, and we found that low expression of miR-27b was associated with poor overall survival of patients with DLBCL. In addition, forced expression of miR-27b suppressed DLBCL cell viability and proliferation in vitro, and inhibited tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, Rel A/p65 is found to negatively regulate miR-27b expression, and its acetylation and block of nuclear translocalization caused by HDAC6 inhibition significantly elevates miR-27b expression. Furthermore, miR-27b targets MET and thus represses the MET/PI3K/AKT pathway. These findings highlight an important role of miR-27b in the development of DLBCL and uncover a HDAC6-Rel A/p65-miR-27b-MET signaling pathway.

All the compounds were tested for their in vitro ability to inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), and the selectivity of compounds to individual cholinesterases was determined. Screening of the cytotoxicity of all the compounds was performed using a human monocytic leukaemia THP-1 cell line, and the compounds demonstrated insignificant toxicity. All the compounds showed rather moderate inhibitory effect against AChE; benzyl (2S)-2-[(2-chlorophenyl)carbamoyl]pyrrolidine-1-carboxylate (IC50 = 46.35 muM) was the most potent agent. On the other hand, benzyl (2S)-2-[(4-bromophenyl)-] and benzyl (2S)-2-[(2-bromophenyl)carbamoyl]pyrrolidine-1-carboxylates expressed anti-BChE activity (IC50 = 28.21 and 27.38 muM, respectively) comparable with that of rivastigmine. The ortho-brominated compound as well as benzyl (2S)-2-[(2-hydroxyphenyl)carbamoyl]pyrrolidine-1-carboxylate demonstrated greater selectivity to BChE. The in silico characterization of the structure-inhibitory potency for the set of proline-based carbamates considering electronic, steric and lipophilic properties was provided using comparative molecular surface analysis (CoMSA) and principal component analysis (PCA). Moreover, the systematic space inspection with splitting data into the training/test subset was performed to monitor the statistical estimators performance in the effort to map the probability-guided pharmacophore pattern. The comprehensive screening of the AChE/BChE profile revealed potentially relevant structural and physicochemical features that might be essential for mapping of the carbamates inhibition efficiency indicating qualitative variations exerted on the reaction site by the substituent in the 3'-/4'-position of the phenyl ring.

They are characterized by stem cell-derived clonal proliferation, harbor Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), or calreticulin (CALR), or myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene (MPL) driver mutations and exert an over activated JAK-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway. Therefore JAK inhibiting strategies have been successfully investigated in MPN clinical trials. Areas covered: The present review aims to provide a concise overview of the current and future role of JAK inhibitors in the therapeutic armamentarium of MPN. Expert opinion: The JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib has clearly enriched the therapeutic armamentarium of MPN and is now licenced for more than five years in MF and over three years as second line in PV. Momelotinib, although of limited activity in MPN trials, demonstrated unique property of improving MF associated anemia. Less myelosuppressive or more selective JAK inhibitors like pacritinib, NS-01872 or Itacitinib are new promising agents tested in MF.

The purpose of this pilot study was to analyze mitochondrial DNA copy number and mitochondrial DNA integrity. PROCEDURE: Copy number and mitochondrial deletion ratios were estimated in the bone marrow of 51 patients and peripheral blood of 30 healthy controls using quantitative real-time PCR. The copy number values were correlated with prognostic markers in patients. RESULTS: Significantly increased mitochondrial DNA copy number (P-value < 0.0001) and increased mitochondrial deletion ratios (P-value = 0.0018) were observed in patients compared with controls. The copy numbers were significantly decreased in patients after chemotherapy (P-value = 0.0232). Patients with higher copy numbers exhibited significantly inferior survival than patients with lower copy numbers (for event-free survival, P-value = 0.04 and overall survival, P-value = 0.1175). CONCLUSIONS: Significant decreases in mitochondrial DNA copy number with therapy indicates that copy number could be evaluated as a potential marker for therapeutic efficacy and a higher mitochondrial DNA copy number could be a poor prognostic marker.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Jain, Ayushi', 'Bakhshi, Sameer', 'Thakkar, Himani', 'Gerards, Mike', 'Singh, Archna']","['Jain A', 'Bakhshi S', 'Thakkar H', 'Gerards M', 'Singh A']","['Department of Biochemistry, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, B.R.

Patients with MDS/MPNs initially received ruxolitinib BID (doses based on platelets count), continuously in 28-day cycles for the first 3 cycles. Azacytidine 25 mg/m(2) (Day 1-5) intravenously or subcutaneously was recommended to be added to each cycle starting cycle 4 and could be increased to 75 mg/m(2) (Days 1-5) for disease control. Azacytidine could be started earlier than cycle 4 and/or at higher dose in patients with rapidly proliferative disease or with elevated blasts. Thirty-five patients were treated (MDS/MPN-U, n =14; CMML, n =17; aCML, n =4), with a median follow-up of 15.2 months (range, 1.0-41.5). All patients were evaluable by the 2015 international consortium proposal of response criteria for MDS/MPNs (ICP MDS/MPN) and 20 (57%) responded. Nine patients (45%) responded after the addition of azacytidine. A greater than 50% reduction in palpable splenomegaly at 24 weeks was noted in 9/14 (64%) patients. Responders more frequently were JAK2-mutated (P = .02) and had splenomegaly (P = .03) compared to nonresponders.

The sera were analyzed for BHV-1 specific antibodies, BVDV specific antibodies and BVDV antigen using the ELISA, and BLV nucleic acid using PCR. The seropositivity rate was 9.0% for BVDV-specific antibody, although 41.4% of camels tested were positive for BVDV antigen. Moreover, there was no evidence of BHV-1 and BLV infections. The results indicated that camels might represent an important source for BVDV infection in all ruminants, including cattle, sheep, and goats bred in mixed herds in Algeria, since they had a higher BVDV prevalence rates.

In diabetes, this process is thought to account for a significant number of cardiovascular disease-associated death and disability. However, the molecular mechanisms by which diabetes contributes to endothelial inflammation remain to be established. Whilst there is some evidence linking hyperglycaemia-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation by the mitochondrial electron-transport chain to oxidative stress, cellular injury and apoptosis in the endothelium, a clear link to endothelium inflammation has not yet been established. The mitochondrial molecular stress protein Hsp60 is known to be secreted from mammalian cells and is capable of activating pro-inflammatory mediators on target cells expressing Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Hsp60 is also known to be elevated in serum of diabetes patients and has been shown to be upregulated by hyperglycaemic growth conditions in cultured human HeLa cells. This study shows that Hsp60 induced in human acute monocyte leukaemia cell line (THP-1) cells grown under hyperglycaemic conditions (25 mM glucose) was able to be secreted into growth media. Furthermore, the secretion of Hsp60 from THP-1 cells was able to be inhibited by 5,5-(N-N-dimethyl)-amiloride hydrochloride (DMA), an exosomal inhibitor. Interestingly, the conditioned media obtained from THP-1 cells grown in the presence of 25 mM glucose was able to induce the secretion of TNF-alpha in human vascular endothelium cell line (HUVEC). When conditioned media was immuno-depleted of Hsp60, there was a significant reduction in the release of TNF-alpha from the HUVEC cells. This suggests that a potential link may exist between hyperglycaemia-induced expression of Hsp60 in monocyte cells and vascular inflammation. Circulating levels of Hsp60 due to mitochondrial stress in diabetes patients could therefore be an important modulator of inflammation in endothelial cells and thus contribute to the increased incidences of atherosclerosis in diabetes mellitus.",,"['Martinus, Ryan Dennis', 'Goldsbury, Julie']","['Martinus RD', 'Goldsbury J']","['School of Science, Faculty of Science & Engineering, The University of Waikato, Hamilton, New Zealand. martinus@waikato.ac.nz.', 'School of Science, Faculty of Science & Engineering, The University of Waikato, Hamilton, New Zealand.']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],20171113,Netherlands,Cell Stress Chaperones,Cell stress & chaperones,9610925,"['0 (Chaperonin 60)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)']",IM,,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Chaperonin 60/*metabolism', 'Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hyperglycemia/*pathology', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Monocytes/*metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*metabolism']",PMC6045554,,2017/11/15 06:00,2019/01/27 06:00,['2017/11/15 06:00'],"['2017/07/04 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/10/12 00:00 [revised]', '2017/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/27 06:00 [medline]', '2017/11/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12192-017-0858-x [doi]', '10.1007/s12192-017-0858-x [pii]']",ppublish,Cell Stress Chaperones. 2018 Jul;23(4):519-525. doi: 10.1007/s12192-017-0858-x.

An ATF7IP/PDGFRB fusion was recently identified in a Philadelphia chromosome-like (Ph-like) B-progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) patient. Here we report on a special case of a Ph-like ALL patient who had a variant ATF7IP/PDGFRB fusion. CASE REPORT In this case, a variant fusion was created between ATF7IP exon 9 (instead of exon 13) and PDGFRB exon 11, resulting in the loss of 411 nucleotides and 137 amino acids in the ATF7IP/PDGFRB fusion cDNA and its encoded chimeric protein, respectively. Interestingly, ATF7IP has also been reported as a fusion partner of the JAK2 kinase gene in Ph-like ALL, but all of the genomic breakpoints in ATF7IP in this fusion reported thus far occurred in intron 13. Enforced expression of the variant ATF7IP/PDGFRB fusion induced cytokine-independent growth and glucocorticoid resistance of BaF3 cells. Similar to the initially described ATF7IP/PDGFRB-bearing Ph-like ALL patient who was refractory to conventional chemotherapy but highly sensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) monotherapy, our patient with a variant ATF7IP/PDGFRB fusion had a poor initial treatment response to chemotherapy but responded well to TKI-based therapy and is now doing well in continuous remission.

Antibodies directed against HLA-DR have demonstrated some clinical success, but toxicities limited development. IMMU-140 is an anti-HLA-DR antibody-drug conjugate composed of the active metabolite of irinotecan, SN-38, conjugated to a humanized anti-HLA-DR IgG4 antibody (IMMU-114); the IgG4 naked antibody is devoid of immune functions. Our aim was to determine if SN-38, the metabolite of a drug not commonly used in hematopoietic cancers, would be effective and safe when targeted to HLA-DR-expressing tumors. IMMU-140 had dual-therapeutic mechanisms, as evidenced by its retention of nonoverlapping anti-HLA-DR nonclassical apoptotic signaling and classical apoptosis mediated by its SN-38 payload. In seven human disease models [acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), multiple myeloma (MM), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), and melanoma], IMMU-140 provided significant therapeutic efficacy compared with controls, in vitro, in 3D spheroid models, and in vivo Except for MM and HL, IMMU-140 imparted significantly improved antitumor effects compared with parental IMMU-114. Even in intractable AML and ALL, where IMMU-114 only had modest antitumor effects, IMMU-140 therapy mediated >80% improvement in survival. Therapy was well tolerated, as demonstrated by no marked loss in body weight. Combined with doxorubicin, IMMU-140 produced significantly greater antitumor effects in HL than with monotherapy and without any added toxicity. The dual-therapeutic action of IMMU-140 resulted in promising therapeutic activity in a range of hematopoietic tumors and melanoma, and therefore warrants clinical development.

Conventional clinical diagnostics, including cytogenetics and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) fail to detect MLL translocation partner genes (TPG) in many patients. Long-distance inverse (LDI)-PCR, the ""gold standard"" technique that is used to characterize MLL breakpoints, is laborious and requires a large input of genomic DNA (gDNA). To overcome the limitations of current techniques, a targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) approach that requires low RNA input was tested. Anchored multiplex PCR-based enrichment (AMP-E) was used to rapidly identify a broad range of MLL fusions in patient specimens. Libraries generated using Archer FusionPlex Heme and Myeloid panels were sequenced using the Illumina platform. Diagnostic specimens (n = 39) from pediatric leukemia patients were tested with AMP-E and validated by LDI-PCR. In concordance with LDI-PCR, the AMP-E method successfully identified TPGs without prior knowledge. AMP-E identified 10 different MLL fusions in the 39 samples. Only two specimens were discordant; AMP-E successfully identified a MLL-MLLT1 fusion where LDI-PCR had failed to determine the breakpoint, whereas a MLL-MLLT3 fusion was not detected by AMP-E due to low expression of the fusion transcript. Sensitivity assays demonstrated that AMP-E can detect MLL-AFF1 in MV4-11 cell dilutions of 10(-7) and transcripts down to 0.005 copies/ng.Implications: This study demonstrates a NGS methodology with improved sensitivity compared with current diagnostic methods for MLL-rearranged leukemia. Furthermore, this assay rapidly and reliably identifies MLL partner genes and patient-specific fusion sequences that could be used for monitoring minimal residual disease.

Our previous study identified several derivatives of tetrandrine showing better activities than parental compound against human hepatocellular carcinoma cells. To increase diversity and cytotoxic activities of the original compound, a series of novel 14-urea-tetrandrine derivatives were synthesized through structural modification of tetrandrine. These derivaties demonstrated a moderate to strong anti-proliferative activities against human cell lines HEL and K562 (Leukemia), prostate (PC3), breast (MDA-MB-231) and melanoma (WM9). Compound 4g showed strongest cytotoxic effect against PC3 cells with IC50 value of 0.64 muM, which was 12-fold, 31-fold and 26-fold lower than the parental tetrandrine, 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin, respectively. Preliminary structure-activity relationship study indicated that urea subsititution was the key pharmacophore for the enhancement of their antitumor activities. Induction of apoprosis by 4g was associated with the activation of pro-apoptotic protein BAX and inhibition of antiapoptosis proteins survivin as well as Bcl-2. Moreover, activation of caspases led to increase cleavage of PARP, which further accelerates apoptotic cell death.

There are four generations of CAR-T cells now. The complete remission rate of pediatric patients with relapse and refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia can be as high as 90% when treated with CD19-targeting CAR-T cells. Furthermore, CAR-T cell therapy can also be used to bridge to transplantation and donor CAR-T cell infusion can be a strategy to prevent relapse after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. As to solid tumors, only patients with neuroblastoma present good response to the GD2-targeting CAR-T cell therapy. The toxic or side effects of CAR-T cell therapy include cytokine release syndrome, off-tumor effect, tumor lysis syndrome, and insertion mutation.

METHODS: Jurkat cells were cultured in vitro and treated with various concentrations (0, 1.25, 2.5, 5, and 10 mumol/L) of oridonin for different lengths of time (24, 48, and 72 hours). The proliferation of Jurkat cells was analyzed by MTT assay. The changes in nuclear morphology were evaluated by fluorescence microscopy at 12 hours after treatment with various concentrations of oridonin. The expression levels of Brg1, P53, and C-myc were determined by semi-quantitative Western blot in Jurkat cells treated with various concentrations of oridonin for 24 hours or 5 mumol/L oridonin for various lengths of time (0, 2, 6, 12, and 24 hours). The expression levels of P53 and C-myc and proliferation of Jurkat cells were evaluated after Brg1 expression was knocked down by Brg1-specific siRNA. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the proliferation of oridonin-treated Jurkat cells was significantly inhibited in a concentration- and time-dependent manner (P<0.05). According to the florescence microscopic analysis, oridonin treatment led to nuclear pyknosis in Jurkat cells. Compared with the control group, Jurkat cells treated with 5 mumol/L oridonin had reduced expression of Brg1 and C-myc but elevated expression of P53. Brg1 knock-down led to a significant reduction in proliferation of Jurkat cells (P<0.05), up-regulated expression of P53, and down-regulated expression of C-myc.

We aimed to investigate the unique patterns and prognostic significance of miRNA expression in Korean patients with MDS. METHODS: Bone marrow mononuclear cells were collected from eight healthy controls and 26 patients with MDS, and miRNAs were isolated and assessed via quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction for selected miRNAs, including miR-21, miR-124a, miR-126, miR-146b-5p, miR-155, miR-182, miR-200c, miR-342-5p, miR-708, and Let-7a. RESULTS: MiR-124a, miR-155, miR-182, miR-200c, miR-342-5p, and Let-7a were significantly underexpressed in patients with MDS, compared to healthy controls. MiR-21, miR-126, 146b-5p, and miR-155 transcript levels were significantly lower in international prognostic scoring system lower (low and intermediate-1) risk MDS than in higher (intermediate-2 and high) risk MDS. Higher expression levels of miR-126 and miR-155 correlated with significantly shorter overall survival and leukemia-free survival. Higher miR-124a expression also tended to be related to shorter survivals.

Ten of 16 patients showed missense, nonsense, insertion or duplication mutations in 13 genes. In contrast to findings in MDS in the general population, mutations in genes involved in RNA splicing were rarely affected. Mutations in RUNX1 and genes of the RAS pathway appeared more instrumental in the pathogenesis of FA myeloid malignancies. RUNX1 mutations were associated with more advanced disease. Interestingly, one patient with refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts harbored the SF3B1 p.K700E mutation highlighting the mutation's causative role in MDS with ring sideroblasts even in the context of FA.

Quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to detect FOXQ1 expression in 117 NKTCL patients and 120 healthy controls. Additionally, FOXQ1 expression in NKTCL cell lines (HANK-1, NK-92, SNK-6, SNT-8 and YT) was determined by western blotting and qRT-PCR. SNK-6 cells were transfected with FOXQ1-shRNA or Shh pathway inhibitor Cyclopamine/recombinant protein Shh. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and 5-bromo-2-deoxy-uridine (BrdU) incorporation assays were conducted to detect cell proliferation, flow cytometry was used to determine the cell cycle and cell apoptosis, and western blotting was used to detect protein expression. FOXQ1 expression was higher in NKTCL patients than in healthy controls, which was related to Ann Arbor stage, bone marrow involvement and the 5year survival rate in NKTCL patients. Moreover, FOXQ1 expression, pathological type, Ann Arbor stage, B symptom and bone marrow involvement were independent risk factors in NKTCL. Shh pathway-related proteins were down-regulated after transfection of SNK-6 cells with FOXQ1-shRNA. Additionally, SNK-6 cell proliferation was greatly reduced, the cell cycle was blocked at the G0/G1 phase, and the expression of CyclinD1 and CyclinE was markedly decreased, while an increase in cell apoptosis with elevated Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) and Caspase-3 and reduced B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2) were also observed.

Current risk algorithms dichotomize MRD data and do not assimilate genetics when assigning MRD risk, which reduces predictive accuracy. The aim of our study was to exploit the full power of MRD by examining it as a continuous variable and to integrate it with genetics. Patients and Methods We used a population-based cohort of 3,113 patients who were treated in UKALL2003, with a median follow-up of 7 years. MRD was evaluated by polymerase chain reaction analysis of Ig/TCR gene rearrangements, and patients were assigned to a genetic subtype on the basis of immunophenotype, cytogenetics, and fluorescence in situ hybridization. To examine response kinetics at the end of induction, we log-transformed the absolute MRD value and examined its distribution across subgroups. Results MRD was log normally distributed at the end of induction. MRD distributions of patients with distinct genetic subtypes were different ( P < .001). Patients with good-risk cytogenetics demonstrated the fastest disease clearance, whereas patients with high-risk genetics and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia responded more slowly. The risk of relapse was correlated with MRD kinetics, and each log reduction in disease level reduced the risk by 20% (hazard ratio, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.77 to 0.83; P < .001). Although the risk of relapse was directly proportional to the MRD level within each genetic risk group, absolute relapse rate that was associated with a specific MRD value or category varied significantly by genetic subtype. Integration of genetic subtype-specific MRD values allowed more refined risk group stratification. Conclusion A single threshold for assigning patients to an MRD risk group does not reflect the response kinetics of the different genetic subtypes. Future risk algorithms should integrate genetics with MRD to accurately identify patients with the lowest and highest risk of relapse.",,"[""O'Connor, David"", 'Enshaei, Amir', 'Bartram, Jack', 'Hancock, Jeremy', 'Harrison, Christine J', 'Hough, Rachael', 'Samarasinghe, Sujith', 'Schwab, Claire', 'Vora, Ajay', 'Wade, Rachel', 'Moppett, John', 'Moorman, Anthony V', 'Goulden, Nick']","[""O'Connor D"", 'Enshaei A', 'Bartram J', 'Hancock J', 'Harrison CJ', 'Hough R', 'Samarasinghe S', 'Schwab C', 'Vora A', 'Wade R', 'Moppett J', 'Moorman AV', 'Goulden N']","[""David O'Connor, Jack Bartram, Sujith Samarasinghe, Ajay Vora, and Nick Goulden, Great Ormond Street Hospital; Rachael Hough, University College Hospital, London; Amir Enshaei, Christine J.

Often, clinical trials compare therapies that have different types, and severities, of adverse effects. Whether rated by clinicians or patients themselves, it can be difficult to know which side effect profile is more disruptive or bothersome to patients. A simple summary index of bother can help to adjudicate the variability in adverse effects across treatments being compared with each other. METHODS: Across 4 studies, a total of 5765 patients enrolled in cooperative group studies and industry-sponsored clinical trials were the subjects of the current study. Patients were diagnosed with a range of primary cancer sites, including bladder, brain, breast, colon/rectum, head/neck, hepatobiliary, kidney, lung, ovary, pancreas, and prostate as well as leukemia and lymphoma. All patients were administered the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General version (FACT-G). The single item ""I am bothered by side effects of treatment"" (GP5), rated on a 5-point Likert scale, is part of the FACT-G. To determine its validity as a useful summary measure from the patient perspective, it was correlated with individual and aggregated clinician-rated adverse events and patient reports of their general ability to enjoy life. RESULTS: Analyses of pharmaceutical trials demonstrated that mean GP5 scores (""I am bothered by side effects of treatment"") significantly differed by maximum adverse event grade (P<.001) in all trials, with a clear trend toward increasing GP5 scores with level of increasing adverse event grade. Effect sizes ranged from 0.13 to 0.46. Analyses of cooperative group trials demonstrated a significant correlation between GP5 and item GF3 (""I am able to enjoy life"") in the predicted direction. CONCLUSIONS: The single FACT-G item ""I am bothered by side effects of treatment"" is significantly associated with clinician-reported adverse events and with patients' ability to enjoy their lives. It has promise as an overall summary measure of the burden of a given set of treatment toxicities compared with another. Future research can identify the contribution of individual side effects compared with one another in terms of how each may contribute to overall bother. Cancer 2018;124:991-7.

Chlorambucil (CLB) had definitive treatment efficacy on low-malignant non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), but with unclear efficacy on highly malignant Burkitt lymphoma. A study has been shown that CLB could enhance the sensitivity of chronic lymphatic leukemia cells against TRAIL. This work aims to investigate the effect of CLB combined with TRAIL on in vitro proliferation and apoptosis of Raji cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: TRAIL (0, 20, 40 and 80 ng/ml) or CLB (0, 2.5 5 and 10 muM) was used to treat Raji cells. Cell counting kit 8 (CCK-8) was used to test proliferation whilst flow cytometry was employed to examine the apoptosis. The effect of TRAIL or CLB treatment on expression of death receptor 4 (DR4) and DR5 was tested. Combined treatment (80 ng/ml TRAIL and 10 muM CLB) was adopted for observing Raji cell proliferation and apoptosis. RESULTS: Single treatment of TRAIL or CLB has weak effects of inducing apoptosis or inhibiting proliferation. TRAIL concentration has no significant effects on DR4/DR5 expression in Raji cells, whilst CLB treatment elevated those gene expressions. Combined treatment of TRAIL and CLB had more potent effects regarding cell proliferation inhibition or apoptosis induction compared to single treatment. CONCLUSIONS: TRAIL or CLB has weak inhibitor effects on Raji cell proliferation or induction of apoptosis. Via up-regulating DR4 and DR5 expression, CLB has synergistic effects with TRAIL to potentiate the apoptotic induction and proliferation inhibition role.",,"['Guo, J-X', 'Zhou, Y-H', 'Huang, Y-Q', 'Liu, G-J', 'Pan, J-X']","['Guo JX', 'Zhou YH', 'Huang YQ', 'Liu GJ', 'Pan JX']","['Department of Hematology, the 2nd Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Fujian, China. guojianxinzxc@163.com.']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],,Italy,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,9717360,"['0 (Ki-67 Antigen)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Chlorambucil/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Ki-67 Antigen/metabolism', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/metabolism', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",,,2017/11/14 06:00,2018/08/17 06:00,['2017/11/14 06:00'],"['2017/11/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/11/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/17 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci. 2017 Oct;21(20):4703-4710.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clinical application of immunotherapeutic approaches has been limited by a lack of target antigens that discriminate malignant from healthy (normal) T cells. Unlike B cell depletion, pan-T cell aplasia is prohibitively toxic. We report a new targeting strategy based on the mutually exclusive expression of T cell receptor beta-chain constant domains 1 and 2 (TRBC1 and TRBC2). We identify an antibody with unique TRBC1 specificity and use it to demonstrate that normal and virus-specific T cell populations contain both TRBC1(+) and TRBC2(+) compartments, whereas malignancies are restricted to only one. As proof of concept for anti-TRBC immunotherapy, we developed anti-TRBC1 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, which recognized and killed normal and malignant TRBC1(+), but not TRBC2(+), T cells in vitro and in a disseminated mouse model of leukemia.

Tumor-derived exosomes (TEXs), which carry tumor associated antigens (TAA), may be a potential cell-free tumor vaccine for the specific eradication of MRLs. However, TEXs are intended to be less immunogenic due to exosomal TGF-beta1. To further optimize the efficacy of TEX-based vaccines, we investigated whether exosomes from TGF-beta1 silenced leukemia cells (LEXTGF-beta1si) had an increased potential to induce a specific antitumor effect compared with non-modified exosomes. METHODS: Exosomal TGF-beta1 was downregulated via lentiviral shRNA silencing of TGF-beta1 in leukemia cells. The characteristics of LEXTGF-beta1si were determined via electron microscopy, western blot analysis, and flow cytometry. The antitumor effect of LEXTGF-beta1si was evaluated by detecting the properties of LEXTGF-beta1si-pulsed dendritic cells (DCs), CD4+ T-cell proliferation, Th1 cytokine secretion, specific CTL activity, and NK cell function. Moreover, to verify the superiority of LEXTGF-beta1si immunization, LEXTGF-beta1si was subcutaneously injected into DBA/2 mice: either followed by tumor challenge or tumor bearing. RESULTS: The lentiviral shRNA silencing of TGF-beta1 in parental leukemia cells successfully downregulated the TGF-beta1 level in leukemia cell derived exosomes (LEX). LEXTGF-beta1si was uptaken by DCs and was more potent in promoting DC function by upregulating the surface expression of costimulatory factors and MHC class II molecules, while inducing the secretion of IL-12p70 and TNF-alpha. Furthermore, immunization with LEXTGF-beta1si facilitated CD4+ T-cell proliferation and Th1 cytokine secretion, and stimulated stronger specific cytotoxic lymphocyte (CTL) response and nature killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity more efficiently compared to non-modified LEX. In mice models, immunization with LEXTGF-beta1si resulted in a more potent capability to inhibit tumor growth and to prolong survival, suggesting that LEXTGF-beta1si was more effective in both protective and therapeutic antitumor tests than non-modified LEX. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggested that down-regulation of exosomal TGF-beta1 effectively induced potent anti-tumor immunity. Our strategy of optimizing exosome vaccine may have promising potential for leukemia immunotherapy.","['(c) 2017 The Author(s). Published by S.

Approximately 30% of newly diagnosed cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML) patients harbor the NPM1 mutation in India. In this study we compared the efficiency of three molecular techniques in detecting NPM1 mutation in peripheral blood and bone marrow samples. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a single-center cohort we analyzed 165 CN-AML bone marrow/peripheral blood samples for NPM1 mutation analysis. About 30% of the CN-AML samples revealed NPM1 mutations. For the detection, three methods were compared: Sanger sequencing, pyrosequencing, and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: NPM1 exon 12 mutations were observed in 52 (31.51%) of all CN-AML cases. The sensitivity of Sanger sequencing, pyrosequencing, and real-time PCR was 80%, 90%, and 95%, whereas specificity was 95%, 100%, and 100%, respectively. The minimum limit of mutation detection was 20%-30% for Sanger sequencing, 1%-5% for pyrosequencing, and 0.1%-1% for real-time PCR. CONCLUSION: The sequencing method, which is the reference method, has the lowest sensitivity and is sometimes difficult to interpret. Real-time PCR is a highly sensitive method for mutation detection but is limited for specific mutation types. In our study, pyrosequencing emerged as the most suitable technique for the detection of NPM1 mutations on the basis of its easy interpretation and less time-consuming processes than Sanger sequencing.",,"['Kumar, Dushyant', 'Mehta, Anurag', 'Panigrahi, Manoj Kumar', 'Nath, Sukanta', 'Saikia, Kandarpa Kumar']","['Kumar D', 'Mehta A', 'Panigrahi MK', 'Nath S', 'Saikia KK']","['Gauhati University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Bioengineering and Technology, Guwahati, India.', 'Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute and Research Centre, New Delhi, India.', 'Gauhati University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Bioengineering and Technology, Guwahati, India.', 'Gauhati University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Bioengineering and Technology, Guwahati, India.', 'Gauhati University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Bioengineering and Technology, Guwahati, India.']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],20171113,Turkey,Turk J Haematol,Turkish journal of haematology : official journal of Turkish Society of Haematology,9606065,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,,"['DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', '*Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",PMC5843774,,2017/11/14 06:00,2018/08/28 06:00,['2017/11/14 06:00'],"['2017/11/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/28 06:00 [medline]', '2017/11/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.4274/tjh.2017.0095 [doi]'],ppublish,Turk J Haematol. 2018 Mar 1;35(1):49-53. doi: 10.4274/tjh.2017.0095.

Homozygous del13q14, 14q32 rearrangements, and higher CLLU1 expression correlated with shorter OS. CONCLUSION: Cytogenetics/FISH analysis is still indicated for routine evaluation of CLL. Special consideration is needed for the poor prognostic implications of del11q22, del17p, 14q32 rearrangements, and homozygous del13q14. The impact of CLLU1 expression is not yet clear and it requires more data before becoming routine in genetic testing in CLL patients.",,"['Abur, Ummet', 'Ogur, Gonul', 'Akar, Omer Salih', 'Altundag, Engin', 'Aymelek, Huri Sema', 'Ozatli, Duzgun', 'Turgut, Mehmet']","['Abur U', 'Ogur G', 'Akar OS', 'Altundag E', 'Aymelek HS', 'Ozatli D', 'Turgut M']","['Ondokuz Mayis University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Medical Genetics, Samsun, Turkey.', 'Ondokuz Mayis University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Medical Genetics, Samsun, Turkey.', 'Ondokuz Mayis University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Medical Genetics, Samsun, Turkey.', 'Ondokuz Mayis University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Medical Genetics, Samsun, Turkey.', 'Ondokuz Mayis University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Medical Genetics, Samsun, Turkey.', 'Ondokuz Mayis University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Hematology, Samsun, Turkey.', 'Ondokuz Mayis University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Hematology, Samsun, Turkey.']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],20171113,Turkey,Turk J Haematol,Turkish journal of haematology : official journal of Turkish Society of Haematology,9606065,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CLLU1 lncRNA, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', '*Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*genetics/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Long Noncoding']",PMC5843776,,2017/11/14 06:00,2018/08/28 06:00,['2017/11/14 06:00'],"['2017/11/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/28 06:00 [medline]', '2017/11/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.4274/tjh.2017.0112 [doi]'],ppublish,Turk J Haematol. 2018 Mar 1;35(1):61-65. doi: 10.4274/tjh.2017.0112.

Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is an aggressive myeloproliferative neoplasm occurring in young children. The common denominator of these malignant myeloid disorders is the limited benefit of conventional chemotherapy and a particular responsiveness to epigenetic therapy with the DNA-hypomethylating agents 5-azacytidine (azacitidine) or decitabine. However, hypomethylating therapy does not eradicate the malignant clone in MDS or JMML and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains the only curative treatment option. An emerging concept with intriguing potential is the combination of hypomethylating therapy and HSCT. Possible advantages include disease control with good tolerability during donor search and HSCT preparation, improved antitumoral alloimmunity, and reduced risk of relapse even with non-myeloablative regimens.

Autopsy samples revealed histopathological evidence of fungal hyphae and an unusual Aspergillus nidulans-like species was isolated in pure culture.

This study aimed to investigate the antitumor activity of icariin in APL cells. METHODS: APL cell lines (HL-60 and NB4) were used to investigate the effect of icariin in vitro. Cell viability was determined by WST-8 proliferation assay, while cell apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry. The mRNA and protein expression was determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot, respectively. Moreover, small interfering RNA (siRNA) and overexpressing plasmid were used to manipulate the expression of PIM family kinase 1 (PIM1) to examine the role of PIM1 in icariin-induced apoptosis in APL cells. RESULTS: Icariin could significantly suppress cell growth and induce apoptosis in both model APL cell lines (HL-60 and NB4). It repressed the expression of PIM1 at the molecular level, which was responsible for the antitumor effect of icariin in APL cells. The ectopic overexpression of PIM1 significantly abrogated the inducing effect of icariin on apoptosis. In contrast, the knockdown of PIM1 by siRNA enhanced the antitumor effect of icariin in APL cells. Moreover, the findings indicated that icariin repressed the expression of PIM1 through generating reactive oxygen species and hence modulating the Janus kinase 2(JAK2)/Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3/5 (STAT3/5) signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Icariin potently inhibits the cell growth of APL in vitro through inducing caspase-dependent apoptosis. Hence, it can be considered as a promising candidate therapeutic agent for treating APL, although further studies including clinical trials are warranted.","['Copyright (c) 2017 Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences.', 'Published by Elsevier Urban & Partner Sp. z o.o.

We have previously described combining CD34-selected haploidentical grafts with umbilical cord blood (haplo-cord) to accelerate neutrophil and platelet engraftment. Here, we examine the outcome of patients with lymphoid malignancies undergoing haplo-cord transplantation at the University of Chicago and Weill Cornell Medical College. We analyzed 42 lymphoma and chronic lymphoblastic leukemia (CLL) patients who underwent haplo-cord allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Patients underwent transplant for Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 9, 21%), CLL (n = 5, 12%) and non-Hodgkin lymphomas (n = 28, 67%), including 13 T cell lymphomas. Twenty-four patients (52%) had 3 or more lines of therapies. Six (14%) and 1 (2%) patients had prior autologous and allogeneic stem cell transplant, respectively. At the time of transplant 12 patients (29%) were in complete remission, 18 had chemotherapy-sensitive disease, and 12 patients had chemotherapy-resistant disease. Seven (17%), 11 (26%), and 24 (57%) patients had low, intermediate, and high disease risk index before transplant. Comorbidity index was evenly distributed among 3 groups, with 13 (31%), 14 (33%), and 15 (36%) patients scoring 0, 1 to 2, and >/=3. Median age for the cohort was 49 years (range, 23 to 71). All patients received fludarabine/melphalan/antithymocyte globulin conditioning regimen and post-transplant graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis with tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil. The median time to neutrophil engraftment was 11 days (range, 9 to 60) and to platelet engraftment 19.5 days (range, 11 to 88). Cumulative incidence of nonrelapse mortality was 11.6% at 100 days and 19 % at one year. Cumulative incidence of relapse was 9.3% at 100 days and 19% at one year. With a median follow-up of survivors of 42 months, the 3-year rates of GVHD relapse free survival, progression-free survival, and overall survival were 53%, 62%, and 65%, respectively, for these patients. Only 8% of the survivors had chronic GVHD. In conclusion, haplo-cord transplantation offers a transplant alternative for patients with recurrent or refractory lymphoid malignancies who lack matching donors. Both neutrophil and platelet count recovery is rapid, nonrelapse mortality is limited, excellent disease control can be achieved, and the incidence of chronic GVHD is limited. Thus, haplo-cord achieves high rates of engraftment and encouraging results.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

This enables measurement of up to 50 simultaneous parameters with no autofluorescent background and little or no spillover or required compensation. Mass cytometry has tremendous potential for the analysis of highly complex clinical samples for the diagnosis and monitoring of malignant and autoimmune disorders. The technology also presents several unique challenges for clinical use and will require new approaches to analyze the large amounts of data generated.,['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.
